[operator instructions] the first question will come from the line of kannan venkarteshwar, barclays.
dave -- barclays -- analyst
hey guys, this is dave [phonetic] on behalf of kannan. i just have a couple of questions, the first one is, it seems that you're filing today mentioned some material adverse change language around some liquidity issues. and i just wanted to understand, if you can elaborate around how are you thinking about meeting your obligations going forward?
and the second follow-up is around the q2 impact around top line, how should we think about this? and going forward even if the shelter-in-place restrictions is down there will be some social distancing for the foreseeable future. so how should we think about this recovery period for the rest of 2020 looking like. thanks.
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer
i'll tell you what i'll trying to do...
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
you want to go first and then i'll pick up on revenue.
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer
perfect. that's exactly what i was going to say, william. thank you. so when i think about the language you're referring to, i'd kind of like to first focus on we do make a statement about how we feel about liquidity for the next 12 months and we are comfortable that we have sufficient liquidity. i think the cautionary language you see, while new in this filing won't be uncommon for companies that are impacted by covid-19, and so it is additional language, it's cautionary language, i don't think it will be uncommon. but i don't want to -- i don't want it to replace the importance of the statement that we've made in our filings and also on this call, that we think we've done the things we need to do to meet our obligations for the next 12 months and we'll continue to try to improve upon that. we understand the value of liquidity and we'll do everything we can to make sure that we have it.
so i wouldn't focus on additional language, there's nothing meant in terms of signaling by the inclusion of it's cautionary language, and i would take it in balance with the other statements we've made. william, i'll let you talk a little bit about the second part of the question.
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
yes, thanks. and thanks dave for the question. i mean, i think as we look into q2 and as we start to see some of the lockdowns being lifted, there clearly is a sense that our audiences are returning to the street. and therefore, our signs and our boards are getting visibility from our customers. but i think what is impossible to say at the moment is whether our audiences while they are returning, whether they are going to be there in the same strength as they were immediately before locked down. and i think we see very different situations in different parts of the world and frankly in different parts of the us.
so i think brian, who lived in texas will probably say things are returning to normal pretty quickly. i think if you lived in new york city you wouldn't be saying that. similarly, zurich is returning to a kind of normality, london definitely isn't. so there's a very varied picture across the world. and while our audiences, our billboards and our science are certainly returning, i think is going to take some time before you would say it had returned to normal, that's one side of it.
the other side of it is weather advertisers are going to be returning to advertising spend as quickly as perhaps we would wish, because there is no doubt the damage to the global economy caused by the lockdown has been pretty significant. and again, of course, it varies market by market. but i think what i said earlier in the prepared remarks, i would just repeat, that we are monitoring this on a daily basis, we are keeping a very, very close eye on our pipeline and we are adjusting our cost base accordingly.
dave -- barclays -- analyst
got it. thank you.
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
thanks.

our next question will come from the line of avi steiner with jp morgan.
avi steiner -- jp morgan -- analyst
thank you. good morning. i've got a couple here. and i apologize, i've been in here, because the super busy earnings this morning, and i hope you're all staying healthy and well. with that can you remind us of the transit versus non-split in your two major reporting segments now? and do you think trends and particularly airports will perform materially worse than the traditional billboard business? thanks, and i've got a few more.
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
thanks, avi. and thanks for the questions. brian, do you have -- do we have the split of transit and non-transit by division. do we provide any color on that?
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer
there is some disclosure in the 10-k, we don't updated in the 10-q so you can look and see in terms of the overall business, what the split is. i think what might be helpful is, if scott talks a little bit about airports and which is the most significant, kind of, non-billboard activity in the us and you can speak a little bit to the transit as a proportion of the business in general terms. but for specifics avi, i'd refer you back to the 10-k.
scott wells -- chief executive officer
yes. it's scott here. thanks brian. airports is less than 20% of the us we've disclosed that in prior roadshow documents and things like that. as far as its performance it has actually held up pretty, pretty resiliently, i mean, you're comparing it to a very difficult situation across all, but i would not think of airports as catastrophic relative to the challenges that we're facing in other inventory. i think the thing you're going to see in that business is that it will be probably the last part of our business that snaps back aggressively, because of the hit on audiences, but because that is very premium inventory with a premium audience that is still moving through the airports, albeit with smaller levels than historically. it has held up reasonably well.
avi steiner -- jp morgan -- analyst
thank you. that's great. and then on the $100 million of cost cuts and again if you mentioned some of this detail, i apologize. but can you flush out the sources of where that's coming from? and maybe relatedly, discuss progress with leaseholders, landlords etc, on for merits. thank you.
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer
well, i can speak to the main categories. and then i'll turn it over to scott and william for the color. the site lease expenses is our largest cost category over 50% of our operating expense, the majority of which is fixed. and so in order to be impactful, you have to focus on your leases, the company has done that and we started very early in europe, because we were hit there first. and so i'll let william and scott talk about progress.
the next largest operating expenses is human capital compensation expense and we've talked a little bit about that. so both those are significant portions of $100 million. in addition to that we should also talk about discretionary expenses. and in this time period, we can be very focused on certain categories, and we are. so those are the three main buckets. they would comprise most of $100 million and i think with respect to site lease, the most important one, we can provide a little extra color. i think we provide a lot of color on capex, so not on the expense side, but to the extent that is discretionary capex or something that can be deferred very focused on it. there are certain investments we will continue to make, because they do make sense. but as you can see from the dramatic decline in capital expenditures we're taking it very serious.
william and scott, did you have additional comments you want to make maybe on the the site lease and the the compensation expense?
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
sure. scott, you want to go first for americas and then i'll make some european comment as well.
scott wells -- chief executive officer
yes, absolutely. thanks, william. so we have thousands of landlords and the process of engaging is one that you need to do kind of landlord by landlord, we can send both letters out to initiate the process, but these are all bespoke individual negotiations. i would tell you that we are seeing good partnership with our municipal lease portfolio, pretty much across the board, because this is a government inflicted challenge to a degree, obviously not the virus, but the shutdowns. the governments are taking accountability for having done that and are working with us.
the private landlords process, they obviously are not accountable in the same way, and are facing this challenge across their portfolios and we are working with them. we are seeing success, but it is slower. and because of the distributed nature of it, that's one of the reasons why we did salary reductions and furloughs and things along those lines that we're able to see savings immediately on because the site leases are much bigger part of our expenses. but there is a lead time to getting it, but we're seeing success really across the board, and i think we're going to be taking substantial cost out in that area. william?
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
yes, let me just add a couple of things, avi, on this. i mean, i think on the site lease point, and much of what scott has said, absolutely applies in the rest of our world as well. and the truth is that, i think our landlords would be surprised if we were not negotiating at this stage or renegotiating at this stage. and that is absolutely the expectation and the conversations that we're having. as scott said across thousands of landlords across our world, those conversations are being productive and collaborative as we work across this process.
the other thing i wanted to say was the, the speed with which leaders across our businesses pivoted to this process of renegotiation was truly remarkable and impressive, and i think that the impact that we've been able to deliver in the second quarter of the target that we talked about of $100 million savings in the quarter on opex. i think that's a very impressive response to this crisis.
avi steiner -- jp morgan -- analyst
appreciate those comments. thank you, i'll let it here. appreciate the time. brian, you touched on the menu of digital liquidity options, i think you said secured maybe unsecured. i want to make sure i heard that correctly. and then with latam and the -- i guess, other segment now, and i've been around when it's been everywhere at this company. should we think about that as potentially up for sale and another liquidity lever. and with that, i'll turn it over. thank you all for the time.
scott wells -- chief executive officer
yes. well, i mean, the move to latin america to the other segment was driven really by how our chief operating decision maker, williams manages the business and in consultation with our auditors. i think we've kind of realigned everything. so it's not specifically tied to any view on our feelings toward asset monetization. that being said, i know, william have spoken on prior calls about focusing on the higher margin businesses, and i don't think it's any secret. our us portfolio of businesses are the higher margin businesses, our core billboard businesses, our core billboard businesses, our digital billboards very high margin.
and we have expressed an openness with respect to, kind of, a non-higher margin businesses. we've entered into an agreement to sell our interest in china, a lot of people have taken that comment really to mean european assets. but i would put latin america in that bucket, as well. again, there's not a for sale sign up for latin america that we operate in four countries, they are successful businesses. but i would not call them core to our operations and i would not put them in the higher margin, kind of, category. so while i wouldn't say this movement into other is an indication that we have changed our view with respect to those assets. i do think that we've made other statements that do indicate how we're thinking about the high margin versus the non-high margin businesses. if that is helpful to you.
avi steiner -- jp morgan -- analyst
well, we're doing, as always, thank you, all, stay healthy. i appreciate the time.
scott wells -- chief executive officer
thanks, avi.
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
thanks, avi.
avi steiner -- jp morgan -- analyst
thanks a lot.
operator
the next question will come from the line of steven cahall with wells fargo.
steven cahall -- wells fargo -- analyst
thank you. and sorry if i missed some of these answers. but maybe just first on m&a, you got a deal done in china. and i think we were all kind of surprised and impressed by the ability to do that in these volatile times. and maybe in retrospect, it seems like china was starting to trend toward reopening and that probably provided your buyer with some of the clarity that they needed. so if we start to think about europe, along those lines, can you give us a sense of maybe where you think you are in the reopening process in some of your major markets? and maybe help us just think about what the m&a environment might look like in those markets and weather potential buyers feel like they have any line of sight yet, maybe as it compares to the pace of where things have gone in china. and i have a follow-up. thanks.
scott wells -- chief executive officer
okay, thank you and thanks for the the question and thanks for the comments on the china sale, which i think was a positive outcome for everybody. in terms of the reopening of europe, i would say it is truly literally very early days. i mean, as i mentioned, there's been some opening up in switzerland, there's been some relaxing of the rules in italy, some relaxing in spain, in the uk we're expecting an announcement from our prime minister on sunday; and france has announced a kind of program of stages of relaxation of the rules.
but there is no sense that a switch is being flipped and markets are suddenly returning to normal at the moment. so i think it would be really too early to say that there are any signs of recovery yet within the european market. i don't understand downbeat about it. i'm very optimistic about the strength of our medium and the momentum that we have in the business. and i do believe that once audiences start returning to the streets, we will be in a very good position, particularly with the increased volume of digital inventory that we have. i think we'll be in a very good position to bring revenues back.
but in terms of m&a, i would absolutely stand by the statement that we made in february that we will actively evaluate all opportunities to enable us to support the growth in the higher-margin businesses, particularly in the us. but there is no indication at the moment that the markets in europe are returning to normal and clearly that makes m&a more challenging.
steven cahall -- wells fargo -- analyst
great. and then just a follow-up on the cost initiatives that you outlined, maybe what sort of pace can we expect that $100 million of run rate to start to kick in, like could we see that being realized by the end of the second quarter? does it take a little longer to roll all of that through, and when i'm kind of getting out with all of this where i think a lot of investors are wondering if you have a lot of cash on the balance sheet after what you'll get from clear channel, clear media limited and you've taken these cost initiatives that should give you some runway to go through a tough environment and burn a little cash in the short-term.
when you kind of do your conservative modeling, i guess, just how worried are you about that runway? or do you really feel like you have ample liquidity unless this downturn is very, very prolonged. thanks.
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer
so a couple of pieces to that question and it's a good question, it's actually kind of the question. so from a liquidity standpoint, i do think we feel like we're in a reasonable position as i think, i've answered on an earlier question we actually make the statement that we are comfortable with our liquidity position for the next 12 months. that being said, there is just such a lack of visibility and the operating profile of the company and this could be more prolonged than we expected you could get the virus behind you. but then are you -- how badly were your customers impacted and how quickly do they come back.
so i don't think you can have too much liquidity in this environment. that's why we did implement and focus very intently on the cost savings initiatives, that $100 million number is what we expect to attain in q2, and i think as we move forward and get more visibility into both the severity and the length of, kind of, the impact of the pandemic, we'll have to continue to adjust that cost base to match the operating performance.
so i think we've done what we feel like we need to do today, but the book isn't close. we need to continue to remain focused, make sure that we aligned our cost base with the business and continue to look for additional opportunities. again, i think we feel good about the liquidity today, but the book is not closed. we're going to continue to look at opportunities to increase liquidity, and make sure that the expense base of the business is rightsized for the operations. scott, william, i don't know if you have anything else to add, but that's how i would respond.
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
i think it's a very good answer.
steven cahall -- wells fargo -- analyst
and maybe just the last one then on that brian, i assume then there are additional levers you could pull on capex, if you reassess the environment, you know at a later time?
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer
i think there's additional levers in opex and capex, should the environment continue to persist, instead of furlowing employees, you may a more permanent decision in certain cases. instead of differing lease benefits you may have to completely realign the cost or defer them further out on the capex side, you may just stop doing anything other than what you actually have to do for the safety of your employees. so i think we've taken the cost, we feel are appropriate at this point in time. but yes, we can always, if we need to adjust we could. we also want to remain flexible, so that if things do start to come back, we haven't made cost they impair our ability to recover. so a lot of it really is decided by our visibility and every day that goes by, every week that goes by, we learn more and we want to remain flexible to adjust to what we're seeing.
steven cahall -- wells fargo -- analyst
great, thank you.
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer
thanks, steve.
operator
our next question will come from the line of lance vitanza with cowen.
lance vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. most of them have actually been answered. but perhaps just back on the efforts to negotiate with your landlords and you mentioned that you've got thousands of them. the $100 million of cost savings for the second quarter to what extent does that depend on additional lease negotiations that you haven't yet gotten done? or is that $100 million, sort of represent changes that as we sit here today in early may have already been put into place. and then i have a follow-up.
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
so let me go first on that. i mean, i would say we are very confident of achieving the target that we set out today, if we weren't confident in setting that $100 million target in terms of the savings for the quarter. we wouldn't have put it out there. we are still in very active negotiations with those thousands of landlord that we talked about, but we believe that, that savings is achievable.
lance vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
okay, thanks. and then just, sort of, a follow-up on that, where you have already been successful, how do you define success? i mean are these reduction sort of proportionate with the revenue reductions are they true discounts? or are you deferring the lease expense into subsequent periods, any we color on that would also be helpful. thank you.
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
yes. i mean, i think there's a range of answers to that question and none of them are entirely precise. we are negotiating hard on the fixed side -- the fixed lease cost expenses, we are seeking to convert those minimal -- minimum annual guarantees that we talked about earlier, converting those from fixed to variables, they reflect the changed revenue environment that we are operating. and of course, there are very significant differences in terms of the kinds of negotiations that we have with our municipalities versus with private landlords.
so i think success comes in different ways and each one -- each contract brings a different set of challenges and opportunities as we go into those renegotiations. so there isn't kind of one-size answers to that question, i don't think. scott, do you want to add anything from there? [indecipherable] perspective on that?
scott wells -- chief executive officer
i'd agree with you, william. i think it is absolutely a mixture of all those, and where there is a contract that has a substantial fixed portion and then a variable portion, we are trying to turn it to variable, but that is not the majority of the us revenue at least, i'm not sure how that would stack up around the world. but we do that when we can, where we variabilize where we can, but that's a minority of our arrangements.
lance vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
yes, thanks guys.
scott wells -- chief executive officer
thank you, lance.
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question will come from the line of stephan bisson with wolfe research.
stephan bisson -- wolfe research -- analyst
good morning, thanks for all the color, guys. i know, it's really hard to, kind of, look into the current environment and kind of see things as they develop. new york times today said that they're expecting revenue declines on the advertising side of 50%, i think broadcast tv is anywhere between 30% and 40% from this morning's releases. can you give us any quantification at all as to where -- in that range you might expect to end up for the second quarter?
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer
i honestly feel that every day i read a different forecast from a different journalists or from a different consultancy firm, and every day they're different. and the honest truth is nobody knows, they really don't, i don't see how they can know, given that we don't even yet know what the timing of the end of the lockdowns in different states or different countries are going to be. and we don't yet have any real sense of what the damage to the economies are going to be. and we don't yet know how advertisers is going to respond to this, there will be some advertisers, who will learn from previous downturns that it's the way this thing is to continue to support their brands and continue to advertise. there will be others who retrench and cut those budget. but the truth is nobody knows at the moment. that's why we are -- as i said, being vigilant and keeping a daily eye on our pipeline, as i said to an earlier question, you know, in some cases there are signs of a positive pipeline building as things return to normal, but it's way too early to call a number for q2, i'm afraid.
stephan bisson -- wolfe research -- analyst
understood. thanks so much [indecipherable].
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer
i wish that could be more helpful.
stephan bisson -- wolfe research -- analyst
it's unprecedented environment. thanks so much for all the color, you guys gave.
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer
that's the word. thanks, stephan.
operator
the next question will come from the line of jim goss with barrington research.
jim goss -- barrington research -- analyst
thanks. i've got a couple also. you have given a lot of color, especially in terms of the european markets and which ones are coming back sooner rather than later. have you -- is there anything you can say about the key domestic markets in terms of the importance to you relative to how that mix in this uneven opening might match up with your business?
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
scott, do you want to take that.
scott wells -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, william, i'll take that -- i'll take a run at that. we are a large dma business, we are experiencing this william said this in the upfront comments as a pretty diverse experience, it's challenged across the country, but we have a very strong business in florida, a very strong business in texas, very strong business in the southwest. all of those regions have been impacted less than the coasts and the midwest is sort of in between. and so as we look to things building back the two variables william described earlier are exactly the critical ones. variable one is the build back of audience, which in those markets, the car culture in the united states is such that it's not like our audiences went to zero during this -- not even close. and that's something that we've actually been able to keep a pretty good eye on with our radar tool and we've been able to engage customers on how that has played out and how it's starting to build back and we've had a couple of weeks of audiences building back across the country, but particularly in those stronger areas that i've talked about.
the second part of it, as william said is how much fundamental damage has been done to our customer base, and i don't think we're going to know the answer to that for some time now, as we work through this. but we are a very local intensive advertising medium and we're working very closely to support our advertising partners. but it's really hard to know how the snapback is going to happen, but the downturn was not uniform across the country, that's for sure. does that answer your question?
jim goss -- barrington research -- analyst
yes, that gets to some of that. and maybe a couple of other things. m&a, you've talked about potential sales or maybe even some tuck-ins. i would imagine there're some challenge smaller players, who might be receptive to potential sale. is that something you're pretty actively exploring right now to round out certain markets?
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
well, i think right now, our focus is on liquidity and then in the current environment it may be challenging to make that type of investment. that being said, if the right opportunity came along, i think we certainly want to take a look at it. but again, it's got to fit within what we're seeing and experiencing and right now we're just challenged with a lack of visibility. so i would never say never, but i think right now we're focused on building liquidity. and so i think, like many others, we'd have to look very hard at and what kind of benefit any type of tuck-in or m&a opportunity really brings to the table.
jim goss -- barrington research -- analyst
okay and one final one, sort of, a blue sky one. we've seen broadcasts where, there are zoom meetings, zoom broadcast from homes and that sort of thing. are there any other use cases for home displays that you've started to think about within the crisis?
scott wells -- chief executive officer
well, i think, what we've learned in the last few weeks is that the value of our inventory it has been very significant in terms of being able to deliver messages around safety, around the spread of the virus in different markets and ensuring that we keep up our public informed. so i think we have learned to be very flexible and we've learned the value of our inventory in terms of getting messages across. i don't think there's anything more that i can say though in terms of how we see the future at the moment.
jim goss -- barrington research -- analyst
okay, well thank you very much.
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
thank you, and thank you everybody for joining this call -- this morning. we appreciate your interest and your support during this extraordinary period in our global history. so thanks to everybody for joining and stay safe. thanks.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. and welcome to the 2020 first quarter earnings conference call for clear channel outdoor holdings inc. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your host, eileen mclaughlin, vice president, investor relations. thank you. please go ahead.
eileen mclaughlin -- vice president of investor relations
good morning, and thank you for joining clear channel outdoor holdings inc 2020 first quarter earnings call.

with that please turn to page three in the presentation, and i will now turn the call over to william eccleshare.
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
thank you, eileen, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join today's call. i'd like to start by saying that i hope you and your families are well and safe and that you are managing to adapt to the extraordinary world in which we now find ourselves. as i assume many of you are doing, brian, scott and i are conducting this call remotely today, so please bear with us in case there are any technical issues during the call.
it's been just over a year since we began executing our vision as an independent company and i can truly say that it has been an incredibly transformative journey for clear channel outdoor. the strength of our global platform, combined with our focus on the four key pillars of our strategy: growing the out-of-home medium, technology leadership, customer focus, opportunistic expansion has continued to deliver the flexibility and creativity that our customers want.
our investment in technology leadership, both in our digital network and our radar platform continue to drive growth particularly in our us business. however, as we all know the spread of covid-19 in the last few months has affected the general economic climate with an impact upon businesses in every sector including ours. the impact in q1 was largely on our european businesses and, of course, in china. due to the continued global spread of the virus including throughout the united states we anticipate significant impact on our results throughout our business during the second quarter and for the rest of the year as more customers deferred buying decisions and reduced marketing spend.
we should acknowledge though that as the situation continues to evolve the full magnitude and duration of the downturn and its impact on our results is difficult to predict. we monitor the situation on a daily basis and flex our plans according to the latest market intelligence. we have therefore taken a number of action to enhance liquidity, preserve our financial flexibility and support the continuity of our platform and operations; including implementing extensive cost saving initiatives. brian will discuss the details of our plan in greater detail shortly, but be assured the actions we are taking are extensive.
we are targeting over $100 million reduction in operating costs in q2 and at least $25 million reduction in capital expenditures in the second quarter. our focus is on positioning clear channel to manage through the economic downturn, leveraging the work we have done to transform our business over the last year, as well as our ongoing initiatives to reduce costs and improve liquidity.
before going into more detail on the current environment and our response, i do want to provide some positive highlights from the first quarter. as we indicated in an earlier press release the americas segment, which accounted for approximately 70% of segment adjusted ebitda in fiscal year 2019 has delivered another strong quarter with revenue, up 8.5% and adjusted ebitda, up an exceptional 18.5% in the first quarter of 2020. this is on top of the 6.6% top line growth in the first quarter of 2019, so truly delivering on our aspiration of growth on growth.
our investments in digital continue to drive growth accounting for approximately one-third of the americas total revenue and increasing 20% in the quarter. additionally, as i have said a key part of our strategy is to explore opportunistic transactions that helped strengthen our balance sheet by improving our financial flexibility and enabling us to invest in the continued transformation of our business.
in march, i was pleased to announce that following a strategic review of our investment in china we reached an agreement to sell our 51% stake in the clear media business to a consortium called ever harmonic. the successful agreement to sell clear media demonstrates the fundamental strength of the out-of-home medium, even during difficult market conditions and at this most challenging period in china's recent history. we have formally accepted ever harmonic's offer and we expect to receive the proceeds of approximately usd253 million later this month. we plan to use the net proceeds of approximately usd220 million to improve our liquidity position and increased financial flexibility. the success that we achieved prior to the covid-19 crisis could not have been accomplished without the hard work and dedication from our teams around the globe. with that said, we are now in an entirely unprecedented environment for our business.
as a global organization, our employees, customers and suppliers have been impacted by covid-19 in every country in which we operate. our top priority is the health and safety of our employees in the face of evolving challenges. we have made an unequivocal commitment to make the well-being of our people, their families and their colleagues, our first priority at this extraordinary time. and as we do so our team continues to show remarkable flexibility and professionalism in adapting to the current environment. from our initial transition of employees to work from home in italy in early march, to a firmwide global deployment by the end of march, our teams were able to make the shift seamlessly. and we are proud that our inventory has been able to facilitate messages of support to front line medical team, to first responders, to delivery professionals and foodservice workers every day in all parts of our world, as well as being used by local and state and national government to remind citizens to stay at home and how to stay safe.
looking ahead, our strategy remains focused on growing out-of-home share of total media spend by leading the technology-driven transformation of the medium and to grow our share of total out-of-home spending by leveraging our distinctive asset base. with that said, however, we have seen a significant decline in our customers' near-term demand given the current circumstances. the impact of covid-19 with shelter-in-place protocols implemented around the world is significantly affecting the behavior and movement of consumers and target audiences.
the scale and speed with which near-term demand has declined and request to either defer or cancel current contracts is unprecedented. our sales teams are working around the clock to protect revenue and doing what they can to alleviate the short-term impact. however, there can be no question that we are going to have a challenging revenue performance in the second quarter.
focusing first on the us, we started to see the downturn at the end of march. fortunately, the quarter started off very strongly and this mitigated the impact of the slowdown in the full quarter. as the shelter-in-place rules expanded across the united states, our team quickly build a playbook to create a process for having customer conversations in a more consistent manner, while focusing on landing on a solution that fits their unique situation. our focus on the customer and our ability to understand the real need behind our request remains critical to our success.
we're only one month into the second quarter and given the uncertainty in the marketplace, it is difficult to extrapolate the declines in april into the full quarter and the balance of the year at this time. at this point may and june also look challenging, but it's still too early to comment on the positive impact we may see as the market start to reopen. i can't stress enough how diverse the impact has been around the us, which makes generalizing very difficult.
from a customer group perspective, national declined more than local in april and we're seeing substantial declines across all product lines, so far in the quarter. our strong foundation of iconic and permed inventory alleviate some of the downward pressure, but q2 will certainly be a challenged quarter and we are pulling all available levers to bring cost in line with declining revenue.
now moving to the international business, we are seeing an even more dramatic decline in customer demand in our european markets as a result of covid-19. this is partly due to the earlier and more severe lockdowns imposed by european government, and also due to the nature of our city-based format. we've already taken and will continue to take appropriate steps to ensure the continuity of our platform and operations to serve our customers, as the european countries gradually reopen their businesses and lift shelter-in-place mandates. we started seeing the downward impact across some european markets in early march, in line with what -- when government advice on lockdowns hit markets such as italy, france and spain. and that downward impact continued across all european market through april.
in france, our largest market in europe, the lockdown was announced mid-march, resulting in a sharp downturn in advertising spend at the end of the first quarter, offsetting the revenue from the paris street furniture contract. the lockdown has been extended to may 11th at which time france plans to progressively lift restrictions on travel and business. in april, we experienced a substantial decline in revenue in france.
in the uk, our second largest market in europe, the team was able to deliver another quarter of top line growth in the first quarter, driven in large part by our continuing investments in digital. however, with the country in full lockdown since the last week of march, the second quarter will be challenging. in april the uk was down significantly, we expect to see some partial lifting of the lockdown by the end of may. it is still early in the quarter and we still don't know when and how the market will rebound from the impact of covid-19.
throughout our americas and international businesses, as well as at the corporate level, we are taking a highly disciplined approach in managing our use of cash through this period, while preparing for the other side of this crisis. at the same time, we are also taking the appropriate steps to help position us to effectively support advertising partners that would want to quickly take advantage of renewed opportunities for connection with our customers after lengthy shelter-in-place orders begin to relax. our sales teams are in active discussions with our customers to develop advertising plans as restrictions are lifted.
importantly, we believe the technology investments we have made, specifically in expanding our digital footprint globally and building out our radar platform in the us, position our businesses to meet our customers' needs as we all move through this unprecedented economic downturn. we are pleased that our customers continue to use radar as a vital tool allowing brands to effectively plan and measure their out-of-home campaign against specific audience segments. and in particularly, for certain businesses, such as grocery stores or pharmacies, experienced not only sustained activity, but an increase in overall visitations. in particular we are leveraging our mobility data to gain greater insight into traffic pattern when consumers start returning to public life.
and we believe the depth of our digital inventory provides the flexibility to quickly ramp up advertising campaigns and most effectively target the right audiences at the right time. it is of course, still early and we expect challenges as we work to better align certain aspects of our business to best serve our customers in this new environment.
above all, our team remains committed to executing our vision to deliver a leading platform in the industry and i remain confident in the fundamental strength of out-of-home, our distinctive portfolio of digital and printed displays and clear channel's ability to drive long-term value creation when the economies rebound.
now, i'd like to turn it over to brian to discuss our first quarter 2020 financial results.
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer
thank you, william. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call this morning. as william mentioned, we have seen a significant impact to our business as a result of the shelter-in-place orders in our markets. however, we believe the initiatives we are taking will strengthen our financial position and support the continuity of our platform and operations as we work through the economic downturn.
before discussing the details of the steps we are taking to increase liquidity and preserve financial flexibility, i do want to review our first quarter results. as william mentioned the americas team delivered a tremendous quarter demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategy prior to covid-19 and what we believe will help us manage our business now and best position clear channel once we are beyond this crisis.
moving onto the results on slide number four. as in the past during our gaap results discussion i'll also talk about our results adjusting for foreign exchange, which is a non-gaap financial measure. we believe this improves the comparability of our results to the prior year. as i mentioned last quarter beginning in 2020 we are transitioning to a new reporting metric, replacing oibdan with adjusted ebitda, as we believe this metric is more useful to the investment community.
additionally, we have changed our segment information to reflect changes in the way business is managed and how resources are allocated by the company's chief operating decision maker. effective january 1st, 2020 there are two reportable business segments. americas, which hasn't changed and europe which consists of operations in both europe and singapore. our remaining operating segments are china and latin america, which do not need the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments and are disclosed as other. of course china will no longer be included in our results following the sale of clear media.
consolidated revenue decreased 6.2% to $551 million, adjusting for foreign exchange it was down 4.7%. the strong performance in the americas segment was offset by declines in both europe and china primarily as a result of covid-19. consolidated net loss increased from $170 million in 2019 to $289 million in 2020. adjusted ebitda excluding fx declined 47% with growth in americas offset by weakness in europe and china.
normally, i would now take some time to discuss our q1 results for our businesses in greater detail. however as william spoke to earlier the results in q1, particularly the growth we saw in the americas are not reflective of what we're seeing in q2. as such i'm going to focus the remainder of my remarks on our current financial position, as well as our efforts in q2 to mitigate the impact of the downturn. for more detail on our q1 results, i'll refer you to slides five through seven in the presentation, the earnings release we issued and our 10-q, which has been filed with the sec today.
now onto slide eight to discuss capex. capital expenditures totaled $36 million in the first quarter of 2020 was $16 million in our americas segment and $10 million in our europe segment, primarily from constructing and sustaining our billboards, street furniture and other out-of-home advertising displays, including digital. most of this was spent before we started seeing the impact of covid-19 in march. the majority of other capex relates to our investment in china, corporate capex of $4 million, primarily relates to equipment and software purchases.
now onto slide nine. clear channel outdoor's consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled 372 million as of march 31st, 2020. this balance included $69 million of cash held outside of the us. the cash held by clear media limited of $31 million is now included in assets classified as held for sale and not included in the consolidated cash and cash equivalents number. our debt was $5.2 billion, up about $150 million as a result of our drag on the cash flow revolver at the end of march.
the weighted average cost of debt was 6.4% in the first quarter of 2020, down from the prior year, due to the refinancings we completed in 2019. cash interest payments for the debt -- for debt during the quarter were $146 million, this was up as compared to the first quarter of 2019, due to the timing of payments. the company anticipates having approximately $175 million of cash interest payment obligations throughout the remainder of 2020.
the springing firstly lien net leverage ratio is 5.7 times as of march 31st, 2020 below the requirement of 7.6 times. however, we expect the ratio to increase during q2, both as a result of reduced operating performance and the loss of clear media's consolidated adjusted ebitda, following its sale. consequently, the company is actively considering options with respect to additional liquidity measures and/or covenant flexibility.
moving onto slide 10. in light of the rapidly evolving impact of covid-19, we have implemented a number of actions to improve our liquidity position and provide us with additional financial flexibility to manage through the economic downturn. as previously announced in march 24th, we made a cautionary draw of $150 million under our revolving credit facility. in addition, on march 30th, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to irrevocably sell our stake in clear media. although the sales process started well before the impact of the pandemic, we expect the net proceeds of approximately $220 million will provide us with additional liquidity to support our business during this time. on april 28th, we tendered our shares to ever harmonic global limited and expect to receive the proceeds later this month.
as william discussed we anticipate significant adverse effects on our results throughout our business during the second quarter. in response, we initiated aggressive cost cutting initiatives focused on capital expenditures, fixed site lease expenses, compensation and discretionary spending. the team worked early and quickly to identify opportunities to delay capital expenditures with discretionary growth capex largely deferred. we are renegotiating certain contracts for committed capex and are closely evaluating all sustaining capex projects for potential deferral. we believe we can reduce our planned capital expenditures for the balance of the year by more than one half from our plan.
site lease expense accounted for about 50% of our total operating expenses and the majority of these expenses are fixed. so it was important that we immediately start working with our various landlords to align fixed site lease expenses with the revenue during the economic downturn. our focus initially was on the minimum annual guaranteed payments, most often part of street furniture and transit contracts, but it expanded to include certain billboard contracts, these are complicated negotiations, but we are achieving success in both europe and the us.
in april we initiated temporary salary reductions at all levels of the organization, including 30% reductions for both william, our global ceo and scott wells, our americas ceo. we have also furloughed employees based on market conditions and have initiated a hiring freeze. we are also aggressively cutting discretionary spending. as william said earlier, our goal is to achieve operating cost savings in excess of $100 million and capital expenditure savings an excess of $25 million during the second quarter of 2020.
finally, i want to remind everyone that the foregoing initiatives are in addition to the steps we completed last summer that extended the maturity profile of our debt and reduced cash interest payments. we believe that these initiatives, as well as the net proceeds from the sale of clear media and cash on hand will provide us with the liquidity and the financial flexibility to enable us to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and other funding requirements for the next 12 months. however, we may take further cost cutting measures beyond those discussed above to increase financial flexibility and generate liquidity in the event of an unanticipated need for cash.
in addition, we regularly consider and enter into discussions with our lenders related to potential financing alternatives, which may include supplemental liquidity through issuance of secured and unsecured debt or other capital raising transactions, as well as given the current environment negotiating further financial flexibility via potential amendments to our debt agreements.
and now let me turn the call back to william for his closing remarks.
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
thank you, brian. as you can see our team have been actively responding to this crisis from an operational, financial and strategic perspective. looking ahead, i'm confident that we're taking the right steps to protect our global team, preserve our financial flexibility and ensure that we are in the best possible position for success when we emerged from the covid-19 crisis. we're moving forward with an aggressive targeted approach to executing our short-term strategic priorities. and i'm confident that the resilience of our business and the agility of our teams that represent the company's unique and fundamental strength.
we have firm plans in place to capitalize on the gradual rebound and are actively working with brands to ramp up advertising for post covid campaign. throughout all of this we continue to prioritize the health and safety of our employees. i look forward to providing updates regarding our progress.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of steven cahall with wells fargo.
steven lee cahall -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thanks, good morning. interesting to see those charts in the presentation about the foot traffic and the miles driven, and they're not too far off of covid level pre-covid levels. how are you thinking about what marketers need to see to start returning? you talked about seeing a little bit of green shoots in bookings. so just wondering how we think about sort of the lag between that data and what marketers actually do?
scott r. wells -- chief executive officer
william, why don't i take this...
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
so let me take that.
scott r. wells -- chief executive officer
oh. go ahead.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
okay. well, let me just make a general comment, which is because i think we've seen a we're at the earlier stages of recovery. we've seen the early first stages of recovery in europe ahead of the u.s. and i think what what's driven the recovery in europe is seeing advertisers kind of seeing the data and seeing with their own eyes people returning to the streets, returning to cities, returning to stores. and as that has happened, clearly, advertising has strengthened and the bookings have come back. so i think it is the thing that is driving the return is the return of audiences to the street. and the encouraging thing, certainly that we've been seeing in some of the european markets, as we mentioned, is that it does seem that there is some real pent-up demand that is coming back pretty quickly as the lockdowns are lifted. and that does give us significantly more encouragement for q3 than maybe we had a couple of months ago. scott, do you want to add from the u.s.?
scott r. wells -- chief executive officer
i mean, i think the only thing i'd add, william, is that it is very, very much by sector. and that the traffic coming back is very important to the businesses that are open and operating normally or close to normally. but you think about some of the businesses that are big partners for us, like entertainment, retail, where they might not be operating normally, that's going to have to make progress as well to see the money come back. but i'd agree with william's assessment overall of how the dynamic is working.
steven lee cahall -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. and then, brian, i think free cash flow came in nicely positive in the quarter. can you maybe speak a little bit to the cash flow dynamics? is free cash flow more resilient than ebitda during this downturn? and maybe an outlook on how you're managing capex would be helpful.
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer clear
sure, steve. thanks for the question. i think when it comes to how we look at free cash flow or ebitda, what we saw in the quarter was a pretty significant benefit, i guess, is the way you would characterize it from working capital shifts, largely in the form of accounts receivable going down, being a source of liquidity, being a source of free cash flow because of the kind of the reduced level of business we have out there. also, you'll see a large amount of rent deferrals, generating an increase in our short-term liabilities. so what i would tell you is there's no magic behind this really. this is reflective of the current environment we're in, how it impacted working capital, and largely, we would expect that again, that benefit to unwind as the business starts to recover, as receivables start to build and as these deferred payments will the ones that we're not able to get permit really from or paid out in the second half of the year. your second question, to talk about capex.
in q2, we had a pretty narrow aperture as we looked at new investments that came across the investment committee's desk. i would tell you though that there wasn't a whole lot going on. i think a lot of municipalities that would have otherwise had tenders, and in many cases, deferred those to later periods. and then the ones we did see obviously, we were they had to be extremely worthy in order to invest a whole lot of money. so we've kept a pretty tight view on it. what we did see come through in q2 was largely sustainable capex that needed to be made or committed capex from prior periods that we weren't able to defer. i think going forward, our capex philosophy is going to be similar, although we want to make sure that we adjust according to the recovery curve. and as we see things improve, the aperture may open a little bit, and there may be other opportunities. but first and foremost, and i hope it came through in the opening dialogue for william and myself, the focus is on liquidity. we feel like we're in a good spot. and so we're not going to do things that jeopardizes that position. at the same time, there's going to be necessary investment to be made in the business both to preserve the current plan and to continue growth, and so we'll continue to look at those as those opportunities come up.
steven lee cahall -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
your next question is from kannan venkateshwar with barclays.
kannan venkateshwar -- barclays bank plc -- analyst
a couple, if i could. so firstly, from a working capital perspective, obviously, you guys have raised lot of money, and the balance sheet seems to be in a comfortable place from a liquidity position. but could you give us a sense of cash burn as the recovery happens because you had a big working capital tailwind last quarter? and i'm assuming as you go through the recovery cycle and as activity picks up that reverses to some extent. so if you could just give us some context around the liquidity on the balance sheet and the cash burn, that would be great. and then i have a follow-up.
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer clear
sure. i think on the first point, i actually touched upon a little bit on steve's question. you're right. i think we would expect what we've seen on the working capital side to reverse itself over time. but again, just given the nature of what generated that working capital movement, that largely will reverse itself as the business starts to recover. so as receivables grow because we're doing more business or as improvements in the second half of the year cause our counterparties under various contracts to say, ""okay, the deferral we made because times were bad, times aren't so bad anymore, and you'll need to make these payments."" those largely will kind of go hand in hand, and consequently, the underlying cash flow performance or ebitda performance of the business will be improved. so hopefully, those will offset and that our operating gains will be greater than the working capital moves. that being said, i think on the international side, they were hit harder. and while they've shown significant improvement in q3, and we would expect sequentially that to continue into q4, it's not likely that there'll be adjusted ebitda positive through the rest of the year, and so we need to be thoughtful and careful about how we manage capex and other liquidity levers that we have. u.s. business wasn't hit as hard, a little slower on the recovery curve, but again, positively sloping in q3. we would expect that through q4. so hopefully, i've answered your question, maybe provide a little bit more color than i intended to, but i'm happy to either follow on, on that or go to your next question.
kannan venkateshwar -- barclays bank plc -- analyst
all right. that's helpful. we can follow up more in detail offline, that's ok. and then the other question was largely around the cost levers. you guys indicated that there's more cost-cutting measures that you're working through. could you give us a sense of the fixed versus variable cost mix? and i'm assuming you've done a lot of the hard work already and you've cut a lot of costs. so given the drop in activity, is it fair to assume that the opex that we see in your income statement in 2q is basically, in some ways, most a fixed cost? or is there some variable cost still there? if you could just walk us through the cost components and what levers you have going forward?
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer clear
yes. i think, first, just a general statement on costs. we have pulled a lot of levers. a lot of them were temporary in nature. and i think that while the business continues to look at ways to optimize our cost structure and may need to take more permanent actions just to kind of rightsize the business for where we are and what we're seeing, largely, what we saw were deferrals on compensation, rent deferrals, although there were certainly we were able to capture some permanent rent abatements as well. so i'm not sure it's fair to say that the current cost is the fixed cost that all the variable kind of got squeezed out. i mean we still had revenue. so we still had variable expense. and in a lot of cases, we converted fixed to variable expense on a temporary basis. and that may reconvert back to fix or maybe permanent depending on the contract underlying contract itself. so not sure that's the right way to look at it. i think that's the most color i can give you on the fixed cost base side.
kannan venkateshwar -- barclays bank plc -- analyst
all right. can i ask one more, sorry, as a follow-up?
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer clear
sure.
kannan venkateshwar -- barclays bank plc -- analyst
as you look at your business, obviously, historically, the outdoor business in city centers and densely populated areas had a different dynamic versus suburbs, now with potentially more work from home and so on, is there any permanent change that you foresee in the flow of business? and how that changes your footprint in terms of presence?
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
let me try and take a stab at that because i think it's an interesting question, kannan. but i really think it is really far too early to say whether there's going to be any permanent change. it does seem to me that we are already seeing in some markets where lockdowns have been lifted and where the pandemic has been well controlled, we're seeing a pretty rapid return to the pre-covid ways of operating and behaviors of people in cities and in workplaces. so while i do think there will be some long-term impact and probably a greater mix than there's been in the past in terms of people working remotely. but it will be a hybrid. it won't be one way or the other. and i don't really foresee any significant structural change in the way our business operates. in the on the contrary, in a sense, i think the momentum that this business had when we went into the pandemic, and that was a global momentum, and pretty much every market in the world, outdoor has been gaining share from traditional media. you saw our very strong performance in q1 in the united states. it seems to me to be every reason to believe that, that will come back and very few reasons to believe that there's really going to be a permanent change in the nature of our business.
kannan venkateshwar -- barclays bank plc -- analyst
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of avi steiner with jpmorgan.
avi steiner -- jpmorgan chase & co -- analyst
i'd heard q3 revenue decline is expected in the low 30s, which is a noted improvement from the second quarter. and if you gave this, i apologize, but how should we think about the underlying expense base? i don't want to get quarter-to-quarter perhaps, but i'm just trying to think through what you may see in the near term as we try and think through ebitda here? and then i've got a couple more questions.
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer clear
i'm sorry, avi. could you repeat that?
avi steiner -- jpmorgan chase & co -- analyst
sure. i just relative to the 30% decline in low-30s revenue decline expected for the third quarter, how should we think about associated or underlying expenses in the quarter? if you can help us there?
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer clear
yes. we continue to take a hard look at the expense line. we didn't provide any guidance in q3 because a lot of in q2, without visibility really into where or how dramatic the decline would be. we knew we had to respond aggressively on the cost side. as we think about q3 and q4, we're starting to see a recovery curve positively sloping. and we want to be sure that we can benefit that recovery. and that's why we didn't make a lot of permanent cost reductions in q2. it's positively sloping. it's still considerably negative than it was last year. we find ourselves in a strange position. we're down 30, sounds pretty good because of q2, but in the scheme of things is still something we have to respond to. so i think the right way to think about it, avi, and without providing hard numbers is while we see improvement in q3 and sequentially, i think, to the rest of the year, we're probably still ways off from returning to normality or returning to 2019 levels. and consequently, the company will have to continue to make decisions on the cost side. so nothing to announce at this point in time, but i think you should expect the company to continue to be aggressive on the cost side and that some of the future initiatives may be more permanent in nature than what you saw in q2.
avi steiner -- jpmorgan chase & co -- analyst
and then in the release, you talk about deferred, revised and canceled sales contracts. is the deferral a meaningful piece of the revenue hit? and any visibility as to at all as to when that might come in? it seems perhaps a little more positive than outright cancellations. and i'm trying to understand how that may flow through.
scott r. wells -- chief executive officer
let me take a run at that. and brian or william, you can jump in as well. we really i mean, think about a movie release that was scheduled originally for april, got moved to july, maybe got moved to november and then maybe got moved to 2021. that would be multiple deferrals. i guess what my point would be is that quantifying that is really quite difficult for you. i guess what i'd characterize is that you should think about the pressure on our revenue side in two ways: there's sales we didn't make because we were busy renegotiating contracts, particularly during the early part of the crisis, that affects downstream time because we do front load a fair bit of our sales; and then there's the actual movement within a quarter. i think that the biggest movement within a quarter in terms of cancellations and deferrals is probably behind us, touchwood. but that other factor of sales we didn't make during those times because we were busy moving things has a lag-on effect, and that's going to be one of the things that is a force against rapid revenue recovery. so sorry i can't quantify that for you, but hopefully it gives you a feel. i don't know, brian or william, if you'd add anything.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
no. i think the only thing i would add from what we've been seeing in europe is that there undoubtedly has been some pent-up demand that has been deferred from quarter two and is being is part of the strengthening that we're seeing in quarter 3. but again, i would reiterate, it's very hard to quantify how much of that is deferred and how much of it is new money coming in.
avi steiner -- jpmorgan chase & co -- analyst
fair enough. and lastly for me, so beyond operational improvements and asset sales, i'm wondering if you can talk about maybe other paths of reducing leverage? and whether that be winning new business, which maybe has been obscured a little bit just in the midst of the pandemic? and then potentially, if it were to avail itself discounts, being able to take a substantial discounts on debt levels if available?
and maybe relatedly, just back to the potential of winning new business. does your liquidity position make you, i guess, more likely to be active on the new business opportunity front in terms of bidding for contracts? or are you going to maintain your normal discipline?
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer clear
sure, avi. and i'll respond initially, then scott and william, feel free to chime in. i think, first and then hopefully came out through the comments that we've made up to now, our focus has been on liquidity. there was a real pivot from where we were at the end of the summer after recapitalizing the company and felt like we had line of sight to a path to deleveraging covid. much like it impacted a lot of companies has derailed us a little bit on that journey. but as we pull the levers we needed to do, as we built up liquidity and as we see recovery in the business, we do need to look further out, and part of that is going back to our core position of wanting to generate additional free cash flow and delever. it starts with fundamentals, and that's focusing on the business. and an important part of that will be being disciplined but choosing the right investments to grow the business. and we've done a lot of work, whether that be contract wins or digital conversions or investment in technology that we think will improve the value of the business and our ability to deliver benefits to our customers. that's first and foremost. you've mentioned asset dispositions, i think we've been clear and communicated that we're open. much like whether you're a buyer looking to acquire businesses or a seller looking to sell businesses, this is a challenging time. there's significant valuation gap. and so that's probably something we'll wait and see. but as the recovery improves, and we get back to historic levels, i suspect that's something that will heat up a little bit. not seeing a lot of discounts on debt. certainly, if that opportunity existed, that may be a good use of excess liquidity. i'm not sure after just having built the balance that we have that we would be in a position to call any of it excess. but at the same time, as we start to realize what we believe is the recovery curve in front of us, we may change our minds about that and utilize excess cash in one way or the other. so i think in a lot of ways, still the options that we had in front of us pre-pandemic, it's just that you want to be very careful and thoughtful and make sure you're on the other side of this thing before you do anything that jeopardizes the comfort of the position that you currently find yourself in. i don't know william or scott, if you have anything to add, but that's kind of my...
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
yes. i'd just add one thing for the avoidance of any doubt, that maintaining our discipline or even increasing the discipline that we apply, both in looking at new contracts, new business, any new opportunities, but also the discipline around any disposals and ensuring that we get the right value, that will absolutely be a part of how we move this business forward. so i think the rigorous discipline that we have applied in the past will be, if anything, actually go up as we move forward.

your next question comes from the line of lance vitanza with cowen.
lance william vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
i'm sorry if i missed this on the call, but with respect to the segment operating results, i was a little surprised to see corporate expenses up year-over-year. i was wondering if there's any color there? and what we should expect directionally as we think about the back half of the year? and then i have another question as well.
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer clear
yes. we are now just finalizing kind of the stages of exit from the transition services agreement that we had with iheart. and so what you may be seeing is some the final spend and getting the infrastructure, largely technology-related, kind of up and running. but i do think that at the end of august, we will that's our anticipated exit date from the tsa, you'll see a more normalized corporate expense profile. i would say that'd be in the $110 million to $115 million range on a go-forward basis once we kind of flush through these last, final stages of the exit. that's significantly lower than what was a run rate corporate expense in 2018. of course, that included the copyright fee. so we feel pretty good about where we landed. some incremental costs above what would have been the corporate expense run rate less the rights agreement the trademark license agreement payments that we had. and that largely just reflects certain costs that related to the standup as a separate business. certain technology, certain executive fees that you have that you didn't have before. but that amount offset by certain efficiencies that you've had. but i think the $110 million to $115 million per annum is probably a good run rate. and as and if that changes, we'll be sure to communicate that.
lance william vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
perfect. brian, that's helpful. and then, william, you had mentioned toward the end of your prepared remarks, if i got it right, that you're open to accretive dispositions that would perhaps help you delever the balance sheet more rapidly. could you talk in general about the environment for m&a right now? are deals getting done? have sellers kind of capitulated on valuation? or are buyers comfortable paying pre-covid prices?
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
it's a great question. and i think the truth is, i would say, it is a difficult environment for m&a. and certainly, in our sector, i've not seen a great level of activity since the pandemic started. and frankly, i would be surprised if in the current environment, there were deals being done because of the challenges around valuation, as you implied. so short answer is i don't think there's a lot of activity going on at the moment. and i doubt there will be until we start to see consistency in the timing and scale of the recovery.
lance william vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
makes sense. and one quick last one, if i could. actually, i forgot. on the interest expense forecast, i think it's up about $40 million year-on-year. as we think about 2021, i know, obviously, you've got the bv notes that adds about $25 million to the run rate. but where is the extra $15 million coming from?
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer clear
yes. i'd have to compare our different views on it. but my guess is it's the long interest payment date on the ccibv notes. our first interest payment is in april, and so that will include not only your 2020 interest expense, but your i'm sorry, not only your 2021 interest expense, but your 2020 interest expense. so that long interest payment date, probably just off the top of my head, it probably accounts for the majority of the $15 million.

your next question comes from the line of aaron watts with deutsche bank.
aaron lee watts -- deutsche bank ag -- analyst
a couple of questions for me. i guess, first, encouraging to see the step in the right direction on kind of your revenue performance from 2q to 3q. are you able to put any goalposts around where the u.s. falls within that guidance and where europe is trending?
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer clear
i'm sorry, aaron, i misheard. i didn't hear the whole question. it's the second time i've had to ask somebody to repeat it, and i apologize, but could you repeat the question?
aaron lee watts -- deutsche bank ag -- analyst
no trouble. so i'm just curious that within the low 30% guidance for 3q, are you able to put any goalposts around where the u.s. is falling within that and where europe is trending within that?
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer clear
yes. we didn't come out and give any specific color on the two different operating groups. i think you can tell from what we did say and what we're talking about that, the improvement is a little clearer in the european side. they were more greatly impacted, but they'll also kind of we're seeing signs of recovery that's a little more rapid. so i think the 30% zip code is pretty good for both entities, but just kind of using the information that we've talked about, it's probably europe is a little better. they're emerging a little faster from the level of lockdowns, and there may be a little more pressure kind of on u.s., who obviously didn't have the quite as significant as a drop in q2. but you live in the u.s., you read about some of the things that are impacting it, including the strong position we had in the south and in the west and kind of some of the pandemic issues that are going on there. so i think as much as i can say is that's a good number for the consolidated entity. and if you were to ask me kind of how the segments look, i'd say europe is probably a little on the strong side of that and the u.s. is a little bit on the other side of that. but all within a very, very narrow band.
aaron lee watts -- deutsche bank ag -- analyst
okay. that's helpful context. and then maybe focusing on the u.s. any kind of themes you can call out or talk to around pricing and occupancy on the billboard business, perhaps over these last few months or what you're seeing in the next couple of months relative to what you experienced during the last recession?
scott r. wells -- chief executive officer
so i'll take a run at this one, and brian and william, you can chime in after. i mean, i think the thing to keep in mind is this recession and this downturn is entirely different than the last one. the speed with which we went in, the broad the breadth of going in initially and then the diversity of verticals based on who's having a good covid and who's having a bad covid are all really different. and then you factor on top of that, programmatic out-of-home didn't exist the last time. you had a very different dynamic in terms of how much of our base was digital. and so i think it's really hard to look for answers to what's going on this time by looking back at what happened last time. and i think the other thing that i'd just really emphasize is we don't really we've never really we haven't talked about rate and occupancy for years. it's because we are very focused on yield management, and that is it was obviously incredibly challenging during the sort of march, april, may timeframe. that dynamic is getting better, and we are working very hard to strike deals that make sense for both parties as we work through this. and it really is not something i mean, we've nearly never got any historical guidance that would help you bridge to anything i was going to tell you about this environment. but you can imagine that it's a very tough negotiating environment. and i think that probably gives you as much as i'm going to be able to give you on that one. but it's very different than '08, '09. i mean i lived through it in '08 and '09, and that was a very different dynamic than what we have right now.
aaron lee watts -- deutsche bank ag -- analyst
understood. okay. and maybe just one last one for me. i appreciate that the airport business is a smaller piece of your overall pie. but curious just as maybe we start to get some green shoots and return to travel and some travel bit more travel being allowed, are do you have any pent-up demand for that inventory? or any kind of themes you can talk about as you sit today with how that business might cover?
scott r. wells -- chief executive officer
so the airports is an interesting business because it's like our traditional roadside business, there's multiple segments of it. you have an installed base that's actually pretty stable and has been stable throughout, that is doing advertising on things like hotel rooms and car services and things like that. you then have a segment that is focused on luxury goods. you have a segment that is focused on reaching high-end business travelers. and i guess what i'd say is that the sort of endemic travel-related part of the business has been hit less than the luxury or business travel or any parts of those businesses. and i think that we're going to need to see some rebound in air travel before we see a lot of it's not the first place in our portfolio that people are looking to place money right now. that is certainly the case.
aaron lee watts -- deutsche bank ag -- analyst
okay, great, thanks for the time
operator
your next question is from stephan bisson with wolfe research.
stephan edward bisson -- wolfe research -- analyst
i was hoping you guys might be able to drill down a little bit in terms of underlying categories. i think, clearly, things like travel are especially hurt. but what really needs to recover to accelerate and bring the recovery into focus? and then any color on geographic trends, large markets versus small markets perhaps?
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
do you want to take it to the u.s., scott, and i'll come in behind on europe?
scott r. wells -- chief executive officer
sorry, sorry. i was talking to mute. i william, i'll be happy to give the first wave here. in terms of the things that need to come back for recovery, entertainment, amusements, retail, those are sectors that are important sectors for us. i mean, food, to a degree, but probably entertainment, amusements and retail are the ones that we most are looking for rebound to help truly say that we have a recovery going overall. technology has been mixed. there have been a number of players that have sustained their investment or even increased it. there have also been a number that have pulled back pretty aggressively. so it's really when we get to a mode where amusements are open and theaters are open, and we're promoting those businesses that way that we'll see the recovery really starting to engage. william, i don't know if there's things you'd add internationally.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
no. i mean, i think, internationally, it's probably fair to say that the kind of the star performer as being automotive, which, i think, reflects both the fact that our car dealerships were closed during the pandemic and wanted to get customers kind of back in those showrooms. and that perhaps people are more interested in car travel than they were prior to the pandemic for obvious reasons. so that's been a star performing category. and packaged goods have held up very well across europe. again, [indecipherable] during the period and packaged goods has been supporting that as well. so those are the main issues. and i think i'd agree with scott in terms of the categories that you need to see to return before you feel you've got a full recovery under way.
stephan edward bisson -- wolfe research -- analyst
understood. and then i guess, lastly, you guys are in a unique position of having the global assets, and it sounds like europe is a couple maybe one step ahead in terms of the recovery process. are you guys learning anything from europe that might be able to help you in the states just in terms of timing? and how best to serve those customers as the recovery takes hold?
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
yes. i mean, i think the the one thing you're learning is that the positive, i guess, that you're learning is that as the lockdowns are lifted, as people return to the streets, so advertisers are coming back into the market. and i think any concerns we had that this would be, in any sense, a permanent state have been allayed. we're seeing our audiences return, and we're seeing advertisers come back once those audiences are back. i think the other thing that we have perhaps underestimated in the past was that one of the things we've learned about the pandemic, by the virus, is that you're much safer outdoors than you are inside. you're much safer out-of-home than you are in home, and we are an out-of-home medium. and i think that is playing to our strength because throughout europe, as the lockdowns have lifted, you've seen people returning to high streets, returning to the to outdoor environment, and that obviously plays to our strength. and then the final thing i would say in terms of the activity that we've been undertaking, and we're doing this as much in the u.s., as we are anywhere else, is just maintaining the dialogue with our advertisers, with their agencies and continuing to look for flexible ways in which we can encourage them back into the market. and that is certainly paying off for us as we see things coming back.
operator
your next question is from jason bazinet with citi.
jason boisvert bazinet -- citigroup inc. -- analyst
just one quick question. if we look at the dichotomy and the top line between europe and the u.s., is it fair to say that the vast majority of that is a function of the asset mix that you have, meaning billboard, street furniture transit? and the link to those traffic numbers you talked about and very little of it has to do with differences in exposure by vertical?
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
i think that's fair characterization. i certainly don't think the difference is around the different advertiser base that we have. i think it's significantly to do with the inventory that we have. the decline the sharper decline in europe versus the u.s. in quarter 2. the european inventory as i think we've said before, the european inventory is primarily small format, street furniture in city centers, whereas in the u.s., we're much more the big billboards on the highways, and that traffic has held up better in the u.s. during the pandemic. so i think it is much more inventory based. we also have a higher proportion of digital in europe than we do in the u.s. and that made it easier for advertisers, both to stop activity more quickly and equally, at the other end, to come back into the market more quickly, and we're seeing that reflected now.
jason boisvert bazinet -- citigroup inc. -- analyst
that's super helpful. thank you.
operator
your next question is from jim goss with barrington research.
james charles goss -- barrington research associates -- analyst
okay. just one thing. there is a sort of a disconnect between traffic and the ability and willingness of advertisers to allocate funds that would be dependent on end market demand. i'm wondering if you could talk about how this situation has been more extreme in this particular case? and how you think that might then create the ability to snap back a little bit more?
scott r. wells -- chief executive officer
are you asking in contrast to '08, '09? is that...
james charles goss -- barrington research associates -- analyst
no, no. even just in terms of normal times, i think you do have you've talked about the entertainment retail amusements coming back. i think national probably has a potential to come back. but a lot of the one of the issues has been availability of impressions. and now you've talked about the traffic coming back quite a lot. but it maybe that's not been enough because the advertisers have either looked at end markets that are that they have some concern about or their own budgets and cost they want to manage. i'm just wondering if how those dynamics are playing out in terms of your ability to improve the your profitability again?
scott r. wells -- chief executive officer
sure. well, i'll give a run at it from a u.s. perspective, and william or brian, you can pile on with other views for other geographies. i think we actually talked about this a lot on our q1 call, but there were two things that were in play this time, which is different from a typical recession: thing one was the fact that so much traffic was traffic was reduced so much and businesses were closed. and you had a very different dynamic then you usually don't have a recession start on a date that you can name. this you could absolutely name dates in march by each geography that things got shut down. and i think at that early stage, people were very hopeful that it was going to be temporary, a short thing. it was going to passthrough, and we would bounce back. and i think what's happened over time is that some of the things you refer to in terms of people looking at their budgets and looking at their p&ls has come into play. and you've gone from what was a dislocated crisis driven by things being shut to people realizing that their individual businesses may not come back as quickly. and again, there are people who are having a very good business during covid. i think you've seen that during this earnings season that there's there are businesses that are profiting mightily during this time. so i do think that we have an ability i think, given the momentum that we had fundamentally in the marketplace heading into this, and given the momentum that outdoor as a category has and some of the things william was just talking about in terms of it's better to be out than in, those are all things that work to our favor. but i think what we're going to be fighting against is going to be people managing p&ls. and at least in the united states, with the spiking in south and west that came in sort of late june and early july, that took the wind out of the sales of a number of advertisers that we're thinking about coming back in. and we've kept in tight dialogue, and i expect that they will be coming back into the marketplace. but we kind of need to see cases coming down across the country to have some of those big advertisers come back. so i think the potential is there, but i do think that people have shifted their focus to more conventional recession thinking than to crisis mode. and william, i'll hand it to you there.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
i think that's right. i mean, i would just underline again that it's true to our history that no two recessions are alike. but i think it's even more true this time around i don't think this is it is technically obviously a recession, but i don't think it has very much in common with anything we've seen before. and i certainly don't think it has very much in common with 2008, '09. it's totally different in terms of both its causes and the way it's going to play out from everything that we're seeing. i think that was the last question. so thank you for that. and i just wanted to conclude with a couple of thoughts. first of all, to thank everybody for joining this call, for your attention and for the excellent questions that you've asked. i think we, without a doubt, are glad to put q2 behind us. i think everybody and almost any business around the world will be glad would have been glad to see the end of that quarter. i think we are encouraged by what we're seeing in q3. we've made that very clear in terms of the guidance that we've given. i think the way the pandemic is playing out, europe was first in and has been first out, and i am significantly encouraged by what we're seeing in the european market. as brian said, a decline of 30% or 25% isn't something to celebrate, but it's clearly significantly better than a decline of 50%, 55%. so we are cautiously optimistic, as we said in the opening remarks, about the way in which the resilience of our business and the way in which as our audiences return to the street, our advertisers are returning to our boards, and that is good news. i would say any recovery is hugely dependent upon the way in which the pandemic is controlled. we've seen that, as scott just referenced. we've seen that in the u.s., as we've had some spikes, we've seen advertisers retreat again. and so any forecast, any prediction, any comments we make about the future are inevitably going to be dependent upon the way in which the governments behave and the way in which the pandemic behaves as a result of that. so it's very tough in any position by this to be so dependent on things that are outside of your control. i think we have been very controlled in the way that we have managed our cost base in q2. and as we said in answer to an earlier question, we will continue to be utterly vigilant on costs as we go through this uncertain period. so i think with that, i will say thank you all very much indeed for joining our call. we look forward to keeping you updated in the coming weeks and months. thank you very much.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the clear channel outdoor holdings 2020 second quarter earnings call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, eileen mclaughlin, vice president, investor relations, clear channel outdoor holdings. thank you. please go ahead.
eileen mclaughlin -- vice president of investor relations
good morning and thank you for joining clear channel outdoor holdings' 2020 second quarter earnings call. on the call today are william eccleshare, chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor holdings, inc.; and brian coleman, chief financial officer of clear channel outdoor holdings, inc., who will provide an overview of the second quarter 2020 operating performance of clear channel outdoor holdings, inc., and clear channel international, b.v. after an introduction and a review of our results, we'll open up the line for questions. and scott wells, chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas, will participate in the q&a portion of the call. before we begin, i'd like to remind everyone that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. these statements include management's expectations, beliefs and projections about performance and represents management's current beliefs.

with that, please turn to page three in the presentation, and i will now turn the call over to william eccleshare. good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join today's call. once again, we're conducting this call remotely today, so please bear with us in case there are any technical issues during the call. i'd like to start by saying that i hope you and your families are well and safe. this has certainly been an unprecedented quarter for clear channel outdoor, and indeed most businesses around the world, and it's one that i don't anticipate repeating. although our sales were significantly impacted by the covid-19 pandemic, we are pleased that we are now beginning to see improvement in travel patterns, consumer behaviour and economic activity in varying degrees across our platform. as a result, we are seeing sequential improvement in our business performance. in the third quarter, we expect consolidated company revenues percentage decline to be in the low 30s as compared to the same quarter last year, with europe performing slightly better than the u.s., as it emerges sooner from the pandemic lockdown. and as we consider the longer term, we're confident in our strategy and the resilience of our business. we believe that the strength of our liquidity position and our financial flexibility will continue to support the continuity of our platform and operations through the current environment. before i get into more detail on our business performance, i want to take this time to thank our employees for their resilience and commitment, leading our business through this challenging period. i believe we, as a company, can feel proud of what we've done to manage through these unprecedented circumstances. moving on to slide four. i'll provide an overview of our business, the current environment and views on where the outdoor market is headed from here. since march, the implementation of lockdown measures to slow the spread of the covid-19 outbreak resulted in a significant decline in out-of-home advertising as our audience stayed inside and our customers deferred buying decisions and reduced marketing spend. in the u.s., revenue was down almost 40% in the second quarter as compared to the prior year. as you can see in the chart on the slide, based on geopath, the out-of-home industry organization that provides third-party traffic data, daily average miles traveled was down about half of where it was pre-covid-19. in europe, revenue was down over 60% as compared to the second quarter in 2019, with most of our markets in lockdown, our audience stayed home, as indicated in the chart on the slide and our advertisers pulled back their spending. anticipating the downturn, we focused on preserving liquidity, including targeting cost cuts of over $100 million, a capital expenditure savings of $25 million to mitigate the impact to our business for the second quarter of 2020. our team has fully delivered on these initiatives and achieved the target. we've taken additional steps to strengthen our liquidity. brian will go into greater detail regarding our financial position shortly, but i do want to highlight that through the issuance of the new $375 million ccibv senior secured notes, we increased our available cash. if you include the net proceeds from this transaction, our cash increases to $975 million as of june 30, 2020. importantly, we have not lost sight of a key part of our strategy: to further improve our capital structure, pay down debt and unlock shareholder value. as and when economies rebound, we will continue to evaluate potential transactions, including dispositions as long as they fairly reflect the future value of a business or region. our focus remains on continuing to own, operate and enhance the value of our businesses in order to drive shareholder value. now i will discuss what we're seeing in the third quarter as well as actions we are taking to best position clear channel as economies in our markets begin to rebound. so far in this quarter, we are experiencing positive customer activity, which is reflected in our guidance for revenue to be down in the low 30s, which is a material improvement over the second quarter, which was down 55% as compared to 2019. in the u.s., as you can see on the graph, traffic is back up to about 95% of the pre-covid-19 levels in most of the country, with traffic on weekends closer to 100% of pre-covid levels according to geopath. national advertising continues to be weaker than local. national advertisements have been very tentative about committing to major campaigns well of ours, but there are substantive conversations in sight. a key for this part of our business will be the full upfront, with many of our national advertisers set their plans for the following year. print continues to hold up better than digital due to longer-term contracts. in europe, as lockdown has been lifted, many of our markets have seen a strong rebound in bookings from the very historic lows for the second quarter, although we still have challenges with spikes of in the infection rate occur continues to occur. as you can see on the chart on this slide, driving and walking is close to being back to pre-covid levels, with transit still lagging. we are seeing the strongest return in bookings in countries where lockdown restrictions were eased the earliest and where the emergency plans were well orchestrated. switzerland, for example, was one of the first markets to reopen and has posted positive year-on-year growth in bookings for the past six weeks. we're also seeing improvement in france. and as restrictions in the u.k. are lifted, we're seeing a significantly improved pipeline compared to the second quarter. about 2/3 of our revenue in europe is from street furniture and billboard, which is where we're seeing audience pick up faster. close to 15% is in malls and supermarkets. supermarkets have remained stable throughout the pandemic, while malls have been slower to come back. just over 10% of our european business is in transit, which has been slow to recover. as we emerge from lockdowns, we're seeing various levels of downsize in certain verticals in some of our largest markets in europe. notably, we've seen good bookings from advertisers in packaged goods, telecom and fashion and beauty. travel, tech and entertainment have been slower to return. we're cautiously optimistic about the future with the varying degrees of improvement in travel patterns, consumer behavior and economic activity across our platform, combined with the positive customer activity we are experiencing. however, our visibility beyond the third quarter is limited, and it remains unclear when a sustainable economic recovery will take hold. we currently expect sequential improvement in revenue performance through the balance of the year, although at levels lower than 2019. given the varying outlook by market, we expect to implement further cost-saving initiatives, including permanent cost reductions through the remainder of the year. our continued focus is on aligning our operating expense base with revenues to provide additional financial flexibility as circumstances warrant. in addition, we will continue to be flexible and front-footed as we maneuver through the impact of the pandemic, working closely with our advertising partners and adapting new ways that we believe will serve us well in the long run. now please move to slide five. in the u.s., we have expanded our efforts to build direct relationships with brand owners, invested in tools to aid in the sales and lead process and built out our technology to better serve our clients. notably, radar is helping with the mobility data as audience levels picked up. we know where audiences are and how they are coming back. and we believe the depth of our digital inventory provides the flexibility to quickly ramp up advertising campaign and most effectively target the right audiences at the right time. recently, we expanded our radarproof tool with two separate partnerships. we partnered with ihs markit to improve auto marketing, as u.s. travelers are expected to take more road trips this summer. our radarproof tool is now able to show auto dealers have a out-of-home ad campaign to deliver sales. in a recent campaign using radarproof, we were able to demonstrate a 15% increase in dealer brand sales driven by the out-of-home campaign. working with arrivalist, we are providing hospitality and travel brand with measurable consumer insight and in-depth performance analysis for their out-of-home advertising campaign. in a campaign for a theme park, we were able to show that the out-of-home campaign drove a 66% average increase in visits to just one theme park. in technology, we're working with our partners to create deeper links to their buying systems, and we continue to enhance our programmatic value proposition. we recently announced a partnership with place exchange, providing digital media buyers with programmatic access to clear channel outdoor digital out-of-home displays through omnichannel bsb. in europe, we're continuing to focus on employing data and technology in order to enhance our revenue and campaign management tools. we've accelerated our ability to provide our clients with granular audience data and insights that accurately demonstrate audience's exposure to individual advertising panels. clear channel radar is now being vested in both u.k. and spain ahead of the simultaneous launch later this month. in the u.k., we launched the return audience hub with our data partners adsquare. the hub monitors a huge anonymized mobile data set to learn and openly share how the portfolio is delivering audiences compared to pre-lockdown levels. the hub also demonstrates how mobility behaviors have adapted and provide simple off-the-shelf solutions to help advertise utilizing audience hotspots. the hub has received fantastic customer feedback for its accessibility, accuracy and simplicity. additionally, as booking cycles have shortened, we've leveraged the flexibility of digital to respond to last-minute request. moving on now to slide six. we talked about our resilience during the crisis, but we also want to focus on the future and what comes next. more than anything, during this process, we have learned the importance of flexibility, and we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business and our ability to return to growth. out-of-home is favorably placed in a highly fragmented media market. we continue to believe, along with industry forecasters, that the out-of-home industry will continue to grow faster than traditional media, with digital out-of-home driving that growth. and with that in mind, we continue to believe that the technology investments made before the pandemic, as well as those we continue to make, specifically in expanding our digital footprint, will serve to better position our businesses to meet our customers' needs. and before i turn to brian to discuss the financials in more detail, i want to highlight that our corporate social responsibility initiative remains an important part of our culture. amidst the global health crisis and calls for sociopolitical change, we've seen play out in all corners of the world, we have reinforced our commitment to our people and to promoting diversity and inclusion as well as the need to do more to continue improving and evolving as an organization. most importantly, we remain committed to our vision to deliver a leading platform in the industry, and i'm confident that the fundamentals are out-of-home, the strength of our portfolio and the strategic steps we're taking to bolster our financial position will continue to support clear channel outdoor's long-term performance and our ability to drive value. now i'd like to turn it over to brian to discuss our second quarter 2020 financial results.

thank you, william. good morning, everyone. and thank you for joining our call this morning. please turn to slide seven. as you can see from our earnings release issued this morning in this slide, as expected, the quarter the second quarter was very difficult for us, as it was for many media companies. i would like to echo william's comments earlier and thank our operating teams. during the past several months, we've had to move quickly from a focus on building on our growth and preserving liquidity. the team's focus on managing operating costs and capital spend has been critical in preserving liquidity. today, given the ongoing uncertainties, and the fact that most of you are likely more focused on the steps we are taking to improve liquidity and our capital structure, i will focus only on the highlights of our second quarter results and not provide detail on the performances in americas and europe, as i've done in the past. you can obtain additional detail from the earnings release and 10-k we filed this morning. and, of course, you are always welcome to reach out to the team with any additional questions you may have.
as in the past, during our gaap results discussion, i'll also talk about our results adjusting for foreign exchange, which is a non-gaap financial measure. we believe this improves the comparability of our results to the prior year. additionally, we tendered our shares in clear media on april 28, and therefore, have only included clear media's results for the month of april. consolidated revenue for the quarter decreased 54.9% from last year to $315 million. adjusting for foreign exchange, it was down 54.4%. the americas segment revenue was down 39% and europe segment revenue was down 62%, adjusting for foreign exchange during the second quarter as compared to the prior year. consolidated net loss increased $131 million from $11 million in the second quarter of 2019 to $143 million in the second quarter of 2020. adjusted ebitda was a loss of $63 million in the quarter, and excluding fx, was a loss of $67 million. and this compares to adjusted ebitda of $180 million in the second quarter of 2019. americas adjusted ebitda was $47 million in the quarter compared to $137 million in the second quarter of 2019. europe's adjusted ebitda was a loss of $69 million in the quarter, and excluding fx, was a loss of $71 million compared to adjusted ebitda of $47 million in the second quarter of 2019. as william mentioned, we recently issued senior secured notes through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary clear channel international b.v., which we refer to as ccibv. our europe segment consists of the businesses operated by ccibv and its consolidated subsidiaries. accordingly, the revenue for our europe segment is the revenue for ccibv. ccibv revenue decreased $183 million during the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same period of 2019 to $107 million. after adjusting for a $2 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, ccibv revenue decreased $181 million. ccibv operating loss was $99 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to operating income of $17 million in the same period in 2019. now on to slide 11 to discuss capex. capital expenditures totaled $23 million in the second quarter of 2020, down $28 million from the prior year, as we proactively reduced our capital spend to preserve liquidity. even with the substantial reduction, we did continue to invest in digital in key locations, with 19 new digital billboards in the u.s. and over 100 new digital displays in europe.
now on to slide 12. clear channel outdoor's consolidated cash and cash equivalents as of june 30, 2020, totaled $662 million, including $317 million of cash held outside the u.s. by our subsidiaries. cash balance includes the $253 million we received from the sale of clear media. our debt was $5.3 billion, up $194 million as a result of our drawing from the cash flow revolver at the end of march and exchanging a promissory note in the principal amount of $53 million for the company's series a perpetual preferred stock. cash interest payments for debt during the second quarter were $9 million. this was down compared to the prior year due to the timing of interest payments. the company anticipates having approximately $166 million of cash interest payment obligations in the second half of 2020 and $360 million in 2021, including the interest on the new ccibv secured notes, which have its first interest payment in april of 2021. moving on to slide 13. over the past year, we've taken several steps to improve our capital structure and liquidity. deleveraging continues to be a priority for the company. it's the reason we took the steps last year to push out our material long-term debt maturities and create a line of sight to free cash flow generation.
when the pandemic happened, we had to pivot our focus to liquidity. our priority now is to keep the flexibility necessary to return to a path of debt reduction and free cash flow generation. as we noted in our last earnings call, we drew down $150 million from our cash flow revolver at the end of march. we also received the approximately $253 million in cash from the sale of our stake in clear media. we met our cost savings goals of $100 million and our capex reduction goal of $25 million for the second quarter of 2020. as i stated last quarter, we focused on three areas: site lease, compensation and discretionary spend. about 50% of the cost savings we achieved in the second quarter are site lease savings and about 30% are compensation with the balance discretionary spending and other costs.
as previously announced, on july 12, we amended our credit agreement in response to the uncertain macroeconomic environment. the amendment suspends the springing financial covenant, which requires that the company's first-lien net leverage ratio not exceed 7.6 times from the third quarter of 2020 through the second quarter of 2021. during the suspension period, the company is required to maintain minimum liquidity of $150 million, including cash on hand and availability under the company's receivable-based credit facility and its revolving credit facility. finally, as william mentioned, this week, we issued $375 million in ccibv senior secured notes to further bolster our liquidity position. the notes have a coupon rate of 6.625% and mature in five years. they also contain a short-dated 18-month call protection provision. we believe the ccibv notes offering serves as affirmation from the market of the strength of the out-of-home industry in general and our business in europe, specifically, as well as our ability to manage through the pandemic. a portion of the proceeds from the ccibv notes were used to pay down the ccibv promissory note in full in the amount of $55 million. after given effect of the $313 million of net proceeds from the new ccibv senior secured notes as of june 30, 2020, cash and cash equivalents would have been $975 million, total debt would have been $5.6 billion and net debt, which hasn't really changed, is at $4.6 billion. from a liquidity standpoint, and given what we know today, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to fund the needs of the business as the economy recovers.
and now please turn to slide 14, and let me turn the call back to william for his closing remarks.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
thank you, brian. as i mentioned, our team has worked tirelessly to adapt to new working environments and new working relationships. from the start, we've been nimble and taken actions required at the moment, and as a result, we have delivered on our short-term priorities. and we continue to explore creative opportunities to reduce costs while remaining focused on winning new business and building out our network. importantly, our investments prior to the pandemic, combined with the strength of our platform and our focus on the key pillars of our strategy, have positioned clear channel outdoor to manage through this period of uncertainty. we remain focused on the strong medium and long-term opportunities within our sector, including investments in technology and expanding digital, and we think clear channel is optimally positioned to benefit from these tailwinds.
as i conclude my remarks, i want to reiterate the following. first, as brian said, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund the needs of the business as the economy recovers. second, we are seeing near-term signs of improvement in our business, which is reflected in our guidance for revenue to be down in the low 30s, which is a material improvement over the second quarter, which was down 55% as compared to 2019. visibility beyond the third quarter remains limited, but we are expecting continued sequential improvement in quarter 4. third, given the resilience of our team, investments in our business and strength of our platform, we are cautiously optimistic and believe we will return to growth in 2021, dependent, of course, on the trajectory of the pandemic and the economies in which we operate. and lastly, as we've stated in the past, we remain open to dispositions and opportunities that accelerate our path to creating enhanced value for shareholders. however, given the current economic environment, our focus remains on continuing to own, operate and enhance the value of the current portfolio of assets in order to drive shareholder value until such a time as the economies rebound. i look forward to providing updates regarding our progress.
and now scott will join brian and myself in taking your questions. operator?

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of steven cahall with wells fargo.
steven lee cahall -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thanks, good morning. interesting to see those charts in the presentation about the foot traffic and the miles driven, and they're not too far off of covid level pre-covid levels. how are you thinking about what marketers need to see to start returning? you talked about seeing a little bit of green shoots in bookings. so just wondering how we think about sort of the lag between that data and what marketers actually do?
scott r. wells -- chief executive officer
william, why don't i take this...
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
so let me take that.
scott r. wells -- chief executive officer
oh. go ahead.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
okay. well, let me just make a general comment, which is because i think we've seen a we're at the earlier stages of recovery. we've seen the early first stages of recovery in europe ahead of the u.s. and i think what what's driven the recovery in europe is seeing advertisers kind of seeing the data and seeing with their own eyes people returning to the streets, returning to cities, returning to stores. and as that has happened, clearly, advertising has strengthened and the bookings have come back. so i think it is the thing that is driving the return is the return of audiences to the street. and the encouraging thing, certainly that we've been seeing in some of the european markets, as we mentioned, is that it does seem that there is some real pent-up demand that is coming back pretty quickly as the lockdowns are lifted. and that does give us significantly more encouragement for q3 than maybe we had a couple of months ago. scott, do you want to add from the u.s.?
scott r. wells -- chief executive officer
i mean, i think the only thing i'd add, william, is that it is very, very much by sector. and that the traffic coming back is very important to the businesses that are open and operating normally or close to normally. but you think about some of the businesses that are big partners for us, like entertainment, retail, where they might not be operating normally, that's going to have to make progress as well to see the money come back. but i'd agree with william's assessment overall of how the dynamic is working.
steven lee cahall -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. and then, brian, i think free cash flow came in nicely positive in the quarter. can you maybe speak a little bit to the cash flow dynamics? is free cash flow more resilient than ebitda during this downturn? and maybe an outlook on how you're managing capex would be helpful.
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer clear
sure, steve. thanks for the question. i think when it comes to how we look at free cash flow or ebitda, what we saw in the quarter was a pretty significant benefit, i guess, is the way you would characterize it from working capital shifts, largely in the form of accounts receivable going down, being a source of liquidity, being a source of free cash flow because of the kind of the reduced level of business we have out there. also, you'll see a large amount of rent deferrals, generating an increase in our short-term liabilities. so what i would tell you is there's no magic behind this really. this is reflective of the current environment we're in, how it impacted working capital, and largely, we would expect that again, that benefit to unwind as the business starts to recover, as receivables start to build and as these deferred payments will the ones that we're not able to get permit really from or paid out in the second half of the year. your second question, to talk about capex.
in q2, we had a pretty narrow aperture as we looked at new investments that came across the investment committee's desk. i would tell you though that there wasn't a whole lot going on. i think a lot of municipalities that would have otherwise had tenders, and in many cases, deferred those to later periods. and then the ones we did see obviously, we were they had to be extremely worthy in order to invest a whole lot of money. so we've kept a pretty tight view on it. what we did see come through in q2 was largely sustainable capex that needed to be made or committed capex from prior periods that we weren't able to defer. i think going forward, our capex philosophy is going to be similar, although we want to make sure that we adjust according to the recovery curve. and as we see things improve, the aperture may open a little bit, and there may be other opportunities. but first and foremost, and i hope it came through in the opening dialogue for william and myself, the focus is on liquidity. we feel like we're in a good spot. and so we're not going to do things that jeopardizes that position. at the same time, there's going to be necessary investment to be made in the business both to preserve the current plan and to continue growth, and so we'll continue to look at those as those opportunities come up.
steven lee cahall -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great, thank you.

your next question is from kannan venkateshwar with barclays.
kannan venkateshwar -- barclays bank plc -- analyst
a couple, if i could. so firstly, from a working capital perspective, obviously, you guys have raised lot of money, and the balance sheet seems to be in a comfortable place from a liquidity position. but could you give us a sense of cash burn as the recovery happens because you had a big working capital tailwind last quarter? and i'm assuming as you go through the recovery cycle and as activity picks up that reverses to some extent. so if you could just give us some context around the liquidity on the balance sheet and the cash burn, that would be great. and then i have a follow-up.
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer clear
sure. i think on the first point, i actually touched upon a little bit on steve's question. you're right. i think we would expect what we've seen on the working capital side to reverse itself over time. but again, just given the nature of what generated that working capital movement, that largely will reverse itself as the business starts to recover. so as receivables grow because we're doing more business or as improvements in the second half of the year cause our counterparties under various contracts to say, ""okay, the deferral we made because times were bad, times aren't so bad anymore, and you'll need to make these payments."" those largely will kind of go hand in hand, and consequently, the underlying cash flow performance or ebitda performance of the business will be improved. so hopefully, those will offset and that our operating gains will be greater than the working capital moves. that being said, i think on the international side, they were hit harder. and while they've shown significant improvement in q3, and we would expect sequentially that to continue into q4, it's not likely that there'll be adjusted ebitda positive through the rest of the year, and so we need to be thoughtful and careful about how we manage capex and other liquidity levers that we have. u.s. business wasn't hit as hard, a little slower on the recovery curve, but again, positively sloping in q3. we would expect that through q4. so hopefully, i've answered your question, maybe provide a little bit more color than i intended to, but i'm happy to either follow on, on that or go to your next question.
kannan venkateshwar -- barclays bank plc -- analyst
all right. that's helpful. we can follow up more in detail offline, that's ok. and then the other question was largely around the cost levers. you guys indicated that there's more cost-cutting measures that you're working through. could you give us a sense of the fixed versus variable cost mix? and i'm assuming you've done a lot of the hard work already and you've cut a lot of costs. so given the drop in activity, is it fair to assume that the opex that we see in your income statement in 2q is basically, in some ways, most a fixed cost? or is there some variable cost still there? if you could just walk us through the cost components and what levers you have going forward?
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer clear
yes. i think, first, just a general statement on costs. we have pulled a lot of levers. a lot of them were temporary in nature. and i think that while the business continues to look at ways to optimize our cost structure and may need to take more permanent actions just to kind of rightsize the business for where we are and what we're seeing, largely, what we saw were deferrals on compensation, rent deferrals, although there were certainly we were able to capture some permanent rent abatements as well. so i'm not sure it's fair to say that the current cost is the fixed cost that all the variable kind of got squeezed out. i mean we still had revenue. so we still had variable expense. and in a lot of cases, we converted fixed to variable expense on a temporary basis. and that may reconvert back to fix or maybe permanent depending on the contract underlying contract itself. so not sure that's the right way to look at it. i think that's the most color i can give you on the fixed cost base side.
kannan venkateshwar -- barclays bank plc -- analyst
all right. can i ask one more, sorry, as a follow-up?
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer clear
sure.
kannan venkateshwar -- barclays bank plc -- analyst
as you look at your business, obviously, historically, the outdoor business in city centers and densely populated areas had a different dynamic versus suburbs, now with potentially more work from home and so on, is there any permanent change that you foresee in the flow of business? and how that changes your footprint in terms of presence?
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
let me try and take a stab at that because i think it's an interesting question, kannan. but i really think it is really far too early to say whether there's going to be any permanent change. it does seem to me that we are already seeing in some markets where lockdowns have been lifted and where the pandemic has been well controlled, we're seeing a pretty rapid return to the pre-covid ways of operating and behaviors of people in cities and in workplaces. so while i do think there will be some long-term impact and probably a greater mix than there's been in the past in terms of people working remotely. but it will be a hybrid. it won't be one way or the other. and i don't really foresee any significant structural change in the way our business operates. in the on the contrary, in a sense, i think the momentum that this business had when we went into the pandemic, and that was a global momentum, and pretty much every market in the world, outdoor has been gaining share from traditional media. you saw our very strong performance in q1 in the united states. it seems to me to be every reason to believe that, that will come back and very few reasons to believe that there's really going to be a permanent change in the nature of our business.
kannan venkateshwar -- barclays bank plc -- analyst
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of avi steiner with jpmorgan.
avi steiner -- jpmorgan chase & co -- analyst
i'd heard q3 revenue decline is expected in the low 30s, which is a noted improvement from the second quarter. and if you gave this, i apologize, but how should we think about the underlying expense base? i don't want to get quarter-to-quarter perhaps, but i'm just trying to think through what you may see in the near term as we try and think through ebitda here? and then i've got a couple more questions.
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer clear
i'm sorry, avi. could you repeat that?
avi steiner -- jpmorgan chase & co -- analyst
sure. i just relative to the 30% decline in low-30s revenue decline expected for the third quarter, how should we think about associated or underlying expenses in the quarter? if you can help us there?
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer clear
yes. we continue to take a hard look at the expense line. we didn't provide any guidance in q3 because a lot of in q2, without visibility really into where or how dramatic the decline would be. we knew we had to respond aggressively on the cost side. as we think about q3 and q4, we're starting to see a recovery curve positively sloping. and we want to be sure that we can benefit that recovery. and that's why we didn't make a lot of permanent cost reductions in q2. it's positively sloping. it's still considerably negative than it was last year. we find ourselves in a strange position. we're down 30, sounds pretty good because of q2, but in the scheme of things is still something we have to respond to. so i think the right way to think about it, avi, and without providing hard numbers is while we see improvement in q3 and sequentially, i think, to the rest of the year, we're probably still ways off from returning to normality or returning to 2019 levels. and consequently, the company will have to continue to make decisions on the cost side. so nothing to announce at this point in time, but i think you should expect the company to continue to be aggressive on the cost side and that some of the future initiatives may be more permanent in nature than what you saw in q2.
avi steiner -- jpmorgan chase & co -- analyst
and then in the release, you talk about deferred, revised and canceled sales contracts. is the deferral a meaningful piece of the revenue hit? and any visibility as to at all as to when that might come in? it seems perhaps a little more positive than outright cancellations. and i'm trying to understand how that may flow through.
scott r. wells -- chief executive officer
let me take a run at that. and brian or william, you can jump in as well. we really i mean, think about a movie release that was scheduled originally for april, got moved to july, maybe got moved to november and then maybe got moved to 2021. that would be multiple deferrals. i guess what my point would be is that quantifying that is really quite difficult for you. i guess what i'd characterize is that you should think about the pressure on our revenue side in two ways: there's sales we didn't make because we were busy renegotiating contracts, particularly during the early part of the crisis, that affects downstream time because we do front load a fair bit of our sales; and then there's the actual movement within a quarter. i think that the biggest movement within a quarter in terms of cancellations and deferrals is probably behind us, touchwood. but that other factor of sales we didn't make during those times because we were busy moving things has a lag-on effect, and that's going to be one of the things that is a force against rapid revenue recovery. so sorry i can't quantify that for you, but hopefully it gives you a feel. i don't know, brian or william, if you'd add anything.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
no. i think the only thing i would add from what we've been seeing in europe is that there undoubtedly has been some pent-up demand that has been deferred from quarter two and is being is part of the strengthening that we're seeing in quarter 3. but again, i would reiterate, it's very hard to quantify how much of that is deferred and how much of it is new money coming in.
avi steiner -- jpmorgan chase & co -- analyst
fair enough. and lastly for me, so beyond operational improvements and asset sales, i'm wondering if you can talk about maybe other paths of reducing leverage? and whether that be winning new business, which maybe has been obscured a little bit just in the midst of the pandemic? and then potentially, if it were to avail itself discounts, being able to take a substantial discounts on debt levels if available?
and maybe relatedly, just back to the potential of winning new business. does your liquidity position make you, i guess, more likely to be active on the new business opportunity front in terms of bidding for contracts? or are you going to maintain your normal discipline?
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer clear
sure, avi. and i'll respond initially, then scott and william, feel free to chime in. i think, first and then hopefully came out through the comments that we've made up to now, our focus has been on liquidity. there was a real pivot from where we were at the end of the summer after recapitalizing the company and felt like we had line of sight to a path to deleveraging covid. much like it impacted a lot of companies has derailed us a little bit on that journey. but as we pull the levers we needed to do, as we built up liquidity and as we see recovery in the business, we do need to look further out, and part of that is going back to our core position of wanting to generate additional free cash flow and delever. it starts with fundamentals, and that's focusing on the business. and an important part of that will be being disciplined but choosing the right investments to grow the business. and we've done a lot of work, whether that be contract wins or digital conversions or investment in technology that we think will improve the value of the business and our ability to deliver benefits to our customers. that's first and foremost. you've mentioned asset dispositions, i think we've been clear and communicated that we're open. much like whether you're a buyer looking to acquire businesses or a seller looking to sell businesses, this is a challenging time. there's significant valuation gap. and so that's probably something we'll wait and see. but as the recovery improves, and we get back to historic levels, i suspect that's something that will heat up a little bit. not seeing a lot of discounts on debt. certainly, if that opportunity existed, that may be a good use of excess liquidity. i'm not sure after just having built the balance that we have that we would be in a position to call any of it excess. but at the same time, as we start to realize what we believe is the recovery curve in front of us, we may change our minds about that and utilize excess cash in one way or the other. so i think in a lot of ways, still the options that we had in front of us pre-pandemic, it's just that you want to be very careful and thoughtful and make sure you're on the other side of this thing before you do anything that jeopardizes the comfort of the position that you currently find yourself in. i don't know william or scott, if you have anything to add, but that's kind of my...
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
yes. i'd just add one thing for the avoidance of any doubt, that maintaining our discipline or even increasing the discipline that we apply, both in looking at new contracts, new business, any new opportunities, but also the discipline around any disposals and ensuring that we get the right value, that will absolutely be a part of how we move this business forward. so i think the rigorous discipline that we have applied in the past will be, if anything, actually go up as we move forward.
avi steiner -- jpmorgan chase & co -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of lance vitanza with cowen.
lance william vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
i'm sorry if i missed this on the call, but with respect to the segment operating results, i was a little surprised to see corporate expenses up year-over-year. i was wondering if there's any color there? and what we should expect directionally as we think about the back half of the year? and then i have another question as well.
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer clear
yes. we are now just finalizing kind of the stages of exit from the transition services agreement that we had with iheart. and so what you may be seeing is some the final spend and getting the infrastructure, largely technology-related, kind of up and running. but i do think that at the end of august, we will that's our anticipated exit date from the tsa, you'll see a more normalized corporate expense profile. i would say that'd be in the $110 million to $115 million range on a go-forward basis once we kind of flush through these last, final stages of the exit. that's significantly lower than what was a run rate corporate expense in 2018. of course, that included the copyright fee. so we feel pretty good about where we landed. some incremental costs above what would have been the corporate expense run rate less the rights agreement the trademark license agreement payments that we had. and that largely just reflects certain costs that related to the standup as a separate business. certain technology, certain executive fees that you have that you didn't have before. but that amount offset by certain efficiencies that you've had. but i think the $110 million to $115 million per annum is probably a good run rate. and as and if that changes, we'll be sure to communicate that.
lance william vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
perfect. brian, that's helpful. and then, william, you had mentioned toward the end of your prepared remarks, if i got it right, that you're open to accretive dispositions that would perhaps help you delever the balance sheet more rapidly. could you talk in general about the environment for m&a right now? are deals getting done? have sellers kind of capitulated on valuation? or are buyers comfortable paying pre-covid prices?
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
it's a great question. and i think the truth is, i would say, it is a difficult environment for m&a. and certainly, in our sector, i've not seen a great level of activity since the pandemic started. and frankly, i would be surprised if in the current environment, there were deals being done because of the challenges around valuation, as you implied. so short answer is i don't think there's a lot of activity going on at the moment. and i doubt there will be until we start to see consistency in the timing and scale of the recovery.
lance william vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
makes sense. and one quick last one, if i could. actually, i forgot. on the interest expense forecast, i think it's up about $40 million year-on-year. as we think about 2021, i know, obviously, you've got the bv notes that adds about $25 million to the run rate. but where is the extra $15 million coming from?
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer clear
yes. i'd have to compare our different views on it. but my guess is it's the long interest payment date on the ccibv notes. our first interest payment is in april, and so that will include not only your 2020 interest expense, but your i'm sorry, not only your 2021 interest expense, but your 2020 interest expense. so that long interest payment date, probably just off the top of my head, it probably accounts for the majority of the $15 million.

your next question comes from the line of aaron watts with deutsche bank.
aaron lee watts -- deutsche bank ag -- analyst
a couple of questions for me. i guess, first, encouraging to see the step in the right direction on kind of your revenue performance from 2q to 3q. are you able to put any goalposts around where the u.s. falls within that guidance and where europe is trending?
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer clear
i'm sorry, aaron, i misheard. i didn't hear the whole question. it's the second time i've had to ask somebody to repeat it, and i apologize, but could you repeat the question?
aaron lee watts -- deutsche bank ag -- analyst
no trouble. so i'm just curious that within the low 30% guidance for 3q, are you able to put any goalposts around where the u.s. is falling within that and where europe is trending within that?
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer clear
yes. we didn't come out and give any specific color on the two different operating groups. i think you can tell from what we did say and what we're talking about that, the improvement is a little clearer in the european side. they were more greatly impacted, but they'll also kind of we're seeing signs of recovery that's a little more rapid. so i think the 30% zip code is pretty good for both entities, but just kind of using the information that we've talked about, it's probably europe is a little better. they're emerging a little faster from the level of lockdowns, and there may be a little more pressure kind of on u.s., who obviously didn't have the quite as significant as a drop in q2. but you live in the u.s., you read about some of the things that are impacting it, including the strong position we had in the south and in the west and kind of some of the pandemic issues that are going on there. so i think as much as i can say is that's a good number for the consolidated entity. and if you were to ask me kind of how the segments look, i'd say europe is probably a little on the strong side of that and the u.s. is a little bit on the other side of that. but all within a very, very narrow band.
aaron lee watts -- deutsche bank ag -- analyst
okay. that's helpful context. and then maybe focusing on the u.s. any kind of themes you can call out or talk to around pricing and occupancy on the billboard business, perhaps over these last few months or what you're seeing in the next couple of months relative to what you experienced during the last recession?
scott r. wells -- chief executive officer
so i'll take a run at this one, and brian and william, you can chime in after. i mean, i think the thing to keep in mind is this recession and this downturn is entirely different than the last one. the speed with which we went in, the broad the breadth of going in initially and then the diversity of verticals based on who's having a good covid and who's having a bad covid are all really different. and then you factor on top of that, programmatic out-of-home didn't exist the last time. you had a very different dynamic in terms of how much of our base was digital. and so i think it's really hard to look for answers to what's going on this time by looking back at what happened last time. and i think the other thing that i'd just really emphasize is we don't really we've never really we haven't talked about rate and occupancy for years. it's because we are very focused on yield management, and that is it was obviously incredibly challenging during the sort of march, april, may timeframe. that dynamic is getting better, and we are working very hard to strike deals that make sense for both parties as we work through this. and it really is not something i mean, we've nearly never got any historical guidance that would help you bridge to anything i was going to tell you about this environment. but you can imagine that it's a very tough negotiating environment. and i think that probably gives you as much as i'm going to be able to give you on that one. but it's very different than '08, '09. i mean i lived through it in '08 and '09, and that was a very different dynamic than what we have right now.
aaron lee watts -- deutsche bank ag -- analyst
understood. okay. and maybe just one last one for me. i appreciate that the airport business is a smaller piece of your overall pie. but curious just as maybe we start to get some green shoots and return to travel and some travel bit more travel being allowed, are do you have any pent-up demand for that inventory? or any kind of themes you can talk about as you sit today with how that business might cover?
scott r. wells -- chief executive officer
so the airports is an interesting business because it's like our traditional roadside business, there's multiple segments of it. you have an installed base that's actually pretty stable and has been stable throughout, that is doing advertising on things like hotel rooms and car services and things like that. you then have a segment that is focused on luxury goods. you have a segment that is focused on reaching high-end business travelers. and i guess what i'd say is that the sort of endemic travel-related part of the business has been hit less than the luxury or business travel or any parts of those businesses. and i think that we're going to need to see some rebound in air travel before we see a lot of it's not the first place in our portfolio that people are looking to place money right now. that is certainly the case.
aaron lee watts -- deutsche bank ag -- analyst
okay, great, thanks for the time

your next question is from stephan bisson with wolfe research.
stephan edward bisson -- wolfe research -- analyst
i was hoping you guys might be able to drill down a little bit in terms of underlying categories. i think, clearly, things like travel are especially hurt. but what really needs to recover to accelerate and bring the recovery into focus? and then any color on geographic trends, large markets versus small markets perhaps?
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
do you want to take it to the u.s., scott, and i'll come in behind on europe?
scott r. wells -- chief executive officer
sorry, sorry. i was talking to mute. i william, i'll be happy to give the first wave here. in terms of the things that need to come back for recovery, entertainment, amusements, retail, those are sectors that are important sectors for us. i mean, food, to a degree, but probably entertainment, amusements and retail are the ones that we most are looking for rebound to help truly say that we have a recovery going overall. technology has been mixed. there have been a number of players that have sustained their investment or even increased it. there have also been a number that have pulled back pretty aggressively. so it's really when we get to a mode where amusements are open and theaters are open, and we're promoting those businesses that way that we'll see the recovery really starting to engage. william, i don't know if there's things you'd add internationally.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
no. i mean, i think, internationally, it's probably fair to say that the kind of the star performer as being automotive, which, i think, reflects both the fact that our car dealerships were closed during the pandemic and wanted to get customers kind of back in those showrooms. and that perhaps people are more interested in car travel than they were prior to the pandemic for obvious reasons. so that's been a star performing category. and packaged goods have held up very well across europe. again, [indecipherable] during the period and packaged goods has been supporting that as well. so those are the main issues. and i think i'd agree with scott in terms of the categories that you need to see to return before you feel you've got a full recovery under way.
stephan edward bisson -- wolfe research -- analyst
understood. and then i guess, lastly, you guys are in a unique position of having the global assets, and it sounds like europe is a couple maybe one step ahead in terms of the recovery process. are you guys learning anything from europe that might be able to help you in the states just in terms of timing? and how best to serve those customers as the recovery takes hold?
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
yes. i mean, i think the the one thing you're learning is that the positive, i guess, that you're learning is that as the lockdowns are lifted, as people return to the streets, so advertisers are coming back into the market. and i think any concerns we had that this would be, in any sense, a permanent state have been allayed. we're seeing our audiences return, and we're seeing advertisers come back once those audiences are back. i think the other thing that we have perhaps underestimated in the past was that one of the things we've learned about the pandemic, by the virus, is that you're much safer outdoors than you are inside. you're much safer out-of-home than you are in home, and we are an out-of-home medium. and i think that is playing to our strength because throughout europe, as the lockdowns have lifted, you've seen people returning to high streets, returning to the to outdoor environment, and that obviously plays to our strength. and then the final thing i would say in terms of the activity that we've been undertaking, and we're doing this as much in the u.s., as we are anywhere else, is just maintaining the dialogue with our advertisers, with their agencies and continuing to look for flexible ways in which we can encourage them back into the market. and that is certainly paying off for us as we see things coming back.
operator
your next question is from jason bazinet with citi.
jason boisvert bazinet -- citigroup inc. -- analyst
just one quick question. if we look at the dichotomy and the top line between europe and the u.s., is it fair to say that the vast majority of that is a function of the asset mix that you have, meaning billboard, street furniture transit? and the link to those traffic numbers you talked about and very little of it has to do with differences in exposure by vertical?
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
i think that's fair characterization. i certainly don't think the difference is around the different advertiser base that we have. i think it's significantly to do with the inventory that we have. the decline the sharper decline in europe versus the u.s. in quarter 2. the european inventory as i think we've said before, the european inventory is primarily small format, street furniture in city centers, whereas in the u.s., we're much more the big billboards on the highways, and that traffic has held up better in the u.s. during the pandemic. so i think it is much more inventory based. we also have a higher proportion of digital in europe than we do in the u.s. and that made it easier for advertisers, both to stop activity more quickly and equally, at the other end, to come back into the market more quickly, and we're seeing that reflected now.
jason boisvert bazinet -- citigroup inc. -- analyst
that's super helpful. thank you.
operator
your next question is from jim goss with barrington research.
james charles goss -- barrington research associates -- analyst
okay. just one thing. there is a sort of a disconnect between traffic and the ability and willingness of advertisers to allocate funds that would be dependent on end market demand. i'm wondering if you could talk about how this situation has been more extreme in this particular case? and how you think that might then create the ability to snap back a little bit more?
scott r. wells -- chief executive officer
are you asking in contrast to '08, '09? is that...
james charles goss -- barrington research associates -- analyst
no, no. even just in terms of normal times, i think you do have you've talked about the entertainment retail amusements coming back. i think national probably has a potential to come back. but a lot of the one of the issues has been availability of impressions. and now you've talked about the traffic coming back quite a lot. but it maybe that's not been enough because the advertisers have either looked at end markets that are that they have some concern about or their own budgets and cost they want to manage. i'm just wondering if how those dynamics are playing out in terms of your ability to improve the your profitability again?
scott r. wells -- chief executive officer
sure. well, i'll give a run at it from a u.s. perspective, and william or brian, you can pile on with other views for other geographies. i think we actually talked about this a lot on our q1 call, but there were two things that were in play this time, which is different from a typical recession: thing one was the fact that so much traffic was traffic was reduced so much and businesses were closed. and you had a very different dynamic then you usually don't have a recession start on a date that you can name. this you could absolutely name dates in march by each geography that things got shut down. and i think at that early stage, people were very hopeful that it was going to be temporary, a short thing. it was going to passthrough, and we would bounce back. and i think what's happened over time is that some of the things you refer to in terms of people looking at their budgets and looking at their p&ls has come into play. and you've gone from what was a dislocated crisis driven by things being shut to people realizing that their individual businesses may not come back as quickly. and again, there are people who are having a very good business during covid. i think you've seen that during this earnings season that there's there are businesses that are profiting mightily during this time. so i do think that we have an ability i think, given the momentum that we had fundamentally in the marketplace heading into this, and given the momentum that outdoor as a category has and some of the things william was just talking about in terms of it's better to be out than in, those are all things that work to our favor. but i think what we're going to be fighting against is going to be people managing p&ls. and at least in the united states, with the spiking in south and west that came in sort of late june and early july, that took the wind out of the sales of a number of advertisers that we're thinking about coming back in. and we've kept in tight dialogue, and i expect that they will be coming back into the marketplace. but we kind of need to see cases coming down across the country to have some of those big advertisers come back. so i think the potential is there, but i do think that people have shifted their focus to more conventional recession thinking than to crisis mode. and william, i'll hand it to you there.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
i think that's right. i mean, i would just underline again that it's true to our history that no two recessions are alike. but i think it's even more true this time around i don't think this is it is technically obviously a recession, but i don't think it has very much in common with anything we've seen before. and i certainly don't think it has very much in common with 2008, '09. it's totally different in terms of both its causes and the way it's going to play out from everything that we're seeing. i think that was the last question. so thank you for that. and i just wanted to conclude with a couple of thoughts. first of all, to thank everybody for joining this call, for your attention and for the excellent questions that you've asked. i think we, without a doubt, are glad to put q2 behind us. i think everybody and almost any business around the world will be glad would have been glad to see the end of that quarter. i think we are encouraged by what we're seeing in q3. we've made that very clear in terms of the guidance that we've given. i think the way the pandemic is playing out, europe was first in and has been first out, and i am significantly encouraged by what we're seeing in the european market. as brian said, a decline of 30% or 25% isn't something to celebrate, but it's clearly significantly better than a decline of 50%, 55%. so we are cautiously optimistic, as we said in the opening remarks, about the way in which the resilience of our business and the way in which as our audiences return to the street, our advertisers are returning to our boards, and that is good news. i would say any recovery is hugely dependent upon the way in which the pandemic is controlled. we've seen that, as scott just referenced. we've seen that in the u.s., as we've had some spikes, we've seen advertisers retreat again. and so any forecast, any prediction, any comments we make about the future are inevitably going to be dependent upon the way in which the governments behave and the way in which the pandemic behaves as a result of that. so it's very tough in any position by this to be so dependent on things that are outside of your control. i think we have been very controlled in the way that we have managed our cost base in q2. and as we said in answer to an earlier question, we will continue to be utterly vigilant on costs as we go through this uncertain period. so i think with that, i will say thank you all very much indeed for joining our call. we look forward to keeping you updated in the coming weeks and months. thank you very much.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the clear channel outdoor holdings 2020 second quarter earnings call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, eileen mclaughlin, vice president, investor relations, clear channel outdoor holdings. thank you. please go ahead.
eileen mclaughlin -- vice president of investor relations
good morning and thank you for joining clear channel outdoor holdings' 2020 second quarter earnings call. on the call today are william eccleshare, chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor holdings, inc.; and brian coleman, chief financial officer of clear channel outdoor holdings, inc., who will provide an overview of the second quarter 2020 operating performance of clear channel outdoor holdings, inc., and clear channel international, b.v. after an introduction and a review of our results, we'll open up the line for questions. and scott wells, chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas, will participate in the q&a portion of the call. before we begin, i'd like to remind everyone that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. these statements include management's expectations, beliefs and projections about performance and represents management's current beliefs.
there can be no assurance that management's expectations, beliefs or projections will be achieved or that actual results will not differ from expectations. please review the statements of risks containing our earnings press releases and filings with the sec. during today's call, we will provide certain performance measures that do not conform to generally accepted accounting principles. we provided schedules that reconcile these non-gaap measures with our reported results on a gaap basis as part of our earnings press releases and earnings conference call presentation, which can be found in the financials section of our website, investor.clearchannel.com. additionally, when we reference our business in china, we are referring to our 51% investment in clear media limited, a public company that trades on the hong kong stock exchange. please note that our earnings release and the slide presentation are also available on our website, investor.clearchannel.com, and are integral to our earnings conference call. they provide a detailed breakdown of foreign exchange and noncash compensation expense items as well as segment revenues and adjusted ebitda, among other important information. for that reason, we ask that you view each slide as william and brian comment on that.also, please note that the information provided on this call speaks only to management's views as of today, august 7, 2020, and may no longer be accurate at the time of a replay.
with that, please turn to page three in the presentation, and i will now turn the call over to william eccleshare. good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join today's call. once again, we're conducting this call remotely today, so please bear with us in case there are any technical issues during the call. i'd like to start by saying that i hope you and your families are well and safe. this has certainly been an unprecedented quarter for clear channel outdoor, and indeed most businesses around the world, and it's one that i don't anticipate repeating. although our sales were significantly impacted by the covid-19 pandemic, we are pleased that we are now beginning to see improvement in travel patterns, consumer behaviour and economic activity in varying degrees across our platform. as a result, we are seeing sequential improvement in our business performance. in the third quarter, we expect consolidated company revenues percentage decline to be in the low 30s as compared to the same quarter last year, with europe performing slightly better than the u.s., as it emerges sooner from the pandemic lockdown. and as we consider the longer term, we're confident in our strategy and the resilience of our business. we believe that the strength of our liquidity position and our financial flexibility will continue to support the continuity of our platform and operations through the current environment. before i get into more detail on our business performance, i want to take this time to thank our employees for their resilience and commitment, leading our business through this challenging period. i believe we, as a company, can feel proud of what we've done to manage through these unprecedented circumstances. moving on to slide four. i'll provide an overview of our business, the current environment and views on where the outdoor market is headed from here. since march, the implementation of lockdown measures to slow the spread of the covid-19 outbreak resulted in a significant decline in out-of-home advertising as our audience stayed inside and our customers deferred buying decisions and reduced marketing spend. in the u.s., revenue was down almost 40% in the second quarter as compared to the prior year. as you can see in the chart on the slide, based on geopath, the out-of-home industry organization that provides third-party traffic data, daily average miles traveled was down about half of where it was pre-covid-19. in europe, revenue was down over 60% as compared to the second quarter in 2019, with most of our markets in lockdown, our audience stayed home, as indicated in the chart on the slide and our advertisers pulled back their spending. anticipating the downturn, we focused on preserving liquidity, including targeting cost cuts of over $100 million, a capital expenditure savings of $25 million to mitigate the impact to our business for the second quarter of 2020. our team has fully delivered on these initiatives and achieved the target. we've taken additional steps to strengthen our liquidity. brian will go into greater detail regarding our financial position shortly, but i do want to highlight that through the issuance of the new $375 million ccibv senior secured notes, we increased our available cash. if you include the net proceeds from this transaction, our cash increases to $975 million as of june 30, 2020. importantly, we have not lost sight of a key part of our strategy: to further improve our capital structure, pay down debt and unlock shareholder value. as and when economies rebound, we will continue to evaluate potential transactions, including dispositions as long as they fairly reflect the future value of a business or region. our focus remains on continuing to own, operate and enhance the value of our businesses in order to drive shareholder value. now i will discuss what we're seeing in the third quarter as well as actions we are taking to best position clear channel as economies in our markets begin to rebound. so far in this quarter, we are experiencing positive customer activity, which is reflected in our guidance for revenue to be down in the low 30s, which is a material improvement over the second quarter, which was down 55% as compared to 2019. in the u.s., as you can see on the graph, traffic is back up to about 95% of the pre-covid-19 levels in most of the country, with traffic on weekends closer to 100% of pre-covid levels according to geopath. national advertising continues to be weaker than local. national advertisements have been very tentative about committing to major campaigns well of ours, but there are substantive conversations in sight. a key for this part of our business will be the full upfront, with many of our national advertisers set their plans for the following year. print continues to hold up better than digital due to longer-term contracts. in europe, as lockdown has been lifted, many of our markets have seen a strong rebound in bookings from the very historic lows for the second quarter, although we still have challenges with spikes of in the infection rate occur continues to occur. as you can see on the chart on this slide, driving and walking is close to being back to pre-covid levels, with transit still lagging. we are seeing the strongest return in bookings in countries where lockdown restrictions were eased the earliest and where the emergency plans were well orchestrated. switzerland, for example, was one of the first markets to reopen and has posted positive year-on-year growth in bookings for the past six weeks. we're also seeing improvement in france. and as restrictions in the u.k. are lifted, we're seeing a significantly improved pipeline compared to the second quarter. about 2/3 of our revenue in europe is from street furniture and billboard, which is where we're seeing audience pick up faster. close to 15% is in malls and supermarkets. supermarkets have remained stable throughout the pandemic, while malls have been slower to come back. just over 10% of our european business is in transit, which has been slow to recover. as we emerge from lockdowns, we're seeing various levels of downsize in certain verticals in some of our largest markets in europe. notably, we've seen good bookings from advertisers in packaged goods, telecom and fashion and beauty. travel, tech and entertainment have been slower to return. we're cautiously optimistic about the future with the varying degrees of improvement in travel patterns, consumer behavior and economic activity across our platform, combined with the positive customer activity we are experiencing. however, our visibility beyond the third quarter is limited, and it remains unclear when a sustainable economic recovery will take hold. we currently expect sequential improvement in revenue performance through the balance of the year, although at levels lower than 2019. given the varying outlook by market, we expect to implement further cost-saving initiatives, including permanent cost reductions through the remainder of the year. our continued focus is on aligning our operating expense base with revenues to provide additional financial flexibility as circumstances warrant. in addition, we will continue to be flexible and front-footed as we maneuver through the impact of the pandemic, working closely with our advertising partners and adapting new ways that we believe will serve us well in the long run. now please move to slide five. in the u.s., we have expanded our efforts to build direct relationships with brand owners, invested in tools to aid in the sales and lead process and built out our technology to better serve our clients. notably, radar is helping with the mobility data as audience levels picked up. we know where audiences are and how they are coming back. and we believe the depth of our digital inventory provides the flexibility to quickly ramp up advertising campaign and most effectively target the right audiences at the right time. recently, we expanded our radarproof tool with two separate partnerships. we partnered with ihs markit to improve auto marketing, as u.s. travelers are expected to take more road trips this summer. our radarproof tool is now able to show auto dealers have a out-of-home ad campaign to deliver sales. in a recent campaign using radarproof, we were able to demonstrate a 15% increase in dealer brand sales driven by the out-of-home campaign. working with arrivalist, we are providing hospitality and travel brand with measurable consumer insight and in-depth performance analysis for their out-of-home advertising campaign. in a campaign for a theme park, we were able to show that the out-of-home campaign drove a 66% average increase in visits to just one theme park. in technology, we're working with our partners to create deeper links to their buying systems, and we continue to enhance our programmatic value proposition. we recently announced a partnership with place exchange, providing digital media buyers with programmatic access to clear channel outdoor digital out-of-home displays through omnichannel bsb. in europe, we're continuing to focus on employing data and technology in order to enhance our revenue and campaign management tools. we've accelerated our ability to provide our clients with granular audience data and insights that accurately demonstrate audience's exposure to individual advertising panels. clear channel radar is now being vested in both u.k. and spain ahead of the simultaneous launch later this month. in the u.k., we launched the return audience hub with our data partners adsquare. the hub monitors a huge anonymized mobile data set to learn and openly share how the portfolio is delivering audiences compared to pre-lockdown levels. the hub also demonstrates how mobility behaviors have adapted and provide simple off-the-shelf solutions to help advertise utilizing audience hotspots. the hub has received fantastic customer feedback for its accessibility, accuracy and simplicity. additionally, as booking cycles have shortened, we've leveraged the flexibility of digital to respond to last-minute request. moving on now to slide six. we talked about our resilience during the crisis, but we also want to focus on the future and what comes next. more than anything, during this process, we have learned the importance of flexibility, and we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business and our ability to return to growth. out-of-home is favorably placed in a highly fragmented media market. we continue to believe, along with industry forecasters, that the out-of-home industry will continue to grow faster than traditional media, with digital out-of-home driving that growth. and with that in mind, we continue to believe that the technology investments made before the pandemic, as well as those we continue to make, specifically in expanding our digital footprint, will serve to better position our businesses to meet our customers' needs. and before i turn to brian to discuss the financials in more detail, i want to highlight that our corporate social responsibility initiative remains an important part of our culture. amidst the global health crisis and calls for sociopolitical change, we've seen play out in all corners of the world, we have reinforced our commitment to our people and to promoting diversity and inclusion as well as the need to do more to continue improving and evolving as an organization. most importantly, we remain committed to our vision to deliver a leading platform in the industry, and i'm confident that the fundamentals are out-of-home, the strength of our portfolio and the strategic steps we're taking to bolster our financial position will continue to support clear channel outdoor's long-term performance and our ability to drive value. now i'd like to turn it over to brian to discuss our second quarter 2020 financial results.
brian d. coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer clear
thank you, william. good morning, everyone. and thank you for joining our call this morning. please turn to slide seven. as you can see from our earnings release issued this morning in this slide, as expected, the quarter the second quarter was very difficult for us, as it was for many media companies. i would like to echo william's comments earlier and thank our operating teams. during the past several months, we've had to move quickly from a focus on building on our growth and preserving liquidity. the team's focus on managing operating costs and capital spend has been critical in preserving liquidity. today, given the ongoing uncertainties, and the fact that most of you are likely more focused on the steps we are taking to improve liquidity and our capital structure, i will focus only on the highlights of our second quarter results and not provide detail on the performances in americas and europe, as i've done in the past. you can obtain additional detail from the earnings release and 10-k we filed this morning. and, of course, you are always welcome to reach out to the team with any additional questions you may have.
as in the past, during our gaap results discussion, i'll also talk about our results adjusting for foreign exchange, which is a non-gaap financial measure. we believe this improves the comparability of our results to the prior year. additionally, we tendered our shares in clear media on april 28, and therefore, have only included clear media's results for the month of april. consolidated revenue for the quarter decreased 54.9% from last year to $315 million. adjusting for foreign exchange, it was down 54.4%. the americas segment revenue was down 39% and europe segment revenue was down 62%, adjusting for foreign exchange during the second quarter as compared to the prior year. consolidated net loss increased $131 million from $11 million in the second quarter of 2019 to $143 million in the second quarter of 2020. adjusted ebitda was a loss of $63 million in the quarter, and excluding fx, was a loss of $67 million. and this compares to adjusted ebitda of $180 million in the second quarter of 2019. americas adjusted ebitda was $47 million in the quarter compared to $137 million in the second quarter of 2019. europe's adjusted ebitda was a loss of $69 million in the quarter, and excluding fx, was a loss of $71 million compared to adjusted ebitda of $47 million in the second quarter of 2019. as william mentioned, we recently issued senior secured notes through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary clear channel international b.v., which we refer to as ccibv. our europe segment consists of the businesses operated by ccibv and its consolidated subsidiaries. accordingly, the revenue for our europe segment is the revenue for ccibv. ccibv revenue decreased $183 million during the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same period of 2019 to $107 million. after adjusting for a $2 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, ccibv revenue decreased $181 million. ccibv operating loss was $99 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to operating income of $17 million in the same period in 2019. now on to slide 11 to discuss capex. capital expenditures totaled $23 million in the second quarter of 2020, down $28 million from the prior year, as we proactively reduced our capital spend to preserve liquidity. even with the substantial reduction, we did continue to invest in digital in key locations, with 19 new digital billboards in the u.s. and over 100 new digital displays in europe.
now on to slide 12. clear channel outdoor's consolidated cash and cash equivalents as of june 30, 2020, totaled $662 million, including $317 million of cash held outside the u.s. by our subsidiaries. cash balance includes the $253 million we received from the sale of clear media. our debt was $5.3 billion, up $194 million as a result of our drawing from the cash flow revolver at the end of march and exchanging a promissory note in the principal amount of $53 million for the company's series a perpetual preferred stock. cash interest payments for debt during the second quarter were $9 million. this was down compared to the prior year due to the timing of interest payments. the company anticipates having approximately $166 million of cash interest payment obligations in the second half of 2020 and $360 million in 2021, including the interest on the new ccibv secured notes, which have its first interest payment in april of 2021. moving on to slide 13. over the past year, we've taken several steps to improve our capital structure and liquidity. deleveraging continues to be a priority for the company. it's the reason we took the steps last year to push out our material long-term debt maturities and create a line of sight to free cash flow generation.
when the pandemic happened, we had to pivot our focus to liquidity. our priority now is to keep the flexibility necessary to return to a path of debt reduction and free cash flow generation. as we noted in our last earnings call, we drew down $150 million from our cash flow revolver at the end of march. we also received the approximately $253 million in cash from the sale of our stake in clear media. we met our cost savings goals of $100 million and our capex reduction goal of $25 million for the second quarter of 2020. as i stated last quarter, we focused on three areas: site lease, compensation and discretionary spend. about 50% of the cost savings we achieved in the second quarter are site lease savings and about 30% are compensation with the balance discretionary spending and other costs.
as previously announced, on july 12, we amended our credit agreement in response to the uncertain macroeconomic environment. the amendment suspends the springing financial covenant, which requires that the company's first-lien net leverage ratio not exceed 7.6 times from the third quarter of 2020 through the second quarter of 2021. during the suspension period, the company is required to maintain minimum liquidity of $150 million, including cash on hand and availability under the company's receivable-based credit facility and its revolving credit facility. finally, as william mentioned, this week, we issued $375 million in ccibv senior secured notes to further bolster our liquidity position. the notes have a coupon rate of 6.625% and mature in five years. they also contain a short-dated 18-month call protection provision. we believe the ccibv notes offering serves as affirmation from the market of the strength of the out-of-home industry in general and our business in europe, specifically, as well as our ability to manage through the pandemic. a portion of the proceeds from the ccibv notes were used to pay down the ccibv promissory note in full in the amount of $55 million. after given effect of the $313 million of net proceeds from the new ccibv senior secured notes as of june 30, 2020, cash and cash equivalents would have been $975 million, total debt would have been $5.6 billion and net debt, which hasn't really changed, is at $4.6 billion. from a liquidity standpoint, and given what we know today, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to fund the needs of the business as the economy recovers.
and now please turn to slide 14, and let me turn the call back to william for his closing remarks.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
thank you, brian. as i mentioned, our team has worked tirelessly to adapt to new working environments and new working relationships. from the start, we've been nimble and taken actions required at the moment, and as a result, we have delivered on our short-term priorities. and we continue to explore creative opportunities to reduce costs while remaining focused on winning new business and building out our network. importantly, our investments prior to the pandemic, combined with the strength of our platform and our focus on the key pillars of our strategy, have positioned clear channel outdoor to manage through this period of uncertainty. we remain focused on the strong medium and long-term opportunities within our sector, including investments in technology and expanding digital, and we think clear channel is optimally positioned to benefit from these tailwinds.
as i conclude my remarks, i want to reiterate the following. first, as brian said, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund the needs of the business as the economy recovers. second, we are seeing near-term signs of improvement in our business, which is reflected in our guidance for revenue to be down in the low 30s, which is a material improvement over the second quarter, which was down 55% as compared to 2019. visibility beyond the third quarter remains limited, but we are expecting continued sequential improvement in quarter 4. third, given the resilience of our team, investments in our business and strength of our platform, we are cautiously optimistic and believe we will return to growth in 2021, dependent, of course, on the trajectory of the pandemic and the economies in which we operate. and lastly, as we've stated in the past, we remain open to dispositions and opportunities that accelerate our path to creating enhanced value for shareholders. however, given the current economic environment, our focus remains on continuing to own, operate and enhance the value of the current portfolio of assets in order to drive shareholder value until such a time as the economies rebound. i look forward to providing updates regarding our progress.
and now scott will join brian and myself in taking your questions. operator?

thank you. the floor is now open for questions. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of steven cahall of wells fargo.
steven cahall -- wells fargo -- analyst
thanks. a few for me. maybe first, just on the new york airports, when -- for those of us who kind of count jfk and laguardia as a second home. i was wondering, if you could talk about a little more detail, what that rollout looks like? and do you have any substantial capex increase in 2021 related to that contract?
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
steve, let me hand it to scott for that. scott?
scott wells -- chief executive officer
thanks, william and good morning, steve.
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer
hi, scott.
scott wells -- chief executive officer
so, as william referenced the contract has not yet been signed and therefore it's not out in the public domain. so our ability to give you a lot's of details about it is limited. but let me tell you a couple of things to the spirit of your question. as you know, being a regular visitor to jfk and laguardia, new york has invested in -- the port authority has invested enormously in all of the four airports around new york city. and what we would expect is that newark is actually going to be our first priority in building out in some of the new terminals there and it will go then a pace across the footprint over a number of years.
it's not going to be something that the build out is completed in year one. but we're very excited about the plans that we've got. we're excited to be able to share more information on those plans as the contract gets finalized. i do think that you'll see an uptick in capex from us next year, but it's not going to be a shocking number, would be sort of the best i can give you on that. i don't know, if william or brian, you have anything you'd add.
steven cahall -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. and then maybe on just some of the cost reductions, brian, would love to hear a little bit about that $32 million in cost savings. do you think that's fixed? and also, i think your debt costs are down, even with the recent notes issuance. and so, was just wondering how you're thinking about maybe what the cash runway looks like and if there's going to be an opportunity to do anything with the 9.25 [phonetic] notes, since those kind of jump out in terms of their cash interest costs at the moment. and then i've just got one more after that. thanks.
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. thanks, steve. on the cost side, i think the recent plans that we've talked about, where we expect $32 million in expense savings, as ultimately to be taken out of the business is structural and permanent nature. i mean, the business changes we need to -- we may need to readdress it, but i think what we're doing right now is right-sizing the business for the current environment. and these plans are across the company. some have been in the works for a little while. some will take a little while to complete, but we're in the [indecipherable] of it. so, hopefully that answers the questions on the expense side. if not, we can go back to it.
on the interest side, i think you're thinking about it the right way. the unsecured notes were the first notes that we refinanced, actually prior to separation. they carry a rate, which is much higher than all the subsequent refinancings. the subsequent refinancings reflect a number of measures that we took post-separation, the issuance of some equity that get -- carrying cost is much lower. we'd like to reprice the unsecured notes. the first call i believe is in february of next year. i don't know that the refinancing rate right now is attractive, but you should assume the company will continue to monitor that. and as we start to see a recovery in the business, a rebound in our trading levels, we would hope there's an opportunity to reprice those securities more in line with what we have in the rest of the portfolio and continue to benefit from the decreased interest expense. so i'll pause there and if you have any follow-ups, please let me know.
steven cahall -- wells fargo -- analyst
that's helpful. and then just last one for me. william thanks for that outlook for some sequential improvement in the americas and i get that europe and latam are a little tough to call. should we similarly expect improvement in free cash flow in the fourth quarter kind of as you think about the business? does it -- are you kind of through the worst and free cash flow can [indecipherable] improve from here or is it still too -- a little too volatile to make that call? thanks.
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
yeah. it is still volatile. it should improve from here. i'll let brian give you a little more detail.
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah. look, i think on the america side, we're seeing improvement and given the guidance we provided, you should expect that to continue at a modest pace. europe, obviously the volatility through the incremental restrictions, is difficult to predict. i would point you, though, to the resilience that was shown in q3 and really the closing of the gap with respect to becoming at least on an operating our segment -- segment operating basis, close to free cash flow neutral. so hopefully, we'll continue to make progress there. we're certainly seeing it on the america side. europe is a bit tough to call, but we're hearing good news out of kind of the macro environment that things may be improving. so, hopefully that will settle down, but right now it's tough predict.
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
just to be absolutely clear though on europe for q4, just -- if i may for a second, just because i think we are saying we don't want to call it at the moment for obvious reasons. uk went back into lockdown last week, as did france, and those are our two biggest markets, but i do want to be very clear just to underline that these lockdowns are not directly comparable to what we saw in the second quarter. schools and universities remain open. there is still significant traffic out there on the streets and in the city centers in a way that there absolutely wasn't back in like april. so, while it's difficult to provide any real guidance for q4, i do want to be clear that we expect -- we don't expect to see anything like the impact from covid that we saw in q2 in europe.
scott wells -- chief executive officer
yeah. thank you.
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
thanks, steve.
operator
our next question comes from the line of lance vitanza of cowen.
lance vitanza -- cowen -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for taking the questions. let me start with the -- i want to go back to the port authority contract. in the press release you came out, there was a reference or references to a transition period. and i'm wondering if you could, and i know that this isn't in a public document yet, but could you talk a little bit about what exactly is contemplated to occur or not occur during this transition period? and then, is it possible to estimate when air travel, [phonetic] if and when air travel eventually returns to its pre-covid levels? how do we think about the possible size of this opportunity in terms of annual ad sales or percentage of your ad sales? i mean, how meaningful should we think this could someday be for you?
scott wells -- chief executive officer
so i'll take that one again. good morning, lance. so, a couple of things, like, as i said, the contract is not yet public. it's not yet signed. so we want to be very thoughtful in details we share. but you should think of the transition period as being akin to what we're doing with airport authorities, that we were the incumbent with. so it's things to reduce risk and exposure during the time that we think covid is going to be most prevalent.
and then as william referenced and as was referenced in our press release, the build back of the mag and the build back of the capex schedule is tied to recovery in air traffic, which is a concept that we think would be very constructive to build into future airports contracts. it's something that we're certainly considering as we pursue future ones, just to minimize the uncertainty during times like what just happened. i mean, certainly this has been pretty unprecedented.
in terms of the size, i don't want to anchor you on a particular number, but these are public numbers that result from these kind of contracts. and if you look back in the last couple of years that the current incumbent had the contract, it was in the $60 million, $70 million range. and i certainly think if you predicated on air traffic recovering, you could see it getting back to that sort of level, but i don't even really want to speculate on that, because we don't know the curve of how that recovery is going to happen. but we're certainly very excited about it because we are big believers in new york and we do believe that this will also help us in cross selling other inventory that we have in the region. so we think this is going to be a real positive for the business.
lance vitanza -- cowen -- analyst
okay. great. if i could just get one more question in, this one about radar. i mean, it actually looks really interesting now all the more so given consumers changing travel patterns. but relative to your peers, and really i guess i'm thinking about outfront and decaux. does your radar platform differentiate you, or is it simply table stakes in today's advertising world?
scott wells -- chief executive officer
william, you want me to take this one or?
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
yeah.
scott wells -- chief executive officer
okay. so i've been pretty consistent about this since we started talking about radar that i believe that out-of-home is going to need to deliver the same kind of insight that marketers are able to achieve when they do business with digital partners. it may not be in exactly the same ways, but they're going to need to be able to do the same kind of analytics on roi that they make. radar will have elements to it that are differentiating, just like creative would have elements that are differentiating, or how you do operations would have elements that are differentiating, but the core of what it is, and the ability to deliver insight about audiences, is something that i do believe will be table stakes in time.
and i think the market has been behaving that way. we've seen more and more emphasis on this from the different players. so how we do it, there are things that we can differentiate. we can make the customer experience better. we can be faster on certain things. we can provide more granularity, more functionality, things like that, but the core concept of providing data to do roi analytics is something that i do believe will be table stakes.
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
yeah. let me just add a couple of thoughts on that, lance, if i may, because i think that's right. but i do think -- i don't think we should be unduly modest about the fact that it does give us an advantage in demonstrating to the markets what our inventory can deliver. and specifically, if i can, just for a moment on europe, i would certainly want to congratulate justin cochrane and our team in europe for delivering a very strong performance in q3. but i would also say, i don't think we could have done that without radar in the uk and spain, which really helped us to demonstrate to advertisers that audiences were coming back and was part of our value proposition. so for the moment certainly, it does give us an advantage. medium to long-term, i agree with scott, this will become just table stakes.
lance vitanza -- cowen -- analyst
got it. thanks guys. appreciate it.
operator
our next question comes from the line of ben swinburne of morgan stanley.
ben swinburne -- morgan stanley -- analyst
good morning. a couple of questions, maybe starting scott, if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the us business. you mentioned that national was down more than local. when you look out over the next three months to six months, so you're starting to see the national money come back faster. i know that tends to be more tied to digital, so shorter cycle. just trying to get a flavor of kind of the local versus national outlook, obviously national has pulled faster but in theory could come back quicker.
and i also was just curious, if i think, william, you described the port authority deal as maybe a model. and i think, scott, you just talked about why. are there other major transit opportunities in the us or abroad that you're looking at over the -- during this kind of covid period, which may give you an opportunity to reshape the model and take advantage of -- i mean, and there's only so many port authorities out there, but even if they're smaller scale, do you see other opportunities like this out there to go after?
scott wells -- chief executive officer
sure. so, ben, let me touch on your first part first, the national versus local. you're right that national pulled back much more aggressively and much more quickly and local has been more steady and more stable. and i think, i've talked about this on other calls, but the diversity of performance across our portfolio is vast. if you look at our smallest markets, some of the smaller cities in florida, some of the smaller cities in texas, or in arizona versus the new yorks or san franciscos, it is dramatic, the differences and the main driver of that is because of the national spending pullback.
we did see in q3, some really nice recovery in our digital space, particularly our roadside digital space. and we have been seeing -- i think the big challenge as you think about our business is that it does lay in over time and advertisers are very uncomfortable making future commitments on anything except the most iconic assets. and so our visibility is much lower than what it even is in typical times. and as we get more and more digital, the visibility gets somewhat lower as well. but the things that we're seeing right now in quarter, we are beating comps again, which we had not been doing much of the year.
we are seeing programmatic pickup, and it's been quite robust for us in the last stretch. and it has a lot of features that advertisers really like right now in terms of being able to decide at the very last minute, whether they're committing. and we're seeing that here in q4, i think we're going to have a similar dynamic as we head into q1, everything's going to be booking really late. hopefully, as we see progress on things like the vaccine, i thought the news out of pfizer was really encouraging, as that starts to build, confidence starts to build and you start to get the prerequisite conditions that you need for a full-on ad recovery. but obviously, that's something that we're not in any position to call.
as to your question about other transit contracts, a number of contracts that were anticipated to be coming out, have actually been delayed. i don't think that there are any big ones that are in process right now that -- any major ones. i mean, there's always some smaller markets and things like that. i think the next one in the hopper is the chicago airports and lax will be sometime not too far beyond that, from the kind of transit that we follow. and then you'd be better off with outfront to get the perspective on some way in rail. i don't know, william, if there are any global ones that you'd want to speak to.
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
no. i'd just say, we learn all the time from every contract negotiation that we go through. and certainly, i think we've learned a few things in this one, which we would take forward into future transport contracts, but there's nothing specific on the horizon at the moment.
ben swinburne -- morgan stanley -- analyst
william, can i just ask one follow-up? i don't know if you'd be willing to give it to us, but i thought i'd take a shot. how was europe in october or if you don't want to talk to a number, was it an improvement from kind of the trends you saw through q3? just trying to get a sense of the underlying trends before the lockdowns get back.
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
yeah. i can't look at my lawyers because i'm on my own here in london. so i would say, we were optimistic that we were going to be able to show continued sequential improvement into q4. we had good momentum and october was looking very encouraging to enable us to be able to do that. but the new lockdown, specifically those in france and the uk, kind of made us pause, is what i would say. so it continued to be very encouraging into october is all i think i should say, ben.
ben swinburne -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of aaron watts of deutsche bank.
aaron watts -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi, everyone. thanks for having me on. two questions for me. let me start with one, focus on the us business. as you look at this recovery and specifically volume versus price, can you talk about the dynamic between those two? and if you've had to give some concessions on price, do you see a path for bringing the pricing back up, knowing that historically, that's been the more difficult of the two to kind of push back to normalized levels?
scott wells -- chief executive officer
sure. no, let me address that in a couple of ways. i think, first off, the nature of the downturn that we have right now, isn't fundamentally about price sensitivity. the discomfort that people have in a lot of ways is more about appearing out of step with what's going on in the markets. and so think of that as something that is inhibiting people wanting to commit, particularly to printed campaigns that are several weeks out when you have so much volatility and where the cases are springing up and how governments are reacting to them, things along those lines.
so when you start thinking about volume versus price, the volume hit is really driven by not price elasticity or anything having to do with that. it's much more about terms and it's much more about the ability to go up and down. so, as a result, as we're working through things. i mean, certainly during the times when traffic was down, we were having dialogues about concessions and make goods and things along those lines. as we look to the future and we look to traffic being back, we are striving to not be focused on that element. and i've talked on a number of other earnings calls about how -- what we really measure is yield. and we measure it pretty -- in a pretty segmented way, looking at our assets in terms of our very most in-demand assets, segmenting out into lots of other categories.
and so what you typically see happen in soft periods, is that the demand for the super premium assets remains pretty stable and that even when people will step back, so william referenced this in his comments, that we're in the upfront period for our long-term renewal, things we call perms. even when somebody steps back from a perm, we're almost always able to resell it to somebody else, oftentimes at an attractive rate, because it's just the nature of that type of inventory. and what you see then is that the longer tail of our assets are where the dynamic is tougher as it plays through.
so, i'm not going to call how yield is going to evolve over the next year, because i don't really know how the virus is going to evolve, and we've seen how much of an impact it's had on the business. but i do believe that our ability to optimize yield and our ability to work constructively with our advertisers to create compelling value propositions, remains that we're going to be able to recover things pretty well. hopefully, that answers your question as best i can.
aaron watts -- deutsche bank -- analyst
no. that's helpful context. thank you for that. and my second question is on the cost side, and i'm hoping you can frame up a little bit more how to think about the fourth quarter and maybe even the first quarter cost base levels, given the cost actions you put in place, but also some of the ebbs and flows of the arrangements you made with landlords, whether it's in europe or here in the us, and how those costs may ebb and flow with -- as time moves forward, and the recovery moves on. should fourth quarter costs look somewhat similar to third quarter costs? i guess is another way to put it.
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer
well, it's -- i would break it into kind of two categories. one are the costs that are not really tied to revenues. they're the ones we control. we have provided some information about what we expect to take out on an annualized basis. and you should see some of that begin to occur. we started latin america very early. they're almost completed. europe and americas are working on their plans now. we'd expect americas to be done over the next quarter. europe are operating a lot of different countries and cost reduction initiatives take a little longer. we expect to complete those in 2021 and that's really cost out of the business.
with respect to other costs and particularly our largest category, our lease expense and the abatements and the deferrals that we've negotiated with counterparties, that is -- has had a big impact. we've been very successful. we've talked about the level of relief that we've gotten on our lease expense, that we expect to get some of that-continue some of that through the end of the year, and we'll continue to do what we can to negotiate continued relief and deferrals as appropriate. so that being said, that is really going to come back as revenue starts to come back. and so as we see improvement in the underlying business, obviously both the relief that we've gotten and future relief that we may get, will start to dissipate.
deferrals will start to come due and we'll start to see some of that likely in fourth quarter. and it will continue as revenue comes back. so, i don't have specific numbers on that, and i think that's still to be determined. what i would convey, aaron, is our operators are very involved in working with counterparties on the leasing side to make sure that we're aligned and capturing all the benefits that we can in the current environment. but as revenues return you should expect those costs to come back.
aaron watts -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. very helpful, guys. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of kannan venkarteshwar of barclays.
kannan venkarteshwar -- barclays -- analyst
thank you. i guess just following up on that comment, when you think about your costs coming back, should we think about them as being proportionate to revenues? in other words, because some of these are deferments on abatements, i would assume that as revenues come back, some of the concessions you've given may basically come back on a larger scale as costs. and therefore when you think about cash flows last year, i guess the unlevered number was roughly about $300 million odd if i'm not wrong, but that includes china. so what period should we expect that number to come back over? is it two years, three years because my guess is, the operating leverage is probably going to cut the opposite way for some time as revenues come back. and so it may not be a linear path back to the same level of cash flow. so some color around that would be useful. thank you.
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer
well, i'll address it at a high level, and then if william or scott want to dig in a little deeper on what they're seeing from the operating side, i'll turn it over to them. i think that the way you're thinking about it is the way we're thinking about it. and what i mean by that is, as revenues come back certainly some of the relief we've gotten the lease expense is a big category, it'll come back. it'll be difficult to predict what format it takes, how long that will take, how that is proportionately tied to revenue.
but i think we should anticipate that. it's not a linear recovery on the cost side because these could come back rapidly, but that's a good thing. that means that our underlying business is coming back. our revenues are increasing, and ultimately, we'll get to the point where this will approach pre-covid levels or over time exceed pre-covid levels.
when that will occur, who knows? i think that we've got large -- i think that we are anticipating being back to free cash flow neutral during 2021, with large interest payments in q1 and q3 that is likely toward the end of 2021. but that's based on a recovery curve that may or may not come to fruition. so i think it's a challenge really to predict how all this will unfold. what we saw in q3 was resiliency in the business.
as the audience came back, we saw the advertisers come back. that was particularly acute in europe. of course, europe had a lot more to come back from. we saw positive momentum, but at least in europe, we've paused because of the new restrictions. it really depends, i think, on how the recovery plays out, but i do think we're well positioned in terms of liquidity, that we have a runway, and we see a path to recovery in 2021. so i don't know william or scott, if you had anything to add, but that's kind of at a high level, the way that i would think about this question.
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
scott, do you want to add anything from the us on the cost side?
scott wells -- chief executive officer
i mean, i think the only other thing i'd emphasize, and we've said this before, is that these dialogues are ongoing dialogues. they're dialogue that -- just because we got a concession in q2, doesn't mean we won't get a concession in q3 or q4 or q1. and some of these things, because -- particularly the municipal oriented or the ones that are related with a governmental agency, take a long time to work through the approval process. and so, you will probably see some lumpiness in savings that flow through over the next couple of quarters, which may actually relate back to prior quarters. it's not going to be a huge number, but the point for you to take on this is that these conversations are ongoing and they are lumpy as you get agreements.
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah. and just to finish on this, i mean, i echo scott's point about the lumpiness. you'll certainly see that in the european piece as well, in terms of some of the renegotiations on contracts. but i think, in terms of your kind of broader question, does all of the cost kind of come back once the market comes back? i think the answer to that is, some of it does, but a lot of it doesn't. i think one of the things about a major disruption like covid, has obviously been, is it does force everybody to look very hard at their business and at the way they operate, and looking for efficiencies in the way they're operating. and some of the restructuring, some of the headcount reduction, we would absolutely expect that to remain once revenues return. so i don't know whether that helps with anybody's model, but i do think that's an important point to add.
kannan venkarteshwar -- barclays -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then, if i could just follow up on the port authority contract, given that the structure is linked to covid and the path of revenues going forward. what does the breakeven period look like relative to maybe other comparable contracts? does the cash flow breakeven also take longer relative to other contracts, or is it comparable when you think about this particular contract? thanks.
scott wells -- chief executive officer
so it's different in some ways, but the outcome will likely not be wildly different. if you think about our typical deployment in a typical environment, we are actually very focused on deploying the capital as fast as we possibly can because that's how you drive growth in the revenue base of the contract. in this case, we're going to be a little bit more methodical. we're going to partner very closely with the port on our joint priorities for the build-out, but we're not going to be going flat out because of the nature of the environment that we're in right now. and so that probably will add a little bit of time to the cash flow breakeven, but it's really hard to give you an answer on that, not knowing exactly how long the travel levels stay depressed. but we do feel very good about the protections that we've got built in and the partnership that we've got lined up here to manage things.
kannan venkarteshwar -- barclays -- analyst
got it. thank you so much, guys.
operator
our next question comes from the line of jason bazinet of citi.
jason bazinet -- citi -- analyst
thanks. i hate to go back to this cost question, but maybe i can try and ask it this way. maybe in simple terms, can you just give us a sense of the fixed portion of your cost basis, let's say in '19 and where you think that will be in '20 as a percentage of total expenses? and then if a dollar of incremental revenue comes in, how much will flow to ebitda based on whatever access you think is most useful, whether it's a geographic split or whether it's billboard versus transit street furniture? just some simple rules of thumb i think would be quite helpful. thanks.
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer
william, did you want me to try to respond to that?
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
yeah, go brian. yeah.
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer
okay. thank you. yes. let me hit the cost question first. i think we've given some commentary pre-covid and maybe post-covid about what our cost structure looks like, the amount that's fixed. at the end of the day, the largest portion of our expense is site lease. and i think we've talked about around half of that -- the site lease being half of our operating expense and close to half of that being fixed. and so, post-covid you're in this environment where you're attacking that because of the revenue decline.
and i do think that we've talked about the success we've had, but also that coming back potentially as revenue comes back. there could be timing, as scott mentioned, there's lumpiness, but our largest expense is partially fixed, we have a large fixed space. and so that kind of leads to the next part of your question, and in that, as revenues come back, what is the incremental drop to the bottom line. and in the past, we've talked about the operating leverage of business. and i think in a normalized environment, there's a significant amount of each incremental baller [phonetic] that know falls to the bottom line and so we work very hard to drive revenue.
i think between where we are today and where we will be say, good to get to a normalized level. we've got some interesting things going on and that is that rule of thumb where the revenue -- the additional dollar revenue proportionally, the more you bring in, the greater amount falls to the bottom line, because of your fixed space, but that doesn't really play out. in this interim time, the incremental dollar revenue is great, but then you'll have some of these fixed costs come back as the abatements that we've previously had, roll off. i don't think there is a rule of thumb in this time period. i think, from an operating perspective, we'll continue to negotiate with our counterparties to make sure that our lease costs are aligned.
from a business perspective, we'll look for opportunities to continue to right size the business. and we've talked about that at some length, and we'll continue to drive revenue, because it will benefit the business. and when we get back to that normalized environment where we have strong positive operating leverage that will be a good place to be. i don't know, i can't predict when it will be, but we've seen positive signs in q3. i think fundamentally, what i'd want to say, jason, is the underlying assets have proven themselves to be very resilient, and we would expect that to continue as audiences come back and as advertisers come back.
jason bazinet -- citi -- analyst
okay. thank you, brian.
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah.
operator
our next question comes from the line of stephan bisson of wolfe research.
stephan bisson -- wolfe research -- analyst
good morning. i was hoping you might be able to give us a little bit of color on how audience trends and revenue trends seem to correlate and what types of conditions led certain markets to actually outperform their 2019 levels?
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, it's not a -- thanks, stephen. it's not an exact correlation, but clearly if advertisers sense that there's nobody out there looking at our boards, then they're less likely to support the medium. and once they see traffic returning, we have seen a very strong sense that advertisers have come back. and with the increasing flexibility of our medium, we've seen it -- us be able to exploit the benefits of digital and so on, as we've said. so there is clearly a relationship, but there are factors too.
and i would say, the other biggest factor is going to be the kind of macroeconomic environment, consumer confidence in relation to that consumer confidence tends to lead to advertiser confidence. and we've seen -- we see markets respond to that as well. so i think those are the main drivers that we see for revenue. and as i said in answer to an earlier question, i think what's encouraging is that we have seen a pretty sharp snapback as those audiences have returned. we're clearly cautious at the moment because we've seen some further restrictions, but we'll obviously be monitoring that closely in the us and in europe in the coming weeks. so i think that's what i would say at the moment.
stephan bisson -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. and then on the second part of the question, did you see any kinds of conditions that permeated in those markets that did outperform 2019 levels during the third quarter?
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
i think they were -- they tended to be the markets where the restrictions had been well observed and where governments were clearly responding quickly to the pandemic. so switzerland in europe was the first market that we saw the recovery come back. i think i spoke about this even on our last quarterly call. and they -- that was a country where the restrictions were quickly imposed. they were then well observed, and then they were lifted and spending came back very quickly. i think where we've seen perhaps slower recovery is where there's been less compliance with the restrictions and a higher and prolonged rate of infection.
scott wells -- chief executive officer
william, the other thing i think might be interesting to think about is, our asset base, the countries that we perform well in, we have a low transit exposure, particularly in europe. i think it's around 10%. in the americas, it's around 17%, largely airport. so in places where we have street level assets proportionally larger than the competitors, we've performed very well. also i think where we've had digitization of the street level assets, it's been very beneficial. so i think those are two other things i'd point out.
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, you're absolutely right, brian, that certainly the high proportion of digital has made a big difference in some of those european markets. so the quick snapback in europe, we saw digital reach nearly close to 70% in the third quarter. and that is because its flexibility enabled advertisers to come very, very quickly into the medium. certainly, true.
stephan bisson -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. thanks so much.
operator
and ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question. our final question will come from jim goss of barrington research.
jim goss -- barrington research -- analyst
thank you. i wanted to ask a little bit more about the new york airport installations. could you talk about the blend of information advertising and entertainment that might be used over the systems and whether the airports would interconnect, say would you have information on flights at laguardia and the kennedy displays, in case there were tie-ups or something of that nature? and if this might set a template for other airport installations you either have or intend to make bids on, including say chicago and lax.
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
scott?
scott wells -- chief executive officer
sure. so the exact architecture of how we're going to handle information, i mean, every airport contract has an element of that, and this one has a robust set of things in terms of communicating within airport about dynamics that are going on. i don't actually know off the top of my head if the plan is to show flight information from different airports across the field. so that's one i'd actually have to look into. but there will definitely be wayfinding information. there'll be information about things that are happening within the airport, different information that the port is looking to share with the people passing through the port authority airports will be part of it.
when i think about this as a template for future airports, the digitization and the ability to integrate the digitization across the airport is something that i think we'll continue to see. i think some of the contract elements in terms of anticipating movements in the audience levels is something that we'll be looking to add in future contracts. but i don't actually -- it's a good question and i hadn't thought about the cross-airport communication.
jim goss -- barrington research -- analyst
okay. maybe one last one and you don't have to get too much into it, but you seemed -- for the commentary about the pfizer announcement of the vaccine was somewhat muted in terms of, i guess, more of a wait and see is how it would affect your business? do you think -- should we be cautious about how we think it will flow back into your ability to develop an audience, sell ads, that sort of thing? or do you -- are you optimistic that the turnaround could be very quick and therefore benefit from the constrained cost structure you've described?
scott wells -- chief executive officer
yes.
eileen mclaughlin -- vice president, investor relations
so i'm hugely optimistic. do you want me to take it, scott, in general? because i think that's across the world. i'm hugely optimistic. if the vaccine proves to be as effective as the claims are coming out, then i'm absolutely optimistic that our audiences will enthusiastically return to the streets, and advertisers will enthusiastically return to our medium. and i think we have real evidence that they do come back, but i'm not an epidemiologist.
i'm not an expert on vaccines, and i haven't seen the detail of the clinical trials, and i believe there's more -- there's at least another month of trials needed before we get widespread use of the vaccine, but i'm positively disposed. i'm highly optimistic. and if they can come good with it, then even before -- we could see december coming back, because confidence will return so quickly. and certainly we'd see that going into q1.
i mean, i think the one thing i would take seriously and importantly on this development is that i think things will move very quickly once the evidence is there. i think take-up will be very quick. and i think reaction from -- in terms of confidence and enthusiasm will similarly be very fast. but as of this moment, on this day, on the november 9, i think it's too early to call that, frankly.
jim goss -- barrington research -- analyst
all right. well, i'm not an epidemiologist either, but they said the efficacy rate was over 90%, which is on a par with small pox and measles. so...
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
i'll take that, definitely.
jim goss -- barrington research -- analyst
flu is 40% to 60%. so this sounds pretty good. thank you very much.
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, if we -- yes, absolutely. so, thank you and thank you everybody for joining our call, and, i'm delighted to end on such an optimistic and positive note. i would just end by saying, i think we're very proud of what we delivered in q3. we have some bumps and some lumpiness ahead of us in the next few weeks, but we are absolutely optimistic about 2021. and we look forward to keeping you updated with developments in the business in the coming months. and thanks everybody for your support and your interest. thank you.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. welcome to the 2020 third quarter earnings conference call for clear channel outdoor holdings inc. [operator instructions]
i'll now turn the conference over to your host, eileen mclaughlin, vice president, investor relations. please go ahead.
eileen mclaughlin -- vice president, investor relations
good morning and thank you for joining clear channel outdoor holdings' 2020 third quarter earnings call. on the call today are william eccleshare, chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor holdings, inc.; and brian coleman, chief financial officer of clear channel outdoor holdings, inc., who will provide an overview of the third quarter 2020 operating performance of clear channel outdoor holdings, inc., and clear channel international, b.v. after an introduction and a review of our results, we'll open up the line for questions. and scott wells, chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas, will participate in the q&a portion of the call.
before we begin, i'd like to remind everyone that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. these statements include management's expectations, beliefs and projections about performance and represents management's current beliefs. there could be no assurance that management's expectations, beliefs or projections will be achieved or that actual results will not differ from expectations. please review the statements of risks contained in our earnings press releases and filings with the sec.

please note that our earnings release and the slide presentation are also available on our website, and are integral to our earnings conference call. they provide a detailed breakdown of foreign exchange and non-cash compensation expense items as well as segment revenues and adjusted ebitda, among other important information. for that reason, we ask that you view each slide as william and brian comment on them. also, please note that the information provided on this call speaks only to management's views as of today, november 9, 2020, and may no longer be accurate at the time of a replay.
with that, please turn to page 3 in the presentation, and i will now turn the call over to william eccleshare.
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
good morning, everyone and thank you for taking the time to join today's call. this is our third quarter conducting the call remotely. and once again, we ask that you bear with us in case there are any technical issues during the call. it has certainly been an unprecedented year for many of us and like you, i'm sure we continue to feel the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business. but in the past quarter, we've also seen how robust our business is and how strongly it recovers as and when some kind of normality returns. we delivered better than expected consolidated revenue in the third quarter with reported revenue down 32% compared to the prior year, a substantial improvement compared to the 55% decline we reported in the second quarter.
excluding china and fx, the decline would have been 27% better than the low 30% decline guidance we have provided in early august. our performance in europe was better than anticipated and well demonstrated the resilience of our medium. as audiences returned to the streets, our advertisers returned to our medium. us performance also showed sequential improvement and was in line with our expectations. at the same time, we continue to implement initiatives to align our operating expense base with revenues. brian will expand on our cost saving accomplishments in more detail later in the presentation.
as a whole and in the context of the pandemic, the results in the third quarter, especially in europe were certainly encouraging. we are continuing to leverage our investments in digital screens, in technology and in our footprint to manage through the crisis and ensure we have the flexibility to deal with the uncertainty as governments across all our markets deal with the ongoing challenges of covid-19. our focus on continued investment for long-term growth is well as demonstrated by the recent announcement of our winning the contract for the rights to advertise in the new york and new jersey airports. we are proud and excited to have won this significant tender and i congratulate scott wells and his team in securing it. i'll talk later in more detail about the contract and our confidence in its value to our business.
now as we look ahead, based on the information we have as of today, we expect a slight sequential improvement in the americas revenue and adjusted ebitda margin in the fourth quarter. however, we are not able to provide fourth quarter guidance for our european segment. the recent mobility restrictions in our european markets, most notably in the uk and france in the past 10 days have created volatility in customer booking activity significantly limiting our visibility. before moving on, i want to take this opportunity to highlight and thank our employees for the amazing resilience and tremendous discipline they've shown this quarter and since the pandemic started to impact us in march. i'm proud of the incredible work our team has done and continues to do to reinforce our solid foundation and drive operational efficiencies in the face of rapidly changing business conditions.
moving on, i'll provide an overview of our business, the current environment and views on where we see the out-of-home market going from here. so please turn to page 4. in the americas segment, year-over-year revenue was down 32% in the quarter, which is an improvement compared to the 39% decline reported in the second quarter. our americas business is centered around the top 20 markets, which contributed to the significant growth we were delivering up to and including the first quarter of this year prior to covid-19. however, even though our audience levels are returning to normal, the largest markets in the top 20 are those most impacted by advertisers pulling back on our out-of-home spending, especially on the east and west coast, where national advertisers are most likely to be focused.
please turn to page 5. europe supported revenue was down 13% against prior year and excluding foreign exchange adjustment was down 18%, which as i noted at the beginning of my remarks is a substantial improvement compared to the 62% decline we saw in the second quarter. the improvement in digital, which accounts for approximately 30% of european revenue and declined 17% excluding fx impact was even larger due to the speed at which advertisers were able to launch campaigns as business quickly returned once lockdowns were eased.
as i've stated in the past, our investment in digital is a key component of our strategy. our digital network is a dynamic medium, which enables our advertisers to engage in real time, tactical, contextual and flexible advertising. i'd call out the strength of our sales team across europe, we've done an excellent job responding with agility. as markets opened up, our audiences were moving around again and advertiser interest returned. we also benefited from our strategic focus on roadside locations, which historically account for about two-thirds of our total european revenue and are far less affected by covid-19 driven restrictions than the transit environment which account for approximately 10% of our european revenue. our uk business was a great example of this, where about 80% of revenue is historically from roadside inventory. since mid-july, up until the recent announcements of new restrictions, our customer booking activity actually exceeded bookings made in the same period last year.
moving on to page 6, and the americas business. with the outlook in the americas improving, we remain cautiously optimistic for the near term. our longer-term focus remains on returning to growth, which we believe we can achieve in 2021. as we enter the fourth quarter, our visibility remains limited. however, we have shifted from playing defense to playing offense, leveraging the investments we've made, and continuing to make in technology. even with the uncertainty created by the recent covid-19 spikes, we believe our organization is in a stronger position to manage through the instability in the market. in light of that instability, we have expanded our client direct selling initiatives. our focus is on selling creative ideas as opposed to specific billboard locations. as advertisers work to realign their advertising campaigns, we have found that cmo's are more willing to jump on a zoom call to hear a great idea. our ability to get a foot in the door is improving all the time.
we continue to demonstrate to advertisers how our radar suite of solutions can help us help them. the audience levels are returning to normal, but travel patterns have changed. audiences are spending more time close to home and less time in city centers, but they're still out and about. with radar, we're able to quickly to adjust to these new travel patterns to help our customers understand the best inventory and roadways on which to reach their customers, we target those customers via our mobile ad and measure the success of the campaign. more specifically, in the fourth quarter, we are seeing continued sequential improvements in our business.
for the first time since march, we've beaten comps in the number of weeks so far this quarter. in our national business, the number of rfps is improving and is close to 2019 levels. local continues to improve and we are seeing continued strength in our perm [phonetic] inventory. we're currently in the renewal season and most are keeping their locations. that said, we are still waiting for more data to better understand the strength of the holiday season relative to previous years as advertisers continue to delay buying decisions. our largest category business services is holding up well, and is performing at levels equal to last year. we are seeing increases in beverages, with the continued weaknesses in amusements and entertainment. additionally, our revenue generated by our programmatic platform has rebounded faster than the rest of our business, although programmatic is still a small percentage of total revenue.
moving on to page 7 for a review of the americas technology initiatives and new contracts. during this past quarter, we continue to invest in technology and our digital footprint in america. we added 19 new digital billboards this quarter for a total of 57 new digital billboards this year, giving us a total of more than 1,400 digital billboards. we also partnered with tremor video to enhance our radar offering, which now provides advertisers a coordinated out-of-home and all screen video solution that seamlessly extends into tv, digital or social video campaigns that reach consumers when and where they're ready to engage with brands. this is just the latest of enhancements to the radar suite, and we expect to continue to add customer friendly capabilities to radar in the coming months.
in addition, our data analytics capabilities expanded with our recently announced rollout of a new audience impressions methodology for airport adverstising, developed in partnership with the industry measurement body geopath, this innovation provides advertisers a more precise understanding of consumers advertising journeys and behaviors as they traverse airports. the new methodology marks a shift from measuring campaign fully based on passenger count toward a more robust understanding of audience behavior and consumers' likelihood are being exposed to advertising in airports, using the same geopath data that is used to measure audiences in the traditional roadside out-of-home sector. the data will become available to advertisers through geopath as well as through radar.
as i mentioned at the start, we are also delighted that the port authority of new york and new jersey board has awarded us the largest airport advertising contract in the us to transform jfk, laguardia, newark and stewart airports into world-class digital media platforms. this is a landmark win for us and demonstrates our confidence in the underlying fundamentals of our business and our focus on long-term profitable growth opportunities beyond the temporary impact of the pandemic. the contract is for 12 years and is contingent upon execution by both parties, which we expect to occur in mid-november. we anticipate the contract will go into effect december 30, 2020.
we worked with the port authority to align our interests with contract terms that set the stage for both parties to achieve their goals under the current conditions and for years to come and it has the potential to become the new industry model. the deal contains a two-year transition period to account for the impact of covid-19 and the traffic recovery at port authority airport. the actual mag due each year, as well as capex spend after the two-year transition period will be dependent upon total passenger traffic.
the port authority of new york and new jersey airports are gateways to the world. and as the region and travel recover, we believe our team is best used to lead its historic transformation. with the addition of these high-value marquee airport assets to our footprint, brands will have the unique one-stop shop ability to execute campaigns that reach consumers as they drive, walk or fly throughout at the new york and new jersey metro area.
moving on to page 8. in europe, where we are seeing a range of performances within our markets due to the resurgence of covid-19 cases. as i noted earlier, historically about two-thirds of our revenue in the region is generated by our roadside displays. in october, we continue to see strength in our street furniture and billboard inventory, given the audiences were still on the street. in contrast to continued weakness in transit, our largest categories fmcg and retail improved sequentially. in addition, fashion and beauty are benefiting from the holiday season. however, our visibility into november and december has been impacted by the spike in new cases and new restrictions, which have led some advertisers to pause their activity.
of course, we are keenly aware of the recent developments around the second wave of covid-19 in europe and we are monitoring these closely. while the new restrictions and the uncertain environment will impact our business in the near term, they are not expected to last as long nor are they as limiting in terms of movement as those we saw back in march and april. as a result, we believe the second wave will have a much smaller impact on revenue in the fourth quarter than it did in the second quarter. more importantly, the resilience of the business is clear. when audiences return, out-of-home business comes back strongly. and as i said earlier, in the uk and elsewhere, we've seen booking equal or better to the prior year in many weeks during the past quarter.
turning to our european technology investments on page 9. in europe, we continue to help brands navigate the audience and environmental impact of changing covid-19 restrictions through the application of smart data. for example, the uk's return audience hub has become a go-to planning portal for advertisers. as i mentioned last quarter, the hub monitors a huge anonymized mobile data set to learn and openly share how the portfolio is delivering audiences compared to pre-lockdown levels.
clear channel radar is now operational in both spain and the uk and has further strengthened our ability to help brands engage audiences effectively as mobility patterns evolve. we are seeing early benefits from our implementation of radar. for example, in spain, we've booked campaigns for pepsico using proximity to stores and more targeted audience demographic and behavioral data being able to respond to new audience behaviors and mobility patterns through the changes we are seeing as a result of covid-19. we continue to expand our digital footprint this year, adding 383 digital displays in the third quarter and 699 year-to-date for a total of over 15,000 screens now live.
as we continue to expand our digital reach across european cities, we are well positioned to deliver increased flexibility and enhanced contextual relevance at scale, improving our abilities in the brands' needs. this is evidenced by the improving digital revenue trend in the third quarter. throughout our digital transformation, we are committed to making clear channel inventory more accessible to both new and existing advertisers. as in the us, we are developing our programmatic capabilities at an increased pace while securing and expanding partnerships with a number of the leading supply side platform partners.
most recently, in spain, we successfully ran our first fully programmatic campaign to car brand cupra in partnership with ssp broadsign reach. broadsign reach is already live across holland and switzerland. in the uk, we just announced the new programmatic partnership with ssp high stack. across clear channel outdoor, we strive to create products and provide services that excite and engage our consumers, communities, advertisers and business partners. as a result, we believe we are well positioned to return to growth in 2021. at the same time, we recognize the pressures of the current environment and we will continue to take steps to preserve liquidity, including balancing the need to defer capital expenditures, and reduce costs while still investing in strengthening our platform.
now i'd like to turn it over to brian to discuss our third quarter 2020 financial results.
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, william. good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call today. please turn to page 10. before i review our third quarter results, i want to remind you that during our gaap results discussion, i'll also talk about our results adjusting for foreign exchange, which is a non-gaap financial measure. we believe this improves the comparability of our results to the prior year. additionally, as you know, we tendered our shares in clear media on april 28, and therefore our q3 results in 2020 do not include clear media. however, our results in q3 of 2019 did include clear media's results.
consolidated revenue for the quarter decreased 31.5% from last year to $448 million. adjusting for foreign exchange, it was down 33.1%. if you exclude china and adjusted for foreign exchange, the decline in revenue was 27%, which was better than the low 30% decline we had projected in early august. our better than expected results are due to a stronger than anticipated rebound in europe. consolidated net loss declined $77 million to $136 million in the third quarter of 2020 as compared to $212 million in the third quarter of 2019. adjusted ebitda was $31 million in the quarter, down 78.4% and excluding fx, was down 78.9%.
now on to page 11 to discuss the americas results. the americas revenue was down 31.8% during the third quarter from $328 million in 2019 to $224 million. as william mentioned, this is an improvement over the second quarter results, which were down 39%. revenue declines and national and local, as well as digital, improved relative to the second quarter, while the decline in airports increased. in general, our airport inventory is considered premium space. so while advertisers did not immediately reduce the airport advertising campaigns in the beginning of the second quarter, they began pulling ads in the back half of the quarter, and into the third quarter. local, which accounted for 64% of revenue was down 27.6%, and national, which accounted for 36% of revenue was down 38.2%.
digital accounted for 30% of revenue and was down 34.8%. this compares to a 53.7% decline in the second quarter. our long-term contracts for print large format billboard, which we refer to as perms, continue to hold up well, even though total print ad revenue was down. both direct expenses and sg&a were down 19% in the quarter, primarily due to lower site lease expenses and lower compensation costs, as a result of the decline in revenue and cost reduction initiatives. adjusted ebitda was $71 million, down 48% from the prior year. as we have stated in the past, our business is a high fixed cost business, and although we are working on reducing expenses throughout the organization, the decline in revenue resulted in a larger reduction in adjusted ebitda.
please move on to page 12 to review europe. europe revenue was down 13.4%. excluding foreign exchange revenue, was down 17.9% in the third quarter. this is a substantial improvement from the 62% decline reported in the second quarter, with all markets contributing to the improvement. france was up in the quarter due to the new paris street furniture contract in addition to a partial rebound in the underlying market. digital revenue accounted for 30% of total revenue that was down 16.6%, excluding fx, slightly less than the overall decline. adjusted direct operating expenses and sg&a expenses were down 8.9%. the decline is due to lower site lease expense, in addition to lower compensation expense, primarily related to the decline in revenue, in addition to cost reduction efforts.
adjusted ebitda was a loss of $8 million, due to the decline in revenue and high fixed cost base. in august, we issued senior secured notes through our indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, clear channel international bv, which we refer to as cci b.v. net proceeds from the note offering provides incremental liquidity for our operations. our european segment consists of the businesses operated by cci b.v. and its consolidated subsidiaries. accordingly, the revenue for our europe segment is the revenue for cci b.v. europe segment adjusted ebitda does not include an allocation of cci b.v.'s corporate expenses that are deducted from cci b.v.'s operating income and adjusted ebitda.
as i just discussed, europe and cci b.v. revenue decreased $34 million during the third quarter of 2020, compared to the same period of 2019, $217 million. after adjusting for an $11 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, europe and cci b.v. revenue decreased $45 million. cci b.v. operating loss was $38 million in the third quarter of 2020, compared to operating loss of $16 million in the same period of 2019.
on to page 13 for a quick review of other. our other segment includes latin america and clear media. the 2019 results include clear media, which was sold in q2 of 2020. latin america revenue was $7 million in the third quarter, down $15 million from the prior year. the spike in covid-19 in latin america started later in the year, and it is taking longer to control the spread of the virus in latin america. direct operating expenses and sg&a were $13 million in the third quarter, down $4 million from the prior year. adjusted ebitda was a loss in the quarter.
now on to page 14 to discuss capex. capital expenditures totaled $26 million in the third quarter, down $34 million from the prior year, as we proactively reduced our capital spend to preserve liquidity and sold our stake in clear media. even with this substantial reduction, we did continue to invest in digital in key locations with 19 new digital billboards in the us, and 383 new digital displays in europe.
please move to page 15. clear channel outdoor's consolidated cash and cash equivalents, as of september 30, 2020, totaled $845 million, including $417 million of cash held outside the us by our subsidiaries. during the third quarter, we transferred a portion of the proceeds from the sale of clear media to the us. our debt was $5.6 billion, an increase of just over $500 million during the year, as a result of our drawing on our cash flow revolver at the end of march, and issuing the cci b.v. notes in august. cash paid for interest on the debt during the third quarter was $147 million, up slightly from the prior year, due to the timing of interest payments, partially offset by lower interest rates. the company anticipates having approximately $21 million of cash interest payments in the fourth quarter of 2020, and $350 million in 2021, including the interest on the new cci b.v. secure notes, with the first interest payment in april of 2021.
moving on to page 16. as william touched upon, we continue to focus on managing our cost base and strengthening our liquidity and financial flexibility, while driving improvements in the top line trends that will return the business to its pre-covid trajectory. this includes our proactive steps to right-size the business. in addition to the temporary cost saving plans we enacted in the second quarter, we've also initiated restructuring plans throughout the company. plans are expected to generate annualized pre-tax savings of approximately $32 million upon completion, with total charges for the plans in the range of $23 million to $26 million to achieve these savings.
while we remain confident the business will return to pre-covid levels, we still don't have the visibility yet on timing. given the uncertainty, we felt it was prudent to take the appropriate steps to work to align the cost base with the current business environment. additionally, during the third quarter, as previously discussed, we issued $375 million in senior secured notes in august through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary cci b.v. we continue our site lease contract negotiations with landlords and municipalities to better align fixed site lease expenses, with reductions in revenues. we generated rent abatements of $24 million during the third quarter and $53 million year-to-date.
we continue to benefit from compensation cost reductions through actions enacted in the second quarter, the majority of which are temporary. we obtained european government support and wage subsidies of $7 million in the third quarter and $15 million year-to-date. we eliminated and reduced certain discretionary expenses. we deferred capital expenditures, as i just mentioned, and we deferred site lease expenses and other payments to optimize working capital levels. from a liquidity standpoint given what we know today, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity, including the $845 million of cash at the quarter end, to fund the needs of the business as the economy and our business recover.
please move to page 17. as william mentioned, in the americas, we expect to see a slight improvement on a sequential basis in revenue and adjusted ebitda margin. in europe, we saw a strong sequential improvement in the third quarter. however, our visibility in the fourth quarter has been impacted by the recent mobility restrictions put in place in some of our largest european markets, most notably in the uk and france. these restrictions have created volatility in customer booking activity, significantly limiting our visibility and ability to provide guidance.
and now, please turn to page 18 and let me turn the call back over to william for his closing remarks.
william eccleshare -- worldwide chief executive officer
thank you, brian. as i mentioned, our team continues to work exceptionally hard through the challenging environment and we are seeing the results of our efforts. we're encouraged by the way we've seen advertisers return to our inventory in the last quarter, demonstrating the resilience of our medium and the value of our locations. they're benefiting from our continued investments in technology and expansion of our digital footprint and are proud of securing new contracts most especially winning the new york and new jersey port authority airports. we remain focused on the strong, medium, and long-term opportunities within our sector and are confident clear channel is well positioned to capitalize on these improving trends.
as i conclude my remarks, i want to reiterate a few things. first, as brian mentioned, the actions we took earlier in the year give us what we believe to be sufficient liquidity to manage through the pandemic, even with the spikes we've seen in the us and europe. second, we will continue to identify both temporary and permanent costs reductions to better align our expenses with the current economic environment and expand on our restructuring plans. third, in the third quarter, we delivered better than expected results, with a strong rebound in europe demonstrating the underlying resilience of our business.
in recent weeks, in both some european markets and the us, we have at times equaled or bettered prior year performance. when infection rates decline and restrictions are lifted and our audience return, our markets come back. looking ahead, the course of the pandemic is still unclear with the second wave in europe and continued uncertainty in the us. although, we expect the next few quarters to remain challenging, we believe in the underlying fundamentals of our industry and our business. as both brian and i said, given the resilience of our team, investments in our business, and strength of our platform, we expect to deliver a slight sequential improvement in americas revenue and adjusted ebitda margin in the fourth quarter. we are not providing fourth quarter guidance for europe, given the recent mobility restrictions creating significant volatility in our booking activity. however, we remain cautiously optimistic that we will return to growth in 2021.
lastly, as we've stated before, we always remain open to dispositions and opportunities that accelerate our path to creating enhanced value for shareholders. however, given the current economic environment, our focus remains on continuing to own, operate and enhance the value of the current portfolio of assets in order to drive shareholder value as the economies rebound. i look forward to providing updates regarding our progress.
and now scott will join brian and myself in taking your questions. operator?

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of steven cahall of wells fargo.
steven cahall -- wells fargo -- analyst
thanks. maybe first william, you talked a lot about digital sales and programmatic, we've seen digital pricing bounce back in a couple of other advertising mediums. i was wondering if you're seeing any of that yet, digital revenue was down in the quarter, but any canaries in the coal mine yet on that side of the business?
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, steve. i mean it depends as always where you look, in europe, we've seen a very strong performance, by digital and pricing certainly remaining strong. in the uk, as i said on earlier q4, we saw 70% of our revenues coming from digital. in the us it's a slightly different picture because as you know it's a very different format for digital and i'll just ask scott to kind of touch on what we're seeing in digital in the us to be a comprehensive answer there.
scott wells -- chief executive officer, americas
yes, thanks, william. i think, steve, if you look in our notes as we break out some of our numbers on digital, you'll see that digital performance improved 1.500 basis points q4 over q3. and i think i can comfortably say we had our best programmatic quarter ever in q4. so we do see it recovering. i think q1 we have a really tough comp and that will probably -- will probably be flattish to a little worse off than the performance that you see for q4, but there is definitely recovery coming in that area and we're definitely seeing improved demand. but the drag overall on our digital does come from our airport segment, which has had a tougher run of it. i'm sure we'll get into that as we talk about segments later on.
steven cahall -- wells fargo -- analyst
yes. and then maybe just turning to margins, incremental margins were really strong in the quarter. how do we think about the fixed-site lease savings, will those continue as revenue returns? are those structural or are those variable?
brian coleman -- chief financial officer
well, there is -- hey steve, this is brian. there is a little bit of both. i think to the extent that we've achieved abatements and concessions or altered the underlying contracts, then those should be expected to continue. but there is a significant amount of what i'd call deferred rent, and as revenues start to return those deferred rent expense will start to be paid. and you can see that as you look at our recruiting expense line, rent expense has gone up. the accrued expense has gone up associated with those deferred rents. i think the best way to answer your question is as follows, the team continues to work very diligently on getting rent abatements, we continue to defer payments during this challenging times. we had a lot of success throughout the year in the quarter, fourth quarter we had $28 million of rent abatements and had brought the year-to-date total as of december 30th to $78 million. so, a lot of success on that front, both in the europe and the americas divisions. but there is also kind of a whole deferred rent side, that's important from a liquidity management standpoint to reflect it in our working capital, but as revenues start to return, we do expect to make those rent payments and it will start to reverse kind of in the working capital plan.
steven cahall -- wells fargo -- analyst
yes. and then last one from me, brian. what would make you comfortable enough to start paying down the revolver?
brian coleman -- chief financial officer
yes, it's a good question, it's almost emotional and that you'd rather have the cash, than not. i think the right answer on that one is, as we see the recovery start to emerge and its upward sloping trajectory is one where we don't think there'll be a setback. that's probably the right answer from a holistic perspective. i mean from a liquidity management perspective, our ability to have the outstanding is conditioned upon a $150 million liquidity covenant. so, we're somewhat indifferent just from a liquidity position. but i think from an optical and just a good cash management perspective, we'll probably keep it on our balance sheet until we see the recovery that doesn't look like it's going to reverse.
steven cahall -- wells fargo -- analyst
yes. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of ben swinburne of morgan stanley.
benjamin swinburne -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks, good morning. when you guys look into q1, i'm just wondering if you could give us, especially in the us, a little more color on sort of the trends you're seeing through the quarter. i would imagine that comps gets easier as you look in the march, and i'm wondering if you give us any more specifics around billboard transit, national, local etcetera? and then back to cash flow. can you just remind us on the term loan or actually across the cap structure, to what extent you've got floating rate debt. i just, you gave some helpful guidance on cash interest in 2022. i'm just trying to figure out how kind of locked and loaded that is? thanks guys.
scott wells -- chief executive officer, americas
hey, ben, it's scott here. i'll take the first part and then hand it to brian to take your second part. so you guys remember, in the us last year, we didn't actually see a lot of softness from covid in q1, we had a very strong q1, we are up 8.5% and actually airports had a very strong quarter that quarter, they've had a very strong q1 in 2019. and so when you think about the dynamic of what's going on with our numbers, it was against a relatively covid free comp for us in q1 in the us. and so, i think-- i think what you're going to see is you're going to see that we had a couple of big deals last year that didn't come back census was out in the marketplace, there are couple of other commercial advertisers that were hitting the ground hard beginning of last year that have not come back this year, and that would be the primary reason in the traditional roadside business, why -- why we'd be a bit softer sequentially. the airports business, i don't think we've hit the trough yet in it. i think we're getting close in terms of where that's going to bottom out, but it is doing substantially less well than the rest of the business. i mean, i think one way to look at that, if you look at our percentage of airports last year, we went from about 17% in 2019, which is something we've disclosed in terms of our revenue mix. airports last year was about 13% and it didn't really start degrading until kind of may, june, so that degradation is something that cost them about 300 bps in our mix for 2020. and i do think we'll see that bottom out, but it has not bottomed out yet.
benjamin swinburne -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. and just to quickly follow-up if i could. i mean, i think williams started the call talking about 2021 being a year of growth. i guess that really kicks in as you get into q2, q3 and the comps start to get substantially easier. is that the right way to think about it?
scott wells -- chief executive officer, americas
yes, i would definitely be comfortable saying we're going to see growth return in q2.
benjamin swinburne -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
ben, i would just add from a european perspective as well, to your q1 point. i mean, in europe we did start to see some covid impact in march of last year, but it's also right to note, as i did it earlier that we have seen pretty significant strength on movement in -- from right at the start of january this year with the second or third wave of the infections hitting the uk, france particularly. so it's probably been a tougher quarter than we expected, but i would say the -- there are very positive indications this week and beyond as we start to see a clear route out of those lockdown announced by governments across europe and pipelines starting to grow into q2. so again, obviously significantly softer comps in q2, but also a real sign of that, that the market coming back for us in the second quarter both in the us and europe.
brian coleman -- chief financial officer
and then ben on the kind of the floating rate exposure question. our balance sheet is actually pretty straightforward, we don't have any material interest rate derivatives. so you can take the little over $2 billion of bank facilities as floating, it would put you a little over a third of our total debt floating interest rate. i would point out though that's somewhat by design as we've kicked out our maturities on our bonds, our prepayable debt becomes an important feature for us and so we have maintained a certain amount of pre-payable floating rate interest debt and that's about a little over a third of the total balance.
benjamin swinburne -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got you. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of lance vitanza of cowen.
lance vitanza -- cowen -- analyst
hi guys. thanks very much for taking the questions. maybe just to start as a quick follow-up to the last question about returning to growth in the second quarter. it sounded like, scott, eu, you are pretty confident than the us, if that would be the case? and then, william, i heard your comments, but was that obviously sort of expectation that you -- in europe, you will also return to growth in the second quarter, and i presume you're talking about year-over-year growth with the discussion about the easier comps, but how about on a sequential basis? do we -- would we expect, i would assume we expect that in both europe and the us as well as we think about the second quarter?
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
thanks, lance. yes, that's right. we would, i think, we would expect to see sequential improvement and we would expect to see, as you say, again the softer comp of 2020 growth coming back in the second quarter. and then what we're seeing in europe to elaborate a little is that i think governments just toward the end of december in the major markets that we operate in got too precautious as the virus mutated and as they saw infection rates rise and we've either had significant restrictions or further restrictions imposed. and i think now as the vaccines are distributed and in my own country, the uk, when our more than 25% of the adult population vaccinated, we're starting to see levels of confidence returning in terms of the government restraints. and we know from what we saw back in q3 that as those restraints are lifted, as our audiences return to the street, so our advertisers come back. and just this week anecdotally in the uk, the announcements were made by the government on monday and tuesday, the volume of calls from advertisers and the sense of a pipeline filling up was pretty palpable. so, you find us in a reasonably optimistic mood i would say for the second quarter, but there's no question that q1 has being tough with those government lockdowns.
lance vitanza -- cowen -- analyst
okay. and then i just wanted to ask you about the cash position. we had actually been thinking -- and it sounds like the first quarter is kind of the trough from an operational standpoint, but from a cash balance perspective, we at least have been thinking that that would come a couple of quarters later in part because of the timing of interest payments, but also in part because of those rent deferrals unwinding that you talked about earlier. could you talk about -- what are your expectations in terms of the timing? and again, i know no one has a crystal ball, but based on at least what you're seeing now, should we still be thinking about sort of like a 3q cash trough or is that harder to tell at this stage?
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
i think it's still a challenge. we are seeing positive signs of recovery and we're optimistic and we also feel very comfortable that our assets are quite resilient and we saw some of that in q3 and the first part of q4, but it's tough to really to predict where things will be further out in the year. i think directionally you're thinking about it the right way, it's been -- it's consistent with the way we think about. as we start to pick up particularly in the second half of the year, i think on an operating basis, free cash flow will definitely improve and should be neutral to positive. i think on a fully levered basis because of our significant debt service that will take a little longer and we'll need to get back to pre-covid type levels, but there's a lot of things in that mix and so it's really tough to put a stake in the ground on timing, but i think directionally, it sounds like we're thinking about it the right way or the same way.
lance vitanza -- cowen -- analyst
is there a minimum cash level at which you would feel the need to take steps to raise additional capital?
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
there is, we think of the $150 million to $200 million on a consolidated base cash levels as one where, as we would have forecast that point to being around that level, we would likely start to plan for additional activities. right now we're comfortable where we are, but we always want to continue to update our forecast every week and day and month that goes by, we will get more information and we want to be dynamic on that front.
lance vitanza -- cowen -- analyst
got it. thanks, guys.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
thanks, lance.
operator
your next question comes from the line of david joyce of barclays.
david joyce -- barclays -- analyst
thank you. just a little bit more on the site lease renegotiations that helped the expense base there in the fourth quarter. is there room for more of that or have you basically done all of the renegotiating you can. and i appreciate that you talked about the site leases being related to the revenue coming back later, but there kind of like a deadline on when that cadence might turn into it sort of a headwind on working capital or is it going to be pretty smooth?
brian coleman -- chief financial officer
sure, i'll take a shot at that, david, and then william and scott can come over the top if they have anything else to add. i think the first part of your question is, the lease negotiations that the operators continue to have, are we done. the answer is no. i think as long as we have covid impacted contracts, there is a conversation to be had. and then it takes time and the negotiations conclude and thus the relief is lumpy, for lack of a better word. so, you saw quite a bit of success in q4, particularly in the european group, but that was efforts since q2, dialogs with counter parties, negotiations, type of thing. those conversations continue and you're having conversations about q3 and q4 impact, and again, i think those will continue, maybe, to a lesser extent as time goes by. and certainly as revenue starts to come back and these contracts start performing closer to their kind of intended terms then i think it will be challenging. and so i think the natural answer to your question is, these will continue, the negotiations will continue and they will start to kind of funnel off as revenues start to return to normality.
david joyce -- barclays -- analyst
and on the revenue front, i'm sorry, go ahead.
brian coleman -- chief financial officer
no, no, no. go ahead.
david joyce -- barclays -- analyst
i was just going to ask on the revenue side of the equation, have the contracts with the advertisers changed as a result of this, meaning have they become more fixed in nature or are they still as variable as they have been, just trying to think of how the revenue has been holding up sort of better than some of our traffic data would suggest.
brian coleman -- chief financial officer
i'll let scott or william address that question since it is advertising contract facing.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
yes, i think overall i don't think the nature of our contracts have changed significantly. i think what had changed is the, the booking curve has changed and that bookings are coming in later than they were and advertisers were perhaps demand and greater flexibility than they were pre-covid, but i don't think there has been a fundamental shift in terms of our contractual relationship with advertisers, no. scott, have you seen anything in the us to comment on?
scott wells -- chief executive officer, americas
no, it's the later contracts, shorter commitments later buying. i mean that's really what's happened.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
yes.
david joyce -- barclays -- analyst
alright, great, thank you very much.
operator
your next question comes from the line of stephan bisson of wolfe research.
stephan bisson -- wolfe research -- analyst
good morning. in the past, you've indicated an openness to asset dispositions. i was wondering if that is still the case and if so, what are you currently seeing in the m&a market and where are i guess some of the hold-ups?
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
okay, so, i'll take that and then brian can add any follow-up commentary. i mean, i would say, i would repeat, i think what i said when answering a similar question last quarter which is that, we certainly remain open, the strategy that we talked about exactly a year ago on our earnings call around taking on the higher margin us business remains that case. but i still believe that right now the valuation gap remains pretty significant and that now would not be the time to look at any significant m&a activity. i think we would want to see a more sustained recovery over a period of time before that became really a likely scenario for us. but the strategy remains the same, it's just that execution right now i think remains challenging. brian, do you want o add anything to that?
brian coleman -- chief financial officer
i agree with that william. i mean i do think that there is an increase in, maybe level of interest generally in the marketplace. but the valuation gap is going to be too wide until we start to see signs of a sustained recovery. so i think i totally agree with everything you said.
stephan bisson -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. and i guess just one follow-up. on that valuation gap, is it more just the base year and needing to kind of rebuild what the assets can do in terms of financials, or is it a multiple problem in terms of what multiple people are running today?
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
frankly it is both.
brian coleman -- chief financial officer
talking about this, say, i think it's probably a little bit of both, but i think it may be weighted toward who takes the recovery risk and until you have a sustained level of ebitda, people are going to discount that. and i think until that recovers, it's going to be a tough conversation.
stephan bisson -- wolfe research -- analyst
great, thanks so much.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
i would just add. i think everyone we talk to is very confident about the recovery in our sector and remain very full of belief for our sector. remember the sector was the fastest growing medium of all traditional media for the preceding five, six years pre-covid. but i think what nobody can answer right now is what exactly -- what the exact timing or shape of that recovery will be. so, until that becomes a little clearer until our crystal balls improve a little, i think that it's unlikely to see significant transaction, that's my view.
stephan bisson -- wolfe research -- analyst
great, thanks so much for the color.
operator
we have time for one more question. your last question comes from the line of jim goss of barrington research.
jim goss -- barrington research -- analyst
thank you. a couple of questions, first, as you alluded to, advertising is a market share game and we follow a lot of broadcasters that have had a less severe or maybe a less severe reaction or a better recovery to this point than the outdoor sector has and in terms of domestic advertising. and i'm wondering what do you think might account for that. is it that your airport exposure or do you think it's the urban versus non-urban exposure? what are the factors that are building into the lesser degree of recovery you've experienced at this point?
scott wells -- chief executive officer, americas
william, you want me to take that one from a --
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
well, do you want to take it, yes.
scott wells -- chief executive officer, americas
yes. okay. so i think there is a -- i think there's a few things going on. i mean, first off in any reporting from broadcasters, your 2020 numbers are distorted by political, which was a pretty big contributor for that vertical, particularly in the latter part of the year. so, i --
jim goss -- barrington research -- analyst
that's clearly besides political.
scott wells -- chief executive officer, americas
so besides political, but the point i'd just start with is that, i think we are not a like-for-like buy with tv. it's not a primary comparison. so it's a little bit of a tough bridge to build you exactly how the advertisers think about it. but i think that a big thing you should keep in mind is that most of the agencies, many of the agencies are based in the biggest cities that have had the most advanced lockdowns in the us. and so, i know from our conversations with agencies and with advertisers, there is a perception gap around how mobile the country actually is versus how -- and this was particularly true earlier in the year, i think it has been less and less of an issue as time has passed. but the agency folks are working from home in los angeles, they're working from home in new york, they're working from home in chicago, and they say, well, since i'm working from home that must mean everybody is working from home and so i'm not thinking about buying out-of-home, but i'll buy tv because everybody is watching more tv albeit they're not watching linear tv, they're watching streaming. but that's a whole other ball of wax to get into.
but i think you'll see as those folks start to come back to offices, or start to see -- we're certainly spending a lot of time educating people on how much mobility there actually is, in the marketplace right now, i think you'll see things come back, but it really -- it's a hard one to give you a like-for-like decision, because i don't think that there are a lot of advertisers who are making a binary decision of do i buy out-of-home or do i buy tv, it's usually, am i going to add out-of-home to a campaign that maybe has tv in it already, you are something along those lines with the perceived mobility, i think that's been a drag on us. and there is no question that you asked embedded in there. you asked about transit, i mean i referenced before that transit was down 300 bps in our percentage mix of revenue for 2020 and that it had not troughed as we reach that point. so that's definitely contributing to it, and that's a --
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
-- that's a perception plus a reality thing to a degree, although we did see pretty robust travel over the holidays, we saw pretty robust travel over president's day weekend, and certainly the average weekly volume is trending in the right direction. and i think that'll be a conversation as recovery gets more firm that we're going to see in the other direction. so hopefully that helps.
jim goss -- barrington research -- analyst
okay. and one other thing, you made a very interesting point in your press release, talking about in the digital platform delivering real-time content changes depending on audience traffic patterns whether daypart and other relevant variables, that seems obviously a digital can enable that sort of flexibility. i'm wondering how much you'd intend to implement that and what are the constraints in terms of parties owning specific placement rates, if somebody wants certain displays down a certain road, and does that -- that factory against your ability to do what you're saying or are you shortening the time frames for digital versus the static board, so that you can introduce this flexibility.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
yes, i mean, it's something that we're managing all the time is probably how i would answer that, to maximize the value that we get from our inventory, and so you'll become advertiser if you take a -- an exclusive right on a particular board, but the majority don't, and the majority on digital, the majority enables us to run the flexibility that we talked about. and i think one of the few upsides of covid is it has given us the opportunity to demonstrate to advertisers, the greater flexibility that digital -- digital out-of-home deliveries both in the us and internationally for us as well to become a very important part of our value proposition. and i think it be really appreciated during the pandemic to be able to take particular daypart or particular days of week and exploit that flexibility, so yes, we obviously have to consider what you want -- other advertisers might want, those advertisers we don't want that flexibility, but we're making those judgments and balancing that to maximize the value of our inventory wherever we operate.
so, i think i should. -- i think i should probably close it there and thanks everybody for your questions and for your attention. as i hope i've managed to convey with brian and scott's help, we recognize that this is a tough start for the year, but we also recognize that as of today, 25th february, i think starting in terms of the net pricing for the world and for our business as well. i think the execution of our team has been remarkable. i think we demonstrated the phenomenal strength of our asset and so far as one can, i do feel optimistic that not only will we return a business to year-on-year growth in the second quarter and beyond, but that we are resiliently focused on getting back to pre-covid levels and that is the united objective for this business across the world. and the sooner government lift restrictions, roll out the vaccines and people get back on the highways and back into cities, the sooner our business will return to those pre-covid levels. so thanks again, everybody, for your to your interest and for your support and we look forward to continuing the dialog. thank you.

it's worth noting that the out-of-home industry has consistently accounted for 5% to 6% of global advertising spend, and was one of the only growing traditional mediums pre-covid. our industry has proven to be very resilient coming out a previous downturn, and we fully expect this will once again be the case as we emerge from the pandemic. longer term, the digital out-of-home sector is projected to grow at 13% compound annual growth rate from 2022 to 2025, according to data published by magna global in december 2020. we hope to capture a significant share of this growth, and we believe the actions we've taken during the past 12 months from strengthening our liquidity and implementing cost restructuring efforts, to the adjustments we've made to our sales approaches, to the continued expansion of our digital platform and data analytics product, put us in a stronger position to return to revenue growth as the recovery ultimately takes hold.
as we previously noted, while we continue to focus on carefully managing our expenses, we have begun to play offence. throughout the pandemic, we have focused on strengthening our relationships with our advertising partners, with an emphasis on collaborating more closely with them as they tap into the flexibility and immediacy of our platform. we have increasingly utilized our radar tweaked solutions to help our customers understand how that target customers have changed their movement patterns. in turn, we have still to demonstrate our ability to deliver real-time content changes depending on audience traffic, as well as weather, day-part and other relevant variables. overall, we are united across our organization in executing a clear strategic plan, and fully capitalizing on the fundamental strength and growth drivers of our global asset base, in order to unlock shareholder value. there are four key components that will continue to define our success now and well into the future. and we have continued to deliver progress across all of them. these imperatives include, first and foremost, we are continuing to invest in our business, including secure in premier contracts and integrating the right technology to strengthen and expand the effectiveness of our assets.
we continue to grow our digital footprint and demonstrated effectiveness in dynamically targeting, influencing and delivering audiences on the move. complementing our digital portfolio, we've added to our data analytics capabilities and further strengthened our radar tweak of tools through key partnerships in both the us and europe, and we continue to expand our integration with programmatic buying platform. all of these investments around monetizing our portfolio by delivering the data, targeting and ease of ad placement that our customers increasingly appreciate. we also finalized our new contract with the port authority of new york and new jersey during the fourth quarter. this venture is aimed at capturing the incredible potential of our platform and technology in a very big way as we emerged in the pandemic and audience travel begins to normalize.
second, we are focused on maximizing revenues by doing what we do best, partnering politely with our customers to deliver compelling advertising solutions, strengthening long-term relationships and remaining agile and flexible. in the us, we're doubling down on our client direct selling initiatives and emphasizing selling creative ideas rather than specific billable locations. similarly in europe, we are working with advertisers and agencies to develop unique network solution, which exploit the flexibility of our medium. these approaches along with the integration of radar's broadening suite of related data analytics tool are supporting deeper conversations with brands, who are selling the unique strength of our platform.
third, we have remained diligent in prudently managing our cost structure and cash flow. these initiatives have included negotiating reductions in site leases, temporary reductions in compensation and reductions in certain discretionary spending, as well as deferring capital expenditures. we've also moved forward with the restructuring plans to reduce headcount throughout our organization.
and fourth, we are committed to maintaining ample liquidity and continuingly -- continually reviewing parts to strengthen our balance sheet over the long term. this includes the recent refinancing of a portion of our debt through the issuance of $1 billion senior notes, which extended our maturity profile and reduced our cash interest expense going forward. and brian will provide more details following my remarks. the strength of our assets and our focus on remaining agile in terms of maximizing our inventory in a difficult environment was evident in the fourth quarter as we continued to post sequential improvement in our performance. we delivered consolidated revenue of $541 million, down 27% compared to the prior year. excluding china and fx, the decline would have been 25% in the fourth quarter, an improvement over the third quarter.
in americas, we delivered results ahead of our expectations in both sequential revenue and adjusted ebitda margin. our performance in europe reflected the impact of the increased mobility restriction as government thought to contain the second wave of the virus. these results were also ahead of our expectations as we work diligently to adjust our selling approaches and maximize our asset in an unprecedented and volatile climate. similar to the third quarter, we saw promising signs regarding the resilience of our platform in select markets, particularly in the uk where our business significantly outperformed the roadside market. we believe this reflects both the premium locations of our roadside inventory, as well as the success of our digital screens which generated close to 70% of our fourth quarter revenue in the uk. these results, as well as our progress in continuing to drive operating efficiencies are certainly encouraging given the pandemic related circumstances we have faced globally. i'd like to call out all of our employees for their outstanding commitment to our mission and their contributions to our business during this extraordinary operating period. we truly have a first rate talented team laying the groundwork to deliver improved results this year and beyond. our people have adjusted brilliantly to new ways of working and their productivity and commitment through the crisis have been outstanding. there are many steps they are taking to further strengthen our operations while adjusting our approach to serving our clients during the pandemic will pay dividends well into the future.
looking ahead, we will be facing a very tough comparable first quarter given our strong performance in the first three months of 2020, and the continued impact of covid 19. this is also traditionally our smallest quarter in terms of revenue. based on the information we have as of today, we expect americas segment revenue to be down in the high 20 percentage range as compared to the prior year. the recent mobility restrictions in european countries, following mutations of the virus have continued to cause significant volatility in our european segment booking activity. due to this, for the first quarter of 2021, with the europe segment revenue to be down in the mid 30% range, as compared to prior year. latin american bookings continue to be severely constrained as the pandemics' impact continues in all four of our markets in the region.
turning to our fourth quarter performance. in the americas segment, while year-over-year revenue was down 25%, we continue to show a sequential improvement, which was better than expected. local continues to show recovery and we're seeing national rebounding, it is not only the number of sales rfps increasing, but we're also seeing an increase in the size of those rfps, which is certainly a good sign. as a reminder, in 2019 national revenue was up 9%. we've begun to gain traction with the large agencies and brands on the ability of the out-of-home medium to deliver results. they were however the first to pullback as the pandemic hit. so we're now beginning to rebuild interest with them, which bodes well as we exit the pandemic.
in the us, programmatic purchasing grew encouraging the year-over-year during the fourth quarter, although off a small base. and we believe programmatic could grow substantially over time. we've built a robust set of ssp partners and a rich network of more than 20 dsps, providing avenues to sell our inventory alongside other digital media. our early entry into programmatic relative to the rest of the out-of-home industry positions us well as we work to introduce our platform and capabilities to a greater number of brands across the larger media buying universe. europe's fourth quarter revenue, adjusted for foreign exchange, was down 23%. while our performance was ahead of our internal expectations due to the second wave of covid and associated travel restrictions, specifically in our largest market, france, we did not deliver sequential improvement. during the quarter, we continued to benefit from our strategic focus on roadside locations, which accounted for about two-thirds of our total european revenue and are far less affected by covid-19 driven restriction than the transit environment which has historically accounted for just over 10% of our european revenues.
similar to the americas, one encouraging outcome of the pandemic is that in europe, we have witnessed increased opportunities to demonstrate the flexibility, immediacy and creativity of our platform from multiple standpoint, including messaging context, contract flexibility and the ability to use mobile data to better target specific audiences.
moving on now to our outlook for the americas business. as i mentioned, we expect the americas to be down in the high 20 percentage range as compared to the prior year. this is slightly weaker than the fourth quarter, due in part to the tough comps of 2020, as well as increased pressure on airports. as a reminder, in last year's first quarter, americas segment revenue was up 8.5% on 2019. we are heartened by the increased audience movement with trends that we're seeing. our data is showing that travel has actually remained close to normal with some weeks even exceeding the same week in the prior year. so audiences are back on the highways and we have no doubt advertisers will ultimately come back to the market. the encouraging news is that, similar to the fourth quarter, we are continuing to see an improvement in the volume and the size of rfps, and it appears that advertisers are getting more confident and starting to plan for the future in a more structured manner. the beverage vertical continues to improve with the restaurant up versus prior year. but it's also clear that advertisers are continuing to delay decision making and booking campaign later reducing our visibility. we're continuing to leverage our radar platform, an expanded portfolio of partner tool to adjust to evolving travel patent to maximize our inventory for our customers, and this is helping to strengthen our relationships and demonstrate the unique attributes of our platform.
turning to a review of the americas technology initiatives and new contracts. during the quarter we continued to invest in the right technology, including increasing our digital footprint, strengthening our data analytic capabilities and expanding in the programmatic space. we added seventeen new digital billboards in the fourth quarter for a total of 74 new digital billboards in 2020, giving us a total of more than 1,400 digital billboards across the united states. we also continue to strengthen our radar platform through partnerships aimed at further improving our data analytics and directly addressing our customers' needs. we entered into a partnership with bombora, a leading provider of b2b intent data. an out-of-home industry first, we are integrating bombora data with radar viewed audience insights, demographics, and location targeting. so advertisers can now understand how each of our display impacts more than 100 b2b audience segment, making targeting the b2b customer more accessible and measurable.
our partnership with bambora followed the recent addition, the partnerships with tremor video and geopath, which we've also added to the integrated suite of solutions we deliver through radar. as an example of the benefits of our technology investment, we leveraged our billable presence in florida and our radar-connect mobile retargeting capabilities to deliver a campaign for game day vodka. the brand reported that the campaign was responsible for 65% of website traffic and achieved a take through rate that was twice the industry average. as repeated case studies have shown, combining billboard ads with mobile is far more effective than just using one or the other. the success was such that game day vodka was subsequently selected as an official committee sponsor by the tampa bay super bowl host committee. this relationship is a very powerful example of radar-connect's ability to take our out-of-home footprint to another level through smart targeting of the right audiences at the right time.
as i noted, we are continuing to expand in the programmatic space. our programmatic platform introduces ease and efficiency to the out-of-home sales process by enabling marketers to buy our out-of-home inventory in audience based packages, giving them a level of flexibility closest to the online platforms relative to other traditional ad medium. as i've noticed -- as i've noted on previous calls, it's my firm belief that if you make something easier to buy, you inevitably grow your business and our growth in programmatic presence would certainly ensure that we continue to capture advertising dollars from other media and grow our share of the pie.
finally, we are off to a good start with our port authority contracts. we have the inventory up and running on our platform and have begun selling at it. as we noted last quarter, the 12 year deal is the largest airport advertising contracts in the us, panning jfk, laguardia in europe, and stewart airports. with the addition of these tremendous airport assets, brands will have the unique ability to execute campaigns that reach a vast array of consumers as they drive local site throughout a vast metro area. despite the short-term challenges related to pandemic, we remain confident in the growth potential of these contracts.
looking ahead in europe where we're seeing a range of performances within our markets due to the resurgence of covid 19 cases, new variants in the virus and related government restrictions, particularly in france and the uk. as i noted earlier, we expect europe revenues to be down in the mid 30 percentage range as compared to 2020. visibility into the remainder of the quarter continued to be impacted as some advertisers pause their activity pending greater clarity on the pace of the vaccination and timing of market reopening. in addition, advertisers are making buying decisions later in the buying cycle which can delay bookings and impact our visibility.
having said that, it is important to note that the impact of current government restrictions remains well below impact that we saw in march and april of last year. and longer term, as we've continued to emphasize, the resilience of the business is clear and when audiences returned to the streets, our out-of-home business will rebound soundly. at this point, we believe restrictions across our european market will begin to lift the spring, and we're working closely with our advertisers to develop campaign targeting audiences as they return. for example, in the uk, where the roadmap to lifting lockdowns was reviewed earlier this week, the expected rebound is being marketed as a renaissance moment, highlighting why out-of-home is better positioned than ever to help brands reach and engage audiences as they emerge from their restrictive stay at home orders.
turning now to our european technology investments, we continue to make progress in utilizing smart data to help advertisers plan and adjust their campaigns. our sales team has integrated the radar technology in spain and the uk, and advertiser interest has been very positive, particularly as we demonstrate the agility of our platform in using aggregated anonymous data to target audiences, as they return to the street. in spain, we recently launched radar driven campaign, centered on driving consumer interest for disney plus and caixabank. the disney plus campaign is for the many theories one division and targeted in 18 to 45-year-old demographics with interest in comic, cinema and video games. and the caixabank campaign was for their young id products and targeted 14 to 30-year-old with interest in music, museums and other cultural locations in barcelona. we're also rolling out a programmatic offering in europe, similar to the americas, our programmatic offering will build over time, simplifying the buying process, providing us with additional revenue stream and a growing avenue to leverage our scale and technology to target new advertising partners. our digital footprint continues to expand in europe. we added 545 digital displays in the fourth quarter and 1,244 in 2020 for a total of over 16,000 screens now live.
overall, we have a broad asset base in europe, which is enabling us to develop and market scale digital networks with a focus on road side, which can be sold flexibly by time of day and day of week. this aligns well with rising advertiser expectations regarding our scale and the strength of our technology in targeting the right audiences on the move. i should also note that we recently secured several key contracts in europe, including winning the bid to renew the rain contract, covering bus shelters, pull banners and stopping points across the city and we've secured a renewal in spain for the madrid outskirts on january 1st of this year. as you would expect, the past year was not particularly active for big tenders given covid and several were pushed out to this year. nevertheless, we were successful in securing these major contracts.
so, in summary, we are intently focused on executing on our strategy, which is centered on strengthening our technology with the aim of fully monetizing our digital board and expanding our customer base. notwithstanding the challenges we have faced, the pandemic has also presented us with a number of opportunities to demonstrate the flexibility and immediacy of our platform with a broad range of advertisers as we look to deepen our relationships and accelerate our digital conversion. it remains early in the recovery and as our market gradually open up, we will continue to take steps to preserve our liquidity, including balancing the need to defer capital expenditures, and reduce costs while still investing in strengthening our platform. overall, we believe we remain in a strong position to capitalize as audience ability increases, given the steps we have taken and continue to take throughout the global crisis.
and now, i'd like to turn it over to brian to discuss our fourth quarter 2020 financial results.
brian coleman -- chief financial officer
thank you, william. good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call this morning. as william mentioned, the past year was challenging, but we moved quickly to address our cost base, strengthen our liquidity and improve our financial flexibility. as we look to build a stronger company, we have also continued to make strategic investments in critical areas aimed at strengthening and expanding the effectiveness of our assets, while also refining our sales approach. taking together these initiatives and our improved cost structure place us in a solid position to benefit as the worldwide economy recovers.
moving on to the results on slide 4. before discussing our results, i want to remind everyone that during our gaap results discussions, i'll also talk about our results adjusted for foreign exchange, which is a non-gaap measure. we believe this provides greater comparability when evaluating our performance. additionally, as you know, we tendered our shares in clear media in april of last year, and therefore our q4 results in 2020 do not include clear media. however, our results in q4 and full year 2019 did include clear media's results. in the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue decreased 27.4% to $541 million. adjusting for foreign exchange, revenue was down 29.3%. if you exclude china and adjust for currency, the decline in revenue was 24.5%. the finish was better than our internal expectations due to stronger-than-expected performance in united states and certain markets in europe. as william mentioned, this was sequentially better than the third quarter. consolidated net loss in the fourth quarter was $33 million compared to net income of $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.
consolidated adjusted ebitda was $101 million, down 51.1%. excluding fx, consolidated adjusted ebitda was down 52.1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. for the full year consolidated revenue decreased 30.9% to $1.9 billion, excluding foreign currency exchange impact, consolidated revenue for 2020 declined 31.4%. consolidated net loss for the full year was $600 million compared to $362 million in 2019. and consolidated adjusted ebitda for 2020 was $120 million, down 80.8% compared to 2019. excluding fx, adjusted ebitda was down 82% for the full year. these are certainly not the results we anticipated delivering when we started 2020. but we do believe the team did an exceptional job responding to the pandemic and taking the necessary steps to adapt to the dynamics in the marketplace. normally during the fourth quarter earnings call i review both the fourth quarter and full year results for each of our business segments. but this year for efficiency, i will focus only on the fourth quarter. additional details of the full-year results can be found in the 10-k which was filed this morning.
now, please turn to slide 5 for a review of americas fourth quarter results. the americas segment revenue was $258 million in the fourth quarter, down 25.3% compared to $345 million last year. as william noted, this marked further sequential improvement compared to the previous two quarters. total digital revenue which accounted for 32% of total revenue was down 29.6%. digital revenue from billboards and street furniture was down 15.4%. digital revenue as compared to the prior year improved sequentially over the third quarter, which was down 34.8% and print continues to perform a bit better than digital due to our [indecipherable] inventory. national was down 27% and accounted for 37% of total revenue, with local down slightly less at 24%, accounting for 63% of revenue. both national and local improved over the third quarter. our top-performing categories in the quarter included business services, our largest category, as well as beverages. regionally, we are still seeing strength in our small markets and weakness in the largest cities. direct operating and sg&a expenses were down 16.8%, due in part to lower site lease expenses related to lower revenue and renegotiated fixed-site lease expense, as well as lower compensation costs from lower revenue and operating cost savings initiatives. adjusted ebitda was $94 million, down 34 -- 35.4% compared to the fourth quarter of last year with an adjusted ebitda margin of 36.5%.
next, please turn to slide 6 and a review of our performance in europe in the fourth quarter. europe revenue of $268 million was down 17.9% and excluded -- excluding foreign exchange, revenue was down 23% in the fourth quarter. this was a bit weaker than the performance in the third quarter as the stricter lockdowns in key european countries, including france impacted our results. however, our results for the quarter finished ahead of our expectations, which speaks to the execution of our team, as well as the strength of our assets. the level of restrictions varied by country, with seven of our top 10 european markets posting sequential revenue improvements in the quarter, with the majority showing topline declines, less than half of what we saw at the outset of the pandemic and last year's second quarter. digital accounted for 34% of total revenue and was down 18.8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. adjusted direct operating and sg&a expenses were down 17% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. the decline was driven primarily by lower direct operating expenses in large part due to our success in renegotiating fixed lease expenses. additionally, sg&a expense was down slightly due to lower compensation due to lower revenue, operating cost savings initiatives and government support and wage subsidies. and adjusted ebitda was $35 million, down 46.9% from $65 million in the year ago period, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. this was driven by lower revenues in the period.
in august, as you know, we issued senior secured notes through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, clear channel international bv, which we refer to as ccibv. net proceeds from the note offering provides incremental liquidity for our operations. our european segment consists of the business is operated by ccibv and its consolidated subsidiaries. accordingly, the revenue for our europe segment is the revenue for ccibv. europe segment adjusted ebitda does not include an allocation of ccibv's corporate expenses, are deducted from ccibv's operating income and adjusted ebitda. as discussed above, europe and ccibv revenue decreased $59 million during the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the same period of 2019 of $268 million. after adjusting for $16.5 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, europe and ccibv revenue decreased $75 million during the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the same period of 2019. ccibv operating income was $0.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to operating income of $38 million in the same period of 2019.
now let's move to slide 7 and a quick review of other, which includes latin america. as a reminder, the prior year results include clear media, which was divested in april of 2020. latin american revenue was $15 million in the fourth quarter, down $11 million compared to the same period last year. revenue was down due to widespread impact of covid 19. direct operating expense and sg&a from our latin american business were $15 million, down $4 million compared to the fourth quarter in the prior year due in part to lower revenue, as well as cost savings initiatives. latin america adjusted ebitda was $1 million, down $6 million compared to the fourth quarter in the prior year due to the impact on revenue from covid 19, partially offset by cost savings initiatives.
now moving to slide 8, and review of capital expenditures. capex totaled $31 million in the fourth quarter, a decline of $62 million compared to the prior year period as we continued to focus on preserving liquidity, given the current operating conditions. capex was also lower due to the sale of clear media, which as i mentioned, occurred in april of 2020, although fourth quarter capex did include a small amount related to the port authority contract. for the full year, total capex was $124 million, down $108 million compared to the full year 2019. again the reduced capex for the full year was primarily due to our liquidity preservation measures and the divestiture of clear media.
now on to slide 9. clear channel outdoor's consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled $785 million as of december 31st, 2020. our debt was $5.6 billion, an increase of just over $500 million during the year as a result of our drawing on the cash flow revolver at the end of march and issuing the ccibv notes in august. cash paid for interest on debt was $22 million during the fourth quarter and $324 million during the full year ended december 31st, 2020. this was in line with our expectation and up slightly compared to the prior year due to the timing of interest payments, which was partially offset by lower interest rates. our weighted average cost of debt was reduced from 6.8% in 2019 to 6.1% in 2020.
moving on to slide 10. as mentioned, we continue to focus on managing our cost base and strengthening our liquidity and financial flexibility. in september we announced restructuring plans throughout our organizations. in our americas segments we completed our restructuring plans in the fourth quarter and we expect annualized pre-tax cost savings of approximately $7 million to begin in 2021. however, our plans for europe have been delayed due to the evolving nature of covid 19 impacts and the complexity of executing the plans. we now expect to substantially complete the plan by the first half of 2022. in conjunction with and in addition to these plans, we expect an additional annualized pre-tax cost savings of approximately $5 million in our corporate operations. additionally, as i mentioned in my remarks on both the americas and europe segments, we continue to work on negotiating fixed-site lease savings and have achieved $28 million in rent abatements in the fourth quarter for a total of $78 million year-to-date. also, we received european government support in wage subsidies in response to covid 19 of $1 million in the fourth quarter and $16 million year-to-date. the duration and severity of covid 19's impacts continue to evolve and remain unknown, as such, we will consider expanding, refining or implementing further changes to our existing restructuring plans and short-term cost savings initiatives as circumstances warrant.
moving onto our financial flexibility initiatives, earlier this month we successfully completed an offering of $1 billion of 7.75% senior notes due 2028. proceeds from the offering will be used to redeem $940 million of our 9.25% senior notes due 2024, as well as to pay transaction fees and expenses including associated call premium and accrued interest. the timing was right for this offering, giving the strength in the high-yield credit market, as well as our improving outlook. in addition, we've de-risked our maturity profile by refinancing approximately half of our 9.25% notes which were unsecured and represent our next nearest material maturity. our weighted average maturity is now 5.6 years, up from 4.9 years with a run rate cash interest savings of approximately $10 million per year, due to lower coupon rate. all-in-all, the offering speaks to the continued support the financial markets half for clear channel outdoor and reflect our improving outlook, strong global assets and leading market position.
turning to slide 11 and our outlook for the first quarter of 2021. as william mentioned, americas first quarter 2021 segment revenue is expected to be down in the high 20% range as compared to the prior year. this is slightly weaker than the fourth quarter, due in part to the tough comps. with the first quarter of 2020 when revenue increased 8.5% over the prior year, as well as the continued impact of covid 19. in our europe segment we expect revenue to be down in the mid 30% range in the first quarter, historically the first quarter of the year is the smallest quarter for revenue. the weakness is due to the resurgence of covid 19 cases, new variants of the virus and related government restrictions, particularly in france and the uk. latin america bookings continued to be severely constrained. additionally, we expect cash interest payments in 2021 of $362 million and $335 million in 2022. the increase in 2021 is primarily due to the interest payments on the ccibv notes issued in 2020, as well as various timing differences.
and now, let me turn the call back to william for his closing remarks.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
thank you, brian. so, to reiterate, despite the near-term challenges we continue to face and the uncertainty regarding the pace of the worldwide recovery, we are encouraged by the resilience of our business and the fact that infection rates are in decline in the majority of our markets, which together with the vaccination programs gathered pace is leading to a real sense of optimism.
our national and local businesses in the us continue to recover. and in europe we are confident that the restrictions of starting to lift and our pipeline is strengthening. as we exit the first quarter and the environment continues to improve, we remain committed to executing against our growth strategy and delivering year-on-year growth in 2021. we believe are focused on working closely with our customers to give them real time audience insight they need, including our effort to expand our technology initiatives spanning our digital platform, data analytics capabilities and programmatic capability put us in an even stronger position to return to revenue growth and benefit from our operating leverage as the recovery takes hold in the second quarter and beyond.
we are now a stronger and more efficient company in the way that we operate, both in terms of the unique value proposition we deliver and the manner in which we run our business. our people have shown that creativity and commitment and we are poised to maximize the opportunities ahead. i look forward to providing updates regarding our progress in the months ahead.
and now, scott will join brian and myself in taking your questions. operator?
",2020-Q4,CCO
-0.8437,,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of steven cahall with wells fargo.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
think you might be on mute, steve.
steven cahall -- wells fargo -- analyst
sorry about that, yeah. so thanks a lot for the color. you talked about the pickup in rfps and theatrical, could you maybe give us a little bit of color on the americas division. how much revenue in this division these days? is it the large urban signage, large urban areas spectaculars, that sort of thing because i imagine that's where you're seeing a lot of this resurgence.
so if you could maybe help put some color or context around those large urban revenue areas and what sort of trends you're seeing and maybe the same question for europe. and then, brian, thanks for that financial detail. maybe if you could dive a little bit deeper into what the covenant holiday means. if you're ending liquidity of $425 million to $475 million, which i think i heard right. does that put you in compliance with the covenant and does that include maybe some of your bank debt reduction or like revolver pay back by the end of the year? thanks.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
brian, you want me to take the spectaculars one first?
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer
okay.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
so steve, the question about theatricals is a good one and just to clarify, they do buy spectaculars but that's not the majority of what they buy. they actually are big users of our digital networks and buy relatively deep into the footprint and so i don't think we disclose how big the spectaculars business is, but it's in that bulletin and other bit that was disclosed. it is definitely showing signs coming back, but it's not just theatrical that's coming back. i hope that gives you a flavor for it.
steven cahall -- wells fargo -- analyst
maybe just in that context is large city or sort of large urban area ex-transit starting to come back. we've seen that from some of our local tv companies?
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
yeah, i mean i think it's a mixed bag across the country, but it definitely is, and certainly as we look q2 and beyond, we're definitely seeing that. i think the more you go south, then the more you go to somewhat smaller locales, the more robust things are. i mean i think this will be a question we'll get, so i'll just answer it right now. we have about a third of our markets, not a third of our revenue, but a third of our markets trending to be ahead of 2019 this year and i think overall we're expecting a very strong second half and really second quarter and second half, particularly on the traditional side.
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer
and steve, i think you asked about europe as well. i mean i hesitate to generalize about the recovery in europe because it really is very different country by country. if we were just talking about the u.k., i think we'd be presenting a very positive picture as the bulk of the restrictions are being lifted almost by the day and we're seeing the recovery follow that very closely. in other european markets, the pandemic has taken longer to be cured as it were. restrictions have remained in place for longer and so we haven't seen the speed of recovery that we're seeing in the u.k. so it is a varied picture.
what is consistent is that week-by-week, lockdowns are being lifted and week-by-week, as those lockdowns are lifted, the revenue comes back and comes back pretty strongly, but it's going to be happening during the second quarter that, that recovery is taking place and so i think what i would say is if you average it out across europe, april continued to be slow. may is certainly moving more strongly and by june i think we are expecting to see in pretty much all of our markets that recovery taking hold, but it's -- i think i would think of the second quarter for europe as a transitional quarter and then looking to a strong sustained recovery into the second half as the vaccination rates increase, but there is no such thing as one europe in this situation.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
and steve, i'll jump in and answer the covenant question quickly. i think first, i'd like to say we're pleased to deliver another amendment and it certainly reflects the continued support of our bank group. so happy with that. the second thing i'd note is this is a springing covenant. so it only applies if there's outstandings under our cash flow revolver, which today there is, but really what the second amendment means is there really is no financial covenant, which is a secured leverage test until the end of the year and in return, we'll continue to maintain a minimum liquidity $150 million.
so it's a continuation of the first and then with respect to the secured leverage test. that test when it is effect is 7.6 times. there is a step down to 7.1 times and consistent with the delay in the application of the financial covenant, the step down has also been delayed. it's been delayed till september 30th of 2022. so, again, pleased to report the second amendment and i think it's kind of based on how we feel the recovery is going and we feel that we do have sufficient means to meet that test. you asked a question about the liquidity guidance and whether or not that's sufficient or what that reflects is kind of the way i took it. when we provided the liquidity guidance, it includes cash and availability. so it doesn't really matter whether we pay down the revolver or not, it would be included whether it's availability in the revolver, cash on our balance sheet. we do believe it's sufficient. we've worked hard to build up that cash cushion. we have more visibility today than we did in the past, but we also are very mindful of our liquidity position and we'll take additional measures if appropriate should we need to make any kinds of changes on that front. so, hopefully i addressed your question. let me know if i didn't.
steven cahall -- wells fargo -- analyst
no, that's great. thank you.

your next question comes from ben swinburne with morgan stanley.
ben swinburne -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, good morning. brian, i think that was your comment about second half of the year. apologize if it was somebody else's, reaching 90% of 2019 revenue adjusted for -- i was just wondering if you could go back to that and just explain that again because that was a little bit quick and also if you could give us a little bit of color on how you guys are thinking about the different parts of your portfolio in the context of that second half. and then i was just curious maybe for scott, on the programmatic side, what are your plans as you move through this year into next year in terms of building that channel out further, technology investments and whether you're seeing advertisers really pick up even further interest in that channel including kind of on the local side would be interesting. thanks a lot.
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah, so i'll talk a little bit about the revenue guidance comment. then i'll flip it over to scott and william to talk about what they are seeing in their various markets, but the guidance provided was really to give some comfort based on the slope of the recovery that we're seeing in our business today. as to where we think the business can be at the end of the year with respect to revenue versus 2019, given what we see today and what we think will be happening over the second quarter and really the second half as we see recovery in the various parts of our business. so things could change, but i think given what we're seeing today, we feel a strong recovery is in sight and by the end of the year, we could be back up to 90% of pre-covid levels, 2019 levels on the top line. so hopefully that gives some indication at a high level what we're seeing today and hopefully we'll see that recovery come to fruition. scott, william color on the operating units?
scott wells -- chief executive officer
yes, the programmatic question, i'm happy to take the u.s. portion of it and then william to the degree you want to talk about the european, we can dive into that as well. so first off, programmatic is coming back very nicely. it is performing well and it is performing ahead of 2019 pretty materially at this point. so it is a channel that we see advertisers having interest in more broadly.
in terms of our plans, i think you will see us add at least one more ssp, which are sort of their supply side platforms, they're sort of the large-scale distribution platform that give you access to different dsps, which are the demand side platforms. that's what the advertisers actually use. we currently have a pretty robust mix, but we're always looking to enhance that and we're always looking to add. i think you're also going to see us building more and more capability in terms of how we're actually handling the content side of things. so there are investments that we're making in our content management system and other developments that we're working with along those lines in terms of making our tool set more robust and able to continue to scale nicely.
as to the question on local, we have had a few local customers buy programmatically. it has not been the primary angle on our business, but i think as you see the demand side, some of the more mainstream demand side platforms coming online that do a lot of business at that level i think, you'll see us pick up, pick up more, but that has not been the focal point so far. william, i don't know if there's anything you'd add on europe.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
no, i'd only say i think i said right at the start of this year that the programmatic was going to be a key part of our agenda right across the company and what scott's been doing in the u.s. i think has been a model of growing our programmatic capabilities. as i said in the script earlier, we would have launched in five major european markets our branded programmatic product, which is now, as i say, in those five key markets initially, we call it clear channel launchpad, which connects our premium digital inventory to ssps and to digital platforms and it's an important start. europe a little bit behind the u.s. in adopting programmatic at scale, but i'm absolutely convinced that within the next two to three years, we'll see it taking a pretty significant share of our business. so it's an important step forward.
ben swinburne -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks everyone.
operator
your next question comes from lance vitanza with cowen.
lance vitanza -- cowen -- analyst
hi guys, thanks for taking the questions. i have one for brian and one for william and maybe william, we could start with, i found the country by country commentary very helpful and i understand that the pace of the restrictions being lifted varies by country to country, but what about the lag between return of audience and return of ad dollars, and generally, if i'm hearing you right, it sounds like you're not really seeing the lag this time around. that feels different than last fall. did i get that right?
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
it really depends, lance, on how much digital inventory we have in each market. so in the u.k. where over 60% of our revenues now comes from digital screens, the recovery is pretty much instant in terms of our revenue once restrictions are lifted. so once audiences are back on the streets, advertisers want to reach them and we can get those straight up on to digital screens and then follow-on soon after on to traditional inventory. in france, for instance, where we have significantly less digital inventory, that recovery can take a little longer although i would say that if we look back into q3 of last year when restrictions were lifted in france, we did see revenue coming back pretty fast, i mean, not as fast as we would with a stronger digital footprint, but i think that is the main variable. i think the other factor to look at is the clarity of the governments signaling of what their plans are in terms of loosening up restrictions.
so i think in the u.k., we benefited from a very clear roadmap of five weekly stages of the opening up. in spain, it's been much less clear what the process was going to be and in france, i think we would say they took a long time before they reacted. they have now reacted and we're now seeing infection rates go down, vaccination rates go up and restrictions being lifted. so as i say, i'm very optimistic about the direction of travel. i'm optimistic about the speed of recovery once restrictions are lifted, but it does vary a little bit market by market. does that help?
lance vitanza -- cowen -- analyst
very much so. thank you. and then, brian, just for you, do you -- does the company still have $40 million to $45 million of lcs outstanding and if so presumably that is factored into the liquidity guide? in other words, that's a net against what you would otherwise be able to borrow on the revolver. is that right?
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer
that's correct and i actually think we disclose what the availability, which would be the size of the revolver less any kinds of commitments, which would include lcs. i don't remember the exact amount, it may be a little higher than $25 million, but we are a big lc user. that is backed out because it's not available for liquidity. so would not be included in the liquidity number.
lance vitanza -- cowen -- analyst
okay, thanks guys.
operator
your next question is from stephan bisson with wolfe research.
stephan bisson -- wolfe research -- analyst
good morning. thanks so much for the additional color today. could you talk a bit about margins and how they trend throughout the year and perhaps over the longer-term for both americas and europe. should we be targeting pre-pandemic levels or something change in the cost structure to push it one way or the other?
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer
i can take a stab at that and then william and scott, if you want to weigh in, respectively. so look, i think margins are coming back. in americas, we talked about sequential improvement and we're a little early in the recovery in europe to make that commitment for q2, but as the economies start to rebound, as europe starts to kind of follow in and really get traction in the recovery, we would expect the margin improvement is there. i mean this is a large fixed cost business, has a great deal of operating leverage and we'll see that pull through as the recovery occurs and if it's not in q2 for europe and we would expect in the second half.
the other part of your question about, do we ever expect margins to hit pre-covid levels. well, the business does change over time and i think that answer is dependent upon a number of things. we have some positives. we've taken out some costs in the business. we continue to take out cost in europe, it will take on the longer there, but we are being very diligent and we don't expect all these cost come back. on the other hand, the portfolio does change. if in the future we have more weight in transit, more weight in airports or its more capital city contracts which have lower margins, that could change the overall margin profile and we do have some of that business mix differential right now and so i wouldn't expect that when revenues get back to 2019 levels, you should assume margins would be at the same point, it's going to reflect some of the underlying changes in the business, but by and large incremental dollars to this business will fall through and we're encouraged that we're starting to see some of that and again, i think through the rest of the year, we hope to deliver it. scott, william, i don't know if you had any further color, but that's where i'd start.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
scott, do you want to make any comment for the u.s.?
scott wells -- chief executive officer
i mean i think the only thing i'd just say is that the next several quarters are going to be lumpy and that could go in both directions and so what's driving that is, we're still in negotiations and still in approval processes on different relief programs and we will start to see some snap backs happen as relief that we got during the worst of the crisis played through and so it's probably not going to be a linear path over the next couple of quarters, but i think medium to long-term, you will see a healthy margin profile reemerge.
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer
scott, i'm glad you mentioned that. that's a very fair point. my comments on the longer-term recovery was assuming all of this had unwound. i think you're right, the next few quarters due to the lumpiness of some of the deferrals and abatements it could be as you said, it could be very lumpy. so i thank you for that.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
yes, so i would only add, i was going to use the lumpy word as well, i'm afraid. it applies equally to europe. it's pretty lumpy. the other point i would make for europe is to echo brian's point is we have made it clear, we are going through some pretty significant cost reduction programs in europe and in some specific european markets as you all know with some of those european markets, those cost reduction programs can take time as you go through extensive negotiations. so, while we are very actively addressing some cost base challenges in europe, the impact is not going to be instant, it's going to take some quarters before we really see that impacting margin.
stephan bisson -- wolfe research -- analyst
great, thanks so much for the color.
operator
your next question comes from david joyce with barclays.
david joyce -- barclays -- analyst
thank you. i was hoping you could provide some more color on the proportion of your advertisers and revenue that are coming from radar at this point. what portion of your footprint is enabled and also are you linking with other -- to what degree are you looking with other media companies with that holistic omnichannel buy program for your advertisers. thanks.
scott wells -- chief executive officer
william, do you want me to take a run at this first?
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
yeah.
scott wells -- chief executive officer
sure, so in the u.s. 100% of our footprint is radar enabled and it's very hard to actually answer your question because radar is not -- it's not something that the client buys, it's a service that goes alongside what they're buying and so a client might use radar and many of our clients at this point are using radar to do their planning, but they might not do an attribution study, they might not sell any other media through our radar connect tool and they might not embed our data.
on the other hand, advertisers might do all 4 of our radar products here in the u.s. so we don't really measure it by what percent of our revenue goes through it and let me speak to the omnichannel because i think there could be two ways to answer that question. i think one would be that we do -- when we do radar studies, we do include analytics for all the out-of-home bits being used, not just ours, but i don't think that's necessarily what you meant by omnichannel. i think you're thinking of omnichannel dsps. so a programmatic thought process and you could clarify it for me when i give you this blurb as well but omnichannel dsps are relatively recent to out-of-home programmatic.
they are absolutely a growth channel and we are definitely seeing advertisers, including out-of-home in their digital campaigns where they might be buying other digital advertising products along with digital out-of-home, the work space for these omnichannel dsp's includes click boxes where they can add digital out-of-home alongside display ads or search or other things like that, but that is still the minority of our programmatic revenue at this point, it's something that we think has huge promise, but it's an emerging channel. so hopefully that addressed your questions.
david joyce -- barclays -- analyst
yeah, those comments were all just for the u.s., correct?
scott wells -- chief executive officer
yeah, that was all u.s. focused.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
if you take europe radar, we launched radar in just the u.k. and spain just last year. we are looking to rollout the product into other european markets later this year, but again to scott's point, we use it as a market indicator of audience and of the audience travel patterns and so use it to demonstrate to our advertisers the audiences that they can reach through a collection or a network of boards or screens, but it doesn't relate to a specific advertiser campaign in general.
david joyce -- barclays -- analyst
okay, thanks. and a second question, if you could please clarify when things normalize in 2022 or '23, will the margins be higher due to your various cost cuts or will the revenue mix shift -- differential make the margin comparisons a little bit more difficult from pre-covid?
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah, i don't think we know the answer to that. i think we are achieving cost savings and we think some of those will stay and obviously as the business grows, we'll have to reevaluate and that is tailwind. at the same time, we are made up of a portfolio of contracts and we will continue to go after profitable contracts and that can shift over time. if we get into more transit, that could change the business mix. so i don't know that we know the answer. i think we'll continue to focus on improving margins the best we can, but at the end of the day, we want to generate positive and incremental positive free cash flow and we will manage the portfolio as we think is most accretive to shareholder value.
david joyce -- barclays -- analyst
and if i could just understand better the renegotiated site lease contracts. are those in temporary abatements, you have temporary changes like do they come back with prior levels of revenue? like how should we think about that cadence?
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer
well, it's a mix and i think you start with when covid impact was the greatest and you started with deferring payments on everything and trigger negotiations. it's unprecedented times, our counterparties largely realize that as well and sometimes those deferrals turn into abatements, sometimes there's government support behind it. sometimes you're dealing with private landlords and it's more of a discussion and maybe it is a deferral and ultimately it will have to be paid out, but there is a wide spectrum of discussions and these are ongoing.
so i think that once we once we confirm that's something is a permanent abatement, we disclose that and everything else is a deferral. if it hasn't been paid, some of those deferrals could flip into abatements, some of those will be deferred and ultimately unwind as the recovery continues. so it's a mixed bag and we do disclose separately the site lease abatements that we've gotten in the quarter and all of last year and so hopefully that gives some color on the site lease negotiations. it's a big initiative, the operators have done a great job and they'll continue to do what they can as long as the business is negatively impacted by covid.
david joyce -- barclays -- analyst
okay, great. thank you very much. [operator instructions] your next question comes from avi steiner with jpmorgan.
avi steiner -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thank you and good morning and thank you for squeezing me in. a quick few here, domestic travel seems to be coming back based on tsa numbers. i'm curious how important is it for the company that business travel returns versus what seems like personal and then if you can just remind us on the lag time on the airports business between higher levels of travel and revenue coming back to historical levels and then i've got a couple more. thank you.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
sure, thanks, avi. you're absolutely right, travel is coming back nicely. the business travel is what historically the majority of airport advertising is anchored on but as we've gone through the crisis, we've actually engaged a lot of advertisers who are not sort of b2b oriented and so we're going through a bit of a portfolio mix shift. i think the way i'd answer your question is that it will definitely be important for us to have international travel in particular start to reemerge because the international terminals tend to be some of your most premium inventory whether for business or for consumer-oriented products. business travel as a whole i don't think needs to get back to the same level that we had before covid in order for it to be still a very robust audience and a robust opportunity.
as far as the question on the lag, i think when you go back and look at last year and now that we're disclosing the information you might see this a little bit more clearly on transit, we didn't see a precipitous fall off immediately and it's because a lot of the airport contracts are a little bit longer-term in orientation. and so you had a little bit of an unwind that happened and that works in the other direction too that you need to get advertisers to decide that they believe that the return of the audience is robust and then they need to commit in order to secure location and secure their positions.
we've never gone through anything like this, or at least not not in recent history. i think 9/11 is probably the closest analogy and it was pretty different in terms of the speed and how traffic rebounded and how things work there but we really. so we really don't know what the lag is going to be, but we expect that it will probably be multiple months. we definitely are seeing advertisers, some of the strategic advertisers that really prioritize airports come back for the second half of this year. so i think our news is going to get a lot better as the year builds, but in terms of the calling the ball on exactly when we're back to run rate, i do think it will lag the roadside business by multiple months.
avi steiner -- jpmorgan -- analyst
i appreciate that color. thank you. and then, brian, just on the liquidity comments, which were very helpful. just for me beyond interest and capex, how do we think about working capital, some of these deferrals come back and any other movements in there and then restructuring cash restructuring please?
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah, that's one of the reasons why we kind of went out and gave a year-end liquidity position as i do think we have some swings particularly in the deferrals. we've got our operators working very hard to defer those payments, convert those payments to permanent abatements and then for liquidity purposes between now and kind of normalization, we have to pick periods when they will hit and so, we thought it was important to kind of go out to the end of the year and provide some liquidity guidance and i think we feel given what we see today, we feel pretty good about that range.
restructuring charges, yeah, look, i think we have a number of things going on. if i look at some of the cost savings initiatives, largely, we have spent and we are benefiting from the restructuring initiatives that we've taken in the u.s., latin america and a significant amount of the corporate. what will take a little longer is the european side and we've provided some data points on that and it really is a function of the countries that we operate in europe, going through the process there, but we do -- and we've actually revised the program to make it larger and more substantial.
that will take a little bit longer, but i do think, from a cash outflow perspective since a lot of that cost is really severance-related that they should be largely in line. put another way, you won't have a huge amount go out day one and not receive that until first quarter of 2023. it should be kind of matched funding from here on out that we had some upfront costs, but for the most part they should kind of match going forward. so hopefully that's helpful on the working capital and restructuring side. let me know if you have further questions.
avi steiner -- jpmorgan -- analyst
no, that's great. and maybe last one i haven't heard in a while, but i may have just missed it. any update on the los angeles billboard market. i thought earlier in the year, there were some new rules potentially coming out there. so any comments there and thank you for the time?
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thanks, avi. i'll take that one as well. the thing you might have read about was the city planning commission had put forth their response to some of the ordinance language that the city council had drafted. it's now back in the city council land use committee and they are working on it. i would not hazard a guess as to when that political process will yield, but i do know that they're working on it. it definitely got de-prioritized during covid. we had felt pretty bullish the early part of last year that things were going to move through and i do think that the city council is engaged and is very serious about getting an ordinance out that will work for the industry, there, but we don't have a timeline that's concrete.
avi steiner -- jpmorgan -- analyst
appreciate all the time. thank you.
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer

at this time, there are no additional questions. i will turn it back over to william eccleshare for his closing remarks.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
thank you and thank you everybody for joining the call and for supporting us during this period. i mean, i just want to end by saying i think we will look back on the second quarter of 2021 as the quarter where the business turned a corner, the pivot quarter if you like where we went back into growth and we are starting to see the real recovery from covid-19. it's clearly dependent upon some factors out of our control whether there are kind of further covid variants and how vaccine programs run out in different markets around the world, but all of the signs that we are seeing are truly encouraging around our business's ability to bounce back from covid and just picking up on some of the questions that we've had today as those restrictions are lifted and as audiences come back into the streets, we do see that recovery coming.
the lag varies market by market, dependent a bit on levels of digital inventory and a bit on specific circumstances, but as i say, q2 is the key quarter for us as we turn that corner and look to the second half of the year to really demonstrate the business back into full growth. so thank you for your support. thanks for the great questions and we look forward to talking in the coming weeks and months. thanks very much.

william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
good morning everyone and thank you for taking the time to join today's call. during the first quarter, we continued to execute on our strategic plan with the goal of maximizing our near-term performance while strengthening our ability to capture an increasing amount of advertising dollars as the global recovery takes hold. our first quarter revenue results were in line with the guidance we previously provided and for our american segment reflected a tough comparison against our strong performance in the first three months of 2020, which was only minimally impacted by covid-19.
we delivered consolidated revenue of $371 million, down 32% compared to the prior year, excluding china and fx. brian will walk you through the details of our first quarter performance following my remarks. looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the progress being made with regard to vaccination process and the increasing levels of mobility across many of our markets as well as the positive sentiment we are hearing among advertisers. as expected, we are now seeing our business return to year-over-year revenue growth through the balance of the year driven by the rebound in several markets. most important, as a result of the strategic investments we're making in our business, we believe we are now in a stronger position to drive revenue growth as global recovery gains traction.
these investments are primarily centered strengthening our ability to monetize our growing digital platform as well as our print assets and elevate our value proposition among the broader universe of advertisers. specifically, we continue to expand and integrate our radar suite of data analytics products into our portfolios while strategically increasing our presence in the programmatic space. we continue to deliver a greater and more valuable set of actionable insights to advertisers while emphasizing selling creative ideas targeting specific audiences.
put another way, we are broadening our discussions with clients beyond just the locations of our outdoor footprint to the value of specific audiences we reach with these assets. the pandemic has provided us the ability to demonstrate the usefulness of our data as consumer journeys change, agencies and brands seek to reach them in a seamless manner. as we focus on strengthening our ability to drive revenue growth, we have also remained diligent in managing our costs and cash flow. brian will provide an update on our cost savings initiatives.
now, let me provide a brief update on each of our business segments beginning with americas. based on the information we have, for the second quarter, we expect americas revenues to be between $265 million and $275 million with adjusted ebitda margin improving sequentially from the first quarter. entering may, we are seeing a notable uptick in bookings as advertisers become more comfortable with the prospect for more sustained opening of the economy as the vaccination rates improve. based on our data, we can see that audiences are increasingly out and about with the recovery unfold, but there remains some lag between emerging mobility patterns and ad purchasing. we primarily attribute this to the fact that some key ad categories such as amusements and restaurants remain challenged due to capacity restrictions, but we believe they will pick up as the year progresses and restrictions are lifted.
further, while our transit business is showing some improvement, it continues to lag in the recovery process, which is weighing on our performance. comprised primarily of airports, this business is well positioned to benefit as travel volume increases. looking ahead, we are continuing to see an increase in the number and value of rfps. categories showing particular strengths include beverages, insurance, and business services. we're also beginning to see an upturn in theatrical in the current quarter, which is a welcome sign related to the progress of the opening of the economy. an example of the big opportunity is centered on maximizing the opening of the economy is reflected in our recently announced partnership with resorts world las vegas. in conjunction with the opening of the resort this summer and the return of convention activity, we launched three full motion digital out-of-home displays offering advertisers premium visibility on the vegas strip. they include the latest in cutting edge digital signage and represent one of the largest exterior led building displays in the u.s. delivering over 135,000 square feet of digital signage.
with regard to our technology investments, we added 14 new digital billboards in the first quarter giving us a total of more than 1,400 digital billboards across the united states. we also continue to strengthen our radar platform through partnerships aimed at further improving our data analytics and measuring the impact of our assets on consumer decision making. we have strengthened our leading audience attribution solution radar-proof by partnering with kochava, the leading real-time data solutions company for omni-channel attribution and measurement.
our innovative combined offering helps brands better understand out-of-home advertising impact on key metrics such as user engagement, website visits, and app downloads. this is the kind of compelling data that is enabling us to demonstrate the power of our platform in influencing consumers on the move. we're also continuing to make notable progress in the programmatic space. revenue from programmatic increased year-over-year in the first quarter will be although off a small base. through integration with multiple ssps, our digital out-of-home ad units are increasingly accessible to digital buyers via the same buyside platform that they utilize to spend their considerable digital budget. and while it's still early in our programmatic expansion, the progress we're making bodes well for the future.
turning to our business in europe, based on the information we have today, we expect second quarter segment revenues to be between $200 million and $220 million, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. as in the americas, the pace of recovery varies across europe, driven by differing rates of vaccination and variants in attitudes to the virus in different parts of the continent, but some of our european markets are picking up momentum in terms of opening up, we're also continuing to see volatility with activity differing from country to country. in our largest market france, the french government introduces additional mobility restrictions at the end of march, following an increase in virus cases and concerns over new variants, delaying the onset of the recovery to the middle of the second quarter. restrictions have started to ease with all schools now open and non-essential retail due to reopen on may 19th.
meanwhile, we are continuing to see promising signs in some of our other markets, particularly in the u.k., our second largest market, where the phase 3 opening is well under way supported by a countrywide vaccination rate exceeding 50%. over the last six weeks, our u.k. business generated bookings ahead of the comparable period in 2019 as we benefit from pent-up demand among advertisers. our u.k. business continued to benefit from the premium locations of our roadside inventory as well as a wide spread scale and audience reach of our digital network. i'm proud to also note that our u.k. team was recently awarded commercial team of the year at the coveted campaign media awards. the judges recognized clear channel's outstanding performance linked to proactive programs focused on supporting advertisers through the unprecedented challenges presented by the pandemic.
looking at the rest of europe, other countries that are progressing well in terms of opening up include switzerland and spain. as with the u.k., we're seeing advertising spend recovering in these markets as inflation rates drop and restrictions are eased. the overall sentiment among european advertisers is very positive reflecting pent-up demand and the need to get in front of consumers. as with the rebound we started to see in the third quarter of last year, following the easing of restrictions, which proved to be temporary, we believe the ad market will rebound again as restrictions are waived weighed in additional markets in the months ahead. our digital footprint continues to expand in europe. we added 355 digital displays in the first quarter for a total of over 16,500 screens now live. supporting these assets, our radar roll out continues to receive positive customer traction in spain and the u.k. we're also testing radar in sweden ahead of our launch in the current quarter with additional launches on track thereafter in france and belgium.
we're continuing to roll out our programmatic offering in europe. we recently launched a branded programmatic proposition called clear channel launchpad, which will serve as a customer gateway connecting our premium digital out-of-home inventory to ssps and digital buying platforms, bringing out-of-home into the omni-channel buying ecosystem. clear channel launchpad is now live in the u.k., switzerland, spain, finland and the netherlands with plans under way to introduce it across france, italy, belgium and scandinavia. similar to the americas, our programmatic platform in europe will build over time, simplifying the buying process and providing us with an important avenue to leverage our scale and technology to target new advertising partners.
so in summary, we remain committed to executing on our strategy to expand the revenue potential of our global portfolio and optimize our ability to take full advantage of the economic recovery. we're now seeing a return to year-on-year revenue growth in the second quarter with indicators pointing to continued improvement in advertiser demand as the year progresses. now i'd like to turn it over to brian to discuss our first quarter 2021 financial results.
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, william. good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. as william mentioned, as expected, the quarter has been challenging due to the impact of covid-19 on our business as well as tough comparisons against our strong q1 2020 performance in americas. however, we are beginning to see a rebound in many of our key markets. we aren't back to 2019 levels, but it's certainly nice to see the improvement. we are also continuing to work on reducing costs and addressing our capital structure while investing in our business so that we are in a stronger position as our business begins to benefit from the improving economic environment.
before discussing our results, i want to remind everyone that during our gaap results discussions, i'll also talk about results adjusted for foreign exchange, a non-gaap measure. we believe this provides greater compatibility when evaluating our performance. additionally, we have expanded our disclosure to include more detail on americas' revenue including breaking out transit revenue. we've also added disclosure on site lease expenses in both the americas and europe segments. moving on to the results on slide 4.
in the first quarter, consolidated revenue decreased to 32.7% to $371 million. adjusting for foreign exchange revenue was down 34.8%. if you exclude china and adjust for foreign exchange, the decline in revenue was 31.7%. these results were in line with expectations. consolidated net loss in the first quarter was $333 million compared to a consolidated net loss of $289 million in q1 of 2020. consolidated adjusted ebitda was negative $33 million in q1 of 2021 as compared to consolidated adjusted ebitda of $51 million in q1 of 2020. excluding fx, consolidated adjusted ebitda was negative $27 million in q1 of 2021.
please turn to slide 5 for a review of americas' first quarter results. the americas segment revenue was $212 million in the first quarter of 2021, down 28.4% compared to the prior year with a decline in revenue across all of our products. national was down approximately 33% and local down approximately 25%. revenue continues to be under pressure as a result of the impact of covid-19, but also the decline was a bit higher than q4 2020 due to the tougher year-over-year comparisons. as i noted earlier, the americas team delivered an exceptional quarter in q1 of 2020 with 8.5% revenue growth over the prior year. direct operating and sg&a expenses were down 21.1% due in part to lower site lease expenses, which declined 22.6% to $83 million related to lower revenue and renegotiated fixed site lease expense. additionally, compensation costs declined due to cost savings initiatives and lower revenue. segment adjusted ebitda was $64 million down 40.5% compared to the first quarter of last year with an adjusting ebitda margin of approximately 30%.
please turn to slide 6. as i just noted, we are now breaking out our transit revenue which is primarily comprised of our airports business. transit was down 61.5% and airports decreased 62.4% to $20 million. our billboard and other was down 20.7%. please turn to slide 7 for a bit more detail on billboard and others q1 revenue performance. rent continues to be a bit more resilient than digital and was down 19.1% with digital down 24.2% in the first quarter of 2020. and on to slide 8, within transit, print declined 52.5% and digital was down 72.8%. next, please turn to slide 9 and a review of our performance in europe in the first quarter. as a reminder, the first quarter is proportionally the smallest quarter of the year given the seasonally low level of revenue.
europe revenue of $150 million was down 29.4% and excluding foreign exchange, revenue was down 35.2% in the first quarter. as expected, the extension of mobility restrictions continued to delay the rebound with the largest revenue reductions occurring in france, u.k., sweden, and spain. digital revenue was down 38.9%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. adjusted direct operating and sg&a expense were down 11.6% compared to the first quarter of last year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, both direct operating expenses and sg&a expenses decreased in most countries in which we operate with the largest decrease occurring in france and u.k. and sweden. the largest drivers of the decline in direct operating expenses was lower site lease expense has declined 10% to $93 million after adjusting for foreign exchange. the decline was driven by lower revenue and renegotiated site lease expense. additionally, sg&a expense was down due to lower compensation attributed to lower revenue, operating cost savings initiatives, and government support and wage subsidies.
segment adjusted ebitda was negative $62 [phonetic] million after adjusting for foreign exchange. this compared to negative $14 million in q1 of 2020. our europe segment consists of the businesses operated by cci b.v. and its consolidated subsidiaries. accordingly, the revenue for our europe segment is the same as the revenue for cci b.v. europe segment adjusted ebitda the segment profitability metric reported in our financial statements does not include an allocation of cci b.v.'s corporate expenses are deducted from cci b.v.'s operating income and adjusted ebitda. as discussed above, europe and cci b.v. revenue decreased $62 million during the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020 to $150 million. after adjusting for a $12 million impact from movement in foreign exchange rates, europe and cci b.v. revenue decreased $75 million. cci b.v. operating loss was $100 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $46 million in the same period of 2020.
let's move on to slide 10, and a quick review of other which includes latin america. as a reminder the prior year results include clear media, which was divested in april of 2020. latin american revenue was $10 million in the first quarter, down $9 million compared to the same period last year due the impact of covid-19. direct operating expense and sg&a from our latin american business were $13 million, down $3 million compared to the first quarter in the prior year due in part to lower revenue and cost savings initiatives. latin america adjusted ebitda was a negative $4 million. moving on to slide 11 and a review of capital expenditures. capital expenditures totaled $18 million in the first quarter, a decline of $18 million compared to the prior year period as we continue to focus on preserving liquidity given the current operating conditions. additionally, capex was also lower in part due to the sale of clear media.
on to slide 12, clear channel outdoor's consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled $642 million as of march 31st, 2021. our debt was $5.6 billion, up slightly due to the refinancing of the senior notes and cash paid for interest on the debt was $145 million during the first quarter. our weighted average cost of debt was 5.9% as of march 31st, 2021. moving on to slide 13, as mentioned, we continue to focus on managing our cost base and strengthening our liquidity and financial flexibility. in april 2021, we revised the europe portion of the international restructuring plan, which we began in the third quarter of 2020 primarily in response to the impact of covid-19.
we expect this plan to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of 2023, an estimate that total charges for the europe portion of the international restructuring plan, including $10 million of charges already incurred will be in a range of approximately $51 million to $56 million. substantially all charges related to this plan were or are expected to be severance benefits and related costs. we expect a europe portion of the plan to result in a pre-tax annual cost savings in excess of $28 million. additionally, we continue to work on negotiating six site lease savings and have achieved $23 million in rent abatements in the first quarter on a consolidated basis. also, we received european governmental support and wage subsidies in response to covid-19 of $5 million in the first quarter.
moving on to our financial flexibility initiatives as previously announced, we successfully completed an offering of $1 billion of 7.75% senior notes due 2028. we use the net proceeds from the offering to redeem $940 million of our 9.25% senior notes due 2024. additionally, last week, we entered into a second amendment to the senior secured credit agreement, extending the suspension of the springing financial covenant through december 31st of 2021 and further delaying the step down until september 30th of 2022.
turning to slide 14, and our guidance. for the second quarter of 2021, americas' segment revenue is expected to be in the range of $265 million to $275 million and adjusted ebitda margin is expected to improve sequentially over the first quarter of 2021. while our europe segment revenue is expected to be in the range of $200 million to $220 million, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. additionally, we expect cash interest payments of $216 million in the last nine months of 2021 and $334 million throughout 2022. we expect consolidated capital expenditures to be in the $155 million to $165 million range in 2021.
we are optimistic about our prospects and may look to accelerate capex spending as appropriate to the balance of the year commensurate with the slope of the recovery. we anticipate our consolidated revenue in the second half of 2021 to reach nearly 90% of 2019 levels excluding china. the recovery is led primarily by our americas' billboard business and a number of countries in europe including our u.k. roadside business. lastly, we expect ending liquidity for 2021, including unrestricted cash and availability under the company's revolving credit facilities to be approximately $425 million to $475 million, but that could vary based on timing of cash receipts, and our payments. that concludes my formal remarks and now let me turn the call back over to william.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
thank you, brian. looking ahead, we are encouraged by the pace of the vaccination process and the increasing levels of mobility that we're seeing across the majority of our footprint. in turn interest among advertisers is returning and we are seeing booking activity exceeding 2019 in several u.s. and european markets which bodes well for the year ahead. we remain focused on strategically investing in our technology including expanding our digital platform and further strengthening our data analytics and programmatic resources with the aim of maximizing the potential of our digital board.
as we elevate our ability to demonstrate the effectiveness of our assets in influencing consumer decision making and continuing to make our inventory easier to buy particularly among digital ad buyers, we will look to expand our revenue growth potential. as we invest in our technology, we will also continue to take steps to carefully manage our costs and preserve our liquidity as we navigate the evolving macroeconomic climate and focus on driving profitable growth over the long-term. and now let me turn over the call to the operator for the q&a session.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of steven cahall with wells fargo.
steven cahall -- wells fargo -- analyst
yes, thanks. so maybe first for scott. it looks like the americas q3 guide is pretty close to 2019, as you mentioned. it sounds like airport is better, but probably still down. and i'm wondering if street furniture probably is, too, in places like [indecipherable]. so just wondering how you think about the recovery in sort of the [indecipherable] bits of weakness. and if we do see those get back to prior levels, how do you think about the ebitda power in the americas business as that's done? and should we expect any lumpiness to expenses due to rent abatements in the back half of the year? and then, william, in europe, maybe you could discuss a little bit of what sort of margins do you start to expect as you get to full run-rate revenues.
i think of that as sort of a mid-teens margin business. so just wondering, given all the cost work that you've done, how you think about it. and then lastly, scott, just maybe what's next in terms of financial management. maybe you could discuss a little bit the covenant springing suspension and what you expect for free cash flow in the back half of the year and liquidity. thank you.
scott wells -- executive vice president & chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas
steve, thanks for the questions. i think brian will take that covenant one, though, so we'll let him get to that one. on your question, i do think q3 is looking like it's going to be pretty close to its counterpart in 2019. the things you named, airports and street furniture, are the things that will probably lag. we still do have the dynamic that some cities are recovering slower than other cities in the mix. new york is actually recovering quite nicely. we don't have much in the way of street furniture there, but the times square area is recovering nicely, and the airports are recovering nicely, along with the roadside that's done well. in terms of the margins, i think there's going to be some lumpiness in our margins for a bit. i mean, you witnessed it to the positive this quarter. we've kind of been consistent in talking about these negotiations are often for relatively big chunks of money, and they are hard to predict.
and we're never 100% sure how they're going to come in. i think a couple of things will happen over the next three or four quarters. one is we are still working on some relief on contracts looking back even over last year. i think the other thing to happen is you'll see some of the relief that we've gotten come out. and so it will take a bit of time for us to get to what we'd call steady-state margins, but i don't think it's going to be wildly dramatic either. hopefully, that answers your question on the u.s. margin recovery.
william eccleshare -- - chief executive officer, president & director
yes, i'll take the european question. i'm not going to give you any kind of guidance on what may or may not happen to margin over the coming months and years, steven, and i don't think you'd expect me to. we will continue to be very vigilant on costs across the european business. i think we've done some excellent work that we've talked about on previous calls in terms of the cost reduction program and the restructuring, and that will continue to have impact in the coming years. but obviously, we can't predict is the impact of some of the changes in inventory that we may see in the months and years ahead. so i think i'll just leave it at that on margin, unless brian wants to add anything before he takes on the covenant question, as well.
brian d. coleman -- executive vice president, treasurer & chief financial officer
the only thing i would add is, as the recovery continues and incremental revenue is added, that's obviously going to be beneficial. and i think we're seeing that in europe. so hopefully, that's helpful, steve. i think we feel pretty good about the direction we're headed. on the covenant question, i think the two key things to think about are, one, the relief that we got with respect to the springing covenant itself goes through the end of the year. and so we'll report our first covenant calculation at our march 31 compliance date. and the second piece of the was a pushback of the step-down in the springing covenant measurement. and that push-down was out to september of 2022.
so i think those are the two things to think about. in exchange for that, we do have to maintain $150 million minimum liquidity. but i think you can see, from our liquidity guidance, we feel very comfortable about that. the trajectory of the business, we've actually upped our liquidity guidance to $475 million to $525 million by the end of the year. so i think we feel pretty good with where we are with respect to the covenant relief. and i would add, it's a springing covenant, so we could always pay off the drawn amounts under the facility, and we are looking like we have the liquidity to do that, should we choose that path, as well.
operator
your next question comes from the lance vitanza with cowen.
lance vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. thanks guys for taking the question and great job on the quarter. william, thanks for your leadership. obviously, been a difficult time. my question for you is it sounds like your new role, i think you mentioned it would include the evaluation of strategic considerations, i.e. m&a. so i'm wondering, can you give us an update on what the m&a environment looks like today with the covid recovery so well-developed? i'd imagine it's possible to buy and sell assets again. am i right about that? i mean, away from clear channel, are you seeing deals get done? and then, if you could comment perhaps on whether you've ruled out any types of transactions, or perhaps you could help us focus on what types of transactions we would be most likely to see, buy or sell region versus region, size, core versus noncore, that kind of thing.
william eccleshare -- - chief executive officer, president & director
right. how much detail do you really want me to give you? let me say, first, away from clear channel, as you say, i think the m&a environment is certainly getting more active. people are undoubtedly seeing markets return, valuation gaps are narrowing, and there's a lot more going on right now than there was this time last year for very obvious reasons. so yes, it's more active. and yes, my new role certainly will involve me in looking at strategic opportunities for the business across our footprint. i don't really think you would expect me to give any kind of indication of where we might be looking to transact or what kinds of transactions we might look at. we're very conscious that, in february of last year, we said on our earnings call then that we would look to focus the business more on the higher-margin assets, and that remains our strategy.
so that can lead you to some fairly obvious conclusions, i would think, about the geographies that we would be looking at. but as to timing, i don't think we would want to say anything more at the moment other than that things are certainly getting more active, and we will continue to evaluate all opportunities as they appear and as we would consider that they would deliver shareholder value. i think i should just leave it at that.
lance vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
that's great. and my another question is just and not to be the pepper in the punchbowl here, but what about the delta variant? i mean, it doesn't sound like you're worried about it, but why doesn't that risk derailing the recovery, in your view?
william eccleshare -- - chief executive officer, president & director
yes, i mean, i think i'm, what i would say, appropriately worried about it. any variant of this virus is concerning to us. and we've all seen too much over the last 15, 16 months to be in any way complacent. what i would say is what i've observed, and we've had more experience of it in europe than in the u.s so far, what i've observed and what i think is confirmed by all of the analysis, although the delta variant is highly infectious, it does appear that the vaccines do offer some significant resistance and are resulting in significantly lower hospitalizations as a result of [indecipherable]. as a result of that, i think it is highly probable that governments will continue to resist imposing any further restrictions.
and as you'll know, in the u.k., which has been the most affected by the delta variants so far; in the u.k., our government has taken a very conscious decision to unlock the economy and remove restrictions at the very time that infections from the delta variant were increasing. and they've done that because they feel confident around the hospitalization rate. so look, i'm not an epidemiologist. i'm not an expert on the topic. but i would say, based on what we know today, our views about the second half of the year stand as stated and reflect a confidence in the recovery. if something changes in the way in which the vaccines protect against the delta variant, then all bets are off. but that's how i see it at the moment.
lance vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you so much guys.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of jim goss with barrington research.
jim goss -- barrington research associates -- analyst
thank you. i have a couple of question also. first, going back to the margin question. would you say the domestic margins should have a sustainable target level north of 40% as [indecipherable] recover in all areas and you've got the benefit of digital, and you also have potentially some cost and expenses that may have been cut during the pandemic that you might be able to keep under control in the future? that would be the first question.
scott wells -- executive vice president & chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas
brian, do you want me to speak to that? or do you want to take that one?
william eccleshare -- - chief executive officer, president & director
i think brian is going to take it.
brian d. coleman -- executive vice president, treasurer & chief financial officer
yes, i'm sorry scott, i'll take it, and then, obviously, you can have some color and add in, if you'd like. look, 40% sounds like pre-covid level margins in the u.s., and i think that that's certainly something we'll strive for. we do have some tailwinds from cost-saving initiatives that we've put in place and other things, but we also -- headwinds from such things as portfolio mix. so i think the first thing that has to happen is we have to get back to the revenue level. but even once we get back to the revenue level, we'll really need to work on keeping the cost savings in place to get back to that 40% level, because we do have to make up for some portfolio mix changes. and that's just the nature of the business, that even if revenues go back to 2019, it doesn't mean your business make-up is the same. and so those are kind of the pushes and pulls. we likely will need to continue to work at it to get back to the 40% level, but we won't be far off as we continue to recover from covid. scott, do you have any additional color you'd like to add?
scott wells -- executive vice president & chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas
i mean, i think the only other thing i'd call out is that seasonality does matter in this business, and so it may not be 40% every quarter as we think about that as things play out. but i think your answer is right on.
jim goss -- barrington research associates -- analyst
okay thanks though. and one other thing maybe i'll touch on. the increase for digital was significantly greater than the increase for billboards, and more than would be accounted for by platform changes. and i'm wondering if there are certain advertisers who are considering both formats in various areas? and what are the factors behind your decision-making? and as to what which appropriate for them? and is this starting to create a little better pricing power on the digital side as you're seeing that utilization improve?
scott wells -- executive vice president & chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas
so i'll take a run at this from the u.s., and then, william, if you want to add anything internationally, we can touch on that, as well. so i guess, first and foremost, as you look at the recovery, you got to remember how things fell, too, because our printed assets did not fall nearly as far as digital did. and so part of why you're seeing the big growth in digital now is because it's comping against significantly worse numbers. if you go back and look at our q2 of last year, digital was hit much harder than printed. in terms of your question about advertisers making decisions, i think there's a variety of things going on and foremost, digital has an immediacy to it. and so, with advertisers reacting to things rolling out across the country. digital has given them a very convenient way to activate in markets as markets get more secure, more stable, and people get out on the streets more and things like that.
i think we're developing different use cases for digital, whether it's in the programmatic use case or roadblocks, or something that we're doing more and more of. there are just different use cases for it that advertisers use, whether it's for a film release or for a new product launch or trying to sustain momentum in a place like a cpg-type product where they're looking to heavy up. digital gives them the ability to do it. so i do think digital, it has been a premium product since we developed it. it remains a premium product. it's on some of our best locations that we've converted to digital. and so i do think it's something that we receive very attractive economics for. and in this business, whenever you have demand strong, you see that dynamic. william, i don't know if you'd add anything incremental to that, as well.
william eccleshare -- - chief executive officer, president & director
no, i think you've nailed it, scott. thank you.
jim goss -- barrington research associates -- analyst
and lastly, are there any broad categories showing greater resilience? you've mentioned a couple of the consumer technology, media. are there some that are really driving the recovery right now for you?
scott wells -- executive vice president & chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas
again, sort of from a u.s. perspective, we went out and got a number of new categories active during covid. and what we're seeing now, as things build back, is some of the industries that were hit really hard during covid are coming back. so theatrical is probably the most obvious in terms of film releases. we've had a number of good, strong film releases this year and a really good pipeline of film releases coming. so they've come back. amusements have come back. you've seen travel and leisure come back. those are all categories that were hit really hard, and that's building on top of some things like in home improvement, real estate, categories that we actually were able to develop pretty successfully during covid. so it's a good time in the business right now, have traditional advertisers coming back, building on top of some new categories that we've done a lot to develop during covid.
jim goss -- barrington research associates -- analyst
okay thanks. and congratulations scott. that's it.
operator
thank you. there are no additional questions at this time. i would like to turn it back over to mr. eccleshare for closing remarks.
william eccleshare -- - chief executive officer, president & director
thank you, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. i just wanted to end by just making a few comments as we announced the ceo transition today. i don't step down until the end of the year, and i will continue to serve the company, as you know, as executive vice chairman into 2022. but i would just like to say it has truly been a great honor for me to lead this business over the last few years, to lead the digital transformation of the greatest mass reach medium of them all. to take this company into full public ownership with a full nyse listing, it was a fantastic step for this business. to lead this business through the pandemic and see the resilience of our people, and i have enormous pride in the way that our people stepped up and continued to drive and develop the business in really tough circumstances.
and finally, to say that the pride i have in handing over to scott as my successor, who i know will continue to build the business, to grow the business and to develop it and build on all of the things that we've done over the last years. so just thank you to everybody. you will continue to hear my voice on this call certainly for the next earnings call. and thanks, everybody, for joining us.

good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join today's call. i'm pleased to report that we're seeing a substantial rebound in our business, not only in the second quarter but into the balance of the year. we've strengthened the top line and improved profitability. with advertisers returning, we believe we're in a stronger position to capitalize on the growth potential of our out-of-home platform, including continued investments in technology to drive growth in our higher-margin market, particularly in the americas, while maintaining our financial flexibility and objective to de-lever the balance sheet and unlock shareholder value. with the business showing clear signs of recovery, i have decided that now is the right time to implement our succession plan and for me to transition from the operational leadership of the company.
i'll be assuming the new role of executive vice chairman starting january 1, 2022, and will be supporting the management transition and leading the strategic m&a activity in our ongoing efforts to optimize our portfolio. i'm also delighted to announce that scott wells will take over as ceo while continuing in his current role as ceo of clear channel outdoor americas, and he will join me on the cco board. scott and i have worked together in a variety of roles since the day i started at clear channel, when he was an operating partner at bain capital, our former pe sponsor. i know that many of you on this call have had opportunity to speak to scott in his role as ceo of our americas business and are familiar with his deep knowledge of our business and the and his team have delivered in the americas division over the past seven years. scott has outstanding previous experience and a proven track record in leading the americas segment's technology and data-driven transformation strategy, resulting in strong growth prior to the onset of covid.
furthermore, during the pandemic, scott and his team have moved quickly to stabilize the business, costs, and position our americas business for a strong rebound that is now underway. i greatly admire all that scott has achieved, and i look forward to continuing to collaborate with him as we focus on maximizing the performance of the company in this next chapter in our history. justin cochrane, the current ceo of our europe segment, will continue in his role and will join these calls in the future to share the results from the europe segment. i would also like to take this time to thank the incredible clear channel team for their dedication and hard work in managing through the most difficult business environment have ever experienced. their ability to adapt to the quickly changing marketplace has ensured that we are in the best possible position to accelerate our recovery by capitalizing on the increasing demand for our medium as consumers return to the streets. moving back now to the review of our business.
we delivered better-than-anticipated consolidated revenue of $531 million in the second quarter, up 63% compared to the prior year, excluding fx and china. americas revenue was $272 million, up 36% at the high end of our guidance, and europe revenue was $247 million, or $224 million excluding fx, up 109%, which exceeded our guidance. encouragingly, we saw a steady improvement in our top-line performance each month as the second quarter progressed. we achieved about 70% of 2019 revenue in april, 80% in may and 90% in june for our americas and europe segments combined, excluding fx. moreover, we are continuing to see positive momentum building our business in the current quarter as the recovery takes shape across our footprint. all of our business segments are growing well ahead of last year, with some markets now beginning to either match or exceed 2019 levels.
as a result of the continued strong rebound we're seeing in our business, we're now increasing the revenue guidance for the second half of the year that we previously provided in our q1 earnings call from nearly 90% to about 95% of 2019 revenue, excluding fx in china. the recovery is across the board, led primarily by our digital roadside business. in short, business is back, and we are very excited about the trends we're seeing and our ability to capitalize on the recovery underway. during the covid crisis, we continued to strategically invest in our business while aggressively addressing our cost structure. we believe we are emerging from the covid crisis with a stronger and more dynamic platform, better positioned to deliver a broader and more valuable mix of actionable insights to advertisers, combined with even greater flexibility in delivering highly targeted campaigns at the right time and in the right place.
these investments have energized our organization and have given our sales teams even stronger resources to present to new and returning advertisers. now let me provide a brief update on each of our business segments, beginning with the americas. americas. based on the information we have for the third quarter, we expect americas revenue to be between $350 million and $325 million, with our segment adjusted ebitda margin expected to return close to 2019 levels. this would put our third quarter revenue performance for the americas within a few percentage points of our top-line performance in the third quarter of 2019. in the third quarter, we are experiencing notable uptick in demand as momentum builds and advertisers recognize the breadth of the recovery underway and the need to rebuild their campaigns, refresh their brands and connect with consumers.
the majority of our markets are showing considerable improvement, driven in large part by our digital business. we're now seeing a strong rebound in airports and in big cities, such as l.a. and new york, as well as in key verticals that had previously been negatively impacted by the pandemic, including theatrical, retail and financial services. we're continuing to see some name-brand advertisers return to the out-of-home market after having been gone for years. this renewed interest is due in part to their recognition of the advancements we've made in our technology, including our radar suite of solutions. with regard to our technology investments, we deployed 26 new digital billboards in the second quarter, giving us a total of more than 1,500 digital billboards across the united states. we also continued to strengthen our radar platform and programmatic solutions through the completion of multiple integrations with our strong base of partners.
these partnerships further elevate our data analytics capabilities and our ability to measure the impact of our assets on consumer reach and decision-making. for example, earlier this month, in a first for our industry, we entered into a partnership with foursquare to provide brands with daily campaign performance metrics across our digital displays. using this new solution, powered by foursquare's attribution product, our customers can evaluate an ad's performance by geography, time of day, demographic and historical visitations. they can then use this data to understand consumers' exposure to our displays and subsequent visits to retail locations and other points of interest. this is the kind of offering that is attracting new advertisers to out-of-home. we are not static billboards. we are a dynamic, addressable ecosystem.
europe. turning to our business in europe, based on the information we have today, we expect third quarter segment revenue to be between $245 million and $255 million, representing about 95% of europe's top-line performance in the third quarter of 2019, excluding fx. we are very encouraged with the trends we're seeing. in q2, all our significant markets showed strong improvements versus trading seen earlier in the year, and advertiser sentiment remained positive, reflecting pent-up demand and the return of large sporting events, supporting our optimism regarding the future of our business. adding to our momentum, we are now actively in pursuit of contract tenders, which have begun to open up again. in belgium, we were awarded a 10-year outdoor advertising contract covering belgium's train stations.
with digital screens in more than 46 cities currently, we ultimately plan to grow our digital presence to 800 screens located in more than 100 stations across the country. in france, we were recently awarded the street furniture contract for aix-en-provence. in barcelona, we renewed the outdoor advertising contract covering the bus stops across the city. overall, we now operate 5,000 advertising places in the barcelona metropolitan area and expect to surpass 150 digital street furniture units by the year-end. supporting our ability to take full advantage of the recovery, our digital footprint continues to expand in europe. we added 68 digital displays in the second quarter for a total of over 16,600 screens now live. building on the strength of our platform, our radar rollout has been well-received in the u.k. and spain and has now been introduced for audience proximity planning in all of our major european markets.
the introduction of our programmatic offering in europe, clear channel launchpad, has also gone according to plan. following recent launches in the u.k., switzerland, spain, finland and the netherlands, we launched in belgium in june, and we are completing the launch in italy. so in summary, revenue momentum is clearly building across our business as the recovery gains steam and our markets continue to open up. advertisers are gaining confidence as vaccination rates increase, remaining restrictions are eased and mobility builds. we are now seeing previously hard-hit categories begin to light up again, which is broadening our revenue base and strengthening our outlook. we are well-positioned to maximize the performance of our portfolio, given the investments we have made in our digital, data analytics and programmatic resources, as well as our efforts to stay in front of advertisers throughout the pandemic. we are now seeing a very healthy rebound in our business. and with that, let me turn it over to brian to discuss our second quarter 2021 financial results.
brian d. coleman -- executive vice president, treasurer & chief financial officer
thank you, william. good morning, everyone. thank you for joining our call. as william mentioned, we saw a substantial rebound in our business in the second quarter, with june revenue for americas and europe combined about 90% of 2019 revenue, excluding fx in china, and we are optimistic about our growth through the balance of the year. however, we continue to manage our cost base, including negotiating rent abatements in some of the markets most affected by covid-19 as well as strengthening our capital structure. moving on to the results on slide 4. in the second quarter, consolidated revenue increased 68.6% to $531 million. adjusting for fx in china, revenue was up 63.4%. consolidated net loss in the second quarter was $124 million compared to a consolidated net loss of $143 million in q2 of 2020.
consolidated adjusted ebitda was $97 million in q2 of 2021, a substantial improvement over q2 2020, which was negative $63 million. adjusting for fx, consolidated adjusted ebitda was $99 million in q2 of 2021. please turn to slide five for a review of americas' second quarter results. the americas segment revenue was $272 million in the second quarter of 2021, up 36% compared to the prior year and at the high end of the guidance we provided in may. digital revenue rebounded strongly and was up 73.8% to $85 million. local continues to rebound faster than national and was up 39.7%, with national up 30.2%. direct operating and sg&a expenses were down 5.7%. the decline is due in part to a 14.2% decline in site lease expense as a result of negotiated rent abatements. additionally, credit loss expense was reduced due to improved collections and outlook.
these were partially offset by higher compensation costs, driven by improvements in operating performance. segment adjusted ebitda was $127 million, up 170.6% compared to the second quarter of last year, with segment-adjusted ebitda margin well above-average due in large part to nonrecurring items, including the negotiated rent abatements. please turn to slide 6. this slide breaks out our billboard and transit revenue. billboard and other was up 42.6%, while transit was down 4.2%, with airport display revenue down 4.7% to $25 million. turning to slide seven for a bit more detail on billboard and others q2 revenue performance. digital revenue from billboards, street furniture and spectaculars rebounded strongly in q2 and was up 97.6% to $75 million, with non-digital up 27.1%. next, please turn to slide eight and a review of our performance in europe.
please note that, as i comment on the percentage change from the prior year, all percentages are adjusted for foreign exchange. europe revenue was $247 million. adjusting for foreign exchange revenue was $224 million, up 108.8% compared to the second quarter of the prior year, ahead of guidance we provided in our q1 earnings call. revenue was up across all countries, most notably in france and the u.k., and digital revenue was up 159.6%, a strong performance driven in large part by the rebound in the u.k. direct operating and sg&a expenses were up 33.2% compared to the second quarter of last year. the largest driver of the increase in direct operating expense was higher site lease expense, which increased 28.9% to $100 million after adjusting for fx due to lower negotiated rent abatements, higher revenue and new contracts.
sg&a expenses increased due to higher compensation expense as we ceased the temporary operating cost savings initiatives implemented in the prior year, combined with lower government support and wage subsidies and higher commissions in the current year. additionally, direct operating expense and sg&a expense increased due to $16 million of severance and related costs for the restructuring plan. these expenses are not included in segment adjusted ebitda. segment adjusted ebitda was $2 million after adjusting for foreign exchange. this is compared to negative $69 million in q2 of 2020. moving on to ccibv. our europe segment consists of the businesses operated by ccibv and its consolidated subsidiary. accordingly, the revenue for our europe segment is the same as the revenue for ccibv.
europe segment adjusted ebitda, the segment profitability metric reported in our financial statements, does not include an allocation of ccibv's corporate expenses that are deducted from ccibv's operating income and adjusted ebitda. ccibv revenue increased $140 million during the second quarter of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020 to $247 million. after adjusting for a $23 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, ccibv revenue increased $117 million. ccibv's operating loss was $40 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $99 million in the same period of 2020. let's move to slide nine and a quick review of other, which includes latin america. as a reminder, the prior-year results include clear media, which was divested on april 28, 2020. latin america revenue was $12 million in the second quarter, up $9 million compared to the same period last year.
direct operating expense and sg&a from our latin american business were $13 million, up $4 million compared to the second quarter in the prior year. latin america ebitda was negative $1 million. now, moving to slide 10 and a review of capital expenditures. capex totaled $32 million in the second quarter, an increase of approximately $8 million compared to the prior year as we ramped up our investment in our americas business. onto slide 11, clear channel outdoors' consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled $564 million as of june 30, 2021. our debt was $5.7 billion, up $169 million, due in large part to the refinancing of the ccwh senior notes in february and june. cash paid for interest on the debt was $67 million during the second quarter and $212 million year-to-date. our weighted average cost of debt was 5.6% as of june 30, 2021. moving on to slide 12.
as mentioned, we continue to focus on managing our cost base and strengthening our capital structure. this includes achieving $35 million in rent abatements in the second quarter on a consolidated basis as a result of successful six site lease negotiations. the majority of the rent abatements in the quarter were in our americas segment. also, we received european governmental support and wage subsidies in the spot of $2 million in the second quarter. in june, we successfully completed an offering of $1.05 billion of 7.5% ccoh senior notes through 2029. we used the net proceeds from the offering to redeem the remaining outstanding 9.25% ccwh senior notes through 2024.
additionally, as we previously announced in may, we entered into a second amendment to the senior secured credit agreement, extending the suspension of the springing financial covenant through december 31, 2021 and further delaying the step-down until september 30, 2022. lastly, in june, one of our non-guarantor european subsidiaries entered into a state-guaranteed bond for approximately $36 million at current exchange rates, which is guaranteed by the government of that country in response to covid-19. and finishing with our guidance. as william mentioned, for the third quarter of 2021, americas segment revenue is expected to be in the range of between $315 million and $325 million. the adjusted ebitda margin expected to return to close to q3 2019 levels. our europe segment revenue is expected to be in the range of between $245 million and $255 million adjusting for fx.
given our improved outlook, we are revising our second half revenue guidance from nearly 90% of 2019 levels to about 95%, excluding fx in china. the recovery is across the board, led primarily by our digital roadside businesses. additionally, we expect cash interest payments of $175 million in the last six months of 2021 and $324 million in 2022. we expect consolidated capital expenditures to be in the $165 million to $175 million range in 2021. this increase reflects our optimism regarding our prospects and our ability to capture new prospects to drive growth. lastly, we are increasing our guidance for our liquidity balance as of december 31, 2021, including unrestricted cash and availability under the company's revolving credit facilities. we expect the balance to be approximately $475 million to $525 million, a $50 million increase from the guidance provided in may. please keep in mind that liquidity could vary based on timing of cash receipts and/or payments at year-end. that concludes my remarks. and now, let me turn the call back over to will.
william eccleshare -- - chief executive officer, president & director
thanks, brian. the recovery is now well underway across our markets, and we are continuing to see solid revenue momentum in the second half of the year, with several of our markets ahead of 2019. we remain focused on strategically investing in our technology, including expanding our digital platform, further strengthening our data analytics capabilities and building our programmatic resources, with the aim of broadening our presence among a greater number of advertisers and increasing our market share. our business is soundly rebounding. our organization is energized, and we are very excited about the growth trends that are building across our markets.
as we invest in our platform, we will also continue to carefully manage our costs, supporting our efforts to drive profitable growth over the long-term, as well as maintaining our financial flexibility and objective to de-lever the balance sheet. as i mentioned earlier, i'm very excited about the future of the company and look forward to speaking with many of you over the next few months as we prepare for the leadership transition, with scott taking over as ceo at the end of the year. and now, let me turn over the call to the operator for the q&a session.

[operator instructions] we'll take a question from steven cahall of wells fargo.
steven cahall -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thanks. and maybe first, scott, you mentioned national is growing, i think, a little bit better than local. do you anticipate national becoming a bigger proportion of revenue over time, but still as you use radar and maybe have more agency buys and if that does happens, does that give you any benefits to your ebitda margins?
scott wells -- chief executive officer, clear channel outdoor americas
thanks, steve. so, right now, we're right around 37% on national and historically we've been closer to 40%. so i think there's definitely short-term room to improve. i also think that there is room beyond that for the reasons that you mentioned and our programmatic business skews a little bit national as well. and so, that's an opportunity to drive it.
national does tend to buy our very best assets. they tend to go for a lot of the premium locations and premium products. so, having national increase will generally help our margins, but it's not like a big light switch, it's a modest improvement as the mix moves in that direction. hopefully that helps.
steven cahall -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yeah. and then, just picking with americas, just wondering if you perceive any real benefit in the quarter from rent abatement activity? and as we think about maybe some of those cost catching up next year, any commentary you could provide on how we should think about americas' margins or operating leverage?
scott wells -- chief executive officer, clear channel outdoor americas
yeah, i think i'm going to have brian speak to that. but, yeah, we definitely have an opinion here.
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah. and i would answer that for the entire company, because i'm not sure the story is that much different in the americas than it is internationally. and that is, our operating teams continue to work with our municipal partners and our various landlords on seeking appropriate rent abatements. and we're going to see some of that in the fourth quarter.
i mean, we saw some of that in the third quarter, about $22 million of the $79 million year-to-date. we would expect that to continue for the next few quarters into q4 and on, albeit likely at a decreasing rate as the business starts to improve. and so, i think that the team is doing a good job. there is a bit of a lag, so it may continue for a while. it is impacting our margins. i think you can see both in the results and in the guidance that our margins are back to levels at or around 2019. but that does reflect some of these rent abatements and temporary cost savings. so, i think that's the right way to think about rent abatements both in the americas and internationally.
steven cahall -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. and then, lastly, how are you thinking about capex for next year? just as the business continues to improve and get back to prior levels, you are confident enough to pay down some debt in the quarter and may good capex came up, so signals like we're sort of getting back to normal and maybe relatedly any more color on some of these additional potential tuck-in americas acquisitions that you highlighted? thanks.
scott wells -- chief executive officer, clear channel outdoor americas
yeah, steve, i think you hit it. as our business normalizes and we are -- we do have visibility and that looks like it is recovering. you should expect our 2022 capex to also go back to kind of pre-covid levels. i think that's a good estimate and that number is probably $200 million, $225 million. it would exclude china because we no longer have that operation.
i think, in addition to that, you are seeing enough of these tuck-in acquisitions that we chose to kind of break it out in our commentary. that number is about $20 million, $25 million, we do expect. that could close in the fourth quarter. it could go on a little longer. each one of those acquisitions takes a little bit of time and it's difficult to predict.
but it was material enough that we wanted to break it out. and i think the other thing is, it's reflective of the current environment. the recovery has brought potential sellers into the market for various reasons. the valuation gap has narrowed. these are unique opportunities that we want to take advantage of. we are in a position where we can. i think you've heard others talk about it. so, as long as it's a material number, we'll continue to talk about it and it would be on top of our capex expectations. so, really leading into these opportunities if they're available and i think it's a positive reflection of where we see the business.
steven cahall -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. thank you.
scott wells -- chief executive officer, clear channel outdoor americas
thanks, steve.

our next question is from cameron mcveigh of morgan stanley.
cameron mcveigh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, guys. this is cameron for ben. we would be interested in which verticals in the us have not fully recovered. and then, as a follow-on, how earlier 2022 bookings looking versus pre-covid growth rates? thanks.
scott wells -- chief executive officer, clear channel outdoor americas
sure. i think both of those are us, so i'll take them. thanks for the questions, cameron. on the verticals, we have seen good recovery pretty broadly lagging relative to historical norms would be areas like amusements, theatrical and restaurants. but they're not lagging a ton and particularly theatrical has really been bouncing back nicely and has a really strong pipeline of releases that bode well and they're using the medium very effectively. so, those would be the ones what i'd call out on kind of not fully recovered.
as far as early '22, it's too early for us to give a full read on 2022, but what we're seeing right now is the early buying and the early bookings is that we're running nicely ahead of pre-pandemic times. so, it looks like we are positioned for a strong 2022.
cameron mcveigh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks.
operator
our next question is from lance vitanza of cowen.
lance vitanza -- cowen -- analyst
hi. thanks guys for taking the questions. i have one on us and one on europe. in the us, the digital has 33% of the billboard revenues. could you remind me what's the all-time high in that number? and when do you expect to get back to that or if the all-time high, where do you think that this percentage goes in, say, three to five years? is there a point in the future where it's -- where half of the business is digital or how are you thinking about that?
scott wells -- chief executive officer, clear channel outdoor americas
yeah. so, lance, i don't have at my fingertips the all-time high, but we'll follow-up with you and get you that information. you're asking specifically about billboards. i think that a third of the revenue was about the all-time high in the us for all digital across everything. i'm not a 100% sure. it's in the ballpark of what our all-time high in billboards would have been, but i am not sure if that's exactly the highest. so, on the first part of your question, we'll follow-up.
the second part of the question, in terms of where it could go, this is -- i'm sure you get tired of hearing us talk about regulation and the regulatory constraints. but there are markets in the us that are north of 50%. i think we've talked about the uk being north of 60% in terms of digital revenue. and i think the potential for the business is quite a bit higher than a third. but the path to get to it, it's going to require more cities embracing digital signage and us getting the ability to convert more and more universally, because within our portfolio, i think this is again something i've mentioned before. we have markets that are at zero percentage and we have markets that are in the mid-50s.
so, the range is -- and then, of course, internationally, it's even higher in the uk. so, i think it is going to be a long-term trend for us. i think we're going to see that number creep up over time. but it probably won't be a sudden move, it will probably just be a steady move over the years to come.
lance vitanza -- cowen -- analyst
that's helpful. thanks. and then, with respect to europe, could you discuss within a little bit more detail the situation in france in particular, and i apologize if you probably called this out in the prepared remarks. but where did you come out versus 2019 in france? and is that business profitable today?
scott wells -- chief executive officer, clear channel outdoor americas
we can't break out the individual performances of the european market. so, i can't be specific on the exact numbers or i wouldn't say the prompt that's showing strong recovery along with most of our other major european markets. so we are certainly seeing a strong snap back in the french business and recovering very, very well. but we don't give individual performances for the individual european markets.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
the only thing i would add is, we are also going through the restructuring plan in the europe. some of that would be in france as well. and you should expect to see results from the restructuring plan starting now in 2022, but largely finished in 2023.
lance vitanza -- cowen -- analyst
thanks very much. appreciate it.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
we'll take our next question from david joyce of barclays.
david joyce -- barclays -- analyst
thank you. first, i wanted to clarify something. it seems like the capex guidance for the year is a little bit below you previously discussed. is that because of the tuck-ins that you just mentioned, the $20 million, $25 million being a replacement use of cash? and then, secondly, is there anything you can point to your digital revenue growth is taking share from other media or share management [phonetic]? thank you.
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer
david, i'll take the first one and then i'll flip it to scott for the second piece of that. you are spot on. it does look like our capex guidance came down a little bit. and the way to think about that is, when acquisitions are immaterial, which they have been largely over the past few quarters, these are just kind of look at capex and you can kind of include that number in the capex guidance. we don't want to like not talk about cash needs.
but i think when you get to the level we are out today, it's more appropriate to break it out. so, in aggregate, i think we're still within or actually have increased the range for capex and acquisitions if you combine the two numbers. but since we broke out acquisitions, capex look like it -- that we tracked it a little bit. so, you are thinking about it the right way. i think going forward, we're just going to break the two out they are different. so, that's probably the best way to handle it.
and then, scott, over to you for the digital question.
scott wells -- chief executive officer, clear channel outdoor americas
yeah. i'm happy to take a crack at it for the us. and then, william, you can weigh in if there are other aspects of it internationally. it is always difficult to pin down in the aggregate ad budget flows. you get buried under anecdotes very quickly when you look at what goes on. but the couple of things that i'd anchor on it, it's really specific to the programmatic space. the vast majority of our programmatic ad revenue is coming in via non-traditional agency partners. it's not predominantly coming from the agency partners and the agency divisions that buy out-of-home. and so, as we grow programmatic, i do believe that that is a tangible way to think about us capturing more of the digital ad budget space.
and it's still small to a degree that you're not going to see percentage points moved in that, but i think it gives us a lot of headroom as we think about capturing those budgets. i mean, as i think about the conversations we're having with advertisers, the two primary things that we're having related to other media in terms of the role that we are playing is, helping people diversify away from digital where they feel like they were overexposed pre-covid and during covid. they got even more overexposed digital display and searching and so forth. and then, the other place that i see us having dialogue about other media is around television and us playing a role that linear tv used to play that of being able to have a broad reach.
i don't know, william, if there are other aspects you could call out from your perspectives.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
no, i mean, i think the direction of travel is exactly as scott described it, europe is a little bit behind the us in terms of the developments of programmatic platforms for out-of-home. so that is the direction of travel and that was an enabler to i think be able to take more share from digital -- the digital platforms.
david joyce -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
[operator instructions] we'll go next to jim goss of barrington research.
jim goss -- barrington research -- analyst
thank you. and good luck, william. you've had a challenging period to manage through. so, congratulations on that.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
thank you.
jim goss -- barrington research -- analyst
the one question i have is, i am interested in the new advertisers that you've been able to secure sort of a best kept secret that's right in front of us. i am wondering, what is driving the new awareness and the adaption and maybe just comment on that a little bit?
scott wells -- chief executive officer, clear channel outdoor americas
sure. so, i'll again take a first pass at it and then, william, if i miss anything, you should definitely way in. we are working on a number of fronts to bring in new advertisers. we have evolved our sales model to have people devoted to calling on large brands as well as calling on the strategy in planning parts of agencies in a way that we historically have not been arrayed. and so, part of what's going on is that, we're just covering the market better and i think that continues to have upside for us, not just at the large advertiser end, but also at the small advertiser end of the spectrum. william talked about it as meeting advertisers where we are -- where they are, excuse me. and that has been a really important theme for us as we array our sales forces.
so, that's sort of the first part of it. the second part of it is that, we are bringing to bear new capabilities that many people don't associate with out-of-home, particularly data and analytics, but also the ability to trade programmatically. and you put those two things together, you are having a very contemporary conversation with advertisers relative to what out-of-home was having five or six years ago. and so, that is really what's making it possible for us to bring in new advertisers in the category. we're able to do things like associate with app downloads, look at the impact of an out-of-home campaign on people downloading apps. we are able to look at prescription uptick as a result of out-of-home campaigns.
the types of things we're able to measure and that we're able to bring attribution are much richer than they were just a couple of years ago. and the advertisers are very focused on data and very focused on seeing roi and we're making it easier for them to do that. so, those are the kind of things that are leading to us bring new advertisers of category.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
yeah. and the only thing i would add within europe is, we have been putting quite an effort into it and we'd start on -- encouraging start-up -- enterprising start-up companies to come into the medium and explore the way in which we could run with a low cost of entering into advertising and they can build brand awareness and drive activity through the use of our medium.
jim goss -- barrington research -- analyst
okay. and you just been mentioning data analytics and links to other media, are these likely to remain sort of informal types or are they going to be far more relationships to establishing to create those bonds?
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
when you say formal relationships, you mean with other media or what do you mean?
jim goss -- barrington research -- analyst
yeah. yes, with other media sellers.
scott wells -- chief executive officer, clear channel outdoor americas
where this is happening, jim, is it's happening in the data management platforms of the advertisers a lot of the time. many of the advertisers have spent extraordinary amounts to build first-party data on their customers. and what we're enabling is the ability to associate out-of-home assets in analyses that they are doing with other media. so, it's often the agency or the advertiser themselves that are doing those analytics. we're just enabling it by offering the feed of data on audiences that are exposed to out-of-home.
jim goss -- barrington research -- analyst
okay. and one last one, if i could? could you comment on the impact on your airport business with the us borders reopening? is there any shape or scope of any recovery that you can draw attention to?
scott wells -- chief executive officer, clear channel outdoor americas
i mean, yeah, we were seeing -- that just happened yesterday. william was actually on the first da flight that was generally opened with the bac. everyone has quite a celebration coming to the jfk. but that has been something we've been aware of for six or eight weeks. you can see in our results that airports was having a good trajectory on their recovery already in q3. and i'd just say that that trajectory has continued into q4 and we are definitely seeing advertisers get excited about the fact that international travels happening. it's probably a little early to declare that we are back on the international part of it, given the first flight was just yesterday. the first flight, i should say, were just yesterday. but i would say, it's a very encouraging development for sure.
jim goss -- barrington research -- analyst
great. thanks very much.
operator
i'd be happy to return the call to management for concluding comments.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
great. thank you very much and thanks everybody for engaging with us this morning and for the maximum questions as ever. that has been the first time that scott, brian and i being in a room together for the 21 months. as scott just referenced, the skies are opening and it's been really good to be in a room together and i had a seamless q&a as we've been working together on this.
and my final remarks, again, just to thank everybody for their support. you are in really excellent hands with scott leading the business and brian continuing as cfo. so it's a great leadership team that we have here. i am pleased to be able to announce the kind of talking gesture that we will be issuing our first esg report in the next few weeks, which pulls together all of the really excellent work that we do around environmental and social issues all around our global business and that report will be available on the investor website within the next few weeks.
and i commend it to you it's quite an impressive record of all that we do. so, with that said, i will say, thank you very much indeed. wish everybody all the very best and we look forward to talking to you over the coming weeks and months. thanks.

william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
good morning, everyone. and thank you for taking the time to join today's call. we delivered very strong results during the third quarter and we entered the fourth quarter with continuing business momentum that we capitalized on the broad base recovery we are seeing across our markets. advertisers are returning to launch new campaigns and rebuild brand awareness. this rebound, together with new advertisers discovering our medium for the first time, is driving growth in many of our markets ahead of 2019 revenue levels in both our digital and traditional assets.
our consolidated revenue in the third quarter increased 33.3% over the prior year. excluding fx, consolidated revenue was $590 million, up 31.8% over the prior year. america's revenue was $319 million, up 42.6%, in line with our guidance and 97% to 2019 revenue. europe revenue was $256 million, up 18.2%, which was slightly ahead of our guidance and 97% of 2019 revenue, both excluding fx.
as we have highlighted on past calls, we have a resilient business that has consistently demonstrated its ability to bounce back from macro disruptions. we are clearly seeing this occur and we are very pleased with how our business is performing in the current quarter. and it is with that confidence in our business and liquidity position that we've repaid the $130 million outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility.
coming out of covid, advertisers are embracing out-of-home as they recognize the enhanced capabilities we have built into our platform. the power of our assets is only matched by our team of talented and dedicated people and the deep relationships they have maintained across the industry throughout the pandemic.
given the expansion of our digital footprint and the related strategic investments in both data analytics and programmatic that we have made in our platform, advertisers are now utilizing an even stronger set of tools that will allow them to expand this relationship through highly creative addressable and measurable solutions. we are meeting our customers where they are by building on the very best features of out-of-home and elevating what we can do for advertisers and their brands in a compelling manner. and so, this is an exciting time for our business as we execute on our vision to expand our share of total advertising spend.
as we focus on delivering profitable growth, we also remain committed to reducing our overall indebtedness, strengthening our balance sheet and elevating our ability to benefit from the operating leverage in our model. as part of this effort and as momentum builds in our business, we will continue to evaluate disposition opportunities in line with our strategic goals and in the best interest of our shareholders.
now let me provide a brief update on each of our business segments, beginning with americas. based on the information we have for the fourth quarter, we expect americas revenue to be in the range of $360 million and $370 million, which is above the $345 million we reported in the 2019 comparable period, reflecting the strong momentum in our business as we close out the year.
in the current quarter, we are continuing to experience a notable uptick in demand with a strong volume of rfps. national is increasing over the prior year at a slightly faster rate than local. based on our current revenue bookings, all our small and most medium-sized markets are pacing above q4 2019. we still haven't fully rebounded in a few markets in california, including san francisco, although la, which is our largest market is now above 2019.
in our larger markets, in addition to la, new york, miami and dallas are also exceeding 2019 levels, with houston and boston plays behind. i would also highlight a promising rebound we are seeing in airports across the country. we believe our success is distributed to our teams doing a better job of servicing our customer needs and matching them to the best asset types. for example, our traditional sales team is now selling our airport inventory. we should note at this point, inflation and supply chain issues are not materially impacting our business, but we are of course keeping an eye on macro trends on how they are playing out.
our digital billboards business, which continues to lead the recovery, is central to our long-term growth strategy. we deployed 17 new digital billboards in the third quarter, giving us a total of more than 1,500 digital billboards across the united states. we are and we remain at the forefront in driving innovation in the out-of-home industry. we've built a dynamic platform that delivers mass broadcast level reach, along with the sophisticated insights similar to the digital display platforms with the ability to target consumers on the move.
our radar solutions continue scaling up and opening new opportunities, including with major cpg brands. recently, we were able to match individual consumer behaviors using our radarproof attribution tool with household purchase data from an id resolution partner, liveramp. in the cpg world, this advancement matters as households, rathan than individuals, often are the decision makers in this product category. so we can now measure the household impact of exposure to our out-of-home advertising.
for example, in separate campaigns for a snack brand, a sports beverage and new packaged food brand, we delivered household sales insights about the consumers buying these products and how out-of-home attracts new customers to these brands. radarproof also demonstrates the ability of out-of-home exposure tin increase the lifetime value of repeat brand purchases, a key metric for consumer packaged goods brands.
further, through our strategic expansion into the programmatic space, we continue to see a notable uptick in brands experimenting with programmatic and we are positioned to participate in this opportunity. for instance, these innovations are evident in our recent campaign for twitch and mediahub global to promote their second annual streamable gaming event. the campaign won best use of programmatic with digital out-of-home this year as part of adweek's annual media plan of the year awards.
our commitment to technology in improving the buying process and enhancing our ability to demonstrate attribution are key drivers of performance in our americas business. and i believe scott and his exceptional leadership team should be proud of their work in delivering such a strong performance as the business emerges from the pandemic.
turning to our business in europe, based on the information we have today, we expect fourth quarter segment revenue to be between $335 million and $350 million, which is in line with europe's top-line performance in the fourth quarter of 2019 of $349 million. all amounts exclude movements in fx. similar to the us, in europe, we are demonstrating the resilience of our platform and its ability to rapidly return to growth.
as we've noted in the past, about two-thirds of our european revenue comes from roadside assets. this has benefited our performance in the current environment, given that we have limited exposures in the transit sector, which has of course seen a greater impact from covid. this is most evident in the uk where we have continued to deliver revenue ahead of 2019. for the last six months, uk revenue has been ahead of 2019, led by the strength of our street furniture footprint and from the benefits of both new contracts and further development and investment in digital roadside inventory.
overall, we are continuing to benefit from pent-up demand across europe, although orders are still coming in later than pre-covid. based on current trends, our pipeline across cpg and retail, our largest verticals, is looking strong with fashion and beauty also looking healthy. our digital expansion is also a central part of our growth strategy in europe.
we added 314 digital screens in the third quarter for a total of over 16,900 screens now live, including digital screens in the uk, italy and ireland. and we are further elevating the value proposition of our digital footprint through the roll out of our radar suite of solutions, which is now gaining traction in all of our major european markets. for example, in spain, we are now able to target campaigns based on online behavior in addition to physical store visits and we are having significant success using the tool in the auto category where brands are able to efficiently target likely car buyers.
in addition, we recently completed the launch of our programmatic offering, launchpad in italy. and we are now executing on our programmatic strategy across the europe, allowing brands to connect at the right time with consumers through multiple touch points, planned real-time digital out-of-home campaigns and control exactly when, where and at what times the ads are deployed.
we are also continuing to selectively pursue contract tenders that meet our strategic objectives in multiple markets. in sweden, we won a seven-year contract to operate the advertising related to a public buy program in the center of stockholm, consisting of 350 static and digital panels in prime locations, further strengthening our footprint across the city.
so in summary, we are executing at a high level across every facet of our strategic plan. the recovery continues to gain momentum and we are seeing good progress in our business in the current quarter. coming out of the pandemic, we are well positioned to maximize our performance as we leverage our digital expansion and the investments we are making in our data analytics and programmatic resources, which is broadening the universe of advertisers we can pursue and strengthening our growth profile.
and with that, let me now turn it over to brian to discuss our third quarter 2021 financial results.
brian coleman -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, william. good morning, everyone. and thank you for joining our call. as william mentioned, we continued to see a strong rebound in our business as reflected in our third quarter results and outlook for the fourth quarter and we continue to manage our cost base, including negotiating rent abatements in some of the markets most affected by covid-19, as well as strengthening our capital structure.
moving on to the results on slide 4. in the third quarter, consolidated revenue increased 33.3% to $596 million. excluding fx, revenue was up 31.8%. consolidated net loss in the third quarter was $41 million compared to a consolidated net loss of $136 million in the prior year. adjusted ebitda was $136 million in the third quarter, representing a substantial improvement over the prior year, which was $31 million. excluding fx, adjusted ebitda was $135 million in the third quarter.
please turn to slide 5 for a review of the americas third quarter results. the americas segment revenue was $319 million in the third quarter, up 42.6% compared to the prior year and in line with the guidance we previously provided in july. revenue was up across all of our products, most notably print billboards, digital billboards and airport displays.
digital revenue rebounded strongly and was up 68.4% to $115 million. national local continue to improve with both up 43%. direct operating and sg&a expenses were up 15.8%. the increase is due in part to a 15.3% increase in site lease expense, driven by higher revenue combined with higher compensation cost driven by improvements in our operating performance. this was partially offset by lower credit loss expense related to our recovery from covid-19.
segment-adjusted ebitda was $139 million in the third quarter, up 96.7% compared to the prior year with segment-adjusted ebitda margin of 43.6%, above our guidance in q3 2019 results due to temporary savings, including site lease savings primarily related to airports as well as lower spending and a reduction in the credit loss expense.
please turn to slide 6. this slide breaks out our americas revenue into billboard and other and transit. billboard and other, which primarily includes revenue from billboards, street furniture, spectaculars and wallscapes, was up 37.6%. transit was up 82.7%, with airport display revenue up 88.7% to $43 million in the third quarter. airport revenue was helped by the return of airline passenger traffic and the new port authority of new york and new jersey advertising and sponsorship contracts.
please turn to slide 7 for a bit more detail on americas q3 billboard and other. digital revenue rebounded strongly in q3 and was up 59.5% to $91 million and now accounts for 33.4% of total billboard and other revenue. non-digital revenue was up 28.7%.
next, please turn to slide 8 and a review of our performance in europe. please note that as i comment on the percentage change from the prior year, all percentages are excluding movements in foreign exchange. europe revenue was $263 million in the third quarter. excluding movements in foreign exchange, revenue was $256 million, up 18.2% compared to the prior year, ahead of the guidance we provided in our second quarter earnings call. as you may remember, in q3 2020, restrictions were lifted and the business bounced back quickly, which created tougher comps than in the second quarter.
revenue in the third quarter was up across most of our products, primarily street furniture and retail displays and in most countries. digital revenue was up 39.3% to $89 million, excluding fx, a strong performance driven in large part by the rebound in the uk.
direct operating and sg&a expenses were up 6.4% compared to the third quarter of last year. the increase was largely driven by a $13 million increase in cost related to our restructuring plan to reduce headcount. as a reminder, costs related to our restructuring plan are not included in adjusted ebitda. site lease expense declined 3.7% to $99 million, excluding fx, driven by negotiated rent abatements. segment adjusted ebitda was $30 million excluding movements in foreign exchange in the third quarter as compared to negative $8 million in the prior year.
moving on to ccibv. our europe segment consists of the businesses operated by ccibv and its consolidated subsidiaries. accordingly, the revenue for our europe segment is the same as the revenue for ccibv. europe segment adjusted ebitda, the segment profitability metric reported in our financial statements does not include an allocation of ccibv's corporate expense that are deducted from ccibv's operating income and adjusted ebitda.
ccibv revenue increased $46 million during the third quarter of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020 to $263 million. after adjusting for a $6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, ccibv revenue increased $39 million. ccibv operating loss was $26 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to $38 million in the same period of 2020.
let's move to slide 9 and a quick review of other, which includes latin america. note, this is the first quarter that the prior year results do not include our china business. latin america revenue was $15 million. excluding movements in foreign exchange rates, it was $!4 million in the third quarter, up $7 million compared to the same period last year. direct operating expense and sg&a from our latin american business were $14 million, up $1 million compared to the third quarter in the prior year. latin america adjusted ebitda rounded to zero in the third quarter.
now, moving to slide 10 and a review of capital expenditures. capital expenditures totaled $33 million in the third quarter, an increase of approximately $6 million compared to the prior year period as we ramped up our investment in our americas business.
now onto slide 11. clear channel outdoors' consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled $600 million as of september 30, 2021. our debt was $5.7 billion, up $166 million, due in large part to the refinancing of the ccwh senior notes in february and in june. cash paid for interest on debt was $52 million during the third quarter and $264 million year-to-date. our weighted average cost of debt was 5.5% as of september 30, 2021, 60 basis points lower than the prior year.
additionally, as william mentioned, given our improved outlook for both our business and liquidity position, we repaid the $130 million outstanding balance under the company's revolving credit facility with cash on hand on october 26, resulting in a corresponding increase in excess availability under such revolving credit facility.
finishing with our guidance on slide 12. again, as william noted, for the fourth quarter of 2021, americas segment revenue is expected to be in the range of between $360 million and $370 million, which is above the $345 million reported in q4 2019. segment-adjusted ebitda margin is expected to return to close to q4 2019 levels of $42.3%. q4's adjusted ebitda margin is expected to benefit from the top-line improvement, but also from one-time items including site lease savings and temporary cost savings.
our europe segment revenue is expected to be in the range of between $335 million and $350 million, which is in line with europe's revenue in q4 2019 of $349 million. both the guidance and q4 2019 consolidated revenue are based on 2020 exchange rates and exclude china. our consolidated q4 revenue guidance is $715 million to $740 million, which is in line with or better than our q4 2019 consolidated revenue of $717 million. as noted above, guidance in q4 2019 consolidated revenue are based on 2020 exchange rates and exclude china.
additionally, we expect cash interest payments of $123 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 and $319 million in 2022. we expect consolidated capital expenditures to be in the $150 million to $160 million range in 2021.
lastly, we are once again increasing our guidance for liquidity as of december 31, 2021, including unrestricted cash and availability under the company's credit facilities. we expect liquidity of approximately $525 million to $575 million, a $50 million increase from the guidance provided in july. this is reflective of our improved performance and our businesses.
the guidance also includes a near-term acquisition pipeline of approximately $20 million to $25 million that we could potentially close by year end that represents small selective tuck-in billboard acquisitions in the americas. please keep in mind that liquidity could vary based on timing of cash receipts and/or payments at year-end.
that concludes my remarks. now, let me turn the call back over to william.
william eccleshare -- chief executive officer
thank you, brian. as i make the transition into the new role of executive vice chairman at the close of the year, and scott moves to take over as ceo, i am confident that we will continue to build on the momentum we're seeing in our business. we are leading the digital transformation of our industry, innovating our platform and strengthening our ability to serve a large universe of appetizers.
we're coming out of covid with a stronger and more dynamic platform supported by an energized worldwide team focused on growth and execution. as we continue to invest in our technology, while carefully managing our costs, we remain focused on driving profitable growth and evaluating all avenues to delever our balance sheet, including dispositions.
as this will be my last quarterly conference call, i'd like to thank all of our investors for their support over the last few years. it's been a pleasure to have met so many of you and have to engaged in conversations with you regarding our industry, our company and the direction of the global advertising market.
i'd also like to record my thanks to my exceptional leadership team who have maintained their focus during an extraordinary period of change both in our business and the world in which we operate. you remain of course in very good hands with scott and the management team as they continue to execute on our plan to fully surface the growth potential and intrinsic value of our assets.
so, a very heartfelt thanks to all of you. and now, let me turn over the call to the operator for the q&a session.
