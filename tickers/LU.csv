[operator instructions] the first question comes from winnie wu with bank of america. please go ahead.
winnie wu -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you very much for this opportunity and congratulations to lufax for a very good first-quarter results. and i have two questions. first, regarding the guidance upgrade. compared to the guidance provided at the full-year result, i think bottom-line number for first half is now 11% higher than previous version, which is actually a quite significant upgrade.
so just want to see if management could elaborate on some of the key drivers. and also, the outlook for full year, i think james just mentioned, it's like that momentum to continue into second half. so hopefully, it means the strong growth momentum will be maintained for the rest of this year. so that's first.
and key drivers for the earnings upgrade and potentially some outlook for second half of this year as well. second is also back to the regulatory front. i think chairman mentioned that there's more regulatory clarity. and i think investors are still concerned regarding stuff like will there be further window guidance to reduce apr, and what about some of the latest requirements like data? like ant was talking about, they need to have a credit bureau license to provide the loan facilitation business.
so hopefully, second question, if management can give us also some expectation if there's further requirement from regulator regarding particularly on data and apr front. thank you very much.
greg gibb -- co-chief executive officer
thanks, winnie. i'll take the first part and then turn the regulatory question over to chairman ji in a second. the guidance upgrade really results from a number of improvements that really exceeded even our own expectations, i think, at the end of q4 last year. we've seen continued improvement in funding cost.
as we continue to improve the mix of our borrowers, the credit insurance costs are coming down. so those are two significant drivers that allowed the take rate to go back up to 10% in q1. and these advantages that we're gaining on both the credit insurance costs should continue -- to actually continue to improve as we move through the rest of the year. and then on our own operating costs, we continue to see efficiencies in our sales force, our commissions, our productivity.
and so these are really the main drivers that allow us to really upgrade our profitability. and the net margin side of the business, of course, directly benefits from that. and we are seeing very good recovery, not only in the take rate line but also in the net margin line. and these are things that we think will continue through the rest of the year.
so as james indicated, we're projecting 19% to 22% profit growth for the first half, and this is something that we think is a level that can be sustained for the balance of the year. chairman ji, on the regulatory question.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu -- head of investor relations and corporate development
in terms of window guidance, the first one, and further requirements to reduce apr further. so far, based on our dialogues with the regulators, we've asked if there's a specific number of targets you'd like us to go through. and we have not received any answer from the regulators, apart from that as an industry leader, you should continue to show or demonstrate your willingness to lower the financing costs, but there's no specific number mentioned. based on our own judgment, we think below 24% where we are today is pretty safe at the moment.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu -- head of investor relations and corporate development
so, of course, we emphasize the regulators will always want lower financing costs. and we will continue to maintain very active dialogues with them. in fact, i'm flying over to beijing this afternoon to speak to a few of the authorities.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu -- head of investor relations and corporate development
so we are looking -- or we are hoping the regulator understands, for a market to exist and to develop in a healthy way, all participants in the market needs to have enough room to maintain and grow their operations.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu -- head of investor relations and corporate development
if the apr continues, if the apr ceiling continues to go down endlessly during that process, you will see the exit of many credit providers in the industry. i personally don't think that's what the regulator wants to see.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu -- head of investor relations and corporate development
as we enjoy lower funding costs and lower credit and cgi costs as a result of better risk management and lower operating costs as a result of improved efficiency -- improvement in efficiency, we hope to pass on those cost savings to lower the overall all-in cost for our borrowers.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu -- head of investor relations and corporate development
so we do have our own road map in terms of lowering future cost for our borrowers as we optimize the aforementioned cost.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu -- head of investor relations and corporate development
in terms of the credit bureau license or credit scoring license, i want to point out again that we have been using a guarantee license as the main entity, where ant has been using a microloan license. those two licenses are quite different.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu -- head of investor relations and corporate development
the guarantee model has existed for many, many years. and in the process, using the guarantee company to collect information and collect customer data, in fact, the scope is much smaller than what a smaller company would collect.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu -- head of investor relations and corporate development
so far, we have received no window guidance or any other communications from the regulators on this front.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu -- head of investor relations and corporate development
of course, we will be adhering to more strict data protection, data privacy rules.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu -- head of investor relations and corporate development
if we do receive anything further, we'll be letting everybody know.

the next question comes from piyush mubayi with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
piyush mubayi -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you, greg, ji, and james, for taking the question. congratulations on a good set of numbers. can i just take you through two particular questions? one is when you talk about the loan book growth that you saw and with sme being a greater percentage, could you take us through color on how that is playing out, the sort of growth rates we can continue to expect into the second quarter? and as realized, you mentioned the guidance to second quarter, but you also mentioned that the levels are sustainable for the rest of the year. so could you just take a step back and take us through where you think this growth in the loan book is going to come from and what the size of the loans you're seeing as possible? and the second question has to do with the far better cost controls that you demonstrated in the quarter, where it's clear that -- and you pointed out that it's lower sales -- lower sales commissions that you're paying out for the quarter, as well as better sales productivity, could you just take us through these two aspects and to look through the rest of the quarters? and whether this is a structural change we're seeing in the business and we can model the new levels of sales and marketing spend? thank you.
james zheng -- chief financial officer
ok. piyush, your line's a bit blurry. can i just repeat your questions to make sure we --
greg gibb -- co-chief executive officer
i'll repeat that as i go, and then i think y.s. will probably add in. i think on the first question, piyush, you're asking is really about loan growth that we've seen in the first quarter, and that is it sustainable for the balance of the year. our view is that we're seeing quite good and strong demand from the market.
i think we've seen a number of indicators that say that sme owners, smb businesses are increasingly using money to grow their businesses and not to repay debt. and so i think there's a healthy environment there for our customer base. and so the one that -- if there's one thing to point to when we look at growth on the second half, we will be prioritizing more at the unsecured side. we see the greatest needs there.
we also see our greatest competitive advantage there. and so that's something that we will drive a bit more. so that has the benefit of really maintaining the revenue growth, in particular, in the second half as we meet that demand. on the cost control side, it really is multi parts, right? so at the top-line level, as i mentioned, we are seeing funding costs continue to come down.
we are seeing our credit insurance costs coming down. and we expect those credit insurance costs to continue to be optimized because as the new loan book grows as a percentage of the total, then our overall customer mix will have improved. the second thing that goes with that, as you may recall from when we first did the ipo, is that as we move more and more to high-quality sme owners, which now makes up 75% of total new loans, the average ticket size of those loans increase. and so that's been at the rate of, i believe, it is about 10% to 15% increase, which, therefore, allows us to reduce commissions at a proportionate level without reducing the absolute income of the direct sales.
so if you take all that and then the ongoing efforts we're really making on the technology side to really empower our ds more to bring more of an online engagement with those customers to deepen both on the lending side and other products, that's what allows us to reduce cost while keeping the top line strong. i don't know if there's anything that y.s. wants to add.
y.s. cho -- co-chief executive officer
i'd probably add some more numbers. from january this year, we reduced our sales commission by 50%. but as greg said, since we reduced price much, our ticket size increased accordingly. so it will result to more and more income for that case didn't change at all.
so this monthly income is still around cny 8,500 per month, so which is very stable. and then it's still about -- more about unit component change. if we compare first quarter this year with the same period last year, our progress in cost improvement is very obvious. our expected apr decreased from, i think, about 29% per unit, and now it's about 23%.
but at the same time, funding cost decreased much. it's now close to about 6%, previously about 7%. and the cgi premium, as we said, it was about 9%. now, it's getting close to 6%, which very indicates our customer mix has been changing a lot since we reduced the highest hr and then equally take the states that have gone since changing our price-charging mechanism based on -- through our tools based on the balance charge.
so as on the net -- as a result, take rate is about 10%, which is almost exactly the same as one year ago. so that is why we estimate [inaudible] is confident about the second half, first half -- the overall the profit growth.
piyush mubayi -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. can i chip in a third question, please? it's very quick if you don't mind. one of the comments is about the company borrower risk of 12.5% of new loans facilitated. how does this compare to the 20% to 30% range you talked about as a percentage of risk that you take on?
y.s. cho -- co-chief executive officer
yes. for the question about our sales risk-bearing portion, it changed. the first quarter is about close to 50%. but if you look at our march single month number, our sales risk-taking portion is around 70%.
so we plan to complete -- we plan to reach about 20% sales risk-bearing portion for new ones by the end of june or no later than july. that is our commitment and discussion we had with the regulators. and at the same time, the risk-bearing portion, which is done by ping an p&c's cgi has been gradually reducing. it's going down to almost 70% right now.
so the rest are taken by five other insurance partners and then 17 partner banks. we have now 52 partner banks. and then out of 52 partner banks, already 17 banks, they joined our risk-sharing model. so going forward, you will see that our safe risk-taking portion will go up to 20%.
and then ping an p&c will be further declining. and then you will see that a lot more risks will be directly taken by either by partner banks or other insurance partners.
piyush mubayi -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you very much.

the next question comes from thomas chong with jefferies. please go ahead. thomas chong, your line is live.
thomas chong -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning. thank you taking my questions. can you comment about the trend in terms of the wealth management takeaways in the long term? how should we think about investors' adoption of higher nav products, insurance products, and financial advisory services?
greg gibb -- co-chief executive officer
thanks, thomas. we would expect the take rate on the wealth management side to improve as we move through the year. and that improvement, in the near term and the longer term, are a combination of factors. so in the near term, it is really about continuing to increase our service to the higher-end customer, providing more qualified investor product on the fund side and the asset management side.
so those are the drivers in the near term which are pulling upward our overall take rate. and then if you go out slightly longer term, so if you move kind of more six to 12 months out from today, we would expect the insurance business, the insurance products that we have on the platform continue to grow at a more rapid pace, and those carry attractive economics for the take rate. and we will then, over the longer term, obviously, we're still in the process of looking at the financial advisory license. and once we have that, we expect that there would be a further lift from the mutual fund side.
so those are in the near term and in the longer term. but generally, we think you should see continued improvement as we move through the quarters of this year.
operator
the next question comes from hans fan with clsa. please go ahead.
hans fan -- clsa -- analsyt
hi. thank you very much for letting me ask questions. i got two questions here. one is about the regulation.
clearly that recently, there's a lot of investigations from cbirc regarding the misuse of the consumption loans and business loans for banks for the purpose of property purchase. there's a lot of rounds of investigation going on in shenzhen, shanghai, and beijing. so we're just wondering, does that really have some any implication on lufax? and how do we usually control and monitor the use of funds? that's number one question. and number two question is really on the other income in the financial statements because, in the first quarter, this notable increase in other income, and just want to -- maybe can management just elaborate regarding what's the key drivers of the other income here? and can this be sustainable in the future? thank you very much.
y.s. cho -- co-chief executive officer
ok. then let me take the first question, hans. thanks for your very tough question. in our base model, our partner bank, as the fund provider, they take the final prospect for this loan purpose management.
however, all we can do within our capacity from sales, application, underwriting, and collection, in every stage of operation, we can have attention to loan purpose management. for example, during the application process, the customer to confirm their loan purpose, and then they need to sign on the commitment letter that says that the loan proceeds -- i'm very aware loan proceeds cannot go into property market or stock market. and during underwriting process, during unit interview, we ask one more time. and we check -- or rather than check that, we check debt interest payment account.
so if the account is repeatedly used by multiple applicants, then we reject. and then lastly, during collection process, after loan, three months after loan, we check previous record and the official record of new mortgage. then we assume customer used our loan proceeds to buy a new house. then according to the contract, customer must repay as soon as possible.
so this is what we are seeing because we don't have account. but with our capacity, we can do everything we can -- we do everything we can do. and to better support our partner banks, banks are paying also very high-efficiency risk loan proposed management because they are taking final responsibility. and our partner bank's reprice is a little bit different from bank by bank.
some banks, they want our borrowers to open their type 4 accounts so that they can monitor our loan proceeds. and sometimes, they want our insurance partners to make all indemnity for the customers or loan proposed violation case. so those we support. but however, knowing that our stray cash is about cny 200,000, so this is quite small case size, which can be used -- this can be used for the property purchase.
so we are paying more attention to our secured loan. and then those actions we are taking to help ourselves and to help our partner banks.
greg gibb -- co-chief executive officer
hans, on the question of other income, a couple of points. one is it's actually directly tied to our core business. and what it involves is the services that we provide to our financial institution partners on account management and also to the extent that they outsource services back to us such as collections. and so this is the number on other income which we will see continue to be strong at least through the balance of this year.
it does also -- the reason you see it popping up a little bit is as we changed our overall pricing structure in september last year in terms of how we gather revenue from various partners, you see this increase in other income. but for the purposes of understanding the overall impact on the economics, at least for the balance of this year, you will see that level of performance in this line item.
hans fan -- clsa -- analsyt
thank you much. thank you.
operator
the next question comes from katherine lei with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
katherine lei -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for giving me the opportunity to ask this question. i mainly have two questions.
the first one, i would like to ask about the take rate. because just now, management mentioned about that you will pass on some of the benefits of lowering funding costs and insurance cost to the borrowers, right? so now, i think the take rate has improved back to the first q 2020 level. so what was your target take rate? how much benefits do you expect that you pass on to consumers? and do you expect take rates within this year to stay at this level or continue to improve? and then within, like, say, three, five years, where do see the take rate goes? so this is the first question. second part of my question is mainly on clarifications of questions asked previously by my peers.
so mainly on like the risk-bearing portion, because for the disclosure, in the disclosure, that about 12.5% of new loans, the risk-bearing is -- lufax is a risk-bearing loan by lufax. so what is that on existing stock of loans? maybe you have talked about that just now, but then i didn't get it because the line is a bit blurry. and also, that for the portions of risk-bearing by third parties, what is the portions on the stock of loans? is that often new loans? can you just clarify your numbers on that? thank you.
y.s. cho -- co-chief executive officer
ok. about the take rate, we explained now our take rate for new business is back to about 10% level, which is almost same as last year. and then going forward, we try to deliver 10% take rate, and then we are confident. and that if we can further improve, further optimize our cost lines, like funding costs or insurance premium or our borrower acquisition cost, then we can return our debt to our consumers, so we can be more price affordable and competitive.
but my view is, so within this year, as soon as we can keep 10% take rate, we can -- as soon as -- as much as we have a room, we can further reduce our overall apr by probably 1% or 2%. but it depends on our progress on how much we can further save our operational cost and our funding cost and then our insurance cost. and the second question about the 20% risk-bearing, right, to expand the full nuance, and then now you're wondering about our balance. so in terms of total balance, because our loans are three years duration, so although we are taking more safe risk-bearing portion up to 20%, it gradually affects our overall portfolio.
so in terms of total portfolio, our sales risk-weighted portion is about 8.7% as of first quarter this year. and therefore, ping an p&c, they take about 82%.
katherine lei -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you.

the next question comes from jacky zuo with china renaissance. please go ahead.
jacky zuo -- china renaissance -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. i have two questions to ask. number one is a follow-up on your take rates. so could you help us go through your unit economics for the existing balance in q1 and for new loans in q1 and probably in april? that would be very helpful.
and second question is also related to regulation. so regarding the ant financial rectification plan, they plan to move their consumer credit, i.e. huabei and jiebei, to consumer finance company under their license. so i just want to check whether we have any change in terms of our consumer finance license? and i just want to check personally our progress on where our consumer finance company sits usually and any change toward this -- our business regarding this financial -- sorry this license.
thank you.
greg gibb -- co-chief executive officer
ok. on take rate, do you want to go first, y.s.?
y.s. cho -- co-chief executive officer
sure. about take rate for hold balance. first quarter this year, our take rate is 10%, 10%. and then more importantly, if you look at -- if you understand our take rate for new business because that really affect our future profitability.
take rate for new business in the first quarter is also 10%, despite the effective apr is obviously lower than our portfolio. so that means going forward, 10% take rate can be [inaudible] unless we take significant change in terms to our effective apr. so we are constant with 10% take rate throughout this year. and then for new business, second quarter, third quarter, so as said, we estimate about 10% take rate for new business without much change.
greg gibb -- co-chief executive officer
second question, consumer finance. ant is moving its business into consumer finance here.
james zheng -- chief financial officer
yes, maybe i'll comment on that, and then y.s. could add. i think where ant has come from historically is that what they used mostly was a micro-lending license and co-lending with bank partners. and now that the entire industry has to take on more risk-bearing, they're obviously, at the same time, looking for something that is as capital efficient as possible from a leverage perspective.
so microfinance companies typically carry a cap leverage of 3 to 5 times. there's some differences by geography, but it's roughly in that range. for ant to use their consumer finance company, that gives them the opportunity to bear risk at a 10 times leverage for capital. so i think that's why you see ant and their various announcements moving their model more toward the consumer finance license.
our risk-bearing, as chairman ji mentioned, is really done through a guarantee company that operates nationwide. and that guarantee company, where we're bearing the risk of up to 20% on all the loans going forward, operates at a 10 times leverage ratio. so for us, we've already achieved what we think in the market is kind of the best efficiency in terms of bearing risk and then putting capital against it. so given our business model is different, right, and the ant business model has been around traditionally, those smaller-ticket, shorter-duration loans that does fit well under consumer finance license.
our business model, which has been focused on the small business owners, larger tickets, relatively speaking, for longer duration, is best suited by the use of the guarantee company. so i think things that ant are doing and versus what we do, they're driven by different factors.
y.s. cho -- co-chief executive officer
right, right. so if we choose between smaller license and a consumer finance license, obviously, consumer finance license is better in terms of leverage ratio, and they can also do a nationwide loan disbursement, right. no regional limitation. but our case, let's understand our borrowers.
the average case size is way above cny 200,000. many of them get cny 300,000 and up to cny 1 million for unsecured loans. but consumer finance license, it does not support a large case size lending. the maximum thing you can do with this consumer finance license is cny 200,000.
but actually, with our regulatory window guidance, we said half receive of cny 50,000 on maybe ticket size, so which is not very active with our current business model.
greg gibb -- co-chief executive officer
so i think the result of that, i think at the back part of your question is, today, the consumer finance balances as a percentage of total is less than 1% of our facilitated amount. it's a new business. it's got about 300,000 borrowers. as we move in the second half of this year to integrate more our online services across wealth and lending, we believe the consumer finance license will be very helpful to serving a lot of our wealth customers and some of their consumption needs.
so we would expect the business to continue to show healthy growth. but as a percentage of the total, even by the end of this year, it will still be probably less than 2%.
operator
the next question comes from chiyao huang with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
chiyao huang -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. thanks, management. congratulations on the solid quarter. i have basically two questions.
the first one is related to the loan economics of the loans that we are providing guarantees as we move closer to the 20% risk-taking. so basically, i want to ask how much in terms of the loan balance that we are taking a risk, how much we can charge on the top-line level? and then how much we can charge in provision cost in terms of the loan balance that we are taking risk? and the second question is in terms of the overall industry. so if you view the sme loans and the asset class, i wonder how does management think of the supply and demand side of this industry with all the regulatory changes and the changes of where -- how do you see the supply of these assets and the demand for these assets evolve over time. that's my questions.
thank you.
y.s. cho -- co-chief executive officer
yes. well, for guarantee portion, 20%. i want to emphasize, no matter you take 20% or 25% or 30%, it does not fundamentally change our profitability. if you take more of credit risk, it comes with risk premiums.
so actually, it can be a little bit more profitable by taking more risk. and then i plan for the full portfolio. now, we have about 8.7%, the risk taken. and therefore, new business, about 70%.
so talking about interest rate, supply and demand, demand are sure steady about 60 trillion, more than 6 trillion of demand. but supplies, we see that the unsecured largest trade size is acquisition loan. we don't see much competitors. we don't see any other companies are providing similar services for small business owners.
either they do, like for other banks, we see that more and more banks they're getting to this market with each of the products. so there's a potential that we get on our secured product lines, but our major business lines, unsecured larger case size brings that pressure on that we still do not see any surprise from banks or other internet finance companies. so i think this market is pretty much secured. it's very competitive.
and then i don't think it is for others to get into this market. just to have to meet several preconditions like offline channels, underwriting model and then collecting infrastructures, all those things.

chen yu -- head of investor relations and corporate development
hello, everyone and thank you, for joining our first-quarter 2021 earnings call. before we go through the detailed quarterly results, i would like to provide some general updates on two aspects of our business. first, the recent regulatory developments and their impact on our business; and second, our achievements in supporting small and micro businesses.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu -- head of investor relations and corporate development
let's start with the recent regulatory development and the impact on lufax. first, with increased clarity on regulations in the first quarter, we have witnessed how regulatory authorities impose various reform requirements on leading tech platforms. we believe that the intention of the new regulation has three folds. first, all financial businesses must be rooted in finance and powered by technology.
second, our financial activities should be placed under regulatory oversight. third, the development of the sector must be built on the basis of compliance. these policy directions are largely in line with our previous expectations.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu -- head of investor relations and corporate development
regulatory compliance has always been a key focus for lufax. although we were not directly affected by the recent announcement, we have always upheld our commitment to provide socially responsible, trustworthy, and convenient financial services.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu -- head of investor relations and corporate development
for our credit retail product facilitation business, we promote responsible lending practices and educate borrowers on rational borrowing. these efforts help us keep our credit services independent from other incompatible businesses and prevent the misleading customers with excess lending practices. for borrowers to use the proceeds for our loans, we are different from most online consumer creative business as we focus on serving the smaller macro business owners. we support the development of china's real economy, and our mission is fully aligned with national policies.
on data security, we have strictly adhered to the principal compliance minimum and necessity. first, the data we collect that are used for the purpose of risk assessment preclude all payment information, which is strictly compliant with the requirements listed in the regulation on the administration of credit scoring industry. second, our data related to ping an group has customer consent and has been scrubbed thoroughly to remove sensitivity. third, our risk modeling and analysis processes are executed in full compliance with industry rules and regulations.
going forward, we'll continue to abide by regulatory guidelines, foster prudent innovation, ensure operational compliance, prioritize protection of personal data and improve financial service efficiency and inclusiveness through technology.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu -- head of investor relations and corporate development
for our wealth management business, we continue to wind down our p2p products in response to regulatory requirements. thanks to our strong operations and risk management capabilities, p2p products now account for only 0.9% of our total client assets. we have achieved a smooth and compliant transition process as we gradually phase out our peer-to-peer product, making our business more aligned with regulatory guidelines.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu -- head of investor relations and corporate development
overall, we are fundamentally different from other leading platforms in terms of business model and target customer base. on regulatory compliance, we have adhered to the principle of pre-emptive diagnosis and swift operational adjustments for timely optimal results to keep our operations in line with regulatory trends. as policy trends become clearer, we believe it will benefit industry leaders such as lufax in the long term.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu -- head of investor relations and corporate development
next, i would like to provide an update on our achievements in supporting small and micro businesses. first, we help small and micro businesses to overcome the hurdles of limited access to capital and high cost in financing. second, we leverage our unique offline-to-online model to provide better services to small business -- small micro businesses.
guangheng ji -- chairman

lufax has always been committed to promoting inclusive finance. to expand small and micro businesses' access to finance, lufax has provided credit facilitation services to more than 15 million customers as of march 2021, facilitated over rmb 580 billion of outstanding balance of loans, and extended unsecured loans to nearly 4 million customers residing outside of tier 1 and tier 2 cities. to improve financing affordability, we have adhered to regulatory guidelines and implemented an all-in cost saving of 24% for all new loans since september 2020. we will remain committed to exploring additional ways to lower the financing cost for small micro businesses.

chen yu -- head of investor relations and corporate development
lufax's unique offline-to-online business model and technology capabilities have enabled us to support the financing needs of small and micro businesses very effectively. recently, we noted investor interest in the development of our offline sales team. i would like to mention that our decision to establish an offline sales team was based on the key characteristics of our core customers. most of our core small and micro business owners have an average age of 39, and the business has average annual revenue of less than rmb 10 million, and average pay of less than 20 employees.
their borrower profiles make it difficult for them to qualify for traditional bank loans. they also lack the time or experience to apply loans online. with this in mind, we have a sales and service team of nearly 57,000 representatives in over 280 cities. by leveraging our proprietary technology applications, our service team is able to provide professional, convenient, and flexible credit services.
for example, the verification of borrower background information is conducted automatically through artificial intelligence online, thus significantly reducing manual effort in information gathering and decision making, substantially improving the efficiency of our lending process. in the future, we plan to launch a series of new technology applications to further enhance our customer experience, empower our offline sales team and improve our operational efficiency.

chen yu -- head of investor relations and corporate development
moving forward, lufax will continue to adhere to the nation's guidelines on green finance and inclusive finance by executing our mission of providing inclusive and compassionate financial services. we view it as our responsibility to provide individuals and small and micro business owners across china with easy access to timely, convenient, and high-quality financial services.

chen yu -- head of investor relations and corporate development
in conclusion, although recent regulatory developments have impacted the industry, our business was not materially affected, thanks to our pre-emptive regulatory intention and proactive adjustment. these efforts have also enabled us to achieve solid operating results in the first quarter. our management team will continue to embrace regulatory oversight while maintaining active dialogues with the authorities. we will also improve our capabilities in technology, pricing, and risk management to streamline our operations, optimize our cost structure and enhance our operating efficiency.
we are confident in our ability to maintain the stable growth of our business and continue to provide compassionate financial services to our customers.

i will now turn the call to greg, who will share our business update for the quarter.
greg gibb -- co-chief executive officer
thank you, chairman ji. before i begin, please note that all numbers are in renminbi and all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise stated. lufax had a strong first quarter. we exceeded our guidance and delivered strong top and bottom-line growth.
in the first quarter, total income increased by 16.9% to cny 15.3 billion, and net profit increased by 18.7% to cny 5 billion. this is exceeding our earlier guidance of cny 4.2 billion. our net margin reached 32.6% in the first quarter, an 11-percentage-point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2020. four key trends underpinned our first-quarter performance.
first, we experienced a significant rebound in our retail credit facilitation unit economics while keeping all-in costs for new borrowers below 24%, the take rate based on loan balance was 10% in the first quarter of 2021, recovering from 9.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020. funding cost optimization and credit insurance premium reduction were key drivers of this improvement as insurance partners lowered their pricing on the basis of better credit and customer quality. we also reduced our sales commissions in january and improved our operating efficiency. as a result, our net margin and lending facilitation essentially returned to the levels we saw prior to price reductions in 2020.
as mentioned, reduction in credit insurance premiums is closely linked to credit performance. in the first quarter, our c-m3 flow rate for all loans facilitated was 0.4% versus the covid peak of 1% in february 2020. the 30-days-plus past due delinquency rate for all loans facilitated stabilized at 2% as of march 31, 2021, on par with december 31, 2020. the 90-plus day past delinquency rate for total loans facilitated improved to 1.1% as of march 31, 2021, from 1.2% on december 31, 2020.
all of the aforementioned operating metrics exclude our consumer finance subsidiary and legacy products, which represent less than 1% of our total loan business. second, we observed steady volume growth while improving our business mix. on the retail credit side, our new loans facilitated grew by 17.3% to cny 172.4 billion in the first quarter, largely in line with our expectations. we continue to focus on serving small business owners and improving the risk profile of our borrowers.
in the first quarter, excluding the consumer finance subsidiary, 75.7% of the new loans facilitated were dispersed to small business owners, up from 65.9% for the same period of 2020. high-quality borrowers, defined as g1 to g3 borrowers by our own internal classification system, contributed 65.9% of new general unsecured loans facilitated in the first quarter, compared to 58.7% for the same period of 2020. the improved borrower quality led to a sustainable decline for credit insurance premiums and expected credit loss levels. on the wealth management side, our total client assets exceeded our guidance and reached cny 421.1 billion as of march 31, 2021.
our focus on mass affluent customers who invest more than cny 300,000 on the platform has paid off as the contribution to our total client assets reached 76.3% as of march 31 of this year. third, we continue to make progress on executing our plans for a more sustainable risk-sharing business model. it is encouraging to see that our funding and insurance partners have remained supportive and are embracing the new risk-sharing business model. as of march 31, 2021, our outstanding balance of loans facilitated with guarantees from third-party insurance partners decreased to 86.8% from 95.1% a year previously.
moreover, new loans facilitated with guarantees from ping an p&c accounted for 78.3% of new loans facilitated in the first quarter, down from 92.5% a year ago, while our funding partners borne the risk for 5.5% of new loans facilitated in the first quarter. loans where we bear the risk accounted for 12.5% of new loans facilitated in the first quarter, up from 1.3% in the same quarter of 2020. the balance of loans where we bear the risk was cny 45.7 billion as of march 31, 2021, representing around 2 times leverage of our licensed guarantee company's net assets of cny 19.2 billion. again, these figures do not include our consumer finance subsidiary.
we expect the net assets of our guarantee companies to continue to increase as our retained earnings growth, providing organic support to future business growth. under a 20% to 30% risk-bearing business model and a 10 times leverage cap for our guarantee companies, we have ample room to grow our total loan guarantee balance without any additional capital injection this year. the existing capacity of our guarantee company supports a doubling of the current business scale. fourth, our wealth management client assets and take rates have remained stable despite accelerated p2p runoff and discontinuation of bank deposit products.
as of march 31, 2021, our total client assets increased by 18.7% to cny 421 billion versus a year ago despite accelerated p2p runoff and discontinuation of bank deposit products. first-quarter revenues from wealth management business increased by 52.8% year over year. in the first quarter, we accelerated the runoff of cny 15.4 billion in p2p products. of that, march 31, 2021, legacy products accounted for just 0.9% of total client assets compared to 20.6% a year ago.
we expect the runoff of our remaining legacy products to be completed in the second quarter. as a result of regulatory restrictions on bank deposit products, deposit-related client assets decreased cny 9.1 billion in the first quarter. our take rate for the wealth business was 28 basis points in the first quarter, with some fluctuation due to decrease in deposit products, offset by continued development in standard wealth and insurance products. next, our upgraded guidance for the first half.
we expect continued growth momentum in the second quarter with steady business development, further cost optimization, and strong credit performance. therefore, we are increasing our first half of 2021 guidance for total income growth to be between 17% and 18%, up from our previous guidance of 11% to 14%. we are also increasing our first half of 2021 guidance for net profit growth to be between 19% and 22%, effectively doubling our earlier guidance of 7% to 10%. in the first half of this year, we expect growth in new loans facilitated to be between 12% and 15% growth, down from our prior guidance of 20%.
this is really due to our greater focus on improving product mix and margins. we plan to prioritize the growth of unsecured loans over secured loans as unsecured loans provide higher operating margins but with smaller ticket sizes. we expect overall unit economics for new loans this year to be largely in line with the average for new loans in 2020. our expectation is that wealth management client assets will grow 9% to 12% in the first half from the same period of last year as we will continue to focus on higher-margin asset management funds and insurance products.
finally, i do want to share our priorities for technology development. our focus is on four fronts. first, we continue to expand our use of legally compliant big data and ai capabilities to augment our strengths in the end-to-end risk management for small business owners. second, we are developing industry content and real-time planning tools to better support the productivity of our unique o2o sales force.
third, we are integrating infrastructure and services across our lending and wealth management customers to capture greater business synergies. we have already begun to integrate lending and wealth client sourcing with the third-party channels, and we'll move to an integrated app for all services by -- during the course of this year. fourth, we are exporting our technology and proven online operating models via cloud solutions to our banking partners in china, hong kong, and southeast asia to extend our market reach and deepen these important ecosystem relationships. we will measure our progress in technology deployment by our ability to increase customer sourcing and financial institution partnerships to enhance our o2o sales productivity and to promote deeper product cross-selling and finally, to achieve greater operating efficiencies.
with the ongoing changes in regulation, we believe that our ability to combine our dna in proven financial services with innovative technology will enhance our competitive differentiation and sustain our growth trajectory for the long run. i will now turn the call over to james zheng, our cfo, to go through the financial details.
james zheng -- chief financial officer
thank you, greg. i will now provide a closer look into our first-quarter financial results. please note that all numbers are in rmb terms and all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated. as greg mentioned, we have experienced significant rebound in retail credit facilitation unit economics driven by lower funding costs, insurance premiums, and optimization of operating expenses.
as a result, we have delivered strong financial results in the first quarter. our total income was cny 15.3 billion, up 16.9% year over year. our net profit increased by 18.7% to cny 5 billion in the first quarter, and our net margin further expanded to 32.6%. now, let's take a closer look into our q1 numbers.
during the first quarter, our total income increased by 16.9%, driven by strong business volumes and increased take rate. on the back of this growth, our retail credit facilitation business is seeing a change in revenue mix as our business and risk-sharing model evolves. while platform service fees decreased by 9.4% to cny 9.7 billion, our net interest income grew 111.7% to cny 2.9 billion, and our guaranteed income grew 597.5% to cny 551 million. in addition, other income directly linked to delivering services to our financial partners increased 241.8% to cny 1 billion.
as a result, our retail credit facilitation platform service fees, as a percentage of total revenue, decreased to 63.4% from 81.8%. as we continue to fund more with consolidated trust plans providing lower funding costs, our net interest income, as a percentage of revenue, increased to 19.1% from 10.5% in the previous year. and as we share more credit risk, generating more guarantee income, our guarantee income as a percentage of total revenue increased to 3.6% from 0.6%. through expanded services to our credit enhancement partners in account management, collections, and other value-added services, our other income as a percentage of total revenue increased to 6.8% from 2.3%.
in wealth management, our platform transaction and service fees increased by 52.8% to cny 625 million in the first quarter from cny 409 million in the same period of 2020. the increase was mainly driven by the increase in fees generated from our current products and revenue recognition arising from accelerated p2p run-off. now, moving on to our expenses. in the first quarter, total cost grew by 17.1% to cny 8.5 billion.
total expenses, excluding credit impairment losses, financial costs, and other losses, however, grew by only 10.1% as a result of improved operating efficiencies in most cases. our sales and marketing expense, which includes borrower and investor acquisition expense and the general sales and marketing expense, increased by 5.5% to cny 4.2 billion during the first quarter. our borrower acquisition expense, which is a major component of overall sales and marketing expenses, increased by only 0.2% to cny 2.6 billion from a year ago, mainly driven by further optimization in sales productivity and sales commission. our investor acquisition and retention expense decreased in the first quarter versus the year before, mostly driven by the improved acquisition efficiency as we leverage data to achieve greater precision in investor profiling and targeting.
our general sales and marketing expense, which is mainly comprised of payroll and related expenses for marketing personnel, brand promotion costs, consulting fees, business development costs, as well as other marketing and advertising costs, increased by 24.8% to cny 1.5 billion in the first quarter from cny 1.2 billion a year ago. this increase was mainly due to lower base in first quarter of 2020, resulting from the postponement of certain marketing campaigns due to covid-19 at that time. our general and administrative expenses increased by 24.1% to cny 854 million during the first quarter from cny 688 million a year ago. this increase was mainly due to lower base in the first quarter of 2020 and subsequent headcount expansion to support new business development, including the consumer finance business.
general administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 5.6% from 7.4% during the fourth quarter of 2020. consistent with the growth of our outstanding balance of loans facilitated and in turn, the expanded loan repayment volume on operations and servicing expenses increased by 17.7% to cny 1.5 billion during the first quarter from cny 1.3 billion a year ago. our technology and analytics expense increased by 8.2% to cny 447 million during the first quarter as we continue to invest in technology research and development. our credit impairment losses increased by 109.8% to cny 1.1 billion during the first quarter of 2021 from cny 502 million during the same period of last year.
this increase was due to increased loan-related risk exposure as our business model continued to evolve, leading to higher credit impairment losses upfront. excluding the consumer finance subsidiary, the proportion of loans for which we'll bear the risk accounted for 12.5% of new loans facilitated in the first quarter, up from 1.3% from the same period of 2020. it is worth noting that the increase in impairment losses is purely a function of the increase in the proportion of credit risks borne by us, while the overall credit profile of our borrowers continue to improve. high-quality borrowers, defined as g1 to g3 borrowers by our internal classification system, contributed to 65.9% of the new general unsecured loans facilitated in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 58.7% for the same period of last year.
in addition, our loan quality indicators, such as flow rate, dpd 30+, dpd 90+ have stabilized and in some cases, improved substantially from a year ago. our finance cost decreased by 36.3% to cny 284 million in the first quarter from cny 446 million a year ago mainly due to the decrease in interest costs. additionally, our effective tax rate decreased to 26% during the first quarter of 2021 from 27% in the same period of 2020. consequently, our net profit increased by 18.7% to cny 5 billion during the first quarter from cny 4.2 billion in the same quarter of 2020.
our basic and diluted earnings per ads were cny 2.09 and at cny 1.96 in the first quarter of this year. as of march 31, 2021, we had a cash balance of cny 24.5 billion, compared to cny 24.2 billion as of december 31, 2020. now, let me provide you with some guidance for the first half of 2021. for the second quarter of 2021, as we prioritize improvement in our loan mix and unit economics, we expect our new loans facilitated to be in the range of cny 145 billion to cny 155 billion; and wealth client assets to be in the range of cny 410 billion to cny 420 billion.
as we maintain our growth momentum and we continue to improve our operating efficiency, we expect our total income to be in the range of cny 14.9 billion to cny 15.1 billion and the net profit in the range of cny 3.7 billion to cny 3.9 billion in the second quarter. as indicated before, our quarterly financial results are subject to seasonality and fluctuation as a result of accounting treatment. however, as our underlying unit economics improve, our second-quarter guidance translates into an estimated year-over-year net profit growth of 19% to 22% in the first half of 2021, a level which we believe should be sustainable for the remainder of the year. these forecasts reflect our current and preliminary views on the market and operational conditions, which are subject to change.
this concludes our prepared remarks for today. operator, we are now ready to take questions.
",2021-Q1,LU

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] your first question comes from winnie wu from bank of america. please go ahead.
winnie wu -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you very much for giving me this opportunity, and congratulations for a solid second-quarter results i guess two things. first, in terms of the credit business, can you provide the latest number in terms of the effective apr in second quarter this year, both for the new business and also for the total outstanding loan balance. so the apr and then the breakdown of funding costs. second question is related to what jean talked about on the information and credit growing license.
can you talk about any progress and application if you are applying for the credit license? any expectation on that? and also with the new regulation restrictions on the usage of credit information, is that going to impact how much data -- credit data in fact is able to access or the scope of data that you're able to leverage on and that are going to impact your credit scoring?
greg gibb -- co-chief executive officer
thanks, winnie. i think on your first question, what we have just disclosed for the second quarter on the overall portfolio is that the apr is 24%. and that's down from 26.7% a year ago. we don't disclose the rate for the new loans.
but what you can very clearly calculate is in order for us to go from 26.7% down to 24%, that means that the new loans that we've been issuing clearly have all been below 24%. and at least a couple of hundred basis points below 24% in order to get that overall average of 24%. and so this is something that we've been doing for some time, and we'll continue to execute that.
y.s. cho -- co-chief executive officer
partly i can add is, if you look at this part, dispose number, if you look at our on-site new -- our apr decreased by almost 6% from one year ago. but two states remain today. and to answer your second question about the data showing we bank or credit license company. the regulation credit tenant, we met pboc a few times.
and then also, we have probably got two questions. the first is whether we need a credit license. our view is our current process of data collection and insuring with partner banks we positive within anti business, the approved score. so we think we don't need a credit license if we need, in that all other net companies or other insurance companies who do tj business, seniors, they all need this credit license there retail to new license on into average as a shareholder.
but so far, the period pay is in confirm whether we need to have this license or not. the second question we have here is what process we would change to follow this regulation. we might need to share our data with our partner to the company who has credit license going forward, and this regulation becomes effective from the end of last year. so we have net next year.
and lower wait on credit national company and then watching the new process. so we can be ready within first half next year and then certainly change went the project, but it's not confirmed yet.
greg gibb -- co-chief executive officer
but in terms of scope of data, y.s., that we can access or we need to use doesn't get impacted by this new structure.
y.s. cho -- co-chief executive officer
there's one small point impact. how we create data, there are two types of data before personal information that inflects directly from borrowers. that does not change. and the second is the data syndicating data from tdc does not change, but for the type that other the customer client asset data, insurance data, how we collect dispersion asset data that we have to collect through the company's credit license going forward, that is our understanding.
so in all, it will most impact our business.
unknown speaker
[foreign language]
chen yu -- head of board office and capital markets
so it was y.s. cho, our co-ceo, responsible for facilitation lending, who just answered. on top of that, i just want to add that we are maintaining a very active dialogue with the credit score and bureau or the pboc, all the relevant key decision makers within the bureau. so far, there's no material impact to our business model.
and based on what they've indicated to us, there's no need for us to change now. i think their key focus is on the data or the information you collected, whether you just use it for yourself? or do you actually pass it on to external parties or in some cases, even monetize on that data. we believe that's their key focus. they're also asking us to our views what i would like to share our data with credit bureaus.
and our response was, look, if there's a pd requirement and everybody is required to do that, we will comply. again, their key focus is on whether we accumulate the data we accumulated or store is just for self-use or will be passed on to third party. of course, that's something we'll never do. they also recognize that we run quite a different business model by our guaranteed company.
so so far, that's the communication we've all had. we don't need to make any changes right now. we'll continue to have those conversations and let the market know if we hear otherwise.

thank you. your next question comes from meizhi yan from ubs. please go ahead.

meizhi yan -- ubs -- analyst

y.s. cho -- co-chief executive officer

james zheng -- chief financial officer
yes. let me just comment on the question number two first, and i will answer question number three. the question number three is about loan rate should be within 24% by june 2022, right? this requirement was given to cs companies. and it's very precise.
what they said is total borrowing cost is little less than 24% for by june 2022 average apr should be less than 20% with a serious time united by june 2024, as wages, and then we believe this will become like a standard of regulation for all. and this is good for us because it brings no impact for us. if you look at our company, as of today, highest is less than 24%. and average is less than 90%.
so we're already there. and then quickly, high data less than 24%. and as of july, our apr is only less than 2%. so basically, we see no impact from this new regulation.
so we are in a very safe position. and the third question, first portion. in august business, our street portion for euros will reach final reached 20% that we are done. in the next step, whether we want to further move up to 3% is we haven't decided yet.
we are in discussion with regulators. but once state demand, we have to go up to 40%, then we can do that very easily with time because our game company, we have already more than 22 billion net asset, which is more than enough to support 40% asset guarantee of portion renewals.

operator
thank you. your next question comes from thomas chong from jefferies. please go ahead.
thomas chong -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks, management, for taking my questions. i have a question regarding our wealth management strategies.
i think we have talked a lot about the lcf side. but how about the wm side? i think we are able to talk about some of the upgrades in terms of the product features including integration with lcr in terms of the interface. can you talk about how we should think about our long-term goal for [inaudible]? in particular, the progress that i made with our automated ai portfolio as well as any competitive landscape or regulations that we need to bear in mind. that's my first question.
and then a question is about the recent outbreak of covid. are you seeing any changes in terms of the fundamentals recently?
greg gibb -- co-chief executive officer
this is greg. on the wealth side business, as we summarize, through the first half of this year or as of june 30, the growth exclude the p2p portion was about 28%. and so this is a business we continue to want to develop as fast as we can. and we continue to see very good progress on our affluent customers, on our qualified investors across a range of higher-end products, including ongoing development for portfolio services and automated matching which we're doing here in china, but we're also looking into hong kong as that market starts to evolve as well.
so this is an area that we will continue to invest. we'll continue to automate. we'll continue to apply more and more data to it to make sure that our middle-class customers are generally bringing good returns, particularly as the market shifts away from fixed income to more variable return products. and this is an area that we continue to invest in.
in terms of the covid impact, i would say up to now, we've not seen any impact. it's really too early and very, very narrow. i know that there's more headlines about it, but it really hasn't been anything that we've seen in terms of frontline impact.
thomas chong -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from katherine lei from j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
katherine lei -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you. i think my peers have asked a lot about regulatory risk. and then i'm going to have a follow-up question on the regulatory risk as well. i think just now management saying that the way to maintain a stable profit margin is to control costs, right? so first, can you help to elaborate on what room of have to continue to cut costs so that the overall take rate will be more stable.
the second question i have is on investors' returns. there's already like $1 billion of buyback being announced and executed some of them being executed so far. so what is the assets on the balance sheet that you believe is deplorable for like buyback or maybe in the future dividends in general?
greg gibb -- co-chief executive officer
y.s., do you want to speak first about the cost optimization areas.
y.s. cho -- co-chief executive officer
ok. i think the team will share more data in the connection, right? but if i give you a lot in the second quarter this year, our average apr was less than 23%, but net margin stayed almost unchanged at around 6%. and then let our components of spending called cgi premium and two impact, you see that those three numbers are obviously imputing meaning decreasing. and going forth, we believe we can further productized by about 2%.
so going forward, even if the overall hr moves out to close to 20%, the reconfidence our net margin will be protected at around 2%. of course, i'm understanding that no matter how low ar goes can deliver 4% area. i'm not saying that. but as soon as average class is around 20%, we are very confident that margin will not change.
greg gibb -- co-chief executive officer
and in terms of investor returns, as we noted on our balance sheet and cash position, 91 billion overall net assets, 42 billion of relatively liquid assets within 90 days. so the share repurchase, the additional 700 million, taking us to a billion still represents a very small portion of our total capabilities. we will continue to explore other ways to generate returns for investors through all the and we're exploring those structures, and we'll certainly undertake them as soon as it makes sense to do so. but we certainly have a lot of room in which to play.
guangheng ji -- chairman of the board and chairman of lufax executive committee
[foreign language]
james zheng -- chief financial officer
as greg mentioned that not only that we have a strong balance sheet. in addition, we have very strong profitability and cash-generating capability. in terms of the question you asked, whether it's buyback or dividend, i can say that we are considering again all means to return value to shareholders. once there's a decision made, we will be making the right announcement.
the usd 10 billion, which is roughly rmb 7 billion of buyback, it's small compared to what we have on our balance sheet. and let's not forget, by the end of the year, we would have generated another 10 billion-plus of rmb profit, and that will go -- also go into our cash reserves and balance sheet
katherine lei -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. thanks.
operator
thank you. that does conclude our time for questions. i'll now hand back to management for closing remarks.
guangheng ji -- chairman of the board and chairman of lufax executive committee
[foreign language]
chen yu -- head of board office and capital markets
thank you for attending our call today. and as mentioned earlier, the results are available online, and we will be having one-on-one sessions with the sell-side analysts, which we will elaborate more on our messages. please do have full confidence that we have a very hard-working management team in the current environment, where global capital markets view on china regulations, which caused a lot of volatility recently. rest assured, not only that the company have heard that, i believe the relevant regulators in china have also heard the market views some front has been telling me that today the biggest factors impacting chinese adr stock prices.
no. 1 is regulation; no. 2 industry, company-specific fundamentals come later. rest assured, the regulators have worked that.
and in the current environment, it is very prudent and it's always been our principle to strengthen regulatory relationships, maintain open communications and make sure we are in the right side of the future direction. thank you again for joining the call.

guangheng ji -- chairman of the board and chairman of lufax executive committee
[foreign language]hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our 2021 second-quarter earnings call. i will start with some general updates on our achievements in the first half then share our thoughts on recent regulatory developments and industry dynamics before providing our plans for future business.[foreign language]first, update in the first half. generally speaking, all the chinese data adr stock prices have seen increased volatility recently due to changes in macro policies and market conditions. at lufax, we managed to deliver improvements in our operating performance, regulatory compliance, and corporate governance in the first half.[foreign language]first, we achieved high-quality growth in our core business.
for the first half, our total income increased by 17% year over year and net profit increased by 33% year over year. later in the call, greg and james will elaborate more.[foreign language]second, we responded to regulatory costs by phasing out our peer-to-peer product in a smooth and compliant manner. in the second quarter, we substantially completed the run-off legacy peer-to-peer products and further strengthened our regulatory compliance.[foreign language]third, we continuously enhance our corporate governance by restructuring our board of directors and establishing committees in key focus areas, including risk management, consumer protection, and esg. we've also been actively advancing the establishment of our esg system.[foreign language]fourth, on may 24, 2021, our company announced usd 300 million of share repurchase.
as of june 30, 2021, we have substantially completed the repurchase. in addition, our senior management purchased $5 million worth of shares using their personal funds.[foreign language]while there are still uncertainties in the market, our stable profitability, strong operating cash flow, abundant cash reserves, and the actions we took to pivot our business based on our understanding of regulatory requirements, all give us strong confidence about our future prospects.[foreign language]as such, i'm pleased to announce a new share repurchase program of 700 million over the next 12 months, bringing our total program to $1 billion. [foreign language] in addition, we are actively evaluating other options to return shareholder value going forward.[foreign language]second, the analysis of regulatory development and market dynamics.[foreign language]since our q1 earnings announcement, the chinese government has continuously tightened supervision of technology platform companies. these include the direct sharing of borrowing information by online loan facilitators and co-lenders with financial institutions, mitigating an all-in-cost ceiling of 24% for consumer loans and publishing the draft version of the amended cybersecurity view measures for public consultation.[foreign language]lufax has always been close and in constant dialogues with regulators to fully grasp with the latest regulatory trends, intentions, and requirements and make sure relevant authorities are fully aware of our business model and development in key areas.[foreign language]i'm pleased to report that so far, we have maintained open communication lines with all levels of regulators with satisfactory frequency and results.[foreign language]despite recent influx of new regulations and policy integrations, our business has not been materially affected.
moreover, our business model operating results have remained resilient.[foreign language]now i will address a number of questions that attracted recent attention. the first topic is the sharing of data by law facilitators and co-lenders directly with financial institutions.[foreign language]recent media reports speculated that the cbirc will prohibit online product facilitation platforms from sending directly to their partner financial institutions forward data, including personal information voluntarily submitted by borrowers, data generated as part of the platform's process and other borrowing information provided by third-party vendors. our interpretation is that it aims to regulate the consumer credit scoring process emphasizing that credit assessment data from internet platforms must be transmitted solely through licensed credit agencies.[foreign language]lufax has been utilizing its license guarantee company to conduct its retail foot facilitation business and perform credit assessment authorized by our partner banks in full compliance with the banking sector, financial institution, and financial guarantee company business corporation guide, we refer potential clients to our banking partners, transmit the guarantee company's approval results and share timely updates on post-origination repayment status. as such, every aspect of our business cooperation is done in accordance of the current guide and that's different from an unlicensed company's loan facilitation model.[foreign language]in the meantime, we will have constructive dialogues with the regulatory authority to seek their feedback and guidance.
we are also prudently exploring the viability of applying for a credit scoring license or cooperating with third-party credit scoring companies.[foreign language]because the mandatory completion of credit scoring reform is set to the end of 2022, there should be sufficient time for both regulatory authorities and market participants to test new models and make adjustments. based on currently available information, we believe corporate with third-party credit scoring companies will not materially impact our business model or profitability.[foreign language]the second topic relates to consumer borrowing costs. at the end of july, some media reported that regulatory authorities would require financial institutions, including consumer finance companies and banks to implement an all-in-cost ceiling of 24% for personal lending. from our perspective, we think that this new requirement has crystallized the direction of loan pricing and eliminated potential uncertainties.
since september 2020 we have been pre-emptively implementing an all-in-cost ceiling of 24% for all new loans we facilitate. going forward, we'll continue to follow regulatory direction leverage technology to broad and small micro-business owners access to cost-effective financing and maintain our own profitability by improving our operating efficiency.[foreign language]the third topic i would like to discuss is cybersecurity.[foreign language]since july, regulatory authorities have been come back [inaudible] several internet platforms in accordance with cybersecurity measures demonstrating the nation's heightened attention to cybersecurity and data safety.[foreign language]to ensure full regulatory compliance of our data processing business operations, we promptly conducted decreasing seminars and performed internal reviews. lufax achieved the internationally accredited iso 27001 certification for information security management and the level three registration certificate from the ministry of public security of china. going forward, we'll continue to strictly adhere to policy requirements and into regulatory compliance in all key aspects of our operations, such as network equipment and service procurement, critical data reviews, and many others.[foreign language]the fourth topic is market development and competitive dynamics.[foreign language]in recent years, a number of internet platforms and traditional financial institutions have jumped into the foray of serving small macro business financial needs.
some platforms have started to copy the auto business model that we pioneered.[foreign language]on the one hand, this validates the attractiveness of our business segments and the effectiveness of our o2o model. on the other hand, intensifying competition challenges lufax to perform even better.[foreign language]over the past 16 years, we have built a highly effective off-line sales and service team, a comprehensive management system, and a proven risk management model stress tested over multiple market cycles. such combination serves as high barriers to entry and precludes peer replication within a short period of time. at the same time, increasing competition also motivates us to work harder, ensure regulatory compliance, innovate with prudent advance our technology and fortify our industry leadership.[foreign language]development plans for the future.
based on our analysis of regulatory intentions and industry dynamics, we believe competitive focus will gradually shift from volume growth to quality growth. consequently, we are committed to uphold the following principles to keep our operations fully compliant to create value to society and to advance our technology.[foreign language]first, we shall keep our operations in full regulatory compliance and strict policy adherence. as an organization with financial dna, we have always prioritized regulatory requirements and operate this new compliant manner. based on our principle pre-emptive diagnosis and swift operational adjustments for timely optimal results, we plan to continue enhancing our communication with regulatory authorities so that we can keep a close tab on a course of regulatory development and timely execute our policy requirements.[foreign language]second, we shall keep creating value to the society by providing quality financial services to small micro business as well as the middle class.[foreign language]as of june 30, 2021, lufax has cumulatively provided credit facilitation services to more than 15.5 million borrowers with an outstanding loan balance of more than rmb 600 billion.
over the past five years, we have effectively satisfied small micro business owners on sme by facilitating nearly rmb 2.3 trillion worth of loans.[foreign language]recently, we launched special assistant plans for small micro companies, mainly aimed at supporting companies in labor-intense industries such as retail hospitality, restaurants, and manufacturing, creating a significant number of employment opportunities. for small micro agriculture businesses, we are working with the china women's development foundation to distribute our farmers' assistance fund to rural female entrepreneurs and cooperative leaders. as a result of this work, we are making meaningful contributions to the economy of rural areas.[foreign language]going forward, lufax will provide more products and services catering to the needs of small micro business owners, leverage technology to reach customers more effectively, simplify loan application process, improve efficiency in reviewing and improving online loan applications, fulfill our commitment to financial inclusion and support the nation's economic development agenda.[foreign language]in our wealth management business, lufax operates as an information and empowerment platform to help the chinese middle class manage the well. lufax will continue to provide a variety of financial products, optimized product matrix composition enhance customer experience, improve service quality and efficiency and contribute to our clients' wealth preservation and growth goals.[foreign language]thirdly, we shall empower our business development and quality improvements through technology.[foreign language]in adherence to our principles o2o integration, multi-service offering and customized solution we have continuously advanced our technology in big data, artificial intelligence, and others.[foreign language]in retail product facilitation, we have launched an ai-powered smart loan solution named xingyun.
in wealth management, we are promoting an intelligent customer service solution aimed at improving user experience. all these solutions demonstrate our ability to enhance our financial service's efficiency by leveraging technology.[foreign language]in conclusion, although our road ahead is not without challenges, we are confident that we will be able to lay our own unique path to long-term sustainable success by maintaining operational compliance, generating social value and continuing technology advancement.[foreign language]with that, i will now turn the call over to greg, who will share our business updates for the quarter.
greg gibb -- co-chief executive officer
thank you, chairman ji. although the regulatory environment continues to transform and some uncertainties remain, our business performance is sound. let me get straight into the key figures, noting that all numbers are in rmb and all comparisons are on a year-on-year basis unless otherwise stated. profits in the first half reached 9.7 billion, up 33.4% versus a year ago.
our second-quarter profit was 4.7 billion, up 53.2% versus a year ago. our second-quarter revenues of 14.8 billion grew 17.3% versus last year. our second-quarter total operating expenses of 7.1 billion decreased by 1.7% for the same period. as a result, our net margin reached 31.9%, a 7.5 percentage point improvement over the second quarter last year, driven by ongoing improvements in operations and technology.
we are confident that profit growth levels in the first half will be sustained throughout the balance of this year. on the back of this solid performance, it is important to note our strong balance sheet and cash position. as of june 30 of this year, our net assets reached 91.1 billion, of which approximately 42 billion are liquid assets maturing in 90 days or less. our net cash flow has increased by 9.6 billion in the last 12 months.
this strong position allows us to do several things. first, it provides us with a resilient ability to meet any new capital requirements may come from regulatory changes. we believe that in lending facilitation, all platforms regardless of business model or customer segment will ultimately be required to bear 20% to 30% of related credit risks with a capital leverage of no more than 10x with a portion of shared risk. in the second quarter, excluding the consumer finance subsidiary, we bought credit risk around 16% of all new loans facilitated and we have more than sufficient capital to meet increased levels of needed.
second, our strong profitability provides multiple avenues to generate value for shareholders. today, we announced that we will extend our corporate buyback program, initiating a new plan to repurchase usd 700 million of shares over the next 12 months. we continue to explore other avenues to return more value to shareholders over time. third, our resources allow us to continue to invest in and enhance our unique business model.
for the sake of general understanding, i'd like to highlight three aspects of our business model and the developments currently underway. first is our unique o2o direct sales force business model, which allows us to unlock the unmet borrowing needs for china's small and micro business owners. in the second quarter, excluding the consumer finance subsidiary, 77.6% of new loans facilitated which is small business owner segment. we continue to find that our direct sales force of more than 58,600 professionals is the key to reaching the small business owners and building the required levels of trust serve their larger and long-term lending needs and being able to match an array of unsecured and secured products to their diverse business and industry purposes.
in the second quarter, new loan sales reached 152.7 billion, growing 11.1% versus a year ago, in line with prior guidance. during the quarter, new loan sales from other channels slowed down a little. however, the increased fee loan volume from our own direct sales teams has offset the weakness in other channels thus demonstrating the resilience and flexibility of our direct sales team as well as the strength of our o2o business model. furthermore, with continued technology upgrades, we have greatly improved the productivity and efficiency of our direct sales team.
in the second quarter, 6.5% of new loans facilitated were in a new secured auto lending product, demonstrating the ability of our o2o direct sales to capitalize on changing market conditions and customer relationships. the productivity of our direct sales force increased 10% over the last 12 months. we continue to invest in new risk, data, industry insights, and technology tools to further enable our unique o2o sales force to tap this hard-to-reach segment, which we believe could not be efficiently served through a pure online model. a second unique aspect of our business model is how we deploy our licenses.
this has become an increasingly important factor in the tightening environment to satisfy both regulatory and funding partner needs. all new loans that we facilitate today either flow through our guarantee companies or our consumer finance license. our guaranteed companies with operations all over the nation except tibet, ningxia, and yunnan provinces allow us to share credit and process data flows with our more than 65 national and local funding partners under well-established legal frameworks. the deployment of these licenses together with successful happening at the abf and interbank abm market has helped the ongoing optimization of funding costs through the first half of this year.
we are now actively exploring new collaborations to meet expected credit rating license usage requirements will come into the effect by the end of next year. a third unique aspect of our business model is that we seek to serve our customers across a full range of financial services, not just lending. while our wealth management platform is a smaller contributor to total company revenues today, the china wealth management market is witnessing substantial new growth as customers and providers are adjusting to full implementation of the new asset management regulations and a new framework for cross-border investing between china's greater bay and hong kong. our domestic wealth and insurance serving primarily the affluent -- the emerging affluent continues to grow with client assets of $421.1 billion as of june 30, 2021, expanding 12.4% versus a year ago, and expanding by 28.8% if excluding legacy tp assets, which have now been substantially run off.
our platform in hong kong is currently entering new partnerships in preparation for the rollout of greater bay policies. in the third quarter of this year, we will merge our online client interface for all borrowers and investors to keep in services to all customers across small business owner lending, consumer finance, wealth management and protection and pension insurance. company analysis assessed many of our small business owners are middle class and emerging affluent customers and a notable proportion of our well customers are small business owners. with the rapidly changing operating environment, we believe our capital strength and unique business model, combined with our deep financial credit experience and commitment to compliance will allow us to remain resilient.
before turning over to james to go through the detailed operating and financial performance and second-half guidance, i would like to highlight one final figure. we have continued to make progress in bringing down apr to our borrowers with the second quarter apr for the overall portfolio reaching 24% and versus 26.7% a year ago. this reduction has been executed without negatively impacting our net margins. in the medium term, we will seek to lower aprs but keep our net margin steady by driving down relevant operating credit insurance and funding expenses.
i will now turn over the call to james zheng, our cfo.
james zheng -- chief financial officer
thank you, greg. i will now provide a closer look into our second quarter operational and financial results. before i begin, please let me remind everyone that all numbers are in rmb terms and all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise stated. our second-quarter 2021 results are characterized by strong business growth, continued operations improvement, and expanded profit margin.
our total income increased by 17.6% to 14.8 million, while our core basic income, excluding investment income grew by 19.1%. our net profit increased by 53.2% to 4.7 billion, exceeding our earlier guidance of 2.7 billion to 3.9 billion. our net margin reached 31.9% in the second quarter, a 7.5 percentage point improvement from the second quarter of 2020. for slide, our continued growth and profitability are key factors.
first, we further optimize the unit economics in our retail credit facilitation business even as we reduced our all-in cost. our loan balance apr declined by 2.7 percentage points to 34% in the second quarter of 2021 from 26.7% in the second quarter of 2020. while our take rate based on loan value improved to 9.7% from 9.5% and our net margin also expanded over the same period, this achievement is a result of four initiatives. first, we continue to increase our number of banking partners and diversify our funding sources, which has allowed us to obtain cheaper funding from partners with better asset quality.
second, the credit insurance premium on our loan portfolio has also been reviewed as our insurance partners took better credit and the customer quality into consideration to lower their pricing and without a greater portion of credit risk. third, the early payoff effect decreased significantly because we have changed the way we charge our customers. fourth, we achieved significant efficiency gains in our sales and marketing as well as our operations. as a result, we are confident that even if we released our apr further into the future, we should be able to maintain the stability in our take rate and net margin in the regional credit participation.
second, we maintained a strong pace of loan volume growth, coupled with business mix improvement. on the retail credit side, we grew our mid loan sales by 11.8% to 152.7 billion during the second quarter of 2021, in line with our previous guidance of 145 billion to 155 billion. at the same time, we continue to focus on service more business owners and improving the risk profile of our borrowers. in second quarter excluding our subsidiary, 77% of new loans facilitated were refers to more owners, up from 72.6% for the same period of 2020.
high-quality borrowers, defined as g1 to g3 borrowers by our own internal system, contributed 63.7% of the new general unsecured loans facilitated in the second quarter, compared to 59.4% for the same period of 2020. on the side, our total client assets increased by 12.4% in to 451.1 billion as of june 30, 2021, exceeding our previous guidance target of 12.1% growth for 420 million. site asset contribution from mass affluent customers who invest more than 700,000 further increased to 18.2% as of june 30, 2021, up from 76.3% as of march 31, 2021. third, we continue to make progress in executing our plan for a more sustainable risk model.
loans were net account for 16% of new loans facilitated in the second quarter, up from 4.4% in the same period of 2020. new loan facilities account for 76.3% of new loans facilitated in the second quarter, down from 89.1% a year ago, while our funding partners bought risk for 4.8% of new loans facilitated in the second quarter. as of june 30, our outstanding balance of loans facilitated with guarantees from third-party credit enhancement partners had decreased to 84.3% from 94.3% a year ago. all of the aforementioned operating metrics exclude those of our consumer finance subsidiary.
at the same time, we continue to focus on improving our asset quality. in the second quarter, our c2m flow rate for or facilitated was 44% versus 0.5% a year ago. the 30-day past-due delinquency rate for all loans facilitated was further improved to 1.9% as of june 30, 2021, from 2% as of march 31, 2020. the 90-day past delinquency rate for the total loan facility stabilized at 1.1% as of june 30, 2021, on par with 1.1% as of march 31, 2021.
all of the aforementioned operating methods exclude most of our consumer finance history and the mediation product which will represent roughly 1% of the total loans tax. fourth, we substantially completed the runoff of legacy p2p products in our wealth management business. during the quarter, current assets from legacy p2p products were reduced to 44 million from 4 billion in the previous quarter, effectively completing our business transformation. meanwhile, our take rate for the segment was 31.8 bps increasing by 3.6 bps from the previous quarter.
these improvements were primarily driven by our continued development in standard wealth insurance products offset by a decrease in deposit products. now let's take a closer look into our second-quarter financials. during the second quarter, our total income increased by 17.3%, and our core business income, excluding investment income grew by 19.1%. on the back of this growth, our business and risk-sharing model continues to evolve, driving a change in the revenue mix of our retail credit facilitation business.
for example, during the quarter, while the platform service fees decreased by 8.8% to 9.2 billion, our net interest income grew 98.7% to 3.2 billion and our guaranteed income grew by more than 800% to 891 million. in addition, other income, which is directly linked to delivering services to our financial partners, increased by 205.1% to 1.1 billion. as a result, our retail credit presentation platform service fee as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 62% from 79.8%. in addition, as we continue to utilize consolidated trust plans, which provides lower funding costs in funding operations.
our net interest income as a percentage of total revenue increased to 21.8% from 12.9% a year ago. moreover, as we continue to bear more trend risk, we generated more guaranteed income causing our guarantee income as a percentage of total revenue to reach 6% as compared with 0.7% a year ago. by expanding our services to our credit enhancement partners in account management, collections, and other value-added services. our other income as a percentage of total revenue increased to 7.2% from 2.8% a year ago.
our investment income decreased by 83.2% to 37 million in the second quarter from 220 million in the same period of 2020, mainly due to losses from the change in fair value of assets. on the wealth management front, our platform transaction and service fees increased by 39.9% on to 407 million in the second quarter from 291 million in the same period of 2020. this increase was mainly driven by the increase in fees generated from our current products and services. now moving now to our expenses.
in the second quarter, total expenses grew by 2.2% to 8.5 billion. however, excluding credit impairment losses, financial costs, and other losses, total expenses actually decreased by 1.7% in the second quarter, underscoring the steady improvement of our operating efficiencies across most business areas. our sales and marketing expenses, which include expenses for borrowers and investor acquisition as well as general sales and marketing decreased by 6.3% to 4.3 billion in the second quarter. as a result of our efforts to further optimize our sales productivity and sales commissions as well as the higher base in the second quarter of 2020 due to nonrecurring expenses, our borrower acquisition expense, which are a major component of our total sales and marketing expense decreased by 19.5% year over year to 2.6 billion.
in addition, our investor acquisition and retention expenses also decreased in the second quarter, mostly due to our optimization of investor acquisition channel costs. our general sales and marketing expenses, which are mainly comprised of payroll and related expenses for marketing personnel, brand promotion costs, consulting fees, business revenue costs as well as other marketing and advertising costs increased by 33.8% to 1.5 billion in the second quarter from 1.1 billion a year ago. this year-over-year increase was largely due to the lower base in the second quarter of 2020, resulting from the social security relief during the covid-19 outbreak in the same period. our general and administrative expenses increased by 21.1% to 798 million in the second quarter from 659 million a year ago.
this increase was mainly due to the lower base in the second quarter of 2020 and headcount expansion in the second quarter of 2021 to support our new business ramp in initiatives including the development of our consumer finance business. our operations and servicing expenses decreased by 3.3% to 1.48 billion in the second quarter from 1.53 billion a year ago. this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in post-origination management expenses, driven by our improvements in management collection efficiency and partially offset by the increase in the trust plan management expenses, resulting from increase in usage of consolidated trust plans. as we maintain our commitment to investing in technology research and development, our technology and analytics expense increased by 18.6% to 570 million in the second quarter.
additionally, our credit impairment losses increased by 133.5% to 1.4 billion in the second quarter from 597 million a year ago. this was due to the continuing evolution of our business model, which led to increased loan-related risk exposure and higher upfront credit impairment losses. it is worth noting that the increase in impairment losses is purely a function of the increase in the proportion of the credit risks borne by us. while the overall credit profile of our borrowers has continued to improve as mentioned earlier.
our finance costs decreased by 37.4% to 276 million in the second quarter from 441 million a year ago, mainly due to the decrease in our balance of convertible bonds, which led to lower borrowing costs and increase in interest expense resulting for increase in deposits. as a result of foreign exchange rate gains, we booked 301 million in other gains for the second quarter of 2021, while our effective tax rate decreased to 26% from 29% a year ago. consequently, our net profit increased by 53.2% to 4.7 billion in the second quarter from 3.1 billion a year ago. meanwhile, our basic and diluted ears per ads were rmb 2 and rmb 1.9, respectively, in the second quarter of 2021.
as of june 30, 2021, we had a cash balance of 39 billion, compared to 24 billion as of december 31, 2020. net cash flow from operating activities was 2.1 billion in the second quarter of 2021. now turning to our guidance for the second half and full year of 2021. for the second half of 2021, we expect our new loan facilitated to be in the range of 324 billion to 240 billion and the client assets to be in the range of 450 billion to 460 billion.
meanwhile, as we maintain our growth momentum and we continue to improve our operating efficiency, we expect our total income to be in the range of 31 billion to 31.3 billion, our net profit to be in the range of 6.6 billion to 6.8 billion in the second half of 2021. this translates into a year-over-year net profit growth of 32% to 36% for the second half of '21 and a 33% to 34% for the full-year 2021. these forecasts reflect our current and preliminary views on the market and operational conditions, which are subject to change. this concludes our prepared remarks for today.
operator, we are now ready to take questions.
",2021-Q2,LU
1.0,,,1.0,":
operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from richard xu from ms. please go ahead. 
richard xu -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you very much. congratulations for the strong third quarter. just have a couple of questions on the funding part at the moment. one is basically, are we seeing opportunity to further reduce the funding costs or basically the yield from the funding partners that we work with at the moment since we're expanding our cooperation population.
and in addition to that, are we seeing these banks are taking more risk on their own. so what percentage of risks are taken directly by the banks at the moment.
y.s. cho -- co-chief executive officer
ok. the proceeds of our funding costs how much risk is there. as of today, we have 59 partner banks and six trust companies. and then in terms of mix, bank funding takes about 60% and then 40% are from trust at different funding cost.
the bank funding cost is at 6.4% and trust at 5.6%. so going forward, we believe -- later we can discuss about take rate this year and next year. we believe we have more room in funding costs to further reviews and safeguard our take rate on the decrease in healthcare environment. as of today, if you look at our fourth quarter number, our sales guarantee portion, it takes up to 20% renewals.
and then our dependence on insurance companies, especially ping an p&c, it went down 70%. so the rest about 20% -- the rest of about 10% are taken by -- in terms of risk-sharing, 10% are taken by partner bank and also insurance companies together. 
operator
thank you. your next question comes from winnie wu from bofa. please go ahead.
winnie wu -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hello?
greg gibb -- co-chief executive officer
winnie, go ahead.
winnie wu -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
oh, ok. sorry. yeah. so i want to ask a high-level question regarding how does management think about the difference between the credit assistant lending model versus the co-lending model.
i mean, apparently, regulators have made pretty strict rules regarding the co-lending model, right, the risk sharing, the percentage funding sharing which is more capital intensive. but in fact, essentially, the way lufax has been complying with the regulation, you are taking more risk because you are putting on long-term balance sheet, and you do have the capital to be fully compliant. whereas on the other side, the so-called assistant lending model has -- is facing more regulatory uncertainty regarding the license requirement regarding the disconnection from the banks. so strategically, how do you compare the pros and cons of those two business models? and where do you see lufax business model evolving over time? 
greg gibb -- co-chief executive officer
thanks, winnie. it's greg. i'll take a first shot at your question and then to see if y.s. has anything to add.
i think that the way the regulators increasingly look at this is really in two buckets, right? there's loans done by banks and then everything else is really regarded as a form of facilitation and cooperation. and i think that under the bucket facilitation and cooperation, and there's been some recent announcements in the last couple of days about ant's requirements in terms of how they partner with banks. the core of this is really that you have the skin in the game. and we have done it at 20% up to now, but we'll probably be moving to 30% over the next 12 to 18 months.
and so that skin in the game is robust and very much in line with the overall steered regulation. the second is that when you take this skin in the game, you need to have a license that is regulated and where capital leverage is controlled within 10 times. and so we do that through our guarantee company. our leverage today on those guaranteed companies is under three times.
and so we're very well-positioned to handle all of that. i think the other thing i would just highlight is that if you look at the requirements that have been announced around -- and over the last couple of days, they now have to split the lending they do through their consumer finance company and they're partnering with banks, and it has to be separately branded. we are already compliant with that requirement in that our consumer finance business is separately branded. and when customers process a loan through our facilitation, the banks themselves are disclosed.
and then each bank carries out its own risk process to prove the lender. so we think that we're unique in having that guarantee company in really taking shared risk on every loan and bringing that to 30% and then having the capital behind it and then in disclosing our bank partners in the process. and i think it will be -- honestly, it's going to be difficult for some players in the market to really meet those capital requirements going forward. so i don't think there's that much of a distinction between co-lending and facilitation.
the real issue is having that capital to back up risk sharing. y.s., anything to add? 
david choy -- chief financial officer, credit facilitation
i think -- technically speaking, like, we are not co-lending for sure. we don't have lending license. all funds comes from bank or some trust companies. and then we are not the -- either because we are financing guarantee license company.
and so the way we do it is property with our financing guarantee license is core. but neither is -- how do we -- we don't think regulator, they clearly separate co-lending and then assistance lending. we believe going forward, one part is -- one regulation will apply to all different model of loan services, including a assistance lending and also co-lending and other pure presentation, right, only effect the bank loan, which they pay all functional loans by themselves from savings underwriting collection. in our case, so our future model, i think we already -- we already have a clear mindset in discussion with regulators.
so going forward, we take all loan funds with -- that come from banks and trust companies. we don't provide any fund, but we are only taking 40% credit risk and then the rest 70% we take -- eventually be taken by fund providers, but it will take some time to reach that point. so as a bridge, we use our management partners. so eventually as a player, if you ask me what is our future model, clearly spend, all funds come from bank first, the risk sharing 30% by us and all the rest 70% are taken from the partners. 
operator
thank you. your next question comes from may yan from ubs. please go ahead.
may yan -- ubs -- analyst
thank you. can you hear me?
greg gibb -- co-chief executive officer
yes. go ahead, may.
may yan -- ubs -- analyst
ok. thank you. thank you, greg. maybe i'll follow up on winnie's earlier question, still about regulation.
so the cbirc, the bank regulator have said that they -- or pboc as well, they were separate, make clear boundary between financial services, the lending technology services, and credit scoring. so it looks like it's maybe targeting to have first -- each operator should have certain type of licenses that will allow you to do this -- to be engaged in such activities. and then secondly, to source split or separate the whole -- the operation current loan facilitation model, which covers the whole of the business chain. so does that mean that in the end, so the service part, the technology service part will be segregated out of the lending and also maybe guarantee as well.
so -- because is that being technically happening in how you can conduct your lending or the whole loan facilitation on business. i don't know if i'm clear or not on that question. and then also earlier mentioned that by march, we will be connected to the credit -- some kind of credit scoring services and paying a small fee of about less than rmb 100,000 per month. i just want to confirm that, so you already -- is there a guidance that the loan facilitation companies or lufax need to do so and to which credit scoring sort of the agencies.
and then also, sorry, on the operating front, we saw 59 insurance groups, the sales force has quite a lot of turnover and has -- sales force has declined a lot that -- has that impacted through your customer acquisition, selling by their sales force, etc.? by the way, it's very good, very strong third quarter results, and also great to hear about the dividend payout. congratulations. 
y.s. cho -- co-chief executive officer
thank you, may. so let me start from the back. the live agents, number of live agents has been declined from 1 million now reached about 70,000, right? then that initially it affects our business growth, that's true. if you look at our -- the sales channel mix.
last year they used to contribute about almost 40% or 14 a few years back. but if you look at third quarter this year number, they now contribute only 28% of total loans. so now we have a lot less dependence on live channels. why? our direct sales, own our sales force, their sales contribution increased up to more than 50% by now.
and other -- this year, again -- we get the last year contribution, while the absolute sales contribution amount will decrease further, we think so. but we are late because even if they decreased a little bit from that 28% contribution, our contribution from direct sales, that part our annual growth is almost 20%. so that is enough, more than enough to cover the shortfall from live agent channel. i don't let -- discuss this number before.
we have direct sales full capacity ratio. this full capacity ratio of 99 margin was less than 90% in the second quarter. but when we finished first quarter, it's already 100%. i think our guidance reform.
we started putting more investment on this developing and expecting and cascading our higher performance director. and now we see an interest in that and then we have full capacity ratio. so i think that means that we are very much confident despite live channel decline further next year, yesterday confidence, and overall, we can deliver -- we can achieve 2 billion -- at least 2 billion sales growth. and then second question is about -- was about something credit scores, first point, right? that we are in close discussion with pboc directly.
and then we build our process in detail. if i make quarter numbers, normally we share with banks about 300 data for one customer. and as pboc said, out of -- in that about 80 data basically must go through the company who had credit license. so that process, now we are working with.
and as greg said, these new process will be in place by march next year. why? the early comments from pboc, june 2023. so we will be ready or ahead of pboc requirement. and then so that doesn't mean the business expands.
we estimate the total is 25 -- 60,000 or 70,000 per month which is very much minimal. so it doesn't mean payout in this process. it doesn't offset our previous profitability. 
greg gibb -- co-chief executive officer
and so maybe to go to the top end of your question, the way that lufax holdings is set up is that each business line is very clearly segregated, very clearly segregated in terms of operation, technology stack, people, corporate governance, etc. so we are already very clearly split by business line. the lending business is also very clearly split in its enablement to partner banks and trust companies and that is really where we process the flow of borrowers that is done through our technology platform. and it passes all of the data, as y.s.
just mentioned, to our banks and trust partners for their separate decision-making. all of our process there does not touch upon a payments license which i think was one of the more major focus areas for ant, which is really to separate payments and lending. our lending is entirely separate in that regard. but the other thing i want to highlight is that no matter what your business model is, this requirement by regulators to have skin in the game, that part of it must be licensed.
and so we do that through our guarantee company in terms of being able to provide that skin in the game. so i think as you look down the path of regulation, your processes in terms of where you're partnering with institutions on the technology side have to be clear and separate from other services. but where you have to bear skin in the game, you have to have requisite licenses to do that. and then in the corporate governance, you have to have separation in that setup, which we have today.
may, just to double-check that we've answered your questions. 
may yan -- ubs -- analyst
can i follow up? follow-up on that. if the -- i guess, the edge for lufax business model is having the guaranteed side of the business, which is licensed and in the intention of the central bank and cbirc is to have all the information flow into the credit scoring agencies and that can be used and shared with other financial institutions, etc. then within other loan facilitation companies or internet technology companies, they can also have the guarantee -- try to get guarantee license, and then they can sort of kind of avoid the credit scoring, extending data to the scoring agencies, too, right? so i understand it may take some time for them to get the guarantee license, but that could also be a way to avoid the regulation, right? why we can --
greg gibb -- co-chief executive officer
our view of it is -- our view, may, for what it's worth, and this has come from our -- a lot of interaction with regulators is that the core principle of data eventually being shared through the rating licenses as y.s. just said, right? in our case, 80 of the 300 variables that we share with banks need to go through that license. i think that's going to be true no matter what your business model is, right? the second thing that we believe is that no matter what your business model is co-lending facilitation or other definition, you will have to have skin in the game. and then behind that skin in the game, you'll have to have an entity that can bear that capital.
i think what i would highlight is other people can get guaranteed licenses. it does take time. but i think the more important thing is if you look through the regulation. what they're looking to prevent is instances where platforms are providing a lot of guarantees beyond what's just indicated in the license.
what they're going to do is really look through the total loans that you help facilitate that you are really bearing risk on 30% of that and that you then have capital to back up that 30%, right? we can't be under the table or side agreements or anything else, which doesn't fully disclose that capital requirement. so i think that's the core direction. and i think that where we are unique is having those licenses in place, having the national coverage, and having more than enough capital to meet those requirements today. 
operator
thank you. your final question comes from hans fan from clsa. please go ahead.
hans fan -- clsa -- analyst
sure. thanks, management, for giving me this opportunity, and congratulations again for the decent results. i have two questions. i think first one is also regarding the regulatory trends.
as you probably recall back in july, mr. hu, mr. zhao from the consumer protecting bureau of cdic once mentioned that the platform companies charge too much profit from the loan facilitation. so what's your view on that? is that means that potentially, cbirc really care about the net margin of lufax.
do we see any sort of pressure on the regulatory side in the coming years in terms of squeezing our net margin? i think that's the first question. second one is more on the operating side regarding rcs. because the loan growth in third quarter was quite strong. and also, we mentioned that the sales productivity was getting better.
so here, i just want to check what's your view regarding the loan demand despite of the economic slowing down. what you see loan demand for our sme customers? and what we have done in terms of -- to promote the productivity of the direct sales team? and how can we reduce the sales commission rates, as we mentioned in the announcement. yes, so that's pretty much about the -- my questions.
y.s. cho -- co-chief executive officer
ok. let me -- i will take the first question later to -- pent up demand. the above supplement from global team -- actually, we don't have any concern because he's very -- he's a person who provided window guidance for lufax in the last three years. so our rectification products in terms of seen portion increase or price decrease inviting more insurance partners are all following his window guidance.
so we haven't got any thought instruction from -- and the once he said that the total fee charged by lufax, including guarantee fee, service fee should be less than 5.5% of loan amount, that sellers loan amount, which we already got hit last year. so since then, we haven't got any further instruction or demand from -- or other partners which we got, so we don't have any concern. then i can later -- i think may add some more comments. and then second question about the rcs loan demand and then -- this year, if you look at year-on-year number if i'm not wrong, sales grew by 60% and balance grew by 20% so i think loan demand is truly there, is very strong.
i think this is, thanks to our unique positioning because providing consistent loan service for small and micro business owners in this sector, we don't see really many other players there. so we have huge demand, and then we can select the customer we want. so loan demand-wise we don't have any concern. and talking about sales, our main focus is gradually leading, therefore, how we can provide more technology tools to support direct sales.
and then also, if you understand our direct sales mix, 10% of high-performing direct sales, they contribute almost 40% of total new ones. and then on that part from fourth quarter, we launched a new direct sales management strategy. so we hire and then train and quick base high performing directors more. and then, who are they, they are number of people who had -- and then that -- the card is created.
so i think those, the high potential sales force, we provide -- we added one -- we provide high fixed salary, but a low commission in the first five months, so that they can come and settle with time. and then -- senior managers we provide yearly bonus based on current loan balance. so this year, if you look at the sales market, actually total expense didn't increase at all plus from fourth quarter, we added a little bit more. and next year, i don't think we have a room to reduce sales commission or reduce unit margins i think overall, because our debt -- we have to guarantee, we have to make sure that our sales force are very competitive and they are very well rewarded but we see more in funding cost and the c-round premium.
i this those -- i believe the more to say. so in the first quarter this year, our average loan price for total loans are about 20%, c-round about 22%. our plan for the next phase -- we don't need to dramatically and quickly use price for that -- we don't need, but we gradually very slowly reduced together with funding costs and c-round optimization. so we can safeguard our take rate and net margin.
so next year in overall, the price decrease will be very minimal, and then our take rate, net margin will be perfectly, i think. 
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
yu chen -- head of board and capital markets
so one quick summary of the translation, which chairman ji just said basically 3 points to summarize. number one, we're fully aligned with the regulatory and the overall society's intention to lower funding costs for small business owners, those who are uttermost by technology, efficient improvement, risk management better negotiations with funding partners to lower our cost components to achieve that. second point, i believe the lowering of our funding cost for the society is going to take some time to achieve. it's not something that can be solved overnight.
it requires all participants to work together to achieve that. and obviously, we are part of that. and thirdly, so far, there are no specific requirements on the exact number or timing from the regulators on us. but obviously, we do have internal targets.
we fully understand the future direction, and we have internal targets to lower to a profit level at the right time. is there any other questions? 
operator
there are no further questions at this time.

yu chen -- head of board and capital markets
in mid-october, mr. guo shuqing, chairman of cbirc stated publicly that -- in the process of rectifying reforming the 14 internet-based lending platforms, the financial regulators raised close to 1,000 issues. the majority of which have been addressed and about half of which have been resolved. as such, we anticipate more material substantive progress by the end of this year.
recently, we noted the speech by certain regulators on the boundaries of financial licenses.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
yu chen -- head of board and capital markets
i want to reiterate, among those companies undergoing regulatory review, lufax has maintained constructive dialogues with the regulatory authorities and progressed smoothly through all aspects of the replication by leveraging our domain expertise financial dna, and thorough understanding of regulations. our early understanding is reasonably consistent with recent requirements, and we periodically review all of our business lines to ensure compliance upholding our principal pre-emptive diagnosis and served operational adjustment for timely optimal results, and we will proactively adjust our business direction to more closely align with regulatory trends as always.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
yu chen -- head of board and capital markets
on the esg front, we devoted substantial resources to establishing ourselves as a role model for overseas-listed chinese companies in terms of compliance governance. our initial post-ipo esg report published in september of this year, showcased our achievements in implementing strong governance, green finance, and consumer services and protection. also, our inclusion in the ftse russell's to major esg indices demonstrated market endorsement of our accomplishment in esg, corporate responsibility, and social value.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
yu chen -- head of board and capital markets
i then want to share some of the key investor concerns. since releasing our q2 results, our management team have maintained frequent communication with investors by hosting more than 60 events, including post earnings calls, and holding roadshows and other meetings.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
yu chen -- head of board and capital markets
we received 320 questions from investors, among which 253 questions, or 79% of the total were about macroeconomics and regulatory trends. 51 or 16% of the total questions were about our business operations and the remainder were about our capital market initiatives, such as dividend payout and share buyback. i will share our thoughts on macroeconomics and regulatory directions, then greg and james will discuss our operational and financial details.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
yu chen -- head of board and capital markets
regarding macroeconomics, some investors are concerned about the impact of our future business from the tightening of the china's property market and the slowdown of overall economic growth.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
yu chen -- head of board and capital markets
our direct and indirect client exposure to the real estate industry is rather small. also bearing in mind that even though the macroeconomy may be under pressure in the near term, medium, small and micro-sized businesses are extremely resilient and served as crucial blood vessels of the chinese economy. consequently, we have seen healthy and stable numbers in business and risk metrics. at the same time, we'll remain vigilant and closely monitor all aspects.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
yu chen -- head of board and capital markets
second, regarding regulatory policies, some investors questioned whether china will remain its return to capital market opens and while regulations would head next.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
yu chen -- head of board and capital markets
we believe that china is at a critical point of transitioning from high-speed to high-quality growth. the nation's reformative and open stance remains unchanged. its capital market stays connected to the world economy and needs investments from around the globe to develop a healthy domestic capital market and its regulatory authorities aim to maintain long-term market stability.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
yu chen -- head of board and capital markets
speech given at the opening ceremony of the fourth china international import expo, president xi reaffirmed china's willingness to open to the rest of the world. at the 2021 annual financial street forum held in late october, vice premium liu he declared that the objectives of china's financial system should include promoting a high level of openness establishing a fair market environment, protecting the legal rights of foreign enterprises in china, prioritizing the development of financial technology and improving the quality and efficiency of financial services. we believe that the government will keep refining regulatory policies to foster a stable and sustainable environment for capital market development.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
yu chen -- head of board and capital markets
when it comes to implementing industry-specific regulations, such as licensing requirements for credit scoring, preventing loan facilitators and co-lenders from sharing bought data directly with financial institutions, and reducing borrowing costs, the direct impact on our business is rather muted. our business model and operational performance remains steady and healthy, thanks to our pre-emptive regulatory assessment, proactive operational adjustments, and anticipatory business realignment. going forward, we'll continue to maintain, open up frequent dialogues with regulators at all levels and through all available channels in order to maintain a tight and accurate grasp of policy intentions and achieve a more thorough implementation of regulatory requirements.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
yu chen -- head of board and capital markets
certainly, lufaxs' unique business model. i would like to reiterate the compliant and unique nature of our retail product facilitation business, as well as the core competitive advantages of our business model.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
yu chen -- head of board and capital markets
first, we focus on serving small macro businesses in the third quarter of 2021, 81% of our new loans were distributed to small macro business owners. as of the end of september, we had provided credit facilitation services to 16.21 million cumulative borrowers.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
yu chen -- head of board and capital markets
second, we conduct our business activities through licensed financial guarantee subsidiaries. what differentiates us from those unlicensed and pure-play loan facilitators is that we have a business license to provide financial guarantees backed with registered capital that we participate in the lending business in a material manner and that we ensure strict regulatory compliance in every aspect of our business process.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
yu chen -- head of board and capital markets
third will be a credit risk on those new loans that we facilitate in accordance with regulatory guidance and requirements, we have established a sustainable risk-sharing business model and increased our risk exposure in the third quarter of 2021, excluding our consumer finance subsidiary, our credit risk exposure to the new loans facilitated increased to 20%. going forward, to stay in sync with regulatory guidance, we plan to make additional preparations for further expansion of our credit risk exposure.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
yu chen -- head of board and capital markets
third, we conventionally reduce our borrowers cost, thanks to our technology advancement and managerial efficiency improvement. since third quarter, we have reduced the all-in cost of new loans facilitated to 21.8%. going forward, we'll continue to optimize our cost structure through technology and fulfill our commitment to financial inclusion.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
yu chen -- head of board and capital markets
in conclusion, we believe that fintech industries regulatory oversight and ratification should achieve more progress, which in turn should iterate stable and sustainable industry growth. our retail credit facilitation and wealth management businesses are fully aligned with china's policy objectives of supporting small and macro businesses to attain common prosperity. in a constantly evolving regulatory environment, our unique business model and strong corporate governance enable us to accomplish gradual business transformation and achieve steady growth.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
yu chen -- head of board and capital markets
looking ahead, we'll continue to uphold our commitments to maintaining full operational compliance, providing compassionate and inclusive financial services setting ourselves as a role model for corporate governance and the overseas-listed chinese companies, and generating increasing value for our shareholders and our society.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
yu chen -- head of board and capital markets
with that, i will turn the call over to greg, who will share our business updates for the quarter.
greg gibb -- co-chief executive officer
thank you, chairman, ji. we delivered strong revenue and profit growth in the third quarter of 2021 despite the changing economic and regulatory environment. we grew our revenue by 21.8% and our net profit by 90.8% year over year, respectively. excluding the impact of the c-round restructuring expenses in the third quarter of 2020, our adjusted net profit increased by 18.1% year over year.
before james takes you through our detailed operational and financial updates, i'd like to cover three broader areas related to our business. first, industry concern on the real estate sector; second, an update on the regulatory rectification progress; and third, our financial position and capital-related plans. concerns on the real estate sector. while we've observed the risk in the broader economic environment, including increased credit risks in the real estate sector, there has been no impact on our business performance to date.
we do not provide lending services to property developers, although some of our small business customers produce construction materials and provide home decoration services. our exposure to borrowers who are directly or indirectly linked to the property sector is quite limited. to date, we have not detected any sign of credit deterioration in our secured or unsecured loan facilitation portfolios, and we will remain vigilant and address credit policies quickly if needed. as of this third quarter flow-through rates indicating future credit quality remains stable and in line with the previous several quarters.
our wealth management business and proprietary investment book have limited exposure to the real estate sector. second, a little bit more on the regulatory rectification progress. as mentioned by chairman ji, regulators recognize that the current industry rectification effort should see substantial progress by the end of the year and some industry observers believe the current stage of regulatory changes is reaching finalization. based on our understanding of the current regulatory requirements, we do not anticipate any major changes to our business model, nor a substantial impact on future business development.
over the last year, regulatory rectification of lending businesses has really included the following elements for platforms, separating lending services from other financial and payment services, rationalizing personal consumption risks, facilitating lower loan pricing to support the real economy, and having skin in the game to share credit risk with requisite licenses and capital requirements. rectification has also required partnering banks to demonstrate independent risk management, set limits for cooperation with any one platform, and limit lending to their geographic footprint. finally, rectification requires data sharing between platforms and finance institutions to be conducted via a credit rating license by the mid of 2023. lufax continues to make consistent progress on all rectification requirements.
lufax conducts lending, facilitation independent of any other financial service, about 81% of all new loans facilitated as of the third quarter with small business owners in line with policy priorities. all-in pricing for loan balance has dropped to 23.1% as of the third quarter this year, down from 26.6% a year ago. as of the third quarter, we now bear risk on 20% of all new loans our nationwide guarantee companies, which share credit risk on all new lending operate with a leverage ratio under three times as of september 31 this year. given our strong capital position and likely future regulatory requirements, we expect to bear risk on 30% of all new loans in the future, probably by the end of next year.
all of the aforementioned operating metrics exclude those of our consumer finance subsidiary. lufax's 589 bank partners operate with their independent risk systems. given our diversified partnerships, current cooperation is fully aligned with the regional footprint matching requirements and each partnership operates within the single platform concentration limits. we are currently in discussions with a number of parties to establish a credit-rating license within the stated rectification period, if this indeed becomes a requirement.
and here, i'll just elaborate a bit. we prepare -- we will be prepared to connect to a third-party credit-rating license by march of next year. and based on our latest understanding, the cost of that connection will not exceed more than cny 100,000 per month. so indeed, it will not bring additional substantial costs the way that we operate.
third, on our financial position and capital plans. through this third quarter, we've been able to meet the rectification requirements and optimize customer pricing while sustaining both our revenue take rates and net profit margins at or above historical levels. as of september 31, our net asset is around cny 93 billion, liquid assets maturing in 90 days or less totaled cny 47 billion, providing us with a position of strength to maximize shareholder value and make ongoing investments in the business. in terms of capital management, as just mentioned, we've completed about 60% of the 1 billion in shareholder buyback that we've announced in recent quarters.
despite our plans to increase skin in the game in the lending facilitation business, our strong ongoing cash flows that we announce today that starting next year, we will begin to pay 20% to 40% of net profit of the previous year in cash dividend to shareholders. these plans should allow us to continue to improve shareholder return on equity and leave us with more than sufficient resources to continue to invest in our core business while taking advantage of opportunities which may arise medium term due to the changing industry and regulatory landscape. within the core business, our priority areas for investment remain upgrading our lending services direct sales force with new technology enablement tools, deepening deployment of ai capabilities in risk management and collections infrastructure adding new functionality to our product lines, and sharing technology capabilities with financial partners in both lending facilitation and wealth management. the main goals for our technology deployment are increasing market reach, enhancing our unique o2o business model productivity, deepening partner connectivity, and further automating services to improve both service quality and cost efficiency.
worthy of note is we did increase our o2o sales force serving primarily small business owners in q3 to around 64,000, up from 59,000 at the end of q2 to further expand market reach. the increase in direct sales was masked by an increase in sales force productivity. excluding new recruited sales force in q3, our productivity rose 8% quarter on quarter and 7% year over year. if we include the new recruited sales force, our productivity rose 4% quarter on quarter.
this increased investment in o2o direct sales reaffirms our view that our offline-to-online services approach is the most cost-effective way to increase the coverage of this otherwise hard-to-reach small business owner segment. also worthy of note is emerging affluent investors, those investing cny 300,000 or more on the platform made up 81% of customer assets on our wealth management platform, up from 78% a year ago. the revenue take rate for wealth management platform increased from 31.8 basis points to 44.1 basis points quarter on quarter due to the increased mix of qualified investor products, insurance services, and technology enablement fees. our overall performance for the third quarter is in line with our prior guidance.
and today, we reaffirm our prior guidance for the full year for revenue and profit growth. i'll now turn the call over to james zheng, our cfo, to go through the detailed operating and financial performance and our reaffirmed guidance for the year. 
james zheng -- chief financial officer
thank you, greg. i will now provide a closer look into our third quarter operational and financial results. before i begin, please be reminded that all numbers are in rmb terms and all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise stated. we delivered another very strong quarter, achieving double-digit growth in both revenue and net profit.
our total income increased by 21.8% to cny 15.9 billion, and our net profit increased by 90.8% to cny 4.1 billion year over year. if compared to adjusted net income in the same period last year, which excludes the impact of the c-round restructuring expenses, net profit increased by 18.1% year over year. let me share some of the business milestones we achieved during the quarter despite the economic slowdown and the regulatory overhead. first, we maintained stable unit economics despite apr declines.
our loan balance apr was 23.1% in the third quarter of 2021, a 0.9% point decline from 24% in the second quarter of 2021, and a 3.5% point decline from 26.6% in the third quarter of 2020. in comparison, our loan balance take rate remained stable at 9.7% in the third quarter of 2021, same as second quarter and a 0.3% point increase from the third quarter of 2020. we were able to buck the trend because we continue to diversify our funding sources and increase the number of banking partners we work with. additionally, we attained further reductions in the credit insurance premiums on our loan portfolio.
also, thanks to our new methods of charging customers, we experienced diminishing impact from the early loan repayments. above all, we drove relentless improvements in our sales and marketing efficiency. all these initiatives combined should enable us to maintain stability in our take rate and the net margin even if the apr may reduce further in our retail credit facilitation business in the future. second, we sustained growth in our overall loan volume with an optimized business mix.
on the retail credit side, we grew our new loan sales by 16.2% to cny 171.7 billion during the third quarter of 2021, in line with our expectations. at the same time, we continued focusing on serving more business owners and improving the risk profile of our borrowers. in the third quarter, excluding our consumer finance subsidiary, 80.5% of new loans facilitated were disbursed to small business owners, up from 75.7% in the same period of 2020. on the wealth management side, our total client assets increased by 12.4% to cny 425.1 billion as of september 30, 2021.
client asset contributions from mass-affluent customers investing more than cny 300,000 increased to 80.8% as of september 30, 2021, up from 77.5% as of september 30, 2020. third, we continue to evolve our risk-sharing business and stabilize asset quality. in line with prevailing regulatory requirements, we borrowed credit risks for 20% of the new loans we facilitated in the third quarter of 2021, up from 16% in the second quarter and 7% in the third quarter last year. as of september 30, 2021, our outstanding balance of loans facilitated with guarantees from third-party credit enhancement partners had a decrease to 81.1% from 91.8% a year ago.
all of the aforementioned operating metrics exclude growth of our consumer finance subsidiary. driven by the evolving risk-sharing business development and ongoing technological operational improvements, excluding our consumer finance subsidiary and the legacy products, dpd 30-plus and the dpd 90-plus delinquency rate remained stable at 1.9% and 1.1% for total loans we facilitated as of september 30, 2021, compared to 1.9% and 1.1% as of june 30, 2021. fourth, we improved the take rate of our wealth management segment through product mix optimization. during the quarter, our take rate for the segment increased by 12.3 bps to 44.1 bps from 31.8 bps in the previous quarter, primarily driven by our continued product mix optimization as we sharpened our focus on products with higher take rates.
now let's take a closer look into the financials. as the revenue mix of our retail credit facilitation business continue to improve, thanks to the evolution of our business and risk-sharing model. total income increased by 21.8% year over year. during the quarter, while the platform service fees decreased by 3.5% to cny 9.6 billion, our net interest income grew 57.2% to cny 3.8 billion, and our guaranteed income grew by more than 600% to cny 1.3 billion.
in addition, other income, which is directly linked to delivering services to our financial partners increased by 144% to cny 1 billion. as a result, our retail credit facilitation platform service fee as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 57.1% from 72%. because consolidated trust plans provide lower funding costs. we continue to utilize them in our funding operations enabling our net interest income as a percentage of total revenue to increase to 23.9% from 18.5% a year ago.
moreover, as we continue to build more credit risk, we generated more guaranteed income, reaching 8.1% as a percentage of total revenue, compared to 1.3% a year ago. by expanding our services to credit enhancement partners in account management, collections, and other value-added services, our other income as a percentage of total revenue increased to 6.3% from 3.1% a year ago. our investment income increased by 149% to cny 266 million in the quarter from cny 107 million in the same period of last year, mainly due to the increase of investment assets and return. in terms of wealth management, our platform transaction and service fees decreased by 4.7% to cny 467 million in the third quarter from cny 490 million in the same period of 2020.
this decrease was mainly driven by the runoff of legacy products and partially offset by the increase in fees generated from the company's current products. now moving on to our expenses. in the third quarter, our total expenses grew by 5.1% to cny 9.9 billion, excluding the cny 1.3 billion in c-round restructuring expenses in the third quarter of 2020. adjusted total expenses grew by 22.2% year over year mainly driven by the increase in credit impairment costs.
however, excluding credit and asset impairment losses, financial costs, and other losses, total expenses increased by 10.5% in the third quarter as we maintain our growth trajectory and further improved operating efficiency. our sales and marketing expenses, which include expenses for borrowers and invest acquisition, as well as general sales and marketing expense, increased by 7% to cny 4.6 billion in the third quarter. our borrower acquisition expenses, which are a major component of our total sales and marketing expenses, decreased by 8.5% year over year to cny 2.6 billion, mainly driven by increased sales productivity and the decreased sales commission. our investor acquisition and retention expenses increased by 10.1% to cny 0.2 billion in the third quarter, mostly due to the increase in marketing efforts to attract and retain investors.
our general sales and marketing expenses, which are mainly comprised of payroll and related expenses for marketing personnel, brand promotion costs, consulting fees, business development costs, as well as other marketing and advertising costs, increased by 39.2% to cny 1.8 billion in the third quarter from cny 1.3 billion a year ago. this year-over-year increase was largely due to the increase in sales costs and lower base in the third quarter of 2020, resulting from the social security release during the covid-19 outbreak in the same period. our general and administrative expenses increased by 46% to cny 937 million in the third quarter from cny 642 million a year ago. this increase was mainly due to the increase of accrued bonus driven by better performance, lower base fees in third quarter of 2020, and headcount expansion in the third quarter of 2021 to support our new business development initiatives, including the development of our consumer finance business.
our operations and servicing expenses increased by 6.3% to cny 1.7 billion in the third quarter from cny 1.6 billion a year ago. this increase was primarily due to the increase in trust plan management expenses resulting from the increase in usage of consolidated trust plan. we remain committed to investing in technology, research, and development as our technology and analytics expense increased by 8.7% to cny 524 million in the third quarter. our credit impairment losses increased by 74.8% to cny 1.7 billion in the third quarter from cny 952 million a year ago.
this was due to the continuing evolution of our business model, which led to increased loan-related risk exposure and higher upfront credit impairment losses. it is worth noting that the increase in impairment losses is purely a function of the increase of the proportion of credit risks borne by us. while the overall risk profile of our borrowers has continued to improve, as mentioned earlier. our asset impairment losses increased to cny 410 million in the third quarter due to the impairment losses of intangible assets and goodwill.
our finance cost decreased by 89.8% to cny 168 million in the third quarter from cny 1.7 billion a year ago, mainly due to the higher base in the third quarter last year, which included 1.3 trillion of c -- 1.3 billion of c-round restructuring expense. additionally, our effective tax rate decreased to 31% during the third quarter of 2021 from 40% in the same period of 2020. consequently, our net income increased by 90.8% to cny 4.1 billion during the third quarter from cny 2.2 billion in the same quarter of 2020. excluding the impact of the crm and restructuring expenses in the comparable quarter, adjusted net income increased by 18.1% year over year.
net margin was 25.8% in the quarter, compared to a net margin of 16.5% and adjusted debt margin of 26.6% in the same period of last year. meanwhile, our basic and diluted earnings per ads were rmb 1.76 and rmb 1.66, respectively. as of september 30, 2021, we had a cash balance of cny 30.5 billion, compared to cny 24.1 billion as of december 31, 2020. net cash flow from operating activities was cny 1.7 billion in the third quarter of 2021.
now -- turning now to the outlook. we reiterate our guidance for the full year of 2021. we expect our new loans facilitated to be in the range of cny 649 billion to cny 665 billion, the client assets to be in the range of cny 430 billion to cny 450 billion. meanwhile, as we continued our efforts to maintain growth momentum and continue improving our operating efficiency, we expect our total income to be in the range of cny 61.1 billion to cny 61.4 billion, and our net profit to be in the range of cny 16.3 billion to cny 16.5 billion.
this translates into year-over-year total income growth of 17% to 18% and year-over-year net profit growth of 33% to 34% for the full year of 2021. these forecasts reflect our current and preliminary views on the market and operational conditions, which are subject to change. this concludes our prepared remarks for today. operator, we're now ready to take questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] we have our first question from richard xu from morgan stanley. richard, please go ahead.
richard xu -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you, management, for the detailed explanations. i have just some additional questions on the, i guess, reform of the direct marketing channels. could management provide a little bit more details in terms of what's entailed? and then i notice basically in the past couple of years management in china been reducing the, i guess, the cost for the direct marketing channels. will this lead to rising costs, cost/income ratio, from the reform of direct marketing channels? and for the insurance channels, any expectations in terms of the contribution from those channels in a couple of years? thank you.
james zheng -- chief financial officer
ok. let me answer the question, and then greg can supplement if i miss any. so let me first give you the overallpicture on the new state owned by china. i talk about this reform.
if you look at our total sales growth ratio in 2021, it was 14.8%, 16.9% from direct sales while made negative 7% growth. in the fourth quarter, quarter on quarter, the total loans grew by 14.3%, in which direct sales delivered 21.6% growth, while [inaudible] negative 20% growth. the share general number channels, they are still delivering two-digit growth, but large channel contribution, their sales volume dropped, i mean, compared with the same period in 2021. their sales volume dropped by almost 40%, 40%, right? so as a result, the life channel contribution ratio to our new sales, it dropped from 36% in 2020 down to 29% in 2021 and then down to 24% in fourth quarter last year.
and if i measure january to feb number, it already came down to 20%. it's quite a rapid decrease. and this is a result of our management decision. this is why we exactly intended because if you understand the difference of ds channel and live channel.
as of today, the live channel credit quality, which is measured by net flow is almost 50% higher than ds channel. so we have control and safeguard our portfolio quality. so going forward, i believe this 20% live channel ratio will be maintained because we believe we took all the main actions by now to cull the rising risk of life channel. then going to direct reform.
so it's obvious that we have to increase sales volume from direct sales to cover the short from live channel. make sure i will emphasize, this reform -- widening by this reform is not to fix an issue. this is a good channel. as greg said, fourth quarter last year, ds channel sales volume growth rate was 21.6%, which was delivered by 8% head count growth and then 12% plus with growth.
so ds channel now in terms of new sales, delivery and credit quality. so this reform we are doing now is to increase ds channel contribution in sales volumes. of course, we want to achieve this through core property increment rather than having more and more taxes. so what we do is we quite that we launched from our fourth quarter last year.
so if we analyze our ds mix, we find that the group post sales experience [inaudible] before they joined us and have reasonably [inaudible] so they need to work hard for family. so those groups used to take about less than 10% of our new hire, but it increased to 45% by january this year. for that, we put extra input. we increased the fixed salary to affect more [inaudible] and then gradually, we change fixed salary to variable commission.
there is -- the others that every time will be six, our analysis shows that this [inaudible] they show [inaudible] higher than other groups. and then if we have more and more [inaudible] group, eventually this will further reduce our sales expense because sales expense components, one-thirds variable, fixed and then two-thirds are the variables. so when we have more and more higher [inaudible] we will eventually also decreased our direct sales cost. and then once those grow, too, they can deliver higher profitability and the low delinquency ratio, then we want to change the role from simple sales force to customer relationship managers so they can manage not only sales, but also second loan, for one case, complaint handling and all in question management.
and eventually, we incentivize them based on balance -- current balance in terms of loan amount, newer amount. and then if you see our [inaudible] i believe this task compared with value achieved in the last two years, for example, like recovery from the pandemic impact ahead of other players who are increasing sales portion from 1% to about 20% in cooperation with our 65 partner banks five first companies and keeping the net margin unchanged despite we sharply decreased our apr compared with those parts, i think this is to be simple task, and we have full confidence, then you can see that how we deliver this.
greg gibb
richard, any follow-up question on that?
richard xu -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's pretty clear. thank you.
operator
thank you. we will now have our next question from hans fan of clsa. please go ahead.
hans fan -- clsa -- analyst
thank you, management for giving me this opportunity to ask questions. i actually have two, if i may. so the first one is actually on the take rate in fourth quarter. we note that the take rate was down a lot q-on-q to 9%.
can you please elaborate on the drivers behind this? and also if you look into this year in terms of take rates, how do we see the change there? that's the first question. and the second question is on the regulatory side. the -- just now chairman ji mentioned -- sorry, greg mentioned that the -- by end of june is likely look at finished and connect to the third-party credit scoring companies. so just wondering how likely this to happen.
is that 100% sure? have we come out with a regulation on this yet? so because this is something really cleared by the market. so just wondering how confident we are on this.
guangheng ji -- chairman
thanks, let me answer your first question first. about the take rate. normally, the fourth quarter is the period we have the lowest take rate and margin. so if you compare year on year 2020 and 2021, the balance base unit actually didn't change at all.
i mean if you also look at [inaudible] if you look at our new business ua, our net margin didn't change any while our vp dropped by from like a plan to almost 27% down to 23%, which is like a full percentage point. so going forward, this year, how do you see the take rate and net margin trend? greg said in his speech, he said the older lines, like the new sales, the balance revenue and net profit estimates will increase by around 10%. so that will indicate, we believe, this year, our take rate net margin will not change much. why? number one, about the price discussion.
our average blended apr for me now is around 20%, 20%. so we believe this [inaudible] requirement. and then we don't see any need to further reduce our apr for new loans. so price, we think we can maintain the current level for new ones.
why we can save a further expense from operational costs and the funding costs, but that can be offset by that increase in credit cost in the first quarter, second quarter. so overall, i believe this year's net margin will remain not much changing.
hans fan -- clsa -- analyst
and on the regulatory -- the [inaudible] for june?
guangheng ji -- chairman
yes. [inaudible] so we are ready with a new process working with by [inaudible] so debt prices can be late [inaudible] by june this year. but we haven't got clear signal or clear guidance from pbc yet. we submitted our plan, but given that clear answer, so we are waiting.
but even if we do that, let me add just one more comment regarding the cost. i cost-outs about rmb 300,000 a month. so cost-wise, there's nothing, but i'm just telling you that process-wise, we are fully ready.
greg gibb
and was one of the reasons that the pboc hasn't given us a clear answer yet is they're still also not sure in a sense that our guarantee license is already [inaudible]
guangheng ji -- chairman
financial guarantee license company, they are not sure yet whether we have to follow this process. so we are waiting.
hans fan -- clsa -- analyst
right, right. and also, i remember last time in third quarter briefing, the management mentioned that there's also a potential chance we are seeking the possibility to see -- to apply for license of credit scoring company. is that on the table?
guangheng ji -- chairman
yes, that's on a table. but you may know that 8% of their shares is owned by ping an, right? so it's [inaudible] we also have a stakeholder in the company. and then that the plan that you mentioned this year is still going on.
hans fan -- clsa -- analyst
thank you so much.
greg gibb
next question, please.
operator
thank you. we now have questions from thomas wang from goldman sachs. please go ahead.
thomas wang -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you management. it's a good set of numbers. congrats on that. can i just check on the full year '22 guidance? if i roughly work on new loan numbers, first half guidance is only three to six and the full year is nine to 12 it roughly works out 15% to 20% implied for the second half.
can i just sort of get your thoughts on -- if you extend it a little bit further, do you think this is kind of a sustainable type of new loan facilitation growth? or do you -- have you factoring some sort of pent-up demand in that number? we may see some even normalization going forward in 2023. just to get your thoughts on why you think the second half numbers in that range. thank you.
guangheng ji -- chairman
ok. so i think the key here is for new sales. but if you remember, fourth quarter of guidance number, we believe new sales will not make growth from the previous year. the biggest reasons, as i said, the large channel contribution day the sales volume dropped almost by 40%, right? so even if direct sales grow by two digits, it cannot offset enough.
the short-term life channel are decrease sales will decrease. so it will take some time. but going forward, because we believe the 20% sales continued ratio from life channel, this will be maintained because we do ordinations right now. so the rest -- going forward, we gradually increase overseas volume by developing more and more direct channel.
so it takes time. so that will come. that will happen from second quarter. and then from second half, you used the sales growth ratio versus last year by more than two digits.
so that will drive our revenue and net income growth in the second half.
greg gibb
and so thomas, if you take that, as far as we can tell, the contribution from ping an life this year will be about 20%. and that may be true for another year or two, right, depending on the speed of the transition at ping an life itself. and so if you take that into account, rolling into 2023 with the reform on the ds side or the strengthening of the direct sales side, then to go back to a more sort of 15% level that you're seeing in the second half into 2023 is possible, right? so it is an adjustment in the first half of this year, which is slower. but as you look at the second half of the year, that is a good indication to where we think things are medium term.
thomas wang -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. so if i take it, basically, if the market is still there, it's not -- and kind of adjusting your internal on the channel on your sales force or that's why you have this kind of deep in the first half for 2022 place a bigger part in this growth to drive growth. where are you hiring kind of those new direct sales personnel? and so what type of person are you hiring? and then how you sort of training them?
guangheng ji -- chairman
yes. actually, we are hiring locally. so we have 35 local branches. they're hiring their own direct sales.
and then we are specifically targeting, as i explained, we call them hire. they have different profiles to analyze who's delivering higher sales volume, higher productivity and low delinquency ratio among our direct sales, almost 60,000 direct sales that we found that, in general, who had sales experience more than three years before they joined us and then a [inaudible] there are several profile indicators. so we are possibly targeting ties into higher to schools. and then those groups, they used to take less than 10% of our new hire last year, especially first half.
and as of today, they take about 40% -- more than 40% of new hire. so we are making progress. and how to hire them because earlier, the region -- they didn't want to -- they hesitate to joining us was because our fixed area was very, very low. so that we change it.
so we are offering fixed salary in the first six months. and then gradually, we switched the portion we gradually reduced fixed parts and increased variable bonus based on their performance. so this is a resolving higher issue. and then how we educate, how we train them? we have the training supplement.
we developed the online training tools through our sales app. so through that, we provide a lot more efficient spending than before. it's now off-line. we provide by four different targets for different groups, different profile.
we provide different head of training through online through sales app.
greg gibb
so i think that the interesting thing here, thomas, to sort of just hit your point is that for the first half, this is to a certain extent self-imposed because we want to make -- maintain the sort of long-term credit quality as a key criteria and just recognizing that was necessary, a necessary change to make, given some of the transformations on the ping an life side. i think that -- but yes has laid out what becomes interesting over time when you move into maybe next year is this [inaudible] group, this more experienced, more stable group of salespeople over time, the ability to deliver on a customer management model rather than a pure loan sales model is very powerful for our economics and our productivity. and so that at the end of the day is what we're really trying to build. and then the work behind that as well is really on the technology side to give them the tools to drive that customer management in an inefficient way.
and so this is kind of a more medium-term transition that you should see come through. it's more about changing mix in the first half of this year, but that it also involves changing a little bit business model and how we serve customers as you go into the medium term.
thomas wang -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it.
greg gibb
thank you, thomas.
chen yu -- head of investor relations and corporate development
please move to the next and last question, please.
operator
sure. we now have our last question from may yan from ubs. may, please go ahead.
may yan -- ubs -- analyst
ok. thank you, thank you for giving me a chance to ask the last question. i actually have three questions, if i may. the first one is to [inaudible] [foreign language]
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
may yan -- ubs -- analyst
[foreign language]
operator
may, sorry to interrupt. please kindly replace most of your questions in english. thank you.
chen yu
sorry, may.
may yan -- ubs -- analyst
ok. ok.
chen yu
sorry, may. shall i add to a quick summary of the q&a that just happened before we move on to next?
may yan -- ubs -- analyst
yes. yes, please go ahead. yes.
chen yu
so the question was on the regulatory sense of the april 29 ratification and whether there's likely going to be more scrutiny or regulations coming for the loan presentation model. that was the question. so the chairman also based on our overall judgment, obviously collecting information insights from a number of channels, including talking to various departments and talking to some of the other platforms in that's going through the review, we are forming a view that it is, number one, it is coming to an end. the process is coming to near the end of completion, given it is about a year long.
a second lufax holdings is one of the better ones. we're not saying we're the best among the 14, but we're definitely one of the better ones. and that's based on our judgment against her from multiple departments and probably to multiple people. in terms of the end results, personally, i don't think there will be an exact ranking of the 14 platforms, but i won't be surprised to see if they are grouping of different types of platforms.
for example, there could be two types. the first type is the ratification is almost complete or there is clear unacceptable plan for the ratification. and the second group, there is not exactly acceptable plans to complete the ratification. in terms of timing, look, we've been staying to the regulators [inaudible] hard, given it is coming to the one-year anniversary, we do think we need this to conclude.
and i'm pleased to say that i think people are the psc and the cbrs and csrc, they do hear our views and they do agree with us that they want to bring this to a conclusion. in terms of what we've done in the past two years, i think, through this process, very importantly, we've kind of rebuilt our trust with the regulators as to the process, obviously, we have redesigned a lot of our business models to be more compliant. in terms of the new regulations on loan facilitation, based on my communication, a personal understanding, we think the regulation is already enough. the focus is more on the actual implementation of those regulations, including some that is still going through consultation and the regulators would like to see the outcome of the early implementation rather than showing up new ones.
greg gibb
may, go ahead with your other two questions, please.
may yan -- ubs -- analyst
[foreign language] ok. thank you. [foreign language] sorry, my questions are so long. the other two questions i have, one is still regarding the business channel transformation that you mentioned the direct sales channel would have better asset quality.
i think, greg, you mentioned that free flow ratio has deteriorated a bit in the fourth quarter as you increase the business sources from direct channels. so is that mainly because of the macro environment changes that some retail loans are having some deterioration in the asset quality? or is it also because of some other reasons that maybe the life insurance side business has deteriorated a lot more? and the second sort of small question is about the take rate on the wealth management. you mentioned that the take rate has gone up. what kind of product was mainly driving that.
and also, going into the future, how the take rate improve further?
guangheng ji -- chairman
ok. the second question about the asset portion in the fourth quarter, yes, we confirm, may, because of the impact from life channel, if you exclude life channel and -- only the performance of the other channels, especially direct channels, that is quite stable, a little bit impact in december, january because of the lockdown of [inaudible] where we have two business centers. so they made minor impacts on our performance, but mostly the moderate impact came from the life situation. and that's why we made a rapid adjustment to channel mix.
greg gibb
maybe, may, i'll take your question on wealth before going back to chairman ji. well, basically, what we did through the course of 2021 is we let lower margin products kind of run off and replace them more -- with more focus on qualified investor products and also gradually the fund mix is also changing, too, within mutual funds to higher-margin products. and then we're also adding insurance services, which are higher margins. so all of those together as well as some of our services to third-party platforms, themes that we collect providing our technology to other financial institutions have been growing as well.
so if you take those accumulation, we see the number of, i think, 69 basis points in the fourth quarter, which was up a lot year on year, i expect in 2022 we'll continue to see improvement on this revenue over aum. adding another 10 basis points over the course of the year is probably a realistic expectation.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu
again, a quick summary of the q&a, just happened. the question was on the exact timing of the april 29 concluded announcement and whether that would impact hong kong listing. the answer is, again, the chairman personally and he stressed this many times that it is personal judgment that the announcement will likely be made in one go instead of separate announcement for each of the platforms. and on that announcement, there's likely going to be that, obviously, there's one group that the ratification is almost done or plan is acceptable, but they're ok to move off of things.
and the remaining of those plans are not acceptable, will require continued monitoring and scrutiny from the regulators. so he believes will be one announcement. and personally, he does not think that's going to be too long. but of course, the exact timing we'll need to wait for regulatory format announcement in a full announcement.
in terms of hong kong listing, yes, the april 29 ratification will impact the timing of hong kong listing. before we complete that, we will not go to hong kong. we have made preliminary discussions with boc, csc, cbrc and the china cybersecurity watchdog. so obviously, lufax will not pursue a hong kong ipo until we get blessing from those relevant regulators.
and the last point on the china-u.s. relationship, through our channels, we believe the regulators from both sides are having continued dialogue. we're tracking the wisdom. as you know, the impact of forced delisting of the chinese adrs will be too big for both sides to take.
so we think they are currently working very hard, and we hit a conclusion or some sort of plan or compromise will be reached soon.

in 2021, we achieved steady growth, improved regulatory compliance and corporate governance and strengthened our status as the role model for compliance and governance on overseas listed chinese companies.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu
our full year 2021 total income increased by 19%, net profit by 36% and non-ifrs net profit by 29% when excluding the impact of noncore items. as a result, our basic earnings per ads for 2021 reached rmb 7.11. at the same time, we increased our share of credit risk-bearing while proactively reducing the all-in cost of our 2021 average outstanding loan balance by three percentage points, improving regulatory compliance and contributing to the national growth of common prosperity.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu
in communicating with regulators, we had opened up dialogues through all available channels at all levels and achieved satisfactory results. upholding our principle of pre-emptive diagnosis and swift operational adjustments for timely optimal results, we maintained a business with the trend of regulatory changes.

secondly, key investor concerns.
guangheng ji -- chairman

chen yu
since releasing our q3 results, our management team had over 50 investor engagement events, including post earnings calls, road shows and other meetings.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu
based on our data, 66% of the investor questions were about business operations, 24% about macroeconomic and regulatory trends and the remainder about capital market initiatives such as dividend payout, share buybacks and hong kong listing. we're glad to see that investors are refocusing their attention back on to our core business as we gain more clarity on our regulatory front. i will share our thoughts on macroeconomic and regulatory direction. then greg and y.s.

updates on the april 29 ratification.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu
by the end of 2021, we had completed the vast majority of our ratification initiatives, and we're on track to clear the remaining issues that require prolonged efforts, including the closing of redundant subsidiaries, running off our online deposit products and stopping sharing certain borrower data directly with financial institutions. judging from information and insights gathered from our channels, including a statement from mr. guo shuqing, chairman of cbirc, during the q&a session of a press conference on march 2, we believe that the regulatory ratification process is gradually entering its final phase. we'll continue to push the ratification process toward the finish line and cooperate with the regulatory authorities for final review.
based on preliminary feedback from a number of relevant regulatory authorities, we are ranked in the front of the 14 companies undergoing regulatory review based on our ratification stance, execution plans and accomplished results. we envision that these aforementioned assessments will be validated over time.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu
local financial supervision and administration measures, the preliminary dropped.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu
although the preliminary draft mandated that local financial institutions shall not conduct business across provisional administrative boundaries, we foresee rather limited impact on lufax for the following reasons: first of all, our guarantee companies have largely completed the establishment of a nationwide local branch network that enables us to conduct local businesses. secondly, we possess a nationwide consumer finance license. thirdly, we have sufficient time to stay attuned to new licensing requirements, provide proactive plans and execute preparations as the draft regulation is currently still at the stage of public comments. with our abundant capital reserves, excellent compliance infrastructure and sound corporate governance, we're well-positioned to apply for our attention is currently still at the stage of public comments.
with our abundant capital reserves, excellent compliance infrastructure and sound corporate governance, we're well positioned to apply for a national micro line license or any necessary license should they become available.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu
response to chinese adr delisting risk.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu
forcing adrs to delist from the u.s. exchange will affect not just us, but all u.s.-listed chinese companies. with such regulation's long lasting and widespread impact, we believe that both chinese and u.s. authorities are engaged in constant discussions.
since our public listing, lufax has strictly complied with all relevant regulations in both countries and fulfilled our disclosure obligations. at the same time, we have explored ways for potential delisting on the hong kong stock exchange and engaged in preliminary communications with relevant regulatory departments.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu
thirdly, the outlook for 2022.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu
having overcome many challenges in 2021, we enter into 2022 facing continued uncertainties. knowing the further risk due to the macroeconomic slowdowns and pockets of covid resurgence, we have made pre-emptive preparations. in the fourth quarter, we placed a greater emphasis on credit asset quality by implementing more stringent risk management criteria. in 2022, we'll focus on deepening our business transformation and returning more value to our shareholders.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu
deepening our business transformation.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu
to ensure the quality of our income and the sustainability of our growth, we plan to deepen our business transformation and strike a balance between scale, expansion and quality improvement in 2022.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu
in our retail credit facilitation business, to mitigate the impact of shifting market dynamics, we plan to strengthen our direct sales channel, recruiting more capable direct salespeople, optimize our team structure and help them achieve greater productivity. in addition to increasing the contribution of direct sales to our overall loan volume, we'll also implement more prudent risk-management measures to keep macroeconomic impacts under tight control.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu
in our wealth management business, we strive to optimize our product mix, improve our user experience, enhance our service quality and efficiency and secure our client assets principal value as well as return on investment.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu
these initiatives may cause some short-term fluctuations in our results, but we are confident we will resume our growth trajectory in the second half of 2022. we're convinced that these business transformation initiatives are necessary to lay a solid foundation for our long-term stability and growth. greg will share more details on our business initiatives and financial guidance later.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu
continue to reward shareholders.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu
despite continued market volatility and uncertainties in 2022, we hold high confidence in our own prospects because of our steady profitability, quality cash flow, ample capital reserves and pre-emptive compliance measures. as such, we will continue to reward our shareholders through share buybacks and dividend payout.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu
in april 2022, we will distribute roughly 30% of our 2021 net profit to shareholders in the form of cash dividend equal to usd 0.34 per ads.
guangheng ji -- chairman
so we go from here. [foreign language]
chen yu
in terms of share buyback, as of december 31, 2021, we had completed about usd 860 million or 86% of the usd 1 billion total share buyback announced in 2021. on top of it, our board of directors has approved another usd 500 million of share buybacks in 2022.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu
finally, i would like to reiterate our core competitive advantages borne out of our exceptional business model. first, our business is fully in sync with china's national policy directive of supporting the real economy as we primarily serve small macro business owners, mostly in wholesale trade, manufacturing and retail industry. second, we operate through guarantee licenses, as well as our nationwide consumer financial license. thirdly, we have an unparalleled insight into regulatory trends through our close dialogues with regulatory authorities.
we have also accomplished a thorough implementation of regulatory requirements by leveraging our domain expertise and financial dna. the combination of these unique factors enables us to achieve business transformation and grow steadily and sustainably in a constantly evolving policy environment. looking ahead, we will continue to uphold our commitment to maintaining full-operational compliance, providing compassionate and inclusive financial services, setting ourselves as a loan model for corporate governance among overseas listed chinese companies and generating growing value for our shareholders and our society.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
chen yu
with that, i'll turn the call over to greg, who will share our business updates in detail.
greg gibb
thank you, chairman ji. in 2021, we successfully and smoothly executed a series of operational adjustments to ensure the long-term sustainability of our growth and profitability. we reduced the average apr of our loan portfolio, increased self-risk bearing and reduced our reliance on [inaudible] channel for sourcing. our full year revenue growth grew by 18.8% year over year, and net profit grew by 36.1% year over year, both exceeding guidance.
in 2021, our retail credit facilitation business achieved a number of important milestones. first, we lowered our average loan portfolio pricing to 22.4% in the fourth quarter of 2021 from 25.7% in the same period of 2020 while maintaining overall unit economics. more details will be elaborated by james. second, our business model is more in line to meet regulatory requirements.
as chairman ji mentioned before, our guarantee company has set up locally approved subsidiaries in all of mainland china, except tibet, ningxia and yunan provinces, allowing us to operate our financial licenses locally. in terms of potential future license requirement, we have a consumer finance license, which enables us to leverage up to 10% or 10 times our capital as opposed to a five times leverage ratio that is currently contemplated for the proposed national micro lending license. so any changes occur that give rise to a national or nationwide micro lending license, we have the required capital reserves, eligibility and preparedness to initiate our application for such one, giving us even more flexibility in serving our core business owner segments. our current guarantee licenses allow us to share credit risk and process data flows with more than 65 national and local funding partners under existing regulatory frameworks.
in addition, we are actively exploring new collaboration to meet expected credit rating license requirements, which come into effect by the mid of 2023. we are prepared to connect to a third-party credit scoring company by the end of june this year. based on our latest understanding, the cost of that connection and the potential changes to our business model will not have any material impact. third, we continue to increase our share of risk bearing in line with regulatory guidelines.
during the fourth quarter of 2021, excluding the consumer finance company, we bore risk on 20.8% of new loans facilitated, up from 10% in the same period of 2020. our guarantee company that bears credit risk operates with a leverage ratio under two times at the end of 2021 against the maximum leverage requirement of 10 times. our healthy leverage ratio, together with strong capital position, gives us comfort to meet any new capital requirements that may come from regulatory changes. last but not least, we saw improvements in the direct sales productivity and operating costs to deliver steady gross and net returns despite sharply reduced reliance on ping an.
during the quarter, new loan sales from the ping an life channel continued to slow down, accounting for 24.6% of new loan sales during the fourth quarter, down from 36.4% in the same period of 2021. to counter this, our direct sales team contributed more by improving productivity. compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, our direct sales generated 21.6% more volume in new loan sales, but head count only increased 8.4% and productivity rose 12.1%. this increased investment in o2o direct sales reaffirms our view that our off-line to online service approach is the most effective way to increase coverage of this otherwise hard to reach small business owner segment.
our wealth management business is also making good progress in a transitioning market. in the fourth quarter, total client assets of $432 billion is overall flat, but grew 13% year over year when excluding p2p and online bank deposit products. meanwhile, we also deepened our product reform to effectively shift our focus toward high-value clients and higher take rate products. as of december 31, 2021, contribution to total client assets from customers with investments of more than cny 300,000 on our platform increased to 81% from 76% of the same period in 2020.
client assets from customers with investments over cny 1 million revenue on the platform grew by 14% year over year. and these customers have a clear preference for higher take rate products. we have differentiated ourselves by demonstrating consistent growth in high-value customers and higher take rate products, laying a solid foundation for future growth. as a result, our take rate in the fourth quarter was 64 basis points, increasing 19.9 basis points compared to the previous quarter.
driven by the optimization in product and investor mix, our wealth management business has improved economics. going forward, we will further focus on higher take rate products and new growth to bolster wealth management revenues. now let's take a look at the future strategies. in the second half of 2021, the transformation of ping an life has led to more notable decline in the business velocity and credit quality of customers sourced through the life channel.
the impact of this decline is seen in the change in our overall c to m3 flow-through rates, which deteriorated from 0.4% in q3 to 0.5% in q4. this deterioration deepened our resolve in q4 to initiate change in our channel mix, further reducing reliance on the life channel and increasing the quality, productivity and then the number of direct sales. in 2022, we will strengthen our direct sales channel by raising our recruiting standards, hiring more cable direct salespeople, providing them with more systematic training, equipping them with new technology and overall helping them achieve greater productivity. increasing contribution of direct sales will help sustain our new loan sales growth and should improve our overall loan portfolio quality as our direct sales force exerts higher control over the assessment of borrower credit worthiness than our referral channels.
as a result of actions taken, we expect the c to m3 flow-through rate to peak in the first quarter and normalize in the second half, creating limited financial impact in the course of 2022. in the next few months, we will closely monitor new loan sales, channel mix, asset quality and productivity of direct sales to track our progress and demonstrate our success in this transition. finally, regarding our guidance. most of the impacts from these channel adjustments will occur in the first half of 2022, resulting in slower profit growth in the first half, but accelerated new business and profit growth in the second half.
our guidance for 2022 is therefore more detailed to reflect the timing of planned adjustments and onetime items. we expect our new loan sales growth to be relatively flat to low single digit in q1 and gradually picking up to 3% to 6% for the first half. and accelerated growth in new loan sales should be witnessed during the second half, and we expect to grow new loan sales at 9% to 12% for the whole year. we expect total income to grow 8% to 10% for q1, 10% to 12% for both the first half and the full year.
projected profit growth for the full year is 11% to 13%, with profit growth of negative 2% to 2% in q1 and the first half. the slower profit growth in the first half reflects a number of year-over-year legacy-related items in the first and second quarter, which suppressed relative profit growth in the first half of 2022. if we remove the impact of these specific items, year-over-year net profit growth is expected to be 6% to 10% in q1 and 6% to 9% in the first half, respectively. lufax's management team has a track record of executing transformations to ensure business sustainability and profitability.
and we believe this time is no different. by taking the short-term pain of making the channel transition in the first half at a time we believe it is prudent to be prudent with overall growth, we will set strong foundations for steady high-quality long-term growth. i will now turn the call over to james zheng, our cfo, to go through the detailed operating and financial performance and our guidance for the year.
james zheng -- chief financial officer
thank you, greg. i will now provide a closer look into our fourth quarter results. please note that all numbers are in rmb terms and all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise stated. we concluded the fourth quarter with a solid financial results, achieving consistent growth in both the top line and the bottomline.
during the quarter, our total income was rmb 15.8 billion, up 19.2% year over year, and our net profit increased by 1.7% to rmb 2.9 billion year over year. without considering the onetime asset impairment cost, our net profit is rmb 3.4 billion, about 19.7% year-over-year growth. for the full year of 2021, our total income was cny 61.8 billion, up 18.8% year over year, and our net profit increased by 36.1% to rmb 16.7 billion year over year, and the growth in both income and the net profit for the full year of 2021 exceeded the high end of our previously announced guidance range. additionally, our net margin for the full year of 2021 improved to 37% from 24% last year.
let's have a closer look at our operating numbers. first, we further reduced our apr while maintaining stable retail credit facilitation business unit economics. our loan balance apr was 22.4% in the fourth quarter of 2021, a 3.3-percentage-point decline from 25.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020. in comparison, our loan balance take rate was 9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, only 0.1 percentage point decline from 9.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020.
our loan balance apr was 23.5% in the full year of 2021, a three-percentage-point decline from 26.5% in 2020, while our 2021 take rate only declined 0.2 percentage points to 9.6%. as we continue to diversify funding sources, engage with more banking partners, reduce credit insurance premiums on our loan portfolios and improve customer charging mechanism, which lead to diminishing impact from the early loan repayments, we will continue to maintain stable unit economics and drive relentless improvement in our sales and operating efficiencies despite apr declines. second, we maintained a stable growth in our overall loan volume and further penetrated into core and targeted customer segments. on the retail credit side, we grew our new loan sales by 14.3% to rmb 151.6 billion during the fourth quarter of 2021, in line with our business focus on risk management under the current macro conditions.
at the same time, we continue focusing on serving small business owners. during the fourth quarter, excluding our consumer finance subsidiary, 79.6% of new loans facilitated were disbursed to small business owners, up from 74.4% in the same period of 2020. on the wealth management side, despite the negative impact of p2p and online deposit products runoff, we managed to grow our total client assets to rmb 432.7 billion as of december 31st, 2021. third, we continue to execute our plans to evolve our risk sharing business while simultaneously maintaining asset quality.
in line with prevailing regulatory requirements, we bore credit risks for 21% of the new loans we facilitated in the fourth quarter of 2021, up from 20% in the third quarter and 10% in the fourth quarter of last year. as of december 31st, 2021, our outstanding balance of loans facilitated with guarantees from third party credit enhancement partners accounted for 78.9% of the total outstanding balance of loans facilitated, down from 89.4% as of december 31st, 2020. all of the aforementioned operating metrics exclude those of our consumer finance subsidiary. due to the slowdown of macroeconomic growth, covid-19 pandemic and life channel changes, we saw some deterioration of overall asset quality.
thanks to our risk management system, the negative impact on our risk indicators are limited. excluding consumer finance subsidiary, our dpd 30 day plus and dpd 90-plus delinquency rates were 2.2% and 1.2% for the total loans we facilitated at december 31st, 2021, compared to 1.9% and 1.1% as of september 30th, 2021. we will remain vigilant and to be prudent on our borrower acquisition and risk management strategy. fourth, we optimized our product mix to improve the take rate of our wealth management segment.
during the quarter, our take rate for the segment increased by 19.9 bps to 64 bps from 44.1 bps in the previous quarter, primarily driven by our continuous product mix optimization as we sharpened our focus on products with a higher take rate. now let's take a closer look at our fourth quarter financial numbers. at the highest level, our total income in fourth quarter grew by rmb 2.5 billion or 19.2% year-over-year growth while total expense increased by rmb 2.4 billion or 26.2% year-over-year growth. and then the net profit grew by 1.7% year over year to reach rmb 2.9 billion.
while operating related costs continue to remain flat due to efficiencies, total expense increase is primarily driven by the credit impairment costs due to higher risk sharing and onetime asset impairment costs. excluding onetime asset impairment costs, which was mainly due to the impairment loss of intangible assets related to shanghai asset exchange and the guarantee company, total net profit was rmb 3.4 billion, reaching 19.7% year-over-year increase. next, let's go through financial numbers line by line. as the total income mix of our retail credit facilitation business continued to improve, thanks to the evolution of our business and a risk-sharing model, total income increased by rmb 2.5 billion or 19.2% year over year.
during the quarter, while the platform service fees decreased by 10.4% to rmb 8.8 billion, our net interest income grew 81.5% to rmb 4.2 billion, and our guaranteed income grew by more than 538% to rmb 1.6 billion. in addition, other income, which is directly linked to delivering services to our financial partners increased to rmb 769 million in the fourth quarter from rmb 452 million in the same period of last year. as a result, our retail credit facilitation platform service fee as a percentage of total income decreased to 51% from 70%. because consolidated trust plans provide lower funding costs, we continue to utilize them in our funding operations, enabling our net interest income as a percentage of total income to increase to 27% from 18% a year ago.
moreover, as we continue to bear more credit risk, we generated more guaranteed income, reaching 10% as a percentage of total income, compared to 2% a year ago. by expanding our service to create enhancement partners in account management, collections and other value-added services. other income as a percent of total income increased to 5% from 3% a year ago. our investment income decreased by 7% to rmb 359 million in the quarter from rmb 386 million in the same period of last year, mainly due to the fair value losses from investment assets.
in terms of wealth management, our total platform transaction service fees increased by 23% to rmb 708 million in the fourth quarter from rmb 576 million in the same period of 2020. this increase was mainly driven by an increase in fees generated from our current products, which was partially offset by the runoff of legacy products. turning to our expenses. in the fourth quarter, our total expenses grew by rmb 2.4 billion or 26.2% to rmb 11.5 billion from rmb 9.1 billion in the same period of 2020, primarily driven by increase of credit impairment costs and onetime asset impairment costs.
total expenses, excluding credit and asset impairment losses, financial costs and other losses increased by 4% to rmb 8.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 from rmb 8 billion in the same period of 2020, remain almost the same as we further improved operating efficiency. our total sales and marketing expenses, which include expenses for borrowers and investor acquisition, as well as general sales and marketing expenses, decreased by 1% to rmb 4.8 billion in the fourth quarter. our general and administrative expenses decreased by 1.5% to rmb 971 million in the fourth quarter from rmb 986 million in the same period of 2020. this decrease was mainly due to our expense control measures.
our operations and servicing expenses increased by 15.2% to rmb 1.9 billion in the fourth quarter from rmb 1.7 billion a year ago. this increase was primarily due to the increase in trust plans management expenses resulting from the increase in the usage of consolidated trust plans and growth in the outstanding balance of loans facilitated. our technology and analytics expense increased by 29.5% to rmb 597 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 from rmb 461 million in the same period of 2020, mainly due to our ongoing investments in technology, research, development and the lower base in fourth quarter of 2020 as a result of social security relief during the covid-19 outbreak. our current impairment losses increased by 157.2% to rmb 2.5 billion in the fourth quarter from rmb 985 million a year ago.
this was mainly due to the increase of provision and indemnity loss, driven by increased risk exposure as the risk sharing at the total balance level has increased from 6.3% to 16.6%. it is worth noting that we grew our guarantee income by 539%, a faster pace than expenses, and continue to achieve positive profitability for our guaranteed business. included in the credit impairment losses, there is also a rmb 260 million increase related to legacy product in wealth management business. our finance costs decreased by 18% to rmb 267 million in the fourth quarter from rmb 326 million a year ago, mainly due to the decrease in the balance of convertible bonds following our c-round convertible notes restructuring and the increase in interest income, resulting from the increase in deposits.
additionally, our effective tax rate was 33.3% during the fourth quarter of 2021 and the increase in interest income, resulting from the increase in deposits. additionally, our effective tax rate was 33.3% during the fourth quarter of 2021 versus 31.9% in the same period of 2020 due to onetime deferred tax asset impact. for the full year of 2021, our effective tax rate was 28.6% versus 31.5% in 2020. as a consequence of the affirmation factors, our net profit increased by 1.7% to rmb 2.9 billion during the fourth quarter from rmb 2.8 billion in the same quarter of 2020.
meanwhile, our basic and diluted earnings per ads during the fourth quarter were 1.26 and 1.21, respectively. our basic and diluted earnings per ads during the year of 2021 were rmb 7.11 and rmb 6.69, respectively, represented a 27.2% and a 20.5% growth year over year. as of december 31, 2021, we had a cash balance of rmb 34.7 billion compared to rmb 24.2 billion as of december 31, 2020. looking ahead, we expect an annual new loan sales growth to be at 9% to 12%, but the growth will notably be much higher in the second half due to the completion of channel optimization initiatives.
similarly, we expect the total income growth of 10% to 12% throughout the year. operating related costs will stay stable across the year with annual increase at about 6% to 8%. credit-related provision growth will even out in the second half given the increased risk sharing already started in the second half of 2021. as a result, we expect our total profit to grow at 11% to 13% for the whole year.
year-over-year growth will be similarly lower in the second half due to onetime legacy pop-related items in 2021. the profit growth rates were picked up in the second half once the channel optimization impact starts to come through and the credit costs are normalized on an annual basis. next, let me give you some specific guidance for q1, first half and full year. for the full year of 2022, we expect new loans to grow by 9% to 12% year over year to the range of rmb 76.8 billion -- rmb 706.8 billion to rmb 726.2 billion and wealth management assets to grow by 2% to 3% year-over-year to the range of rmb 441.3 billion to rmb 445.7 billion.
we expect our total income to grow by 10% to 12% year-over-year to the range of rmb 68 billion to rmb 69.3 billion and net profit to grow by 11% to 13% year over year to the range of rmb 18.6 billion to cny 18.9 billion. for the first quarter of 2022, we expect new loans to grow by minus 2% to 2% year over year to the range of rmb 169 billion to rmb 175.8 billion and wealth management client assets to grow by 2% to 3% year over year to a range of rmb 429.6 billion to rmb 433.8 billion. since retail credit presentation income is recognized over the life of a loan and is more driven by loan balance, we expect the total income to grow by 8% to 10% year over year to the range of rmb 16.5 billion to rmb 16.8 billion. in the first quarter, net profit will grow minus 2% to 2% year over year to the range of rmb 4.9 billion to rmb 5.1 billion.
but if excluding the legacy p2p impact in 2021, net profit is expected to grow by 6% to 10% year over year. for the first half of 2022, we expect new loans to grow by 3% to 6% year over year to the range of rmb 334.8 billion to cny 344.6 billion and wealth management time assets to grow by 3% to 4% year over year to the range of rmb 433.7 billion to rmb 437.9 billion. we expect our total income to grow by 10% to 12% year over year to the range of rmb 33.1 billion to rmb 33.7 billion, and net profit grew by 1% to 3% year over year to a range of rmb 9.8 billion to rmb 10 billion and by 6% to 9%, excluding the legacy p2p impact in 2021. this forecast reflects our current and preliminary views on the market and operational conditions, which are subject to change.
this concludes our prepared remarks for today. operator, we're now ready to take questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] when preparing to ask a question, please ensure your phone isn't muted locally and please mention the question in both english and chinese. thank you. our first question comes from winnie wu from bank of america.
please go ahead.
winnie wu -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to ask a question. so, my question is regarding the covid lockdown. i mean, apparently, management has been very prudent in terms of adjusting the growth target and lifting the lending standard. but just want to ask, you know, is the impact on loan demand temporary? or could this lockdown was leading to more prolonged damage to the demand from the sme sector that the growth outlook for even 2023, 2024 might be impaired? and related to that, the second question is in terms of the impact on asset quality and impairment.
assuming the covid situation can't get under control by, say, end of june, when do you think is the peak in terms of npl formation, npl ratio, and/or impairment? i will do the translation. [foreign language]
greg gibb -- co-chief executive officer
[foreign language] thanks, winnie. this time, covid impact is quite different from 2020. this time, it takes a lot wider and longer. in 2020, it was quite limited to a certain area and therefore, relatively short period of time.
our credit indicators also fully recovered back to pre-pandemic level only in three months' time in 2020. and the overly coming was in better shape back then, like no supply chain issue, no import/export issue, not a big issue in real estate sector, for example. so i think we all believe that even after this pandemic control comes to end, the market environment will not be as good as pre-pandemic period at this time. so with the concern, with the concern on economy downtown, which was shown from many indicators from second half last year we're partly taking pre-emptive actions from fourth quarter last year.
and that, as a whole, cut of more than 20% of our target segments and made the biggest impact on our last channel new sales. it dropped almost 40% from the same period last year as a result. but looking back, we believe we made a life decision. and it is not the lifetime, we think, to pursue rapid growth.
instead, we will be more prudent in new customer quality and our asset quality. there are still quite much uncertainties to how this pandemic control will play out and its final impact. for us, we provide -- that's why we only provide the first half guidance. nonetheless, you know that we have more than 15 years select in consumer credit risk management and we have more than -- as greg said, we have more than 10,000 creditors nationwide who have renewed work experience during lockdown situation with the best-in-market system support.
also, we can have 50,000, 57,000 offline directives engaged in offline collection and support to our collection team. on the demand side, although recently, demand is -- demand on business operation loan is weakening, that's true. but we do not worry about the demand side because, you know, that the market space issues, and they will nearly take about 1% market share. and in the long run, we know that this sector will surely grow in line with the government's support and policy.
and then good news is you asked about when is the peak of our credit loss in consolidation on metro. and then when it will -- when you will recover and then how long it will take. still uncertain, but good news is the peak pandemic is already over. april was -- we saw the highest net flow ratio in terms of sequential, and then it makes a clear process, clear improvement starting from may.
so i believe -- so now we're in the process of recovering already, including shanghai.

thank you. our next question comes from thomas chong from jefferies. please go ahead.
thomas chong -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, everybody. thanks, management, for taking my questions. may i ask a question with regards to our wealth management strategy, as well as how consumer sentiment impacts the business trend? thank you. [foreign language]
greg gibb -- co-chief executive officer
thanks for your question, sorry, correct. ok. on the wealth management side, we really continue to do three things. so one is continue to deepen our focus on the affluent and upper affluent customers and provide them with more content and service around the new product set, which is now that all products in china have moved away from fixed income into nav-based mutual funds, private placement funds that have more volatility than fixed income, providing with more content, more upfront information, more post-investment services, and really combining our relative expertise through online, as well as through the telecom services ready for these higher-end customers to really help them navigate this new environment.
so even though the markets have been in the a market, the asia market, and china has been down 20% to 30% really through may now, we've seen quite good stability in the customer base and quite good stability in the ca overall. so, we will continue to provide those services, continue to refine them, give customers more real-time input on their portfolios, help them drive diversification, help to improve their overall customer mix, so they can generate a steady return in a difficult environment. we do have hope that now that the markets have come off quite a bit in the first half that we may have a chance for some recovery for customers in the second half, which would be very helpful as we continue to change this product mix to this target segment. the other thing that we are doing as well is increasing our focus.
this is something we've been working on for more than a year now on the insurance product set as well. because certainly, as china goes through its overall changes, given our average customer age is about 39 years old on the wealth side, pension-related issues where pension reform is advancing, insurance and pension services are becoming increasingly important. and that's an interesting area because it is a nice margin business to have. so overall, we continue to drive it online.
we continue to drive new customer growth. we continue to focus on the upper end and change the product mix to continue to drive up the overall net margin in the business. if you look, as we stated at the end of march, we're at about 53, 54 basis points income over ca, which is up quite a bit from a year ago. so this is an area that we continue to drive.
and over the longer term, we hope that it will become a larger contribution to both and the holdings as a whole.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from hans fan from clsa. please mention your question in both english and chinese.
hans fan -- clsa -- analyst
sure. thanks. thank you for giving me this opportunity to ask a question. my question is mainly about the direct sales reform progress.
as we know that since end of last year, lufax has launched the progress to reform the direct sales team. just wondering what's the progress now. and how long should we expect this reform to be largely completed? and also just to follow up a question regarding the breakdown of the customer acquisition. can you share the percentage in terms of -- coming from the direct sales team, coming from the insurance team of ping an, and also from telephone sales? [foreign language]
james zheng -- chief financial officer
[foreign language] thanks, hans. let me first share the progress with live channel actions. live channel, the fourth quarter new sales dropped by almost 40% from the same period last year, and now it takes about 20% to our new sales contribution. and direct sales, the fourth quarter new sales increased by about -- roughly about 10% from the same period last year, and the email takes 57%.
so regarding the channel mix, live is contributing 20% and then direct sales almost 60% now, and the rest 20% are from telemarketing, especially for our [inaudible] customers reborrowing. so it's a mix. before i get into the ds turn reform, if i show someone ask about live channel, you know that we took a series of risk mitigation actions from fourth quarter 2020. so 40% sales drop in fourth quarter this year is big but it's not a huge surprise for us if intended.
and now if you look at the live channel new customer quality in fourth quarter 2020, after we took all those actions, we measure new customer quote like dpd 1+ mobf3 while dpd 30+ mobf3. it is now even slightly better than direct access channel. it's very promising. and total number of less agents now you see that it gets stabilized.
it does not decrease further and much. so we believe life term contribution through new sales, which has already reached the button, it cannot be lower than this. and we believe this will rebound slowly going forward. so this is an update about live channel action.
and then i want to say that we have a hope that this will contribute more new sales going forward. and then coming to direct sales reform. this is ongoing reform, it takes time. as of march end, total number of direct sales we have is 57,000.
that includes two leaders and other supporting staff. it was 57,000, exactly the same number a year ago. so a number of direct sales didn't increase at all for a year, yet china sales volume increased by almost 10%. that well indicates our parity improves, continuously improves.
although we tighten, we continuously tighten underwriting policy and reduce target market to achieve the better asset quality, we continue to focus on optimizing the st mix with priority. this year, we said we do not pursue rapid sales growth or balance scores, but taking this operational. we focus more on how we can optimize our safety mix. we try to get more equally tie whose retention rate is two times higher than [inaudible], meaning after when they joined us.
and whose possibly is normally more than 20% higher than failure type. so we focus on how we can get more new type group versus failure type and then change the mix of direct sales. as greg mentioned, the recent high shows that our new type portion, it takes up to more than 40% out of total new hire. it was just one digit last year.
so we are making progress. and also, we are providing a lot more tech enablement through our sales and upgrades to enhance their sales efficiency. and also, we are now trying to gradually removing middle layer, which takes about 10% of total sales headcount. so that naturally will further improve our sales productivity.
so this year, we focus on building stronger direct sales team full reform. and then this will lay foundations, solid foundation for our rapid growth from next year after we get through this difficult time.

key achievements.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
despite covid-19 resurgence and macroeconomic slowdown, we achieved steady growth during the first quarter.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
during the first quarter, our total income grew by 13.5% year over year to rmb 17.3 billion and net profit increased by 6.5% year over year to rmb 5.3 billion. our basic earnings per ads for the quarter reached rmb 2.31. in april, we paid a dividend of usd 0.34 per ads for the first time since we went public. we plan to return value to our shareholders in a variety ways going forward.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
second, key investor concerns.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
we maintained open dialogue with the market and hosted over 60 investor events during the first quarter. based on our data, roughly 60% of investor questions were about macro environment and business operations, 30% were about regulatory trends and the remainder were related to capital market development. in general, investors are concerned about chinese adrs. many think that the panic selling has caused adr's valuation to decouple from their fundamentals.
although recent public statements from chinese regulators have instilled some confidence into the market, most investors are still taking a wait-and-see approach.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
presently, investors' key concern rests on our growth prospects in the current macroeconomic environment.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
in march, china escalated its countermeasures to contain the coronavirus. shanghai, for example, has experienced lockdowns under the nationwide covid-zero policy impacted by pandemic including economic slowdown. the financial services industry as a whole unavoidably suffered the deceleration in growth and deterioration in asset quality. our own business was also impacted.
our own business was also impacted. our analysis indicates that the impact from this year's pandemic is higher than that of 2020. in preparation for the challenge, analysis indicates that the impact from this year's pandemic is higher than that of 2020. in preparation for the challenge, our management has pre-emptively implemented a series of initiatives, including tightening our credit policy, enacting prudent cost control measures, shoring up cash flow management, and many more.
greg will elaborate further on those details later.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
many investors have expressed concerns about the april 29 ratification progress and the adr delisting risk. having completed the vast majority of our ratification-related initiatives, we have also devised detailed action plans for the remaining issues that require planned efforts. at the financial stability and development committee meeting on march 16, the vice premier of the state council, mr. liu hu, made a call to press ahead with the ratification of large platform companies and to finish this task as soon as possible.
on april 29, the political bureau of the covenant's party of china's centric committee also stated in their meeting that efforts should be made to advance the ratification of platform companies and promote the regulated and sound development of the platform economy. judging from this information and insights, we believe that the regulatory ratification process is at the point of entering its final phase.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
regarding the delisting risk, the u.s. securities and exchange commission provisionally identified lufax as a commission identified issuer under the holding foreign company accountable act on may 9, 2022. over 100 chinese adrs have been included on the sec's provisional list. more importantly, we have been delighted by the positive market signals indicating that the prc and u.s.
authorities are moving closer toward an agreement. during the recent 2022 boao forum for asia annual conference, vice chairman of the china securities regulatory commission, mr. fang xinghai stated that negotiations between chinese and american regulators over other issues involving u.s.-listed chinese companies have proceeded smoothly so far and that a cooperation agreement appears to be possible. we are confident that the delisting risk will likely diminish further.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
third, lufax mid- to long-term development.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
despite the short-term challenges caused by covid-19, what i would like to reiterate here are the four key competitive advantages that we possess namely: alignment with policy direction, tremendous market potential, unique business model, and abundant capital reserves. these advantages have given us confidence that we should be able to navigate through the current economic cycle.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
alignment with policy direction.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
because small and micro businesses are part of the core engine powering the chinese economy, they get a thorough and comprehensive policy support and does enjoy enormous growth potential. at the same time, they often encounter three hurdles when trying to get funding. we characterize those hurdles as three accesses, three deficiencies, and three difficulties.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
the three accesses refer to the excessively high cost, high pricing, and high risk that small and micro businesses face when they apply for loans. the three deficiencies are the lack of financial statements, credit scores, and collateral that these businesses typically face. the three difficulties represent the difficulties in unification, standardization, and promotion of financial services to small and micro businesses.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
as a result, it is difficult and costly for small and micro businesses to borrow from traditional banks. as the leading financial services provider for small and micro businesses, we'll continue to align with regulatory directions, remain true to our mission of offering inclusive financing services and deliver solutions to solve small and micro businesses' financing difficulties.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
enormous market opportunities.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
domestic financial services targeting small and micro businesses can be characteristic to provide high growth and low penetration. according to statistics from the people's bank of china, the balance of inclusive loans to small and micro businesses grew at 29% cagr from 2019 to 2021 and constitute roughly 10% of total loans. although the industry is growing rapidly, it still has a long way to go to catch up with its peers in developed countries where 30% of total loans are lent to small and micro businesses. such a gap presents an enticing opportunity for the industry to develop under a variety of supportive policies.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
unique business model.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
over the past 18 years, we have been providing integrated online to offline financing services to satisfy small and micro businesses' needs. our technology combined with our online operational experience have equipped us with an effective mechanism to reach borrowers and manage risks. led by a team of seasoned executives with extensive expertise in technology and finance, rich experience in operational management, and global vision and corporate development, we have broken down barriers and achieved important breakthroughs. we believe that our unique business model will support and continue to serve as a solid foundation for our steady growth and steer us through market fluctuations.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
abundant capital reserves.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
as of march 31st, 2022, we had ample capital reserves of roughly rmb 100 billion in net assets and over rmb 40 billion in cash, that's ensuring our smooth navigation through economic cycles and consistent returns to our shareholders. despite the challenges brought by covid-19 this year, we will maintain our per ads dividend amount at the same or above level than that in 2021.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
in summary, despite this year's challenging macro environment, our advantages in regulatory compliance, market potential, business models, and capital reserve have positioned us well to navigate through the current economic cycle while executing our mission of serving small and micro business owners. going forward, we remain fully in sync with china's national policy directives of supporting the growth and development of small and micro businesses and the real economy at large.
guangheng ji -- chairman
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
with that, i will turn the call over to greg, who will share our business update in detail.
greg gibb -- co-chief executive officer
thank you, chairman ji. in the first quarter, we built on the solid foundations of 2021 to deliver stable operational results in an increasingly challenging environment. cognizant of the negative impact brought by covid's resurgence, we have recently launched critical actions for the more difficult market conditions ahead. before turning to our covid response, let me highlight a few key figures for the first quarter.
please note that all numbers are in rmb terms unless otherwise stated. in the first quarter, we generated 17.3 billion of total income and 5.3 billion of net profit, both figures exceeding our prior guidance. the take rate in our retail credit facilitation business remained steady at 9.7% this quarter versus 10% a year ago. by the end of the first quarter, the wealth management business saw stable client assets of 433 billion, despite volatile markets and the revenue take rate in this business reached 53.9 basis points in march.
operational costs were held steady, while we continue with technology investment to empower our direct sales productivity in the loan facilitation and to optimize online customer management in wealth. in the first quarter, about 40% of our new direct sales hires for lending facilitation net our upgraded target profile for the ongoing channel transformation. first quarter direct sales productivity for lending increased 4.8% versus a year ago. now turning to the resurgence of covid.
we believe the multicity lockdowns that started in march will likely have a deeper impact on the economy and our operations than seen prior in 2020. our 18 years of credit experience has taught us that rapid change in the environment requires decisive pre-emptive steps to both minimize downside risks and to be best positioned for growth when the environment recovers. under the current zero covid policy, we believe that simultaneous rolling lockdowns across multiple cities will likely remain rooted to the landscape through most of the remainder of 2022. we entered this landscape facing a weaker macroeconomy than in 2020.
the two months plus long lockdown of shanghai, its interregional -- interprovincial highways, its supply chains, is creating much larger ripple effects than those seen in wuhan during 2020. through the lens of our data and experience, we can now roughly profile the impact of shanghai's lockdown on our lending facilitation business. we forecast that c-m3 flow rates will triple during the lockdown period, gradually returning to pre-lockdown levels six months after the lockdown ends. however, as zero covid policies and restrictions are constantly evolving, it's difficult to detect their impact on other cities.
furthermore, we think it's only prudent to assume that during the second half of the year, more cities could be placed under the varying degrees of lockdown. from our vantage point, we are unable to estimate the exact number of cities that could be affected. and thus, the overall impact is extremely difficult to assess at this point. while there remain uncertainties ahead, we are nonetheless confident that the array of measures we have implemented nationwide will mitigate the challenges posed by this operating environment.
these measures include targeting higher-quality customers, providing more customized products, and improving our risk management efficiency. first, we are continuing to target higher-quality customers and tightening our credit policy by utilizing a differentiated approach. on the one hand, we are gradually seizing serving high-risk profile customers. for non-small business owners or industries that are likely to be hardest hit by covid, for example, travel-related, we have tightened our credit policies nationwide.
on the other hand, we've adopted a differentiated approach based on risk performance. for geographies and channels with stronger credit performance entering this landscape, we've made smaller adjustments. and for geographies with below c-m3 flow rates, we only target new businesses and loan top-ups for the highest quality customer segments. second, we are providing a greater number of customized products to mitigate any potential sales losses created by our adoption of higher quality standards.
for those customers who represent too high credit risk or to provide unsecured loans, we encourage them to pledge collateral and apply for secured loans. for those small business owners who have higher-quality risk profiles, we provide them with lower aprs, longer tender period products, and more flexible payment schedules to relieve their financial burden and to help them overcome their current difficulties. finally, we are improving our risk management efficiency. our collections team are equipped with our risk management system, remote working platforms, technology tools, and deep experience they gained in 2020 through their work.
by leveraging these tools and abilities, they can work remotely to monitor the status of borrowers, proactively identify potential loans at risk, and take immediate action on loan collection. our proprietary data-driven collection force of 10,000 agents is deployed across 10 cities. this team, together with our more than 57,000 direct sales agents, is fully deployed to help manage and mitigate any and all risks. it's also important to note, as chairman ji just did now, that our strong balance sheet and cash position provide us with resilient ability to overcome challenges.
as of the end of the first quarter, our net assets stood at 98.3 billion, and our leverage ratio for our guarantee company stood at less than two times, positioning us well to handle risk fluctuations. our credit insurance partners are also in a strong capital position to handle associated risks, although they will certainly reprice credit insurance fees as we move through the cycle. the financial strength of the underlying credit enhancement and risk-sharing that we have with our funding partners provides them with little burden in the ongoing loan servicing small business owners. we believe this notable strength will enable stable funding availability through this challenging time and further distinguish lufax versus other platforms who may now charge higher prices, encounter higher risks, and have less capital resources to protect operational resilience.
being a relatively -- being in a relatively strong position with strong partners will enable faster resumption of growth when the macro environment stabilizes. while we are selectively putting on the brakes on new loan growth to be prudent near term, we also remain focused on executing our longer-term strategic priorities. the channel transformation has continued at pace in the first quarter with our direct sales making up 57% of new sales in the first quarter versus 49% a year ago, underpinning the improved productivity. also, within the direct sales team, we recruited more high-quality talent and dismiss below-average performing one.
as a result, high-quality accounts accounted for 40% of new hires in the first quarter, and we believe this proportion will continue to grow. more broadly, we sense the regulatory environment is placing increased focus on funding availability for small business sector, indicating likely greater stability and regulatory requirements this year versus the past year. taking all these points together does lead us to revise guidance for the first half of 2022. we will provide full year guidance when we get more clarity.
our renewed guidance in this very dynamic environment is based on the principle that it is better to be conservative early rather than sorry later. hence, we are revising our new loan sales growth for the first half of 2022 to decrease between 7% and 10%. for our wealth management business forecast, we remain largely unchanged. we will continue to monitor domestic capital performance, which impacts investor ca and overall investor sentiment.
we expect our first half revenue growth to be 8% to 10% year on year. we believe the impact of the lockdown in multiple cities, the volatility we see in foreign exchange rates, and our increase in the credit losses where we bear risk will be higher than previous guidance. thus, our net profit for the first half is likely to decrease between 11% and 13% year on year. if noncash foreign exchange losses were excluded from calculation of net profit, then the company's expectation for the first half profit will be a decrease of 3% to 4%.
as chairman ji just said, we are confident that we will successfully navigate through the current cycle and are committed to maintaining our 2022 per ads dividend amount at or above the level in 2021. last but not least, our cfo james has decided to take an early retirement. james has been with the company for eight years, and we really want to thank him for his great contribution to the company. the company has started a search for a new cfo.
and during the interim period, mr. david choi will assume the finance function of the company. with that, i'll turn the call over to james zheng, our cfo, to go over the financial details. james?
james zheng -- chief financial officer
thank you, greg. i will now provide a closer look into our first quarter results. please note that all numbers are in rmb terms and all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise stated. we achieved solid financial results in the first quarter as we continue to drive growth in both the top line and the bottom line.
during the quarter, our total income was 17.3 billion, up 13.5% year over year, and our net profit increased by 6.5% to 5.3 billion year over year. let's have a closer look at our operating numbers. first, we maintained a stable unit economics for our retail credit facilitation business while further reducing our apr. our loan balance apr was 21.8% in the first quarter of 2022, a 3 percentage point decline from 24.8% in the first quarter of 2021.
in comparison, our loan balance take rate was 9.7% in the first quarter of 2022, only a 0.3 percentage point decline from 10% in the first quarter of 2021. our continued efforts to diversify funding sources, engage with more banking partners, reduce credit insurance premiums on our loan portfolio, and improve customer charging mechanisms to diminish the impact from the early loan repayments, enabled us to maintain stable unit economics to drive further enhancements for our sales and operating efficiency despite apr declines. second, we continue to penetrate our core and targeted customer segments. on the retail credit side, we continue focusing on serving small business owners.
during the first quarter, excluding our consumer finance subsidiary, 83.5% of new loans facilitated were dispersed to small business owners, up from 75.7% in the same period of 2021. on the wealth management side, despite the negative impact of p2p and online deposit products runoff, we managed to grow our total client assets by 2.7% to 432.6 billion as of march 31, 2022. client asset contribution from the mass affluent customers investing more than 300,000 increased to 81.3% as of march 31, 2022, up from 76.3% as of march 31, 2021. third, we continue to drive for the evolutions of our risk-sharing business while maintaining vision on asset quality changes.
in line with prevailing regulatory requirements, we bore credit risks for 20.4% of the new loans we facilitated in the first quarter of 2022, up from 12.5% in the first quarter last year. all the affirmation operating metrics exclude those of our consumer finance subsidiary. due to the slowdown of macroeconomic growth and the covid-19 pandemic, we saw some deteriorations of overall asset quality. however, thanks to our risk management system, the negative impact on our risk indicators are limited.
excluding consumer finance subsidiary, our dpd 30+ and the dpd 90+ delinquency rates were 2.6% and 1.4% for the total loans we facilitated as of march 31, 2022, compared to 2.2% and 1.2% as of december 31, 2021. we will remain vigilant and to be prudent on our borrower acquisition and risk management strategy. now let's take a closer look at our first quarter financial numbers. at the highest level, our total income in the first quarter grew by 2.1 billion or 13.5% year-over-year growth, while total expense increased by 1.6 billion or 19.1% year-over-year growth, and net income grew by 6.5% year over year to reach 5.3 billion.
if no cash foreign exchange losses were excluded from the calculations of the net profit, then the year-over-year net profit change would be 2.1% while operating related costs continue to remain flat due to efficiencies, total expense increase is primarily driven by credit impairment costs due to higher risk-taking and increased risk and impairment provision rate related to loans. next, let's go to the financial numbers line by line. as the total income mix of our retail credit system and patient premium continue to change, thanks to the evolution of our business and risk-scaling model, total income increased by 2.1 billion or 13.5% year over year. during the quarter, while platform service fees decreased by 9.7% to 9.3 billion, our net interest income grew 71.2% to 5 billion, and our guaranteed income grew by 245% to 1.9 billion.
other income decreased to 704 million in the first quarter from 1 billion in the same period of last year. as a result, our retail credit presentation platform service fees as a percentage of total income decreased to 50.2% from 63.4%. because consolidated trust plans provide lower funding costs, we continued to utilize them in our funding operations enabling our net interest income as a percentage of total income to increase to 28.8% from 19.1% a year ago. moreover, as we continue to get more credit risk, we generated more guaranteed income, reaching 11% of total income compared to 3.6% a year ago.
our investment income decreased by 11.2% to 435 million in the first quarter from 490 million in the same period of last year, mainly due to the decrease of investment assets partially as a result of share buyback. in terms of wealth management, our platform transactions and service fees decreased by 5.3% to 592 million in the first quarter from 625 million in the same period of 2021. this decrease was mainly driven by the runoff of legacy products, which was partially offset by the increase in fees generated from our current products and services. turning to our expenses.
in the first quarter, our total expenses grew by 1.6 billion or 19.1% to 10.2 billion from 8.5 billion in the same period of 2021, primarily driven by the increase of credit impairment costs. total expenses, excluding credit and asset impairment losses, finance costs, and other losses, increased by 2.7% to 7.2 billion in the first quarter of 2022 from 7.1 billion in the same period of 2021, remain almost the same as we further improved operating efficiency. our total sales and marketing expenses, which include expenses for borrowers and investor acquisition, as well as general sales and marketing expenses increased by 5.9% to 4.5 billion in the first quarter. our general and administrative expenses decreased by 15% to 726 million in the first quarter from 854 million in the same period of 2021.
this decrease was mainly due to our expense control measures. our operation and servicing expenses increased by 4.5% to 1.6 billion in the first quarter from 1.5 billion a year ago, primarily due to the increase of trust plan management expenses, which resulted from the increase in consolidated trust plan. our technology and analytics expense increased by 0.2% to 448 million in the first quarter of 2022 from 447 million in the same period of 2021 mainly due to the company's ongoing investments in technology, research, and development. our credit impairment losses increased by 168.2% to 2.8 billion in the first quarter from 1.1 billion a year ago.
this was mainly driven by two factors: one, increase of provision and indemnity loss driven by increased risk exposure. as a reference, including the consumer finance subsidiary, the company bore risk of 19.4% of this outstanding balance from 8.7% as of march 31st, 2021; two, change in credit performance due to the impact of covid-19 outbreak. our finance costs decreased by 25.7% to 211 million in the first quarter from 284 million a year ago, mainly due to the increase in interest income resulting from the increase in deposits. additionally, our effective tax rate was 26% during the first quarter of 2022, remain the same as the same period of 2021.
other gains were 118 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to other losses of 138 million in the same period of 2021, mainly due to the foreign exchange gain in the first quarter of 2022. we have noticed that the volatility of foreign exchange rate between renminbi and the u.s. dollar has increased and special volatility could have both positive and negative impact on our quarterly net profit in the future. as a process of asset management factors, our net income increased by 6.5% to 5.3 billion during the first quarter from 5 billion in the same quarter of 2021.
meanwhile, our basic and diluted earnings per ads during the first quarter were rmb 2.31 and rmb 2.14, respectively. as of march 31st, 2022, we had a cash balance of 40.6 billion in cash at bank as compared to 34.7 billion as of december 31st, 2021. in addition, liquid assets maturing in 90 days or less amount to 52.1 billion as of march 31st, 2022. during the first quarter of 2022, the overall economics in china was impacted by the regional lockdown.
and with current zero covid policy, we believe that rolling lockdowns simultaneously across multiple cities will likely remain rooted in the landscape throughout most of 2022, thus exerting severe daily influences toward the entire economy and the credit business. as the overall impact is extremely difficult to assess, we would like to provide our revised first half guidance to account for the near-term macro headwinds, and we will provide full year guidance when we get more clarity. for the first half of 2022, as we become more prudent in underwriting, we expect new loans facilitated to decrease between 7% to 10% year over year to the range of 294 billion to 301 billion; client assets to grow by 1% to 3% year over year to the range of 425 billion to 434 billion; total income to grow by 8% to 10% year over year to the range of 32.5 billion to 33.1 billion; credit-related provision will increase given the deterioration of asset quality, driven by the covid impact and higher risk exposure; other losses will increase due to foreign exchange volatility; operation-related costs will decrease as we continue to improve our efficiency. as a result, we expect the net profit to decrease between 11% to 13% year over year to the range of 8.5 billion to 8.6 billion.
if noncash foreign exchange losses were excluded from the calculation of the profit, then the company's expectation would be for a decrease in net profit for the first half of 2022 of between 3% to 4%. the profit growth rate will pick up once the channel optimization impact starts to come through and the credit costs are normalized on an annual basis. this forecast reflects our current and preliminary views on the market and operational conditions, which are subject to change. that concludes our prepared remarks for today.
operator, we are now ready to take questions.
