at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to mr. patrique richards, executive director of investor relations and business development. please go ahead, sir.
patrique richards -- executive director, investor relations and business development
thank you and good morning. we appreciate you joining us to review our fourth quarter and full year results. today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast and can be accessed directly from our website at ir.usana.com. shortly following the call, a replay will be available on our website.

i'm joined this morning by our ceo and chairman of the board, kevin guest; our president, jim brown; our chief financial officer, doug hekking; as well as other executives. yesterday after the market closed, we announced our fourth quarter results and posted our management commentary results and outlook document on the company's website.
we'll now hear brief remarks from kevin before opening the call for questions.
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
thank you pat and good morning everyone. we appreciate you joining us to review our fourth quarter and full year results as well as our initial outlook for 2021. overall, we are very pleased with how we performed against the many new and unique challenges of 2020. our strong performance in the base of an unprecedented pandemic reflects the continued demand for our high-quality nutritional products and successful execution of our strategic initiatives. in 2020, we found that we were well positioned, well prepared and nimble enough to adapt to and succeed in this unprecedented operating environment. because of this, we ended the year with more customers, higher net sales and record earnings per share. as you can see from our initial outlook, we are expecting 2021 to be another record year for usana.
2020 was truly a transformative year for our business as we accelerated many aspects of our customer experience strategy. we've been actively investing in the usana customer experience for several years now with an emphasis on our digital strategy. in 2020 we capitalized on the groundwork we had already laid and accelerated many other projects to successfully operate during the pandemic. we improved our websites, digital shopping experience, associate training, customer communications and our overall technology infrastructure. additionally, we introduced several new digital tools that will allow our sales force to continue sharing and selling usana products in a predominantly virtual environment. these enhancements to our business as well as many other technical and operational improvements have meaningfully improved the experience that our sales force and customers experience when doing business with usana.
although we recognize that the pandemic is not over, our outlook for fiscal '21 reflects an expectation that we will see progress through 2021 toward a more normalized operating environment. while we have learned a great deal hosting several virtual events this past year, we look forward to the future opportunities of engaging again with our sales force and customers in an in-person setting when it makes sense to do so. our business is built around fantastic nutritional products, relationships and personal interactions. we plan to leverage the benefits of both virtual and in-person events moving forward.
during the first half of the year we expect to hold virtual only events for our sales force and maintain our work from home plan for employees. during the year, we will continue to execute our digital strategy, drive growth in existing markets with our emphasis on china, launch our new active nutrition product line and other products and actively seek out business development opportunities. as we execute this strategy, we are projecting another amazing year for the company.
in closing, i am very confident in our strategic direction, the competency and agility of our team and the strength of usana's underlying business. with that i will now ask the operator to please open the lines for questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and we'll take our first question from david bain with roth capital.
david bain -- roth capital -- analyst
great, thank you. first, congratulations on a fantastic 4q execution. i guess my first question would be, if you could potentially capsulate the potential route to new market that you suggested in your press release that you're laying the ground work for, i mean, obviously that can take many forms, such as china did or be strictly organic. is there any way we can think about the potential immediate impact to a new market in relation to your strategy?
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
our strategy for last several years is -- has been that we wanted to focus our resources on our existing markets and focus on growth where we were currently doing business. we feel like we've got a number hand in that area and feel very confident that it's time for us to move into exploring other opportunities around the globe. if you look at some of our peer group, they are in -- some are in 50 or 60 markets around the globe and we do see that as a potential growth opportunity, but it's not the primary strategic growth strategy for the company. we do see international expansion as an important piece, but again like you mentioned, it takes quite a while for it to have an impact. jim, do you want to add?
jim brown -- president
yes, i mean, when we look at the markets that we selected to go forward and of course at this point in time is where -- when we look at is about 18 to 24 months out, we wanted to announce that to the field, but we do have a plan and a strategy as we go. there's just a lot of work that has to be done from setting up a market and that's everything from logistics to where and how we are going to produce our products to hiring the right staff, all of that goes down the path and that's why we're looking at that 18 to 24 months run rate before we actually launch the markets. so you're looking at an impact probably the end of '22 when we look at starting up the market. so you see a financial impact into '23. so it ways out, but again we feel, and we always have gone down that path every couple of years ago opening a market that we need to have the right runway to make sure it's a smooth opening.
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
and david i would add on, i think a little bit of your question the method and the manner we enter china that's definitely something that we consider in evaluating whether a partner makes sense as we kind of look at the opportunities. and to jim's point, a lot of the laid work has been done historically and we have these markets kind of said on the shelf and kind of timing for when it makes sense, like the method and the manner, i think we have an idea, but we're still in the process of kind of getting to that point.
david bain -- roth capital -- analyst
okay, fantastic. and i guess my follow-up would be, if maybe you could give us a sense as to what benefit either from a cost structure standpoint or revenue generation through technology or otherwise. just from best practices or really what you've learned that could become permanent out of covid?
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
one of the things that we definitely have learned is that it is very -- we are very capable on an international level, a very high sophistication level when you're operating in several different languages across the world that we can do it virtually. and for me, i don't have to get on a plane and fly to china and we can still have a very positive impact. one area where i think i'm really surprised is as we launch new products and the new initiatives that we've been able to do a completely from a virtual perspective and seeing huge success and so our -- one of our big takeaways is that we're going to proceed in the future utilizing a hybrid approach where we're going to leverage technology in a more meaningful way and encapsulate some of the in-person opportunities, but just sheerly from a management perspective, i become very much more accessible to our global community and customer base by leveraging technology. and so that's a huge learn for us, because a significant piece of our sg&a -- our spend is done on live events and travel and it has changed our basic business model somewhat, because we have been so used to being on planes traveling all over the world to get in front of our people. and so that's been a big learn and it will dramatically change how we do business here. i don't if you guys want to...
jim brown -- president
yes, i mean, the other thing, perhaps from the management team and how we're doing our business when we look at the sales field, we talked about digital transformation, our digital footprint, we're seeing a huge adoption when it comes to running your business digitally, so as well as the company figuring out how to do it our field across all of our markets has figured out that way to run their business across wechat whatever form it is and to continue to have a path of growth and we were quite incredibly surprised in 2020 and i think that's one of the biggest reason that we had such a great years that adoption to the digital platforms.
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yes. and david, this is doug. a little bit more perspective there again. in some of our markets and in some pockets within existing markets, we've seen a hesitation or resistance to adopting some of the technology we've rolled out and this environment has almost forced them to use it and i think we've heard a pretty good response from that and so that's been kind of a pleasant surprise for us to go back and get more and more folks using the tools.
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes, for us i'd like, thinking about it that although covid had a negative effect in many people's lives, it's really been an accelerator for usana and helping us accelerate the strategies that we already have in place versus a disruptor. and i'm very grateful that we were able to accelerate things that were already in place when we had immediately pivot to the new operating environment. and so i'd see it in a lot of ways from our strategy side an accelerator versus a disruptor.
david bain -- roth capital -- analyst
awesome. and i'm sorry, since it's my first call as an analyst on your stock. if i could ask just one thing as a follow-up to that deepening digital revenue generation, the whole thing that you've spoken to, are you seeing an overall younger demographic in the network?
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
i think, well, i -- this is an anecdotal kind of a response to your question and doug has the numbers better than i do. but based upon what i'm seeing just from a participation -- even from a digital perspective, i do see a younger population, even on my social media accounts and see those who are actively engaging with me as the ceo of the company, i do see a younger group and a younger population continually coming into the business which i see is very positive. and so again this is just my observation at a very high level. but i would say -- i would say yes, we do see a younger demographic coming into the business.
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yes, i would say as well from a relevancy aspect, we're set up now to actually meet the demands of that younger crowd, where before when it was mostly done in person, it really didn't have that effect. right now, we're doing everything digitally. that's the platform that the younger crowd wants to work on and we're continuing to make that. so like kevin said, we're seeing it. i think in the future we will see more of bringing that demographic into the business.
jim brown -- president
and maybe a few other commentary, i think there are higher growth markets, we had a younger demographic and that's been really clear. i think in some of our other markets, what we've seen, as we've seen -- to kevin's point and ago, we've seen some more of these younger group come in, but we've also seen more of our legacy customers start using the technology more. so i think all those things are positive.
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes. i would agree with that.
david bain -- roth capital -- analyst
fantastic. congratulations again. thank you.
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
thanks.
operator
and next we'll move to sebastian barbero with jefferies.
sebastian barbero -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. a few questions from me please. wondering first, if you could talk about some of the trends you're seeing overall in the consumer health market, including changes in customer behavior over the past 12 months and how does this compare across your different markets? and also if you can talk about retention rates for your associates and preferred customers and how these have trended versus pre-covid levels?
jim brown -- president
as far as kind of the recent trends, sebastian, i think what we've seen and we talked about early in 2020, we saw a spike initially as kind of the rest of world started dealing with the covid pandemic and we saw a spike in some of our immunity product were designed to go back and support immune functions and we have definitely seen a spike kind of drift down, but it is still clipping at a higher run rate of growth in the rest of our products. and so, without a doubt, we've seen that. across all our markets, we're seeing a more keen awareness of health and wellness and it allowed us to go back and have more robust conversations and have dialog with these customers and consumers that we have out there.
as it pertains to your second question, we produce that active customer count number for very specific reason. when someone comes in and buys and they don't buy, again typically we don't get something that they were going to do and this other stuff. so that active customer count captured and purchased in the most recent 90-day period. and so we think that's kind of the best transparent metric we use internally as well.
sebastian barbero -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. and you guided that china to grow between 6% to 12% in 2021, that's on an organic basis is likely between flat to up 6%. i'm wondering could you talk about any changes in the market in recent months, including meeting protocols in the competitive landscape? what gives you an inflection, what gives you the confidence when inflection is in tact with the next 12 months. and also any color you can give us on early '21 trends and what does your guide imply in terms of growth cadence for the year?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
and sorry sebastian, it's coming across a little bit muted on the -- on your voice. so was this specific to china, that you asked the question?
sebastian barbero -- jefferies -- analyst
yes, yes. so just trying to understand any changes in the market in recent months, particularly as it leads to meeting protocols and also if you can give us some color in early 2021 trends and what does your guide imply in terms of growth cadence for the year?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
and i'm sure as you've read, many of the same information that we're getting, china is kind of a nuanced marketplace where you have different restrictions, different guidance really provincially and even at the municipality level. and so i think the questions we're getting leading up to the year is how china has a better control and they weren't having any issues and you've obviously seen recently in the news that these pockets of kind of outbreaks happen and china was really fairly quick to respond. we always stayed attached to kind of the direction that we're getting from our government relations folks and the conversation they are having with the government there. and so we're kind of telling that while we do see, it really is kind of a nuanced staying and it's not real specific to china as a whole. but that factors in kind of the best estimates we have.
the other thing in the market, i think as a whole, what we're getting from our folks with boots on the ground as we're seeing overall growth in the market not related to usana in that mid-single digits to mid single-digits plus. we expect to outpace that a little bit, but that's kind of how we see it right now. the competitive landscape is really not to alter from what we've seen historically. they are always new entrants and stuff. right now i think we just haven't seen kind of same noise in that area and it really is from established players, really kind of getting a foothold in executing our strategies.
sebastian barbero -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. and in terms of active nutrition, this new line launched in q2, you mentioned will have a focus on weight management and digestive health. will this be some sort of shake or will it be full comprehensive weight loss program backed by some digital tech embedded in it?
jim brown -- president
yes, the active nutrition is more of a full program. right now, what i would consider are likely to be as a foods line with our new trivia on the products there. we're looking at shakes, bringing back bar as we've mentioned in past calls, which you saw in north facility which literally the stone throw away from where we're seeing our corporate headquarters, and we're going to be making our own powdered beverages and bars in that facility. we've actually started already because we're looking at launching active nutrition, and we talked about that, really the impact for a handful of markets will be in the second quarter and then we are going to have additional phases of launch throughout 2021. so we'll see the full impact of active nutrition really into 2022, but we'll see those trends happening in the third and fourth quarter of this year. but it's much more than just a foods launches programs, there's influencers, there is all kinds of different ways to get more of a community around this area instead of just more foods. and so this is a little bit of normal approach how we've approached different product introductions in the past.
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
and for us, there is a real focus on lifestyle and versus a product or two that are being launched out there. if we can truly effect someone's lifestyle in a positive way to improve their health, we're really wanting to take a more holistic approach to the lifestyle as we move forward and so we're excited as a health company to be able to round out our offering in those categories.
sebastian barbero -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. okay. and last one from me, switching to capital allocation priorities. there was some nice buybacks in q4, results are building cash for strategic partnerships and if that's the case, can you walk us a little bit -- can you give some more details run your m&a criteria. you're looking to companies solely in the direct selling industry or are you also considering brands outside like you did with built brands, what product categories do you believe are opportunity that could nicely compliment your portfolio and then in terms of what sort of capacity do you have and are you willing to take on leverage to execute?
jim brown -- president
yes, i mean regarding the opportunities sebastian, the focal point has really been our kind of organic business. we also are actively looking for things that don't necessarily bid directly into direct selling business that we can go back and acquire core competency, that we can leverage in our other channels as well. the built brands is a great example, go back and accelerate our understanding our know-how to go back next year on what we have. so those are good examples, i think geographic expansion, we'd look at vertical integration, technology anything to go back and kind of playing the helping wellness space and i think it may look -- i think it was not directly correlated to direct sales channel at this point, but we believe those opportunities there is leverage going forward.
and then regarding leverage and stuff, yes, we see opportunities and stuff without a doubt. i -- we're not afraid to go back, a couple of times ebitda on the books of debt. we're just looking for that opportunity, and we believe the deal flow that we're evaluating on a regular basis, now as far beyond what we've done historically. and we're looking for those opportunities and really evaluating those on a pretty dynamic basis.
sebastian barbero -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
next we'll move to doug lane with lane research.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
yes, hi, good morning everybody.
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
hey, doug.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
i just want to focus if we could -- hey, i just want to focus if we could on customer counts, to a lesser extent, even the active associate accounts where it's really been a tale of two stories this year, where outside of china the growth has been remarkable but inside china it just doesn't seem to be getting any better. so let's -- if we could start with the good, the 30% increase in active preferred customers year-over-year outside of china, i mean how sustainable is that and what kind of number should we be thinking about for 2021 as far as that's concerned?
jim brown -- president
yeah, i would say over the last couple of years, the strategy that kevin has encouraged the group to go back and adopt is really focusing on the consumer and you see in all our markets across the globe that focus first and foremost on the customer. at the end of the day we grow the company by having more individuals and families consumer products. and i think if we do that incredibly well, we've been executing on it. i think that makes it easier and easier for associates going forward as well from a business opportunity perspective. so that focus haven't changed and we'll keep leaning into that going forward. china has had a couple unique challenges back to back in a couple of years. and so that's, i think we're coming out of that. i think the china team out there really worked hard to go back and build a base, so we can really leverage going forward and the feedback we get is very encouraged and excited about the opportunities we have going forward. and really see some momentum moving forward in the business.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
yes. on china, i think the one concern that i would have, again it was a great quarter. but the one sort of numbers that stuck out on the consent side was that the preferred customer number decelerated so much sequentially from 193,000 to 164,000. so what happened in the quarter to impact the customer number in china?
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes, it had to do with that trial program that we ran beginning -- end of q2 and q3 and it really encouraged our associates to go back and share the opportunity and we created a very linear compensation for a short period of time. and so it really hurts them to go back and reach out in the track and as that trial program ended, you saw from those numbers drift down and even with the decay and some of those lift in the customer numbers in q3, overall, i think our q4 numbers were catalyzed by the momentum created from that program as a company as a whole. we also benefit modestly from currency, but that was the primary catalyst in the change in accounts there.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
are you seeing any lift in china. i mean, especially in the active associates we saw a less -- to a lesser extent a deceleration there as well, but the associate account in china continues to sort of drift lower here. so i'm wondering is -- are you looking for an improvement in 2021 just sort of stabilization in china. i've been following china because it's almost half of your business?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yes, i think we're looking for progress there. i think you go back and see that reflected in kind of the outlook numbers that we have. we're not going to go back and grow unless the customers are moving to the right direction. i think the confidence is there and kind of the momentum is there and the plans are there and the strategy. this is an investment year for china and they are taking full advantage of that and we see progress in executing those investments.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
okay, thanks doug.
operator
next we'll move to ivan feinseth with tigress financial partners.
ivan feinseth -- tigress financial partners -- analyst
thanks for taking my call and congratulations on another great quarter.
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
thanks.
ivan feinseth -- tigress financial partners -- analyst
what were the strongest product categories and the strongest products in the most recent quarter and what kind of product trends are you seeing with product demand trends in interest from customers and associates are you seeing?
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes. like doug mentioned a little bit earlier, the immune health continues to be the product line that's outpacing anything else. and then, and when we look at it, we did a lot of programs throughout 2021 from a promotional activity as well from incentives as well as product launches, i mean, we launch more products in 2020 than we ever have. and that was part of our overall strategy to create some growth in the markets and lessen the distractions that covid-19 and -- but again that immune health is continuing to be the line that's moving forward. i would say in 2021, hopefully when we are talking about it, that active nutrition would be the catalyst throughout the year when it comes to new product launches. but i don't see the demand for immune health to really go down in 2021.
ivan feinseth -- tigress financial partners -- analyst
and how are you like helping your associates like to educate in market immune health and that it should continue long after hopefully the pandemic is in the rear view mirror?
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
i think that's part of what usana is. i mean part of what we do is training to make sure that our associates can tell the story of our products and why the high quality is needed throughout the world and we continue to do that in the markets and we talked a little bit about the challenges this year that we've overcome and that's doing that training really from a online digital zoom, wechat whatever that is platform to get it done, but we continue to do that and when we launched active nutrition in march, in the end of march, really what's going to happen in the first couple of months is dedicated to an understanding and training of our associates and we'll really roll that product line out a little bit later in the second quarter, but it's incredibly important for us as a company to rmr associates and sales field to be able to tell that story of our products and why we're better than the competition.
jim brown -- president
yeah, i would say the other things, we -- years ago, we acquired a production company that makes incredible content and really the dynamic way to go back and share the message in education. one of the things that our china market has planned this year is to go back and replicate a lot of that capability within market. it will go back and build brand awareness, content velocity many really positive things there and they're working on and so more and more we continue to go back and kind of leverage that know-how and expertise and find ways to share that information in a digital way.
ivan feinseth -- tigress financial partners -- analyst
and how do you envision what kind of events you are going to have for the active nutrition launch?
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes, i mean right now those have been and we're really launching a handful of markets to start with us, canada, mexico, australia, new zealand will be following shortly. i mean, those would be virtual events that we train our associates using web zoom mostly for those markets. and it's going to be training on the products themselves but also the program that go along with it. we are also doing user trials at the moment. so that information will come out during that and it's all been positive thus far. we're really excited about active nutrition and for us with another area that we talked about from an exciting standpoint is bringing that technology and producing those products ourselves at the company. it's been something over the last -- well, i've been at usana 15 years, it's been my biggest headache is dealing with a lot of third-party manufacturers who are no longer not dealing with at this point in time, but bringing that in-house is really going to have an impact to our ability to launch new products, new flavors and try things with a faster pace than we've ever had in the past.
jim brown -- president
yes. it's something that we're ivan that we're doing with active nutrition that we haven't done before, with relationship to your question is, we have an ambassador program which is, we've taken some of our business builder associates out there who are helping advocates and we're actually currently having them involved with the product, working with our science team, our r&d team, giving that expertise that they from a product knowledge perspective as well as helping us put a program together that assist us directly put boots on the ground. it's almost like a working focus group that is helping us build to the launch. and so we already have embedded, so to speak, a group of advocates who have great experiences with the product as ambassadors throughout these markets, which will give us a huge boost as we launch the product.
ivan feinseth -- tigress financial partners -- analyst
what do you feel the size of the active market -- active nutrition market is relative to your current market? i mean there are a lot of companies that purely do sports related performance related stuff, but it's pretty big and what do you think is going to be your unique attributes and your competitive advantage when you go into this?
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes. so just for clarity ivan. i think that whole kind of fitness and exercised up will be a little bit down the road. here is what we're going to be focusing on kind of weight management healthy snacks. we think the market is a really large market and it's something we can go back and really leverage our existing customer base to go back and tell the story through some of the technology we've talked about. so we think it's a big opportunity. i think just managing expectations here a little bit, first and foremost, jim and walter noot, our chief operating officer are really been working hard to go back and get that production operation up and going in a very thoughtful meaningful way. and then after that, we're going to launch in select markets in q2 and systematically roll that out and start broadening out the product base, and it really is a more holistic offering like so many things we see out there are very just product focus and we plan to definitely have some ideas [phonetic] broader than that which grow in things for nutrition and exercise and those types of things going forward as well.
ivan feinseth -- tigress financial partners -- analyst
and then on, i guess this is the first call since you announced your investment in built brands. can you go into a little detail about what attracted you to, what opportunities you see, how are you going to work with them. what's going to be the benefit that you saw and as consumers of your product what can they expect from this?
jim brown -- president
yes, with built brands, deal itself was an investment in the company, minority investment. but what we really were interested in was some of the aspects that we gained from that company. they're right down the road from us maybe 30 minutes running literally millions of bars by year and the things that we wanted to do was get expertise into our facility a little quicker. we're going to be world-class in making foods and powdered beverages, but we're just not that right this second, it's going to take a little bit of time to get there. so there is the sharing of knowledge from an operational standpoint. that was a benefit. the other thing is that we are using their formulation and r&d team to help us create usana bar with some of the learnings that they have and some of the technology that they have and that will probably turn into many bars in the future. and again that's going to speed up the process for us as usana to launch a product, because we'll be able to use their expertise and really it wasn't as much about investment, which we have our high hopes that we'll get a great return from that investment. but it was about their operational excellence and the ability to get it on new bar from an r&d standpoint quicker than our normal process.
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
and just, ivan, from my perspective, as the ceo, i had the great opportunity to go down to build bars, sit with their ceo for a couple of hours and we were able to strategically brainstorm, how could we have some synergies together. they are in a completely different market that we're in. they have a completely different approach to how they deliver and manufacture and sell products. and so for me the synergies that come from somebody who is actually serving somewhat the help versus an active nutrition market already in a different way is very important from a learning perspective on top of investment opportunity, which i think is a very great use of our capital, and also getting the new core competency, but also the synergies that come from us being a partner with someone who has somewhat of a similar business, but yet does it in a completely different way.
ivan feinseth -- tigress financial partners -- analyst
it's exciting, and i'm looking forward to the active nutrition launch and more about the usana bar with built. i mean, they tend to lean keto, paleo which i think is a big market more than fad [phonetic]. but i think it is an important nutrition focus. so what are your thoughts on that?
jim brown -- president
yes, we'll be looking for bar piece [phonetic] to go back and obviously have -- obviously some protein, but also some nutritional bit as well with different focal areas. so that's something that we're -- we've been developing and looking down the path. i would say that we have anything specific in line with the [indecipherable]. we definitely have something that are catered toward health benefits.
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
and just to that point also, we're always looking for different delivery ways -- different ways to deliver nutrition and with some of these bars we've had prototypes where we've had them fortified with various vitamins and minerals within a very tasty chocolate bar and it's a great different delivery system that we are exploring also as we look at these avenues. so to your point, whether it's keto or what it might -- whatever it might be, it really opens up a host of opportunities for us from a sheer delivery perspective.
jim brown -- president
and the other area too when it comes to bars like kevin is talking about, we historically had three or four large offering. now with the new foods plant and having that supply chain managed by ourselves, we could have a lot more entries into the bar area as well as the powdered beverage area, because we're not held under the same contractual obligations that we are with third parties in really large run and everything else that makes it more complicated to have a lot of variations. so that's something that we're going to be able to support that in nutrition line with.
ivan feinseth -- tigress financial partners -- analyst
i appreciate the insight and the update and congratulations again on the results and wishing you a much more -- ongoing success in 2021.

operator
good day and welcome to the usana health sciences first quarter conference call. today's conference is being recorded.
at this time, i'd like to turn the conference over to mr. patrique richards, executive director of investor relations and business development. mr. richards, please go ahead.
patrique richards -- executive director, investor relations and business development
thank you. good morning. we appreciate you joining us this morning to review our first quarter results. today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast and can be accessed directly from our website at ir.usana.com. shortly following the call, a replay will be available on our website.
as a reminder, during the course of this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of our company. those statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially from the results projected in such forward-looking statements. examples of these statements include those regarding our strategies and outlook for fiscal year 2021, as well as uncertainty related to the magnitude, scope and duration of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic to our business operations and financial results. we caution you that these statements should be considered in conjunction with disclosures, including specific risk factors and financial data contained in our most recent filings with the sec.
i'm joined this morning by our ceo and chairman of the board, kevin guest; our president, jim brown; our chief financial officer, doug hekking, as well as other executives.
yesterday after the market closed, we announced our first quarter results and posted our management commentary results and outlook document on the company's website. we'll now hear brief remarks from kevin before opening the call for questions.
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
thank you, pat, and good morning everyone. we appreciate you joining us to review our first quarter results. this was another excellent quarter and a great start to an exciting year for usana. we generated double-digit sales growth in each of our regions and total customers increased both year-over-year and sequentially. this is better than expected performance and was driven by the successful execution of our first quarter initiatives and continued strong demand for our high-quality nutritional products. accordingly, we've raised our full year net sales and diluted eps outlook.
in addition to our financial performance, we accomplished several other key initiatives. in late march, we launched our new much appreciated and anticipated active nutrition product line and the initial reactions from our customers has been very encouraging. this product line promotes a holistic approach to healthy weight management, as well as digestive health, energy and hydration. while the initial launch of the line was limited to the united states, canada, mexico, australia and new zealand, we plan to roll the line out to additional markets as the year progresses.
additionally, we continue to execute our digital experience strategy, which entails further enhancing the overall shopping experience for our customers with a particular emphasis on the china market. these enhancements allow consumers to easily interact with usana, while sharing their experiences with others.
finally, i'll comment on briefly -- comment briefly on our updated guidance. as we noted yesterday -- in yesterday's release, we raised both net sales and diluted eps guidance. while we don't provide quarterly guidance, we noted that we have planned for and are offering a worldwide short-term sales program during the second quarter. this program is designed to further reward associates for sales to new customers for a limited period of time and is being offered in each of our markets. we offered a similar short-term sales program during the third quarter of 2020 which was very successful. we anticipate a reasonably similar response in the second quarter this year.
accordingly, we expect our net sales in the second quarter to be the highest net sales quarter of the year as we oil up our strategy. in closing, we believe that we are positioned for continued growth and are confident in our overall strategies, both long-term and for 2021.
with that, i will now ask the operator to please open the lines for questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] we'll take our first question from doug lane of lane research.
douglas lane -- lane research -- analyst
yeah, hi. good morning everybody. kevin, you mentioned the active nutrition launch in the markets that you introduced to recently, but what more specifically do you see for the timing into the asian markets, particularly china? i mean, third quarter, fourth quarter or later in the second quarter? just a little bit more granularity on that.
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah. doug, this is doug. so china, just because of the regulatory timeframe for products is probably going to not be this year. i mean, they're obviously doing some products in line with the kind of the overall product category here, but having kind of the full rollout of some of the other stuff, i don't think we'll expect in the current fiscal year.
douglas lane -- lane research -- analyst
korea, philippines those kinds of markets?
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yeah, maybe, jim, if you maybe just touch on the rollout schedule.
jim brown -- president
yeah, we have pretty much six more markets in asia pacific-focused happening in the third and fourth quarters of this year. and like we've talked about before with active nutrition, it actually started the last day of the -- in march, so we really didn't have an impact in the first quarter. we'll see more of an impact in the second quarter as you know the sales start growing for the first markets that were launched. but again, we'll see more of the impact in '22, because again the rollout will happen in the third and fourth quarter for the remaining markets.
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
and, doug, this is kevin. part of the active nutrition line is our meal replacement drink which is nutrimeal and we're expecting -- back to china, it won't be active nutrition line, but a piece of that line is nutrimeal and we're thinking q3 or q4 in china.
douglas lane -- lane research -- analyst
got it.
jim brown -- president
and maybe a follow-up -- maybe a follow-up real quick on active nutrition. i think just from an alignment of kind of the strategy we've been rolling out, the investment in the plant, the investment in built brands, i think we're quite excited internally about what this could do and i think initial response, it's obviously during the launch period, but i think we're pretty excited about what we're seeing.
douglas lane -- lane research -- analyst
well, i mean, you're four weeks into it, so you should have some initial read, i would imagine. so that's good to hear. can you talk about -- i get the near-term promotion driving a bump in sales in the second quarter, but then the way the numbers work at least from my math is that we see a pretty sharp deceleration in growth in the third and fourth quarter. and is that just because of the comparisons or what is going on under the surface, particularly when you've got this new product being rolled out that should help cover some of that tough comparisons of last year?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think your observation is accurate, but the comps, if you look at the third quarter of last year, we ran the same promotion that we're talking about in the second quarter of this year and the third quarter of last year. and in the fourth quarter of last year, we had that extra fiscal week. so, yeah, you're right, there are a few events therein doing the other stuff. but i think we're pleased with how we're executing and the results in the first quarter for us were beyond our expectations, modestly.
douglas lane -- lane research -- analyst
yes, yes. and then just lastly, the organic growth in mainland china of 8.1%. probably the best quarter in at least a couple of years here. so is that -- again just trying to get a feel for sustainability of the accelerated growth in mainland china, was there a one-off event promotion, something going on there or can we expect to see some sustainability of this kind of growth rate?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah, and i think you have to be mindful like what we talked about, we're running in the second quarter. i mean that's in all the markets. so we would obviously expect to go back and see china benefit from that as well. we often offer promotional packs right around chinese new year, the lunar new year and china had similar type packs last year, but they just sold a little bit better this year and that was definitely additive. we talk to our management team in china and the executives with responsibility for that and i think what we're hearing is positivity. and we just got to go back and keep driving on that customer count growth number, and then that really takes care of itself going forward.
douglas lane -- lane research -- analyst
okay, fair enough. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. and we will take our next question from sebastian barbero of jefferies.
sebastian barbero -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, team. thanks for taking the question. refreshment issue in china, it is encouraging to see the growth accelerating in q1, but wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the recent trends in the chinese consumer health market, any changes in consumer behavior, as well as your ability to hold meetings and also what percent of total sales are now going through the wechat platform.
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah. so we're going to -- so brent neidig, who has responsibility for the china market is sitting with us. we're going to let him chime in and comment on that.
brent neidig -- chief officer and managing director, china
yeah, the -- i would say that the market is returning to somewhat normal condition. the impacts from the coronavirus last year really helped slow down growth and i think things are somewhat returning to normal this year. so it's returning to a somewhat normal state.
sebastian barbero -- jefferies -- analyst
and you have an ability to be holding meetings today? and if so, what's the size of them?
brent neidig -- chief officer and managing director, china
yeah. meetings have returned, they're not at the same degree as we were holding in years past. so it is going on an upward trend there. and you also referenced the wechat enrollments. that -- we experienced about 10% of our weekly enrollments come through that wechat platform.
sebastian barbero -- jefferies -- analyst
got it, ok. and in terms -- and the q4 '20 results, i think you guided for china growth of 6% to 12% for the year. now q1 was 13%. so, a bit of an over delivery there, do you have any changes to your full-year guide in terms of flexibility with china growth?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
no, we don't. i think we're still right in that range, sebastian, relative to our numbers and i think there's ebbs and flows in different periods and like we said a few of these short-term promotional things surrounding the chinese new year outperformed what we expected and maybe that same level isn't present every quarter. we do expect kind of, as indicated, kind of good growth in china this year and expect to see some good progress.
sebastian barbero -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. thank you. and then, though it's still early, there's starting to be evidence that your digital investments are shifting the premise of the model more toward higher base of preferred customer, which has been a goal of yours over the past couple of years. curious to learn more about the feedback you've been getting from associates on the new digital tools and training you're providing, and also how you're expecting personalization to improve customer experience.
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, obviously we've -- over the last several years, we have really increased our focus on the preferred customers. again, you can go back and definitively see that with accounts in the preferred customers. our general belief is the more and more we market directly to consumer, the easier the job is by the associate and the easier it is to build a business. but you're right, training programs and information and just better and more refined communication is something that's well under way. we have a host of teams that are working on on-boarding and customer-listening and we're able to go back and be pretty responsive to kind of short-term feedback that we're seeing.
we're also actively looking at retargeting associates and customers with certain behaviors that have purchased from us in the past and seeing some success there and we're fairly early in the game, but there's something that we see some opportunity for, going forward.
sebastian barbero -- jefferies -- analyst
and last one from me is, you bought back $70 million of shares in q1 out of $81 million remaining on existing plan. can you help us think through your capital allocation priorities for the remainder of the year?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, sebastian you're right. i mean, you could go back and see with the cash level we were down a little bit from where we've been running. we still see some opportunity, obviously, with what we're seeing in the price today, which relative to how we viewed our performance is a little bit of a disconnect, but i think you'd see similar stuff. we've obviously -- you can go back, and i think even in looking at different models out there, our spend level is expected to be up this year from a lot of strategic initiatives. and we laid out those things in mcro that we kind of provided in our first release for the year with the annual guidance. but i think you're going to see a pretty similar pattern.
and i think we'll be opportunistic relative to the environment that we see out there. and as we've mentioned to you in the past, we've been evaluating a variety of business development and maybe one of those things come to fruition, too. so we'll keep kind of pushing down that path. the primary focus is growing our existing business and then everything else kind of falls into a priority rank after that.
sebastian barbero -- jefferies -- analyst

2021-Q2,USNA,2021-07-28 11:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good day, and welcome to the usana health sciences second quarter conference call. today's conference is being recorded.
at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to mr. patrique richards, executive director of investor relations and business development. please go ahead sir.
patrique richards -- executive director of investor relation and business development
good morning. we appreciate you joining us to review our second quarter results. today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast and can be accessed directly from our website at ir.usana.com. shortly following the call, a replay will be available on our website. as a reminder, during the course of this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of our company. those statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ perhaps materially from the results projecting such forward-looking statements. examples of these statements include those regarding our strategies and outlook for fiscal year 2021, as well as uncertainty related to the magnitude, scope and duration of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic to our business, operations and financial results.
we caution you that these statements should be considered in conjunction with disclosures, including specific risk factors and financial data contained in our most recent filings with the sec. i'm joined this morning by our ceo and chairman of the board, kevin guest; our president, jim brown; our chief financial officer, doug hekking; as well as other executives. yesterday after the market closed, we announced our second quarter results and posted our management commentary document on the company's website.
we'll now hear brief remarks from kevin before opening the call for questions.
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
thank you, pat, and good morning, everyone. we appreciate you joining us to review another excellent quarter for usana. we're pleased to report record net sales, earnings and active customers with double-digit year-over-year sales growth in each of our regions. much of this growth was propelled by a short-term sales program we offered during the quarter that not surprisingly contributed meaningful -- meaningfully to our results which we expect to be not short-lived. we offered a similar sales program during the third quarter of last year that was also very successful and we were pleased to see our sales force embrace this program again this year. although, we will not run another sales program of this magnitude in the back half of the year, we have several other initiatives planned that we expect to contribute to results in the back half of the year, which we believe will curate customers.
as noted in our earnings release yesterday, we reiterated our net sales and earnings per share outlook for 2021 and remain confident in our long-term growth strategy. this strategy remains centered on customer growth and engagement and enhancing the overall experience of our customers that they have when doing business with usana. as we continue to execute this strategy we will focus on improving our technology, launching new products and product lines, driving growth opportunities in existing markets, pursuing international expansion opportunities, and capitalizing on business development opportunities including strategic investments and acquisitions. in closing, we are pleased with our performance in the first half of the year and believe we are well-positioned to deliver another record year for usana.
with that, i'll now ask the operator to please open the lines for questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from doug lane, lane research.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
yes. hi. good morning, everybody. just want to start-off with the dichotomy between such a strong second quarter and no change to your full year outlook, which really implies a sharp deceleration in the back half of the year even adjusting for the extra week last year. we're talking about going from 25% sales growth over mid-20s this quarter to mid single-digits in the rest of the year. i just wondered if you could elaborate on why such a sharp deceleration is expected here?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yes. doug, this is the other doug here. it was really kind of what we talked about at the end of last quarter. the sales program was really the lift there and it does have some short-term nature to it and that's really the primary catalyst. we see an opportunity to go back and learn from the process and acquire new customers. we just engage with them but that's the primary catalyst to what you're referring to as that sales program in q2 and it was in q3 last year.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
i noticed after the sales program in q3 last year, your customer count dropped off in the fourth quarter last year. so, are these customers somewhat fluid here? and are we looking for a reduction in your customers going into the third and fourth quarter this year from the second quarter levels?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yes i would expect at least a similar pattern to what we saw last year. we put some additional things into place this year to be more proactive in reaching out and engaging those customers, but i would expect some of that same type of thing. many of the customers could come on through social means and sometimes you see a one purchase and not repeat. but yes, it's a similar paradigm to what you saw last year and hopefully a little bit of progress this year.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then you mentioned covid-19 in your comments and i just wanted to get an update from you guys if i could on how you're seeing covid impact your business now in your various geographies around the world.
jim brown -- president
yes, doug this is jim. when we look at covid-19 as a company in general we've had to really sit back and measure this by market-to-market like you're talking about. and we are seeing in asia pacific different markets have different types of lockdowns or maybe not even a lockdown, but just a different operating environment in general. we talked about the fact that we have a china convention plan in september. we've just made the decision to move that to december because of the covid environment in nanjing where that is planned.
and in general, we're just having to pivot as we go along. supply chain is another area that's been challenging but the reality is we've done a great job our operations departments have done a great job maintaining supply and having limited back orders probably back orders at the same rates before covid. but we're just looking at that and our inventory has gone up a little bit to about $90 million. we would look at inventory going up a little bit higher than that as we again try and work in the covid environment and make sure that we have a good supply chain.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
so jim, just to see if i can understand the impact here. is it more of an impact to supply chains and margins versus demand or is it about the same? i mean how would you characterize where in the p&l it impacts the most?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yes. doug this is doug again. so the question is a good one. i think if you've seen historically the group's done a really good job of kind of leaning into a demanding environment. we've really seen some prolonged -- some of our key markets have a prolonged exposure some markets are in their worst shape they've really been in the covid environment that we're dealing with. so just real high level i think some of those things there -- some of those activities take their toll. we'll lean into that at the back half of the year, just like we did when we had covid and support of those markets.
additionally, we're starting to hear whispers and indications of inflationary pressure on some of the material costs. we're definitely seeing that on the labor side. and what that's going to mean overall is probably not a great deal this year. you'll probably see a little bit of gross margin pressure there. but i mean without a doubt you do see some cost pressure and you do see some disruption to business that we've at least historically managed well and we'll continue to go back and work on that. the team has been fantastic in each of our markets in leaning into it.
jim brown -- president
yes. just a good example is just the logistics side of it. it's taking another four to six weeks to get products across the water to asia pacific. so we've gone into our erp system and changed some of the parameters too and that will increase inventory. but in the end, we're trying to push more finished goods into the market so they can react and run their businesses accordingly.
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes and in the short term we've been air shipping stuff to the markets to make sure they have ample supply.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
okay. that makes sense. and just lastly doug do you have an update on what your expected capital expenditures will be this year?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yes i -- my best guess at this point we've been pretty low so far year-to-date. we definitely had the plans for the back half of the year. i think part of the issue as we talk about supply chain a lot of the stuff that we plan for to go back and receive some of the capital win has been delayed due to this thing. but i would say somewhere between that $10 million and $15 million range for the year would be my best guess at this time.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
okay, great. thanks guys.
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
thanks doug.
operator
our next question comes from stephanie wissink, jefferies.
stephanie wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you. good day everyone. two questions if we could. the first is just a -- wanted to give you some time to share a little bit more about your native shopping app in china. just seeing the china numbers come back pretty strongly wondering how much of that you think is led by the digital tool deployment versus just the underlying recovery in demand?
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes we have walter noot who oversees that in the room with. we'll let him respond to that.
walter noot -- chief operating officer
so our china shopping app is probably not one of the main reasons for our initial growth in china. we've had a lot of downloads. we've got a lot of usage. it's -- we've -- it's been very -- it's been accepted by our china market, they're very excited about it. but we take an mvp approach to our software development. so, our first phase was shopping. we're going to add kind of the auto order function, which allows people to continue to reorder product and set it up on a schedule. we're going to add more notifications and other tools in the next few months. and so, there's a lot more coming with that. but i would just say, that's kind of a strategy for us. it's a long-term play it's not a short-term play for us.
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yes, i would also say maybe stephanie add on a little bit to what walter said, is the initial indication feedback from the customers in the market have been very positive. it's far more familiar to them than what the shopping experience we've had in the past. so, we're making progress, and it fits into what kevin talked about with that customer experience. and we'll keep pushing that and keep layering on and keep building additional functionality and things that could be a catalyst to future revenue growth. right now, i think there's, i think a lot more satisfaction from our consumers in the shopping experience, but there's more room to grow there.
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes. there's more coming for china shopping. we'll add more shopping experience with web shopping and other things that are more chinese native.
stephanie wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
yes. and i thought that was interesting that you used the word native. so, is this something that is designed in china, for china or is this something that has a platform that could be deployed around the world if you find that the consumer engagement is there to justify it?
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
it's different. the chinese shopping experience is different than non-chinese shopping experience. just the way their user experience works is different. so we've designed these applications. all of our work that we've done over the last 1.5 years, which some of it's being deployed this quarter and next quarter, next quarter we're going to -- it's going to start coming out. but, all of this is being done very native. it's being done in china. it's being done for china. it's the way the chinese people shop. it's just a different experience for them, and we are learning from that, but we are adding and changing shopping experiences around the world, more localized for their markets.
stephanie wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
that's great. i want to just jump over to active nutrition, because your comments suggest that it's coming out of the gate pretty strongly. so, wanted to ask two questions. one is the cohort of associates that you're seeing drive that business is it similar to the cohort that you would see in your core business or is this a new cohort of associates that's coming on board? and same question for preferred customers, similar or different or unique relative to your core business?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yes. stephanie i'll let jim add on here or kevin after i give you my thoughts on it. i think for the most part, it's some of the same folks, but what you do see is a lean with some of the folks who are consuming our supplements and kind of our nutrition products, who have more of a lean toward kind of the weight management activity and digestive health and hydration energy; you see more of an adoption there. that was a unique way we introduce that product category, but it's been pretty limited in its introduction so far, and there's plans to maybe continue to roll that out throughout the year. maybe jim can touch on kind of the rollout.
jim brown -- president
yes, we've rolled out to limited markets, mostly north america at this point in time. and then we have a second phase that's going to start rolling out in the third quarter, really into the second quarter of 2022 is when this will all go out. and then, we have plans and we're working on products right now to enhance the line. so, even as we're rolling it out there's going to be more products, more bars in different offerings in each of the markets coming out, so our long-term strategy is to continue to support the line. we look at this line as a great introduction for associates to get more pcs. it's a very -- it can be a very sticky product. you get an experience with it, and then hopefully people that come on with active nutrition will then make the decision to stay with you signing and get them to our nutritional is kind of the roadmap that we have.
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
and stephanie, this is kevin. one of the things strategically that we've talked about in past calls is the notion that we're appealing to lifestyle and we're expanding our product offering base from outside of just nutritional vitamins and a pill so to speak by creating the new manufacturing plant that we call usana north and other areas where we're accumulating competitive advantages through our manufacturing skills. we're seeing that all proceed according to plan. and this year is looking like it's moving forward according to plan and what we had planned strategically from a digital strategy perspective, but also from a product perspective, as you think about active nutrition.
i mentioned in my comments, other products and product lines. you'll see in the future that we're getting ready to release other things that will lead into usana being more of a health company as it relates to overall lifestyle and having a more holistic approach to people as health becomes more and more of a concern, a need and a desire for consumers globally. so active nutrition is our first step in a strategic move from a lifestyle perspective and you can look to more products and product lines contributing to usana as we move forward.
stephanie wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
very helpful. thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from ivan feinseth, tigress financial partners.
ivan feinseth -- tigress financial partners -- analyst
good morning. thank you for taking my question, and congratulations on another quarter of great results and the -- congratulations on the launch of the active nutrition line. what areas in the launch have surprised you positively and maybe disappointed? and where do you see new opportunities in that line?
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yeah. i think some of the areas that surprised us, i guess, was some of the forecasting we did on the line initially was just beaten in general. we had some of our products do two to three even 10 times what we were expecting at the beginning, which is very promising. but again with the supply chain issues we had it kind of slowed down that launch for a few weeks and we had to pivot on it. but it's been accepted from the field really well. one of those product is a metabolism product, and it just went really well and we're excited about getting it into the other markets and just seeing what active nutrition could do for really into 2022.
ivan feinseth -- tigress financial partners -- analyst
and then on your active nutrition app, what kind of engagement have you seen in that? and what other apps do you see coming out to follow that?
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yeah. i mean, i think the people coming in and filling -- kind of filling out the online survey and stuff i think it's gone pretty well. as far as people are hitting the site and taking in those who follow -- who actually fall through the questions as they started. so it's still really early in the game, but i think at least encouraged by the initial response there.
ivan feinseth -- tigress financial partners -- analyst
and then what kind of feedback are you getting from associates as far as their clients what they're looking for, what they like, what they want to see more of?
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yeah. well, jim go ahead.
jim brown -- president
yeah, i think one of the areas that we're getting a lot of feedback and it works well with us having usana north and a bar line is just more options when it comes to bars and we have that in our future. we're going to be looking at releasing another bar at the end of this year and potentially a couple more flavors into early next year. that's the type of feedback we get. of course we get other feedback ivan about taste and wanting different types of flavors and we'll work with that. we really have an opportunity having usana north where we manufacture our bars and our powdered drinks to really satisfy the needs of our customers at a different level because before when you're dealing with third-party manufacturing your hands are tied by minimum order quantities and a few other things that don't let you pivot as well. but bringing it in internally is going to really solve some of these issues.
ivan feinseth -- tigress financial partners -- analyst
and then on the bar subject like from your acquisition -- your investment in built brands, what are you seeing happening there? are you going to be launching some co-branded or them helping you develop bars for your own brand?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah, we're not going to launch a co-branded built bar but the intent with the investment was really to get expertise and speed up the r&d process to help us formulate new bars. and when i talked about just a minute ago that we have a bar at the end of the year and potentially more flavors of a similar bar in the next year that was really driven by the collaboration with built bar or built brands, and it's just allowing us to move down that r&d into pilot batches into real products much quicker than if we were doing it ourselves. long-term what we're doing is we're building out a food lab; that's already started. and probably over the next launches of bars into 2022 there'll be bars that we've done ourselves. but it really helped speed up that process when we got into the collaboration with built bar.

2021-Q3,USNA,2021-10-27 11:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good day, and welcome to the usana health sciences third quarter conference call. [operator instructions]
at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to mr. patrique richards, executive director of investor relations and business development. please go ahead, sir.
patrique richards -- executive director of investor relations and business development
thank you, and good morning. we appreciate you joining us to review our third quarter results. today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast and can be accessed directly from our website at ir.usana.com. shortly following the call, a replay will be available on our website. as a reminder, during the course of this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of our company.
those statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from the results projected in such forward-looking statements. examples of these statements include those regarding our strategies and outlook for fiscal year 2021, as well as uncertainty related to the magnitude, scope and duration of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results. we caution you that these statements should be considered in conjunction with disclosures, including specific risk factors and financial data contained in our most recent filings with the sec.
i'm joined this morning by -- with our -- by our ceo and chairman of the board, kevin guest; our president, jim brown; our chief financial officer, doug hekking; as well as other executives. yesterday, after the market closed, we announced our third quarter results and posted our management commentary document on the company's website.
we'll now hear brief remarks from kevin before opening the call for questions.
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
thank you, pat, and good morning, everyone. we appreciate you joining us to review our third quarter results. as we reported in our mid-september press release, disruptions and lockdowns due to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic affected our performance in several of our key markets during the quarter. yesterday, we reported that our final third quarter results were modestly better than our preliminary projections, and we reiterated our fiscal 2021 net sales and earnings per share outlook.
so the takeaway is that although the back half of the year has presented unanticipated challenges, we expect 2021 to be a record revenue year for usana. as we enter the fourth quarter, the operating environment in many of our markets around the world remains unpredictable. so it's difficult to project when sales activity and momentum in our business will completely rebound. notwithstanding the current environment, we continue to execute our growth strategy and are optimistic about our prospects for continued growth in 2022, and more importantly, in the long run.
we will also continue to place a high priority on strategically investing in the business today in order to drive growth tomorrow. our overall growth strategy continues to be centered on generating sustainable customer growth and engagement, curating microentrepreneurs and enhancing the overall experience our customers have when doing business with usana.
in this regard, we continue to be focused on: one, improving our technology and providing our associates and customers with a seamless shopping experience; two, launching new products and product lines; three, identifying and executing growth opportunities in existing markets; four, pursuing international expansion opportunities; and five, capitalizing on business development opportunities, including strategic investments and acquisitions. i'll close by saying that we remain confident in the strategies we are pursuing for the long-term health of our business, and in our overall long-term growth potential in our markets globally.
with that, i'll now ask the operator to please open the lines for questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] we'll take our first question from stephanie wissink with jefferies.
chris -- jefferies -- analyst
team, it's actually chris [phonetic] on for steph. i wanted to touch on the fourth quarter, if i might. the midpoint of your guide really implies a flattish to slightly negative sales number. but just given the outsized drop in customers reported at the end of this past quarter, how do you gain confidence in generating that level of revenue on a smaller overall starting base? are you seeing anything, october to date, that would imply this sort of attrition has kind of stabilized?
g. douglas hekking -- chief financial officer
chris, this is doug. i'd probably hold off on giving too much color on what we're seeing so far in the quarter. but one of the nice aspects of how we report our customer accounts is it gives a true measure who purchased during the quarter. and what you saw in the third quarter represented -- i think, as you indicated in some of the notes, a fall off from where we were in the prior quarter and the year ago quarter. and a great deal of that fall off had to do with the absence of a short-term sales program during the quarter.
and we were quite optimistic about many of the aspects we were kind of pushing on and a little disappointed that we didn't see some of those customer accounts cascade forward. we saw a similar pattern last year after we ran this program. we definitely made increased effort, but i think the environment made it a little bit more challenging to kind of execute on many of the things that we wanted to execute on. and we're still working on it.
it's -- we still recognize it as a critical part about touching those customers early in their journey with the company. as far as the fourth quarter goes, listen, i think the measures that you saw in the third quarter and what we're expecting in the fourth quarter would go back and lead you to believe that we'd see something roughly similar in customer accounts that we saw in the third quarter. and so based upon the guidance we put out there, i think that's roughly our expectations at this point.
chris -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. that's great color. and then for my second one, i just wanted to ask if it's your sense that maybe the drop in customers, do you think that's a reflection that some may have moved away to maybe alternative solutions? and then maybe just as a quick follow-up to that, how do you really think about kind of reactivating and reengaging some of those lost customers and associates? any color there would be great.
g. douglas hekking -- chief financial officer
yes. and once again, i think when we have a pretty prominent short-term program like we had in the third quarter of last year and the second quarter of this year, we have seen some dips in customer accounts following that. we believe that we changed a little bit of the structure and we put some programs in place to offset that. and that's obviously not what we saw, and we're definitely not totally pleased with the results.
and i think the environment definitely has something to do with it. but i think it's less to do with kind of the overall thing. and i think it's more to do with the customers that we brought on during that period of time and how we engaged them early on. kevin?
kevin g. guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes. yes. just -- this is kevin. an additional thought is we continue to focus our strategy on growing our active customer count, which is an opportunity for us to look at retention and how to retain people. and our long-term strategy over the last several years that we've talked about on these calls is our advance in technology and advancing our technology base. and so we're starting to see some of those things roll out, which we believe will help us in the future as it relates to our active customer count.
g. douglas hekking -- chief financial officer
and then the second part of your question, chris, was really reengaging some of those customers. we always have some problem going on. the marketing team always has an outrage going on. oftentimes, that's met with somewhat limited success as far as reaching out to someone after they're not buying any more. but it's something we continue to do. and i think we're finding new things that do work as we move forward.
chris -- jefferies -- analyst
that's great, thanks a lot guys.
operator
[operator instructions] we'll take our next question from doug lane with lane research.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
hi, good morning everybody. you mentioned the delaying of certain new products given the covid-19 resurgence and the disruptions there to your business. can you be a little bit more specific on what the change in plans was there? is it basically just been pulled back from a 2021 event and will be included in 2022? or exactly how did that time line change?
g. douglas hekking -- chief financial officer
yes. i think that's pretty much it. either they got pushed to the fourth quarter or you'll see them kind of roll into the first part of next year. and i think a lot of it has to do -- and i think it's well reported out there, doug, that you're just seeing some disruption just even in transit times and doing some of this other stuff and whether that market is really able to fully roll that out in the current environment, and it really is market specific on how it's impacted us.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
and what were the key products that were delayed?
g. douglas hekking -- chief financial officer
we still had some additional work with our active nutrition and some -- i guess, some products that had some pretty close ties to that. and just kind of our standard -- some product introductions that we had scheduled that have been kind of pushed out. but primarily, active nutrition was a big focal point.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
does that change your outlook for 2022? will that crowd out from product activity you had slated for 2022? or will that just be added to what was already on the target of 2022?
g. douglas hekking -- chief financial officer
yes. i don't think it -- provided that we don't have any more unforeseen kind of challenges, i don't think it should disrupt other plans that we had for 2022.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
okay. that's fair enough. and then same question really with live events. if i remember right, you were talking about a live event to the fourth quarter, and i assume that that's been scrapped. but can you update us on when you expect to be hosting major live events again?
g. douglas hekking -- chief financial officer
yes. so -- go ahead, jim. i'll let you take that one.
jim brown -- president
so right now, in china, they're having a national meeting that's scheduled for the beginning of december, so right around the corner. that is scheduled now to be live. of course, that could always change according to the market. in market, there are large events that are happening there. in our second quarter at our ap convention, that's going to be a virtual event like we've been doing. and then august of next year at our international 30th anniversary event, that's planned to be live. again, those could change according to requirements or what happens with the demic, but right now that's the schedule.
g. douglas hekking -- chief financial officer
and doug, maybe to add on there, i think once again, it really relates to what the activity level is in market and really what makes sense in the market given the current environment. so it's nice to see. and i think the china team is eager to go back and have some in-person opportunity to go back and engage and do this other stuff. and so we're hopefully that comes to pass like we're planning. i think you've seen korea be able to go back and have a few small in-person events as well. and so we see that as a very encouraging sign going forward as well.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and the global events in salt lake city, and that's next august or july, i believe. and you mentioned it's the 30th anniversary, so i would expect maybe a bigger news than usual? how should we think about what kind of promotional and product events are going to happen around your 30th anniversary convention?
g. douglas hekking -- chief financial officer
yes. it's interesting times because under normal circumstances, it would be a huge event. the thing that we're going to do is we're going to continue to have that live. and we know that there's certain markets, for example china, that gets 1,000 to 1,500 people that come, may not be open to come into the event.
of course, we want to look at potentially having some products to be announced at the convention and entertainment at a different level than we have in the past because of the 30th anniversary. but when we come to attendance and what we're planning, we're planning kind of flat to down from previous years when we've had that event, only because we're just not sure of what markets will be open at that time.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
no, that makes total sense. and just lastly, can you talk about china? just what's going on with that market? i mean, other than just sort of the pandemic-related openings and closings that we read about in the paper. what about the nutritional supplement market in general and your business there? specifically following that 100-day review period, which really doesn't seem that anybody has really recovered from that. what just -- can you talk about the market for supplements and usana's products specifically in china?
g. douglas hekking -- chief financial officer
yes. i think some of the broader market indicators we see is we see some support for those types of products. i think, obviously, the pandemic has brought a lot of the stuff to the forefront or top-of-mind type discussions. but without a doubt, doug, i think some of the things you're saying is true -- that was a pretty disruptive event that definitely had a disruption in consumer confidence.
but i think the recognition of playing a role in your own health and taking products that are additive there, i think, is definitely on the mind. so i think we're optimistic. i think what we're hearing from the team there is optimistic with some of the plans they have rolling out next year, but it's been a longer process than what we had anticipated.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
okay, thank you. thanks, sir.

operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to usana health sciences' fourth-quarter conference call. today's conference is being recorded. at this time, i'd like to turn the conference over to mr. patrique richards, executive director of investor relations and business development.
please go ahead.
patrique richards -- executive director, investor relations and business development
thank you. good morning. we appreciate you joining us to review our fourth-quarter and full-year results. today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast and can be accessed directly from our website at ir.usana.com.
shortly following the call, a replay will be available on our website. as a reminder, during the course of this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of our company. those statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ perhaps materially from the results projected in such forward-looking statements. examples of these statements include those regarding our strategies and outlook for fiscal year 2022, as well as uncertainty related to the magnitude, scope, and duration of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic to our business, operations, and financial results.
we caution you that these statements should be considered in conjunction with disclosures, including specific risk factors and financial data contained in our most recent filings with the sec. i'm joined this morning by our ceo and chairman of the board, kevin guest; our president, jim brown; our chief financial officer, doug hekking; as well as the other members of our executive team. yesterday, after the market closed, we announced our fourth-quarter results and posted our management commentary document on the company's website. we'll now hear brief remarks from kevin before opening the call for questions. 
kevin guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
thank you, pat, and good morning, everyone. we appreciate you joining us to review our fourth quarter and full-year results, as well as our initial outlook for 2022. 2021 marked a year of solid performance in what remains a dynamic operating environment. for the full year, we grew net sales by 5%.
however, as the covid-19 pandemic has evolved over the last two-plus years, we've learned that its impact to our business is not linear. this is evident in our fourth-quarter results where lockdowns and disruptions to our operating environment pressured our financial performance. we continue to manage the business with sustainable long-term growth in mind. and in 2021, we made meaningful progress on several strategic initiatives.
technology investment remains a focal point. and last year, we made several improvements and enhancements to our digital tool offerings, including rollout of a product recommendation tool, introducing customized and branded website creation tools, and releasing the first version of our native shopping app in china. these enhancements provide our customers with an excellent shopping experience, and we believe this will help drive customer acquisition. additionally, we maintain an unwavering focus on product innovation.
and our scientists and product specialists made progress on our long-term product development road map. we've also transitioned more manufacturing to our food's facility in salt lake city, and we expect to see product and financial benefits in the coming years as we focus on leveraging our investment in this facility. as we embark on usana's 30th anniversary this year, we will continue to strategically invest in the business with investments focused on our digital transformation initiatives, product innovation, growing our business in china, and pursuing business development opportunities, all with the objective of growing our active customer counts. we are excited to resume hosting in-person events this year in markets where it is safe and where we are permitted to do so.
we are currently planning to celebrate usana's 30th anniversary by hosting a hybrid, virtual, in-person event in salt lake city, and we're also planning to host an in-person event in china in the back half of the year. we continue to believe that in-person events are both important and additive to driving excitement and momentum within our sales force. additionally, we plan to run short-term sales programs across several of our markets throughout the year to suit the needs of individual markets. before turning the call over for questions, i'd like to briefly discuss our fiscal 2022 outlook.
we are cautiously optimistic on a return to normalcy as some of our markets currently remain severely impacted by covid-related lockdowns while other markets are seeing signs of reopening. as such, our net sales and diluted earnings per share guidance carry a wider-than-normal range. we anticipate that net sales will accelerate throughout the year. we also expect some pressure on our operating margin relative to historical performance, which reflects inflationary pressures on key areas of our business, strategic investments in our digital infrastructure, and increased travel and event-related costs.
in closing, we are confident our strategies will enable us to become even more positioned to drive future growth. with that, i'll now ask the operator to please open the line for questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we'll take our first question from steph wissink with jefferies. please go ahead.
steph wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you. good day, everyone. we have a few questions if we could. the first is just on your remarks on the call today regarding the sales acceleration through the year.
so, it's a two-part question. one, if you can just give us some sense of magnitude, kind of the starting point to the ending point as you've contemplated in your guidance? and then just remind us if there are any unusual comparison effects to the prior year, just recognizing 2021 was a somewhat unusual year as the year played out.
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah. stephanie, this is doug. and so, i appreciate your question. so, the ramp-up during the year has to do with some of the kind of the holiday period you see.
right now, we're in chinese new year. it's tough to get a whole lot done during that period of time. and then the timing of some of these test programs and promotional activity that we have planned throughout the year. and so, as i'm sure you're aware, what we did in 2020 was in the third quarter, pretty heavy promotion period with every market happening at the same time.
that happened in the second quarter of 2021. that will be a little bit more spread out and kind of ramp with expected significance throughout the year, really kind of culminated in the third quarter. and so, that is kind of -- hopefully kind of captures both those things is that we'll see a build and match. we'll see the first quarter at or modestly above sequentially and then kind of build from there.
steph wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. that's really helpful, doug. and then my second question is related to your comments on cost inputs. if you can just give us a sense of your cost basket.
what's the most heavily densified in the basket? where you're seeing the most pressure? and if you have -- or do you plan to take price? and at what magnitude to offset some of the pressure?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, relative to the product itself, you really have all the inputs that are flowing in there. you have materials far and away are the biggest cost pressure right now, and there's a little bit of a risk profile there as we've got bids from our suppliers, but we don't even have a secured price throughout the year, so they're a little bit unknown. and i think they're just kind of dealing with their uncertainty as well.
and so, we're seeing some definitive pressure there. in markets outside mainland china, we're seeing somewhere in that 5% to 7% range is pressure on material costs. wages, i think definitively, we've seen wages across the board, not only in the production environment, but throughout the organization, just with this environment we've kind of come into, and it's not just domestic, we're seeing it in the other markets as well. and then some of the overhead and some of the transportation costs continue to go back and get pressure.
we're hoping to start seeing some of the transportation costs and the -- just the magnitude that we've been paying above historic levels start abating in the back half of the year. i think some of these other things we see is a little bit more persistent throughout the year.
steph wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. and have you taken price yet? or do you intend to? and if you can give us a sense of a 5% to 7% kind of a blended average cost increase? or are you seeing costing higher than that and you're going to price into that higher level of cost?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah. and so, we've spent a lot of time with this. we've talked with our sales leadership, our markets' kind of direction from kevin and jim, and really trying to take a pretty thoughtful, pragmatic approach. so, yes, we will have a price adjustment, but it's modest as we expect some of these things to start abating then we'll adjust accordingly.
and that will typically happen in the first quarter -- first and second quarter, and it really varies by market, but it should be relatively modest in price adjustment. and i think we're trying to balance a bunch of things there but --
steph wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. last question is just on some of the tests that you've been running to activate your associate network. and i think you mentioned to drive customer count. can you give us just some sense of early learnings from those tests? anything that you found to be successful that you expect to deploy more widely in 2022? thank you.
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah. and so, stephanie, we're fortunate to have david mulham, who heads up our sales around the world with the exception of mainland china, and then brent neidig in here. and so, maybe i'll let those gentlemen talk on that since they're present today is probably -- you can hear it right from the horse's mouth.
brent neidig -- chief officer and managing director of china
good morning. yeah. so, yeah, we've run a number of tests in the back end of '21. and i think what we've seen as a result of that is a high level of engagement, not just through the rewards process, but certainly from the experiences that we've been able -- and the solutions that we've been able to deliver through those programs.
so, definitely a stickier process with our customers and a longer tail in terms of their purchasing over a series of cycles.
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
brent, from a china perspective, anything else to --
brent neidig -- chief officer and managing director of china
yeah. i'll just speak briefly to the short-term sales incentives that we've run over the last couple of years. we've certainly had several learnings from both of those events. we've really heavily analyzed the types of individuals that are being attracted by those incentives and what their tail looks like once they come into the business.
so, we have made some adjustments for forward-looking promotions to accommodate the types of individuals that those incentives are attracting. and so, we hope to have continued improvements to those results as we move forward.
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah. and i think, stephanie, from our perspective, and we've been pretty open about this, i think you saw that in the program we ran in 2020, we had a little bit of a catalyst to the business, i think, particularly just kind of given the fact we're just getting into the covid environment there. and what we probably didn't fully appreciate at the time is we had some companion efforts going on at the same time that were pretty additive to that. those were not present in what we did in 2021.
so, the sales team have designed and architected what we're going to be doing this year to have more similarities to 2020 and a few more enhancements from what we've learned.
steph wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. that's really helpful. if i could toss one more in. just noticing that china sales on a quarter-to-quarter basis or sequential basis actually did show some improvement.
do you attribute that to some of these companion-driven coincident driving promotions? or is that something that maybe is more structural and fundamental and we've kind of seen the bottom of that market in terms of performance?
brent neidig -- chief officer and managing director of china
yes. stephanie, this is brent. it's an interesting observation. we're very optimistic about the signs that we're seeing coming out of china.
i'm very optimistic for 2022. i think to your question, though, it's difficult to know. i think that there are some structural improvements that we've made over the last couple of years, and we're starting to see the fruits of those labors. our digital enhancements and improvements that we're making to the shopping experience has certainly improved things.
and we're also very excited about new leadership that's come on board with new ideas, and they have the ability to really help turn around momentum that's been somewhat lackluster over the last several years. so, i think all of those things compiled together, quite optimistic about the direction we're going to be going in china.
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah. stephanie, this is doug. i'd probably add on. in our fourth-quarter results, we had a little softer than what we expected just because we had to push some of these events out that we had planned to the market.
our national sales meeting, which we had deferred is now -- we had to cancel it for the period. other product-related promotions in reference to that event got pushed down and had limited impact because of that. so, i think brent's comments are appropriate. but i think even with the light of that we had to go back and push some things out and had to go back and postpone it just kind of adapting to the environment. 
steph wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you, and encouraging as well. i'll jump back in queue. thanks, everyone.
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
thank you, stephanie.
operator
[operator instructions] we'll go next to doug lane with lane research. please go ahead.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
yes. hi. good morning, everybody. on the cost front, i get the cost inflation and shipping and materials and what have you.
but can you talk a little bit more about the associate incentives? they were up 110 basis points in the quarter. is there going to be -- is that going to be a pressure point next year or this year as well?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
no, i think it's in check. and i think, doug, in all honestly, i think the comparison, yes, on a year-over-year basis, that's the math. i think the fourth quarter of last year was lower than what we typically see. i think the level that we had as far as what we're reporting here is, i think, roughly in line kind of with what you'll see for the year in 2021, you'll see in 2022.
so, i think it just happened that last year we were just a little bit lighter as we scramble and a bunch of the events and travel and some of this other stuff got postponed and we had a little bit of pickup in the fourth quarter last year that we didn't have this year.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
ok. fair enough. can we talk a little bit more about your convention this year? it's the 30th anniversary. it sounds like it's going to be perhaps a little bit more of an event than typically in the past.
i know you mentioned it's a hybrid event, but that will include in-person component, obviously. is there going to be any kind of special promotions run during your or ahead of that, any kind of special new product activity we should look for? just any kind of more color on what you think the impact of the convention will be this year.
kevin guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
well, doug, this is kevin. you know, we are -- we rely heavily on our events as it relates to momentum in the business, and we're excited at the prospect of being able to get together. being our 30th anniversary also is an opportunity for us to generate excitement around the world. so, we are going to plan for the worst and hope for the best, meaning we're going to do a simultaneous virtual event while we're doing a live event.
and we've never really seen anything like this before. we're excited about the technology we're going to use in the interaction to make it as personal of an event globally. we expect we're going to have several thousand people here in salt lake city in attendance, but we expect tens of thousands of people globally to participate virtually in this event. as to relationship -- to your question about promotions, we will have some promotions that are tied to our 30th anniversary, tied to some new products that we've been wanting and hoping and waiting to launch that are in the queue.
but it's not going to be as it relates to the convention directly, it's not going to be an overwhelming product launch and/or sales promotion period because we are trying to have that happen throughout the year, not just in one event and also thinking about the fact that there is a possibility that the event could be limited just because of unexpected covid issues. so, we're not relying on that event for certain product launches and/or promotions.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
ok. that makes sense. thanks, kevin. just one last thing with all these lockdowns and what have you.
you mentioned in your commentary that the philippines was down 52% in local currency, which is a big number. does that imply that there could be some significant bounce backs as we come out of this covid? or do you think that's kind of a permanent reset of the sales level there?
kevin guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
i think it's -- we're going to have to build from there. it's not -- it's -- i don't think it's going to go back and bounce back overnight. you have a market that's very densely populated. and in many cases, this market was doing a great deal of in-person transaction.
i mean, probably one of the higher of all our markets of doing things in-office, and that shut off essentially overnight. and that environment has really gone through a great deal. so, yes, i think we'll make progress. the team is -- i can tell you, it's working hard day and night as committed as ever, but it's going to take some time.
and i think they're anticipating to make some progress this year, but it's not jumping right back to where it was in 2020.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst

operator
good day and welcome to the usana health sciences first quarter conference call. today's conference is being recorded. at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to mr. andrew masuda, director of investor relations.
please go ahead, sir.
andrew masuda
good morning. we appreciate you joining us to review our first quarter results. today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast and can be accessed directly from our website at ir.usana.com. shortly following the call, a replay will be available on our website.
as a reminder, during the course of this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of our company. those statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ perhaps materially from the results projected in such forward-looking statements. examples of these statements include those regarding our strategies and our outlook for fiscal year 2022 as well as uncertainty related to the magnitude, scope and duration of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic to our business, operations and financial results. we caution you that these statements should be considered in conjunction with disclosures, including specific risk factors and financial data contained in our most recent filings with the sec.
i'm joined by our ceo and chairman of the board, kevin guest; our president, jim brown; our chief financial officer, doug hekking, as well as other executives. yesterday, after the market closed, we announced our first quarter results and posted our management commentary document on the company's website. we'll now hear brief remarks from kevin before opening up the call for questions. 
kevin guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
thank you, andrew, and good morning, everyone. we appreciate you joining us to review our first quarter results. usana delivered solid first quarter results in the face of continued challenges across several key markets. despite these challenges, both net sales and diluted eps grew sequentially during the quarter.
our operating results for the first quarter varied across several key regions and markets. for example, the u.s. market generated year-over-year sales growth and performed modestly above our expectations. conversely, some key markets in southeast asia pacific generated softer-than-expected results during and after the lunar new year holiday despite our efforts to offset the seasonality through promotional offerings.
nonetheless, worldwide sales and operating results were in the range of internal expectations. during the quarter, we made progress on several of our 2022 strategic initiatives. we resumed the rollout of our active nutrition line across certain markets, and we continue to make enhancements to the overall customer experience through strategic digital investments. as we all have seen, the operating environment in china has become more challenging and unpredictable due to the escalation of covid-19 and the accompanying lockdowns, restrictions and other disruptions to individuals and businesses.
shanghai has experienced citywide lockdowns, and the chinese government recently began implementing restrictions in parts of beijing. at this point, we do not have transparency into whether these restrictions will continue to increase in the coming weeks in beijing and other areas of china that are important to our business. nevertheless, given the current circumstances, we anticipate some negative impact on our results in china, and we've lowered our fiscal 2022 outlook to reflect this uncertain environment. regardless, we remain committed to supporting our associates, customers and employees in this key market and will continue to adapt to these ever-changing conditions to generate momentum in the business.
in closing, we remain confident that the successful execution of our global strategies will position usana to deliver long-term sustainable growth in the future. with that, i'll now ask the operator to please open the lines for questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we'll go first to chris neamonitis at jefferies. your line is open. please go ahead, sir.
chris neamonitis -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thanks, everyone for the questions. i wanted to ask about china and asia pacific. so maybe starting with china, still a sequential improvement despite the new year and some of the more extreme restrictions, right? so can you talk about how maybe that market progressed within the quarter, maybe month by month? are you seeing more digital uptake offsetting some of those external pressures? or maybe just help us think about how you're able to support customers in that market.
brent neidig -- chief officer and managing director of china
this is brent. we started a little sluggish in january, and we did see an uptake in february and march, and i think that was primarily due to a lot of the initiatives that we rolled out in the latter half of the quarter. so i was very optimistic to see that, especially given the challenging circumstances that are there throughout the country. we're very pleased with the effort that we made and for the results that we were able to deliver despite the challenging circumstances.
chris neamonitis -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and then on -- maybe on asia pacific, could you unpack for us the macro trends you're seeing, specifically in malaysia and the philippines? i know you mentioned in covid fatigue with customer accounts could be hanging in there. so what are you hearing or seeing as it relates to productivity in those markets? and is there any sort of kind of clearing event you would be able to point to as we move through the year?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah, and i think you have two different stories really. i think the philippines is coming off a really challenging year and they've been working -- i think, similar to what in china, have been working very diligently to go back and get the momentum turned and moved in a good direction. and i think we saw some flattening on a sequential basis and a little bit better performance sequentially, but we got some work to do there. in malaysia, which has really been one of our top-performing markets year-on-year, you had a little bit of dynamic of year-over-year comps on the timing of promotions and kind of the cadence of promotions between the two quarters.
and it really is the first time in malaysia, we're starting to see this in a few markets. it's the first time that many of these folks were able to go out and see their families during the lunar new year. and we saw a little bit more of that than i think what we had banked in. so we saw a little bit deeper dip during the chinese new year, and we saw some of these promotional packs that we typically surround with that period of time, maybe not resonating quite as strong as what they did last year.
and i think -- so a host of factors, but i think that's a market that we're still incredibly high on and expect to go back and see some progress as the year goes on.
chris neamonitis -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. and then just last one for me, just on input cost trends. i think last quarter, you flagged about 5% to 7% of pressure on materials. but the new guidance implies maybe that's maybe stepped up since a couple of months ago.
so is that how should we be thinking about it? and maybe if you could help us think about how that trend evolves through the year? are you seeing any sort of relative stability in those baskets?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
well, because the last time we've updated, there hasn't been that much time this past. i think we're still oriented in that same range that we had, but it's definitely something with our operations group, we're watching as kind of we're bringing the raws and finished, we go back and market and sell. and so we'll definitely report on that as the year progresses. but right now, just because it's so recent to when we reported the year there's not that much more to add there at this time.
chris neamonitis -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. thanks everyone.
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
we'll go next to doug lane of lane research. your line is open. please go ahead, sir.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
yes. hi. good morning, everybody.
kevin guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
good morning.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
good morning. on the inflation front, do you -- have you enacted any price increases or what's your plan for price increases for the remainder of the year?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah, we have and we've spent a great deal of time with each of the individual markets. we've met as an executive team. and we've tried to go back and take kind of a moderate approach and not being too forward leaning on that. so toward the end of the quarter, mid- to late first quarter, most of these price changes were enacted, but they were relatively small in comparison to some of the inflation pressures we're seeing.
and kind of given our gross margin, we felt that was kind of the appropriate tack to go back and take. so you're somewhere in that two, two and a half percent range on a weighted basis on some of that, but that definitely wasn't reflected for the full quarter.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
got it. and looking at your operating margin assumption, i think you took 50 basis points out of your range. and your cost of goods and your associate incentives have been pretty stable. they really -- the pressure has been the deleveraging on the sg&a.
is most of that 50 basis point reduction just further deleveraging on the sg&a because of your sales reduction? or do you anticipate a little bit more gross margin pressure that you've been seeing in the last couple of quarters?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think we've definitely seen an elevated pressure on kind of the cost of materials that we're producing. but a lot of what you're seeing in at least the first quarter relative to expectation, i think, really was a little bit deleveraging on the sales line. and you can go back and clearly see that just on the year-on-year comparison there.
that's where the bulk of the operating margin was lost year-on-year in kind of that loss of leverage on the sales performance in q1.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
ok. yeah, definitely. and on your sales reduction, because again, the sales number in the first quarter, it looks like it'd be what people were expecting. and so that means, obviously, the reduction in second, third and fourth quarter.
and you mentioned that the second half, you still anticipate growth but not as much as before, but is really the bulk of the revenue reduction going to hit the second quarter because of the lockdowns in china?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah and i wouldn't say that. there's some timing of events. when you look at the second quarter of last year, we had the short-term program, every market did in the second quarter last year. and we've spaced that program out, so you see more of the distributed offering this year through markets.
and so china, one of our bigger markets who performed well on this. really, we're kind of wrapping that up and having a big part of that in the second quarter. it's -- i think it's been a little bit more challenging environment. i think as the government has kind of elevated, kind of how they've handled the covid environment.
and it's not an opportune time to go back and run something like this, but it was already underway. but i think as a whole, i think we saw some reasonably good performance there and maybe a little bit different than what we've seen in past years. but -- so i think you'll go back and see a little bit of progress sequentially in the second quarter. and we're hoping to go back and get a little bit more visibility, doug, as far as what that situation is in china.
what we saw this time just it wasn't the same response from the government that we saw the first time we kind of went through the initial covid. and so we're adapting and responding to brent's point, i think the team has done a great job. i think we have new -- some new digital assets in the studio in-house that really allows us to kind of be pretty active in that environment. but i think the main reason you've seen some of the softening in our guidance is just from some of the unknowns we're seeing in that environment.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
and is it more impacting your ability to sell product or your ability to get products out to your customers?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
well, i think for a period of time, really toward the end of first quarter, we had a small bump in deferred revenue, i think, particularly in trying to go back and get products delivered to shanghai because of some of the lockdowns and shutdowns there. and so we've been able to date get products, manufactured products, but there has been some disruption in delivery relative to some of the positions the government had. we've been trying to find compliant productive ways to try to get product out, but we're definitely going back and staying in touch with the government as we do this just stay in good standing.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and just lastly, you mentioned in your previous call that you were planning to have an in-person event in china in the second half. have you made a call on that yet or you're still waiting and see on that?
brent neidig -- chief officer and managing director of china
yeah, doug, just given the uncertainty, we decided to change the event that we had. we initially planned for nanjing in september, and we've decided to go to a hybrid event. so as doug already mentioned, we have an in-house media studio, so we're going to leverage that asset and produce some high-quality content from the studio and plan on more small in-person gatherings throughout our branches and distributor workshops throughout the country. just i think given the current environment, i think it would be really unreasonable if we were able to actually pull an event off in person at that magnitude.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
got it. make sense. all right. thank you.
kevin guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
thanks, doug.
operator
[operator instructions] we will go next to linda bolton-weiser at d.a. davidson. linda, your line is open. please go ahead.
linda bolton-weiser -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
yes, hi. thank you. so i was just curious about the americas and europe region, which i think it was down about 3% in constant currency, and yet the u.s., i think, was up 5%. so i'm just kind of wondering, was the decline so big in the other parts of the region that, that offset the growth in the u.s.
or can you just give a little more color on that region? thanks.
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah, thanks, linda. yeah, the primary catalyst there is we saw modest softening in canada, which is a great market for us. but i think the bigger challenge we had is in our mexico market. and mexico has had some competitive issues and some kind of going through some stuff.
and so we've been actively supporting them, and i think we're optimistic. but yes, year over year, mexico was a tougher performance quarter for them.
linda bolton-weiser -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
ok. and then i know when you had reported and talked about the fourth quarter results, you gave a little bit of sequential guidance for revenue. thinking in the same way now, i mean i'm kind of seeing that revenue has to be down sequentially in the second quarter from the first quarter. am i thinking of that correctly?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah. what we have -- and we typically don't do a great deal of talking on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but we're expecting to see some incremental progress. i don't think it's going to be dramatic, but we are expecting to go back and take some steps forward on kind of revenue performance in q2.
linda bolton-weiser -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
so you mean sequential revenue level in dollars?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
correct.
linda bolton-weiser -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
ok. ok. and then just i saw that you added like a small amount of debt to the balance sheet. is that just related to your cash repatriation or like what was the reason for that?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah. it's just timing. i think from time to time, we'll go on the line just as different things in our operations dictate. we did do a little bit of buyback activity in the first quarter, roughly $25 million.
and so it really is a matter of timing and some of that comes with capital or inventory buying or paying of annual bonuses. and so we'll float on that periodically. and sometimes it's in and out before the quarter is over and sometimes there's a small residual lay over, but that was really the nature of that.
linda bolton-weiser -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
ok. thank you very much. i appreciate it.
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
ok. thank you, linda.

kevin guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
thank you, andrew, and good morning, everyone. we appreciate you joining us to review our second quarter results. [audio gap] prerelease and our final earnings release for the second quarter yesterday. our operating performance during the second quarter was negatively impacted by covid-related lockdowns restrictions and other disruptions in several key markets.
these disruptions also had a negative effect on the regional sales programs we offered during the quarter. despite the short-term disruptions to our business, we remain confident in our business strategy and our prospects for future customer and sales growth. although we continue to prioritize the alignment of spending with sales performance in the near term, the health of our balance sheet and our generation of free cash flow will allow us to continue making the necessary investments to position usana for future growth. during the quarter, we made progress on our strategy in several areas, including the introduction and launch of enhancements to our associate onboarding program, which streamline the onboarding process, provide associates with additional tools to set up and operate their business.
we believe this will help support and increase our associate base over the long term. additionally, our digital strategy remains a primary focus for our team moving forward. we look forward to celebrating our 30th anniversary at our upcoming global convention in salt lake city in a few weeks. this will be a hybrid event with an expected in-person attendance of approximately 4,000 associates and tens of thousands participating virtually.
we also have selected events and modest promotional activities planned in conjunction with the celebration to help generate the excitement surrounding this event. in closing, we remain confident in the strategies we are pursuing for the long term health of our business and in our overall long-term growth potential in our markets globally. with that, i'll now ask the operator to please open the lines for questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] and we'll go first to stephanie wissink with jefferies.
chris neamonitis -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, everyone. it's chris neamonitis on for steph. thanks for taking the questions. the first one i have, can you maybe help us understand a little bit better the diverging performance between preferred customers, which really seem to be kind of holding up versus the associates accounts, which are turning down.
is there something maybe structural we should be thinking about or what kind of color can you offer to kind of reconcile those two pieces? and then can you remind us again, is there conversion potential from preferred customers to associates? and if so, what does that typically look like?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
chris, this is doug. and i'll let kevin and jim jump on and kind of give you a kind of big picture narrative if i missed something here. but we over the last several years have really leaned into making preferred customers a priority. we've had several structural things that we've done.
we've been testing programs in the americas and europe region in particular, tested a program that really was scheduled to end in march. we bumped it out a couple months and that's why you see a little bit of sequential change in americas and europe on pc from q1 to q2. but it really is from the strategies and what we've been focusing on and how we've been really approaching the business as far as building that preferred customer base in the mix of customers. the second part is there an opportunity for transition or movement from becoming an associate if you're a preferred customer.
that opportunity is available. it doesn't happen as much as you think. but i think some of our best associates are those that are really passionate and believe -- heavy belief in the products. and a lot of that starts with the consumption of the products.
so i think that does happen. it just is not a real high clip right now.
kevin guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
i just wanted to answer your question. you asked about the possibility of preferred customers becoming associates. yes, they can. they can elect if they want to become an associate and sell the products.
and we actually hope that would be a great transition because they will have had an experience with the products and we'll be able to sell them more effectively. i don't have off the top of my head the conversion rate from our preferred customers to associates. doug, i don't know if you --
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
it's been low to date. but i think the ones that have made the move, i think really provide -- proved to be really successful associates because they're understanding belief in the product.
kevin guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
and i just want to add a little color on this. we, being 30 years old, we have really done some data mining and some research and looked out. we really have an excellent or have had historically an excellent distributor experience, meaning someone who's selling and building a business and earning income as they share our product experience. our focus has been recently over the last probably 18 months at least a customer experience.
and how do we interact and deal with customers? because we feel that one of our main competitors is the experience they expect to receive when they come and interact with our company. and if that experience isn't seamless, they'll go somewhere else. that's why our digital strategy is so critical to the growth of the company, because it has to be a seamless experience for someone who simply just wants to take our products. so you can see that the increase in our customer account is being part of the success of that overall strategy as we grow the business.
and at the end of the day, we really care about people utilizing our products every day. and so it's just an expansion of our overall strategy.
chris neamonitis -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. that's super helpful color. and maybe just as a follow up to all of that, could you give us any color on the trends you're seeing, especially kind of in the context of your -- the enhanced onboarding program? any trends on new associates coming into the business?
kevin guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
well, this is kevin again. it's too early to tell at this point. we just barely are releasing the first versions of our onboarding program. but one of the key objectives to the onboarding is our retention and customer connection.
and one -- another key focus of our overall high level strategy is connecting, especially in these covid days, we've not had the opportunity to connect as we normally would on a personal basis. and so this whole customer connection and interaction and touch points as they go throughout their journey is becoming more and more critical. and our onboarding process is just a heightened level of connection and interaction as our associates move through their journey of building a business.
chris neamonitis -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. and then you touched on covid briefly there, which kind of segues into my next question. but as we look across your markets, obviously, you have these covid-related disruptions softening the top line. but i'm surprised the performance in greater china actually improved sequentially, especially given kind of all of the headlines related to restrictions.
so why did the market, like china, performed better on a sequential basis than others, which i would assume would be less restrictive? but perhaps i'm not.
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
well, i think you're exactly right. it is -- it's more restrictive in china than what we see in the other markets. and really the catalyst for why you saw sequential improvements is for the last three years, we've run this kind of sales program that we've been testing and evaluating and tweaking and adjusting. and china moved up their plans from running that later in the year to the second quarter.
and that's why you saw an improvement from q1 to q2. and as we noted in our comments in our release, i think we're generally disappointed across most of our markets with how that program performed. but i think we're committed to going back and making structural changes that create sustainable growth traction and not trying to go back and just get something that pops short term and do this other stuff. so i think the changes that but no changes that we've made are there.
but i think the environmental factors with covid, the drag on the economy, consumers having to go back and select out and just making some tough choices, how they're going to pursue things. it creates a challenging environment. and china still continues to go in and out of lockdowns, maybe on a lesser scale than what they've had in the not-too-distant past. but i think some of the investments that brent neidig, who oversees our market there and his team have made, i think are really going to pay dividends going forward, really related to what kevin said on the digital strategy.
kevin guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yeah, and just a little more color, a lot -- just from speaking for myself, i tend to look through the lens of the united states as i think about how we're moving forward but really we are a global business. and if you take markets like the philippines, where they're completely shut down, but most all of their business is dependent upon will call and working in an office environment versus here in the united states, we get things shipped, when covid restrictions are in place, that has a huge negative impact just on people receiving products, doing businesses interacting. and we see that in malaysia and other markets in asia where we're really strong. and so the person to person side of things is it has a bigger impact for us outside of the united states just because of how they inherently do business.
chris neamonitis -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. that's great. and then last question before i hand it off, maybe just on the purchases that are being made, are you noticing anything different in terms of average basket size? or should we be thinking about the -- maybe the softer top line number primarily driven by the overall number of transactions, so maybe any color there?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think long term, i think the simple answer, we're not seeing anything that's definitive enough. i mean, we're a little bit off on the average spend this quarter. i think some of that can be tethered to the promotional activity and what happens during those cycles.
but as a whole, we've seen that trend pretty close within a relevant range and really not be that meaningfully different.
chris neamonitis -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you.
kevin guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yeah, thank you.
operator
we'll go next to doug lane with lane research.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
yes. hi. good morning, everybody. staying on -- well, looking at the second half here, if i understand what went on in the second quarter, the bump in china sequentially, particularly with the preferred customers, was a little bit more promotionally related.
so we should probably see that settle back to where it was in the first quarter and fourth quarter looking into the second half of the year.
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah, we would expect that just from the nature of how we count the active customers. we'd expect to see a little bit softening in the customer numbers. i think we have a lot of really important things going on in that market, but i think just relative to how that calculation takes place, yeah, that's accurate, doug.
kevin guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
and doug, this is kevin. i just want to remind everyone, our -- especially as we're coming out of unprecedented times, that we're really playing the long-term game here. and we've done some of these promotional activities to try and maintain and keep an excitement level in a marketplace where we normally can't traditionally do our business as we would, but we feel like in the second half of the year and as we move more into a normal pace of business that continue to pursue those promotional activities, is it necessarily in the best interests of the long-term health of the company as we move forward? and so we're choosing this route for the long-term betterment of the company from a strategic perspective, as we've stated in our documents going forward. and so again, we're kind of switching up our mode of business activity on purpose because of the changing environment as we look at the long-term health of the company.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
ok. i mean, that makes sense. and yeah, i mean, i get what you're doing there. and again, sticking with thinking through the impact of the macroenvironment today, and particularly with covid, i maybe like others, expected a lot worse results in china and maybe not as bad results in southeast asian pacific, which continues to be quite weak.
so am i reading is right that the actually the impact from covid is more disruptive to your southeast asian pacific business than it really was to china at the end of the day? meaning that if we ever do come out of this pandemic, that the bigger bounce will be in southeast asia pacific versus china?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
well, i would say that china had been a market that's been impacted just because of the strict lockdowns. i think china has a better ability infrastructurally to go back and handle some of the stuff going on. the philippines, which has been an incredible market for us, has had a tough time with density of population, availability of services and stuff. and to what kevin said, they were so accustomed to doing business in an in-person environment.
it's a really dramatic change for that market. and if we do get freed up there, i think that is additive to that market as well. kevin?
kevin guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yeah. and just one thing -- and brent, you might want to talk to this. it's a credit to our team in china being creative in getting our products in a very, very locked down, difficult environment and finding different ways to get our products out to our people, which we didn't even have that opportunity in some markets. but in china, our on the ground team really, really performed.
i don't know, brent, if you want to just give some color to that situation to help doug kind of understand the dynamics a little bit.
brent neidig -- chief officer and managing director of china
sure. yeah. in china, i think the -- doug mentioned already, the infrastructure was slightly different than what we see in the philippines or southeast asia. there's been a higher preference of people being willing to switch to a virtual environment.
and just logistically, it's easier for us to distribute our products throughout the country than some of those other markets. but the lockdowns that we experienced throughout china in the second quarter and first quarter specifically really disrupted that ability to deliver that product. and so we had to get very creative through our distribution network to switch 3pls, to switch shippers, final mile distributors, in order to get that product to our customers. and our ability to adjust quickly on the fly the way that we did allowed us to continue to recognize revenue throughout the quarter.
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah, i would also add on that brent -- sorry. i'll also add on that brent's made some investments in the market in studios to allow us to manage content and reach that audience in kind of a higher velocity way and more responsive to even before covid kind of came into play for everybody around the world. china had a really high percentage of their sales that were already happening in a non in-person environment. and so they were set up and people were accustomed to doing business like that.
but yeah, there's a few key markets in southeast asia that we've now had a couple of tough quarters here. but i think we see the individuals there and we have confidence and i think from a build standpoint going forward, back to your original question, doug. yeah, i think there's an opportunity to go back and see that if we can go back and get a little bit more of a stable environment, start track in a good way. and we're really confident with the staff there.
kevin guest -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
and also, doug, walter, our chief operations officer, who's here today, was just in the philippines, and maybe i'll give you a kind of some color on what you experienced there, walter just being on the ground recently in the philippines and what you're seeing there and what you're seeing for the future.
walter noot -- chief operating officer
well, in the philippines, they've had -- because of really lockdowns and because everybody's still wearing masks and you still got to have -- basically you have to have vaccination passports in any building. and so people haven't been having a lot of in-person meetings. in fact, when i was there, they were the -- some of the first in-person meetings that they were starting to have with our distributors, with teams out there. and the other part was the pickup center that we have there.
we have several pickup centers, and they've been empty. we -- our volume has gone down over the last -- during the covid period, the volume in the pickup centers went down to almost nothing, where nobody was showing up. and that's where they spent a lot of their time interacting and meeting with each other. and so that's starting to open back up again.
but it's a cultural change that people have to go through. they have to feel comfortable getting out. they have to feel comfortable meeting in person again. and those things are gradual changes that they're going through right now.
so i think this -- just like you said, doug, i think you mentioned that there should be some growth there. and i believe that that's going to happen in those markets. you're going to see more interaction, personal interaction. and in the near future, i think we're going to start seeing some better activity there.
doug lane -- lane research -- analyst
ok. that's good color. thank you.

[operator instructions] we'll go next to linda bolton-weiser with d.a. davidson.
linda bolton-weiser -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hi. so the u.s. market was a little bit weaker than, i guess, i had modeled. can you give us a little bit of color about what's going on in the u.s.?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
i think some of it, for the quarter, a little bit of timing on the comparisons. we kind of transitioned out from one campaign that we run in the first part that we see some real potential from a structural and structural opportunity there going forward. i think sequentially, that was kind of the biggest narrative that we saw with the u.s. the u.s.
did not run their sales program in the second quarter. and so they have a really tough comp year over year with that. and we just generally saw more success last year in the program that we ran.
linda bolton-weiser -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
do you plan some promotional program in the second half?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
but on a local market basis, absolutely. we'll have things that engage our consumers and products and experiences and the other stuff, but it's just not going to be the magnitude of what we've done historically. and i think that was kevin's narrative really here. focus in the long term and making sure that we're doing something that's additive on a sustainable basis.
and we've learned quite a bit through doing some of these sales programs and we'll adjust accordingly. but you'll see local market activity for sure. you will probably not see something of magnitude for the company as a whole that's meaningful from a big thing. we do have our 30th year convention coming up and there'll be some activities and events and promotional campaign surrounding that to build the excitement.
but that's really kind of the biggest stuff we have in the back half of the year from a promotional standpoint that reaches across all markets.
linda bolton-weiser -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
and can you remind me, like in like the u.s., like what percentage of your sales are kind of done like on a subscription basis where the customer is accepting product kind of every month? what percentage?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah, mid to high 50% off the top of my head. i don't i don't have the number in front of me, but i think we're probably high 50% of our sales are happening on subscription business.
linda bolton-weiser -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
ok. and then how recession resistant do you think your business will be if we do see this consumer weakening going on?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think we'll see. i mean, i think this is a new environment for all of us. the story had been historically, when you see a little bit of pressure on the economy, we see a little bit more activity in our channel. i think it's just a totally different environment than what we've experienced, and we're actively reaching out.
we're actively soliciting the opinions and feedback of customers and we're taking these things. we're reacting in a pretty short period of time. and so so time will tell there. i think i think people are more health aware and more health conscious than they've ever been.
and i think we have products that can go back and help them go back and take a little bit better charge of kind of their well-being going forward. so that's -- i think that's a big opportunity that we have. and we have to continue to go back and work to go back and communicate and really be front of mind for the consumers out there.
linda bolton-weiser -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
ok. and then i noticed it was good that your inventory did come down. it was down year over year and down sequentially, which is good to see. do you expect that decrease to continue in the second half like well, do you think third quarter inventory will be down again sequentially?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
i think we'll see a little bit of -- and walt, you can jump in here, but i would expect to see it go down a little bit, not the same change you saw from q1 to q2. i think we made a very intentional choice to make sure that we had inventory to go back and market and sell to our customers. and as we've seen, demand trying to do this other stuff, same thing with our expense management, that team has been actively trying to go back and align those inventory levels with the performance that we have now and things that we have on the horizon.
walter noot -- chief operating officer
yeah. so that was very intentional, what we did. middle of last year, we started building up inventory intentionally because we saw shipping and we saw covid-related issues coming up worldwide. so we built up more finished goods out in our markets.
we doubled the amount of raw materials we had because we were concerned about supply chain. that actually saved us during that whole period. and then we've slowly been building -- bringing back that back down. we're going to keep bringing that down throughout the year a little bit unless we start seeing more disruptions in supply chain and then we're going to build back up again.
it's worth having inventory.
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah, the other aspect that we do from an operational standpoint is we have a real core competency at making our own products. and i think that's been a huge benefit in this environment. it allows us to respond a little bit quicker with taking out one more player in that supply chain process. and so we see that as a definitive advantage as we've gone through this as well.
walter noot -- chief operating officer
our biggest challenge is still shipping. it's still transport across the ocean. so if we make it in salt lake and it ships to south east asia or somewhere else, that's still a challenge for us. and that's the reason inventories are still, generally a little bit high.
that's been very intentional.
linda bolton-weiser -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
ok. and i was just curious, do you have an operating cash flow number for the first half or the quarter?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah, we did. let me pull it up. we did about 15 million in operating cash flow in q2 and i can pull you up year to date. i think what we're generally expecting for the year is something the -- 100 million to 105 million range.
linda bolton-weiser -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
ok. thank you. and then it didn't look to me like your sg&a expense was, like, a little lower than we had expected. and you kind of alluded to taking some actions to adjust the business to the conditions.
can you just talk about what cost reduction actions you're taking?
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think in the immediate short term, most of what we've seen are things that vary from a variable perspective, or things that are more performance based, that relate to our operational execution and just the environment, how we're generating operating margin. we still have work to do and in it usually takes several quarters. i think we're just being very intentional in prioritizing the business, really what kevin said, what's -- what we think is best for the long-term benefit and growth of the customers and individuals and families consuming our products.
and that's what's going to get prioritized. but we do feel need to go back and be more agile and have resources kind of put to those things that are going to be a catalyst to really kind of executing on that vision and mission of the company.
linda bolton-weiser -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
ok. that's it for me. thank you very much.
doug hekking -- chief financial officer
thank you, linda.
