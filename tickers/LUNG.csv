thank you, sir. [operator instructions] our first question is from the line of bob hopkins with bank of america. your line is open.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks, and good afternoon. so i'm sure a lot of people would be interested in hearing how things went over the course of the quarter and kind of what you're seeing early in april, especially given the comments you made on the last call about expectations for march. so any color on kind of how you ended the quarter and what we're seeing in april, i think, would be really helpful. so thank you.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
sure, bob. the quarter ended as we sort of suggested it might. as you will recall, the last week of february was quite strong. we had our last call at the beginning of march, and we had visibility to a couple weeks of a pretty solid scheduling.
march ended up being a very solid month for us. that was really encouraging. we've seen this sort of shape before, if you will. we've twice before kind of bounced out of things here in the u.s., most particularly in july of 2020 and october of 2020, as well.
so as we were coming out of march, typically what happens is you have this massive acceleration going into that key month, and then you have a little bit of a lag in the following month. and i'm not going to get into specifics on april, but the magnitude of the drop-off in the month that follows that surge month is usually pretty significant. it was in the last two times we've pulled out. this time, however, as we, frankly, had anticipated, april continued as a very strong month.
so in contrast to prior periods, april was strong and march, like in those prior periods, probably contained some sort of pent-up demand which normally softens the following month, but that did not present itself in april.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. so it sounds like april then was better than march and that march was probably at least 40% of the quarter. is that fair directionally?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
i would say that, directionally, the magnitude of the better is not 40%, but it is stronger in april. and typically, the month after that surge month would be down. i mean, in the prior two situations, it was down 25% month over month, and april is stronger. we moved across april stronger than we did in march.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. no. appreciate that. but previously, you talked about percentage of accounts that were active, and so i'm curious as to where we are now on that front in the u.s.
and then, lastly, i was wondering if you could just give us a comment on europe. are things kind of getting worse there, slowly getting better there or stable there? just kind of where are we in europe right now? and where are we in terms of the u.s. in terms of percentage of accounts that are active?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. well, the first part of your question is a much simpler question than the second part of your question, because europe is so heterogeneous, but i'll try to be concise on the second part. the first part, in terms of active accounts, as you certainly imagine, it's strengthening. we talked specifically sort of on a month-by-month basis in the last call, and we said we're going to do that on a one-time basis, so let me reorient you to sort of quarterly expectations.
so an active account is one that orders during that period. and in the pre-covid phase, on a quarterly basis, about 90% of our accounts were active in any given quarter. so when we look across the first quarter of this year, we were quite a bit short of that. less than 70% of our accounts were active.
but you might recall, the numbers that we talked about, that was 32% and kind of low 30s to mid-30s in january and february. so you can imagine we did strengthen quite a bit in march, and we continued to see that strength into april. so we would expect that the second quarter will step up off of that 68% on a quarterly basis in terms of active accounts. so it was good news there.
with regard to europe, yeah, it's a great question, and it's a little bit complicated. obviously, europe got hit by a wave of covid that we did not get hit by here. and our rate limiter is icu capacity. so if you think about the way that wave builds, there's about a four- to eight-week delay on clearing the icu beds so that you can sort of start doing the procedures again, because most accounts anywhere in the world have an issue with executing these procedures without sort of the appropriate number of beds.
and we've just peaked in europe in terms of sort of the incidence of covid in various different markets. it's different in different markets, and this is where it gets complicated. obviously, in the u.k., the shape of that curve looks very much like the u.s. curve because they got vaccines out quickly.
so that was sort of in early january getting on the other side of things and on the down slope. and of course, as you look across, italy is sort of in the next cohort. by mid-march, they were basically on the back side of the covid curve. and then france was the next, about two weeks later, as of about april 1, they got on the backside of that curve.
but again, they've got a at least a four- to eight-week lag to clear the icu beds. so when we look at europe right now, we see ourselves as really pulling out in the third and fourth quarter whereas, in the u.s., we see the second quarter as sort of the commencement of the pullout. so we got quarters two, three and four in the u.s. where i think you should expect sequential sort of acceleration or growth.
and i think in europe, we're probably going to be large -- i wouldn't expect to see that in the second quarter, but would in the third and fourth.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. very helpful. thank you.

the next question is from the line of marissa bych with morgan stanley. your line is open.
marissa bych -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. this is marissa from morgan stanley. can you hear me?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
marissa bych -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. great. well, thanks so much for taking the question. can you comment any further on the volume of stratx scans that you're seeing today relative to maybe february and march? and then, you touched on this, but are valve placements today associated more with patients from the backlog, to your point about pent-up demand, or patients who have had the scan more recently? thank you.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
great question. so i think the simplest answer to your question on stratx is that the scans are up and they're looking strong as we look ahead. so that's good news. as far as pent-up demand, typically, it's a little bit hard to tease this out, but our clear sense having, like i said, gone through this at least a couple times last year and going through it now, we expect that most of our pent-up demand was realized in march.
and so that's one of the reasons why we're particularly encouraged by sort of the shape of things in april because we think we cleared a lot of that. so we are in, i think, good shape from a stratx perspective as it relates to sort of forward-looking procedures that we're anticipating.
marissa bych -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. great. thank you.

the next question is from the line of larry biegeslen with wells fargo. your line is open.
unknown speaker -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for taking the question. this is kevin on for larry today. my question is, as we think about modeling q2, in the u.s., is march or even the april run rate the right way to think about q2? and then given the headwinds you're experiencing ous in q2, how should we think about that? should we think about that as stepping down from q1? and i just have one follow-up.
thank you.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
i think i'm going to pull -- derrick's the expert modeler here, so i'm going to pull him into this conversation. but i will tell you that it was an interesting thing we had sort of going into the quarter. you may remember, i think if you were to review the transcript, we were anticipating that europe would end up being stronger than the u.s. coming out of the first quarter, and we had thought that that was going to be fairly significant.
and in fact, it wasn't. and the reason for that is that the u.s. got a lot stronger. and europe didn't necessarily get a lot weaker, but it just sort of stayed kind of where it was.
so the ratios have changed a little bit, and i think the mix will be a little different than we had anticipated in the second quarter. but i think that the net numbers will probably be in the same range. but i'll let derrick get into more specifics around maybe ways to think about modeling.
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
yeah. so i think that separating them out between ous and u.s. is a good way to look at it. and so, in the u.s., i would expect to see, as glen had mentioned, a sequential increase starting in the second quarter and sort of gradually moving up sequentially by quarter through the remainder of the year.
there likely was a bit of pent-up demand in march. but again, as glen mentioned, we saw april come in very strong. so i do think that looking at that and running that forward is kind of the right way to look at at least the second quarter for the u.s. outside the u.s., there's just a lot of uncertainty that remains in this second quarter.
so i don't think that we would expect to see a sequential step-up in the second quarter. again, it all really depends upon how the recovery plays out, particularly across europe. but we would remain cautious in the second quarter and then expect that we see kind of a full global recovery in the european regions, as well, in the back half of the year and start to see a sequential increase from there.
unknown speaker -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thank you. that's super helpful. on the aeriseal comments on the call, i assume you would need two trials, one for sealing the fissures, then doing zephyr, and then one for stand-alone. the question is are you still planning to submit the ide in the u.s.
later this year for either? and with the new applications, what is the best case, base case scenario on u.s. approval for each, in your view?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we're in the midst of -- we're deep into this process right now. we're evaluating the convert protocol, which is the one that we're doing in europe, primarily in europe, which is the sort of sealing of the fissure, if you will, to enable us to do more zephyr valve treatments. that's a very intriguing approach.
it's a fairly straight line for us because it allows us to basically take patients that are cv positive, make them cv negative, and then use valves in those patients. but we need to get the data back from that trial and then put together a package to move forward. so you are correct. there's some additional studies that are out ahead of us.
as it relates to the stand-alone treatment, which i referenced, which we're talking to fda about, i think what specifically we end up needing to deliver from a biocompatibility perspective is likely to impact that timeline. so i think we commence clinical research in the united states next year i think on both of those programs. and i would say that we're quite -- 2025 to get into the u.s. marketplace sort of time line.
unknown speaker -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thank you.
operator
the next question is from the line of rick wise with stifel. your line is open.
rick wise -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
good afternoon, glen. hi, derrick. glen, maybe just expanding further on your comments about opening accounts, opening new accounts, but maybe first talk about, as covid cases subside, as doctors are back on sort of everyday duty, so to speak, are you seeing that happen? or is this process of covid-fading and docs returning to sort of life, hopefully, gradually as normal? are you having more opportunity to train doctors? what kind of trends are you seeing on that aspect of the story?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
well, we're definitely in the united states seeing subsiding. and again, our target physicians around the world are primarily pulmonary and critical care specialists. so when covid is hot and the icus are filled, they're in there focused on that. and that's why we're actually quite impressed by our performance in europe, given the magnitude of the wave that's hit them.
this situation, and i'll talk about the united states as it relates to what follows, has created a truly sort of transformative opportunity for us as it relates to getting face-to-face and gathering physicians together and respiratory therapists and clinical coordinators and so forth, because these zoom calls are just so easy to do relative to pulling people into a ballroom or into a restaurant or something like that. so from a training perspective, i think we are training or interacting, getting treating physicians with referring physicians and the like, much more than we did in the pre-covid phase, and we expect to continue to push forward on that front.
rick wise -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. and you talked about reimbursement, and i totally take your point about the reimbursements aren't necessarily a headwind, but make it easier if you get them in the positive place. are there any critical opportunities to make progress on that front coming up?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so the only real big sort of gorilla in this space that's left is blue cross/blue shield. so we're really focused on trying to move them. and the way that we have been moving them, as we announced, we just got blue cross/blue shield of massachusetts, which goes effective on june 1.
last month, or last call, we announced other situations that rolled positive for us. so we're chipping away at it. and so that works well for us, because the average time it takes; just to put things into perspective, keep in mind, again, 75% of our patients are medicare patients, and 25% are sort of pure commercial patients. of those medicare patients, a third of them, or 25% of the whole, are managed medicare.
so they get fronted by one of the private payers. and so when we go out and seek preauthorization, we don't have to seek it for medicare patients. and there's no problem there. the managed medicare, 98% of the time we're seeking preauthorization, we get it.
the commercial payers, when we seek just across all commercial payers, again, that's 25% of our business, we get pre-authorization 97% of the time. and when you look across blue cross/blue shield affiliates, so this is an association that is negative on our technology, and yet we keep working with them. 95% of the time, we try to get a procedure preauthorized, we are successful in doing so. so the issue is not whether we can win when we go toe-to-toe.
it's the appeal process and so forth. so if somebody is positive, we go to a commercial payer that's positive, we can turn that in two weeks. if we go to blue cross/blue shield, it might be 90 days. and so these patients are critically ill.
it's a taxing process, and we want to try to simplify that and shorten that and make it easier for the patients. so we're working very hard. and i would say that every blue cross/blue shield plan that we flip over underneath that umbrella is a positive. and so that's why we celebrate those in particular.
rick wise -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
gotcha. just one more from me on the opening new accounts. in the fourth quarter, you opened up 13 new u.s. centers.
you opened up close to a similar amount in the first quarter. how do we think about the cadence of new account openings, going forward? again, as covid faded, as you expand your management and sales team generally, should we expect that pace of account openings to accelerate? thank you.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think in terms of the first half of the year versus the second half of the year, we anticipate that that's going to go up about 50%. i mean, we have said that we think that to do about 10 new accounts per quarter is what we anticipate in the first half of this year, so we did 12. i think we did 12.
i know you just said 13, but i think it's 12. so we're 20% more, or two more, i guess, depending on how you look at it. so we're in that ballpark. there's a lot of headwinds and things.
we imagine those will abate a little bit, but we're in that neighborhood. and then, we would expect to be at 15 per quarter. so we were targeting this year about 50, so that'd be 10 plus 10 plus 15 plus 15. and that's what we continue to project, and we'll do our best to opportunistically beat those numbers.
but i think it's super important. i mean, if we wanted to get 100 accounts up in the next whatever, we probably could. but it's super important that we pick the right places, we get them deeply engaged, we train them impeccably, and we build this foundation the right way. and so this is not a speed game for us.
rick wise -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
makes sense. thanks so much.
operator
the next question is from the line of bill plovanic with canaccord. your line is open.
unknown speaker -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hi, glen and derrick. this is john on for bill tonight. thanks for taking our questions. i first want to get some color on the accounts that are still not active.
i know you mentioned about 70% are active. and i know, pre-covid, that was around 90%. so how do you get to 90%? is this just hospitals reserving icu bed capacity still?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
so there's a restarting process, and so we've initiated that with a number of hospitals. i don't know if i did earlier in this call, but obviously, in the last call, we talked about i think 32% and 33% of our hospitals were active in january and february. that number actually changed. it's 36%, so it got a little bit more positive in february.
but in any case, it was 58% in march. so we're moving in a very nice and positive direction. and april will be in the same ballpark. and if you throw up 60% per month across the quarter, just to give you a sense, in the pre-covid phase, if you looked at it on a monthly basis, we'd have about 70% of accounts active in any given month.
and if you looked at it on a quarterly basis, we'd be at about 90%. so we finished the first quarter at 68%. we see that strengthening in the second quarter. and it's just getting people back and moving and getting the pipeline sort of flowing toward treatment.
it all gets initiated. typically, when these covid walls presented themselves, i mean, it's like somebody throwing a switch in most of the hospitals around the world. in some cases, it was done on a state basis. in other cases, it was done on a national basis, where they just shut down, like literally, one day, we're not doing anymore.
and so to get it restarted, typically, the restart happens with patients that were already scheduled at the time they threw the switch off. and so those are the folks that they prime the pump and get things going, and we tried to get those scheduled as early as we could, and we have seen some number of those happen in march, a smaller number of those happening in april, and then sort of organic growth in that april timeframe, as well. our biggest, strongest, most active accounts are the ones that typically come back first, and the other ones will follow.
unknown speaker -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. thanks for that color. and then i just want to turn to the convert trial. could you provide us some update on enrollment in the trial itself in europe?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think we last spoke 60 days ago, and i don't think we had enrolled anybody. maybe we had. we're a few patients in.
it's a heck of a time to be enrolling patients in a clinical trial. you think therapeutic. we're down low on the list of things in the midst of the covid craze. so i'm quite happy with where we sit right now.
and we have a lot of patients that are lining up, and we would expect that this will be accelerating in the not-too-distant future. this is something that, as an organization, we're super-proud of a lot of the things that we do, but we have a clinical and regulatory group that's got a great track record, one of the most, i think, arguably the most successful in the entire interventional pulmonology space, and they're going to get this thing moving as soon as it's possible. and the other area that we're particularly proud of is our global commercial footprint, which i think is unmatched by any other company in the interventional pulmonology space, at least on the therapeutic side of the equation. and that group is chomping at the bit.
so they're anxious for us to keep pushing things forward, and as are we. so we're pushing hard on that front, get those things going.
unknown speaker -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. thanks, glen.
operator
the next question is from the line of joanne wuensch with citibank. your line is open.
joanne wuensch -- citi -- analyst
good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. i'm curious about how physicians and centers move through the process of being opened, as you put it, or trained for physicians, and what their motivation is as to start scheduling patients as the covid pandemic eases.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
are you talking about new physicians, or physicians that are sort of restarting, if you will?
joanne wuensch -- citi -- analyst
actually, i'd like both.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. well, the restarting ones, they normally have some number of patients that were previously scheduled that are chirping in their ear, saying when am i going to be my treatment. patients are super-interested. i don't know if you've look on our website, or on youtube or whatever.
these patients are really fired up. and the changes that are being delivered when everything lines up, the magnitude of benefit is really life-changing. and as a consequence, i think the newer physicians see this as something they want to be a part of. and i think it's super-important to acknowledge, and we hear it from our physicians, and sometimes they tear up, to be perfectly frank with you, because pulmonologists and interventional pulmonologists in particular, when they're doing procedures prior to this treatment, it was almost always in lung cancer patients.
and they were almost always trying to beat back encroaching tumors to try to keep the airways open and allow the patient to breathe. and invariably, they're just kind delivering bad news. that's a cancer that -- i don't know what the odds are, but it's something like 95% chance, you're not going to be around in five years if you get lung cancer. so they're doing what they can.
and so they really like the fact that they can take somebody and turn back the clock when everything lines up and have somebody come in and say, hey, you change my life. this is incredible. thank you. so i think there is an emotional side to this thing for the physicians, because they just don't do anything else that's anything like this.
joanne wuensch -- citi -- analyst
and for the new physicians?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i'm sorry. that's what i was talking about. i think that's what the draw is.
i think the thing that's driving the existing people is probably getting that good feeling again, but also the people chirping their ears. and the people who are coming on board are saying this is new, this is important. the data are compelling. we can't get these kinds of magnitudes of changes with drugs.
i don't do surgery, and surgery is way more invasive. i've got to be doing this. and they want to try to help the patients.
joanne wuensch -- citi -- analyst
thanks very much.
operator
the last question is from the line of jason bednar with piper sandler. your line is open.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. glen, i wanted to come back to the discussion of pent-up demand. i guess, one, really good to hear the band's been strong here from march into april.
but why wouldn't there be even more pent-up demand that comes through these next few months? i mean, i guess why would a single good month of demand be enough to clear a bulk of that patient backlog that's built up there, especially with all those accounts that haven't backed the last three to six months?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. well, like i said, the first few patients that start out of the blocks are typically patients that are being rescheduled. and as i said before, and i'm generalizing, but the first centers that tend to come back online are our biggest and strongest centers. so you add those two things together and say, well, if the first movers in terms of coming back online happen to also maybe have the longest string of patients that they're going to bring with them to reschedule, then it makes sense to me anyway.
and we've certainly seen it historically, where a good bit of that pent-up demand has presented itself, and we saw a huge amount in july and october of last year, and we think that we saw a good chunk of it in march. that's not to say that it's all there. it's very difficult to tease this all out, but you might see 50% of it in march and 25% of it in april, and the rest of it is spread across a couple of months, something on that order. so that's kind of where we are and why it happens.
and you can see where this wave happens. so, for example, going into this really strong month, i'd mentioned july of last year, we had something like 150% increase from june to july. so you see this wave just build very abruptly, and it's helped by that pent-up demand. and then, it was followed by a 27% decline the following months.
and going into october, there was another big 50% to 100% kind of bolus that comes through, and it softened in the next month. and it's because you've got that covid backdrop. and i think that blanket to a large extent, although not fully in the united states, probably not fully until the back half of the year, but has primarily been pulled off the united states. and as a consequence, i think we saw this real demand that was underneath that coming through in april, because it didn't go down.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. that's extremely helpful. thank you for all that. and then, maybe just shifting gears a little bit, it looks like there's another study here that's posted, and maybe it should begin soon, or maybe it already has, that's separate from aeriseal.
it looks like you're collaborating on it with an academic center, but it's looking at a different interventional approach to achieve fissure completion followed by placement of zephyr. i don't think you've elaborated here today, but could you here just talk about what that city looks like? and then, what's the right way to think about that study strategically relative to aeriseal?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
i would call that sort of -- it's a small study. it's called cove. it's using laparoscopic techniques to complete the fissure. i believe that's what you're talking about.
it's a study that's being done in australia. i view that as more of a scientific proof-of-concept, sort of. we have a history. if you look at the zephyr valve, we have four randomized controlled trials, all of which hit on all three of the endpoints, and each of those studies builds on each other.
and so we have a tradition among the people that are here, many of them have worked together for decades, where we really try to build a very, very solid foundation. and so, as we moved into the convert study, which is using aeriseal to complete the fissure, we wanted to make sure that the whole scientific package held together. so we had a proposal that was presented to us that we supported as an investigator-sponsored study to complete the fissure laparoscopically, and then to put in valves. so i think that's the study that you're probably referring to that's ongoing.
it's a smaller study, very small study, feasibility, scientific proof kind of study.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
yeah, this does look like a smaller study. i think this one was out of boston, though, the complete 1 study. we can follow up offline. but -- ok.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
it's the same. well, it's slightly different, but it's similar. what i just said is really the same.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
yup. yeah. exactly. got it.
thank you very much.

good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the pulmonx q1 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, brian johnston, with gilmartin group. sir, you may begin.
brian johnston -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, operator. good afternoon, and thank you all for participating in today's call. joining me from pulmonx are glen french, president and chief executive officer; and derrick sung, chief financial officer. earlier today, pulmonx released financial results for the quarter ended march 31, 2021.

glen french -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, brian. good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the first-quarter 2021 earnings call. here with me today is derrick sung, our chief financial officer. today, i will share a few highlights from our first-quarter results and outlook for the remainder of the year before reviewing our progress relative to commercial execution and longer-term objectives.
overall, we've been pleased with our financial performance and the resilience of our business despite covid-related headwinds. in q1, we recorded worldwide sales of $9.2 million, buoyed by an acceleration of u.s. revenues in the final weeks of the quarter as covid hospitalizations dropped. outside the united states, we saw a modest recovery in the early part of the quarter stalled by another wave of lockdowns in many parts of europe, which represents the majority of our international business.
despite these regional variations, we remain optimistic that the global rollout of vaccines, covid will no longer be a significant impediment to our growth trajectory for the second half of the year. through the quarter, we also made substantial progress in expanding our commercial team and our base of treatment centers, saw growing momentum and indicators of demand for the zephyr valve treatments, and were successful in securing incremental payment coverage. these trends, along with our q1 performance, leave us more confident in our ability to deliver on our full-year 2021 revenue guidance despite continued near-term uncertainty relative to regional covid headwinds. as such, we now expect full-year 2021 revenue to be in the range of $48 million to $50 million, up from our prior guidance of $46 million to $50 million.
moving now to a review of each of the areas of progress. this quarter, we have meaningfully expanded our commercial infrastructure. in the u.s., we met our objective to expand our sales management team from six to nine regional directors while adding six new sales territories, bringing our total number of u.s. sales representatives to 51.
we continue to expect to end the year with 55 territories in the u.s. internationally, we expanded our sales management team in europe and intend to continue to expand our team selectively in key growth geographies. we continue to receive strong interest from prospective new treating centers eager to start using zephyr valves, another sign that the underlying clinical need and demand for our procedure remains strong. in the u.s., we added 12 new treating centers during the first quarter, bringing our total u.s.
treating centers to 160. we continue to target offering zephyr valves in at least 200 total treating centers in the u.s. by the end of the year. on the reimbursement front, we are gaining further traction with blue cross/blue shield plans, and we see a change to a positive policy for our zephyr valve procedure june 1, from blue cross blue shield of massachusetts, the largest health plan in the state, covering nearly 2 million lives.
while we do not see reimbursement as a significant barrier to adoption of our treatment, we continue to celebrate our policy wins, particularly removal of negative policies like this one, because these wins validate the clinical acceptance of our technology, reduce headwinds that patients may perceive in order to obtain access to the technology; and, most importantly, they reduced the time to pre-authorization approval and, therefore, time to treatment. turning to a key driver of future growth, you may recall that our zephyr valve treatment is designed to reduce hyperinflation among patients without collateral ventilation who have a complete separation of the targeted lobe with the adjacent lobe. for patients not currently eligible for valves due to collateral ventilation, we are developing a second therapy, aeriseal, which is a polymeric foam that is designed to be delivered via a bronchoscope to a targeted region of the lung. aeriseal received designation as a breakthrough device by the u.s.
food and drug administration in december of 2020, and we are currently exploring two potential applications of aeriseal to treat collateral ventilation-positive emphysema patients. the first application involves using aeriseal to essentially seal off the fissure gap that is responsible for generating the collateral ventilation, thus turning patients who are not zephyr valve candidates into those who are. we are currently in early stages of exploring this application of aeriseal in a multicenter international trial that recently began enrolling patients. we are also exploring aeriseal as a stand-alone treatment for emphysema patients with positive collateral ventilation in which aeriseal is delivered directly into the airways of the target region of the lung in order to achieve lung volume reduction.
for this stand-alone application, we are currently in active discussion with fda to determine necessary biocompatibility testing required to commence the trial in the united states. despite our progress with aeriseal to date, it is important to note that we are still in the early stages of development, developing our clinical and regulatory strategy before we determine how best to bring this product to market, and we remain several years away from commercializing this technology. finally, i'd like to highlight some recent additions that we have made to strengthen our senior management team. as announced earlier today, we are pleased to welcome michael ryan as vice president of corporate strategy and business development.
michael joins us from boston scientific, where he was vice president of business development, directing all business development and investment efforts across five of the company's seven business units. he's been deeply involved in the pulmonary space for more than a decade, led boston scientific's prior investments in pulmonx, and was an observer on the pulmonx board of directors for more than five years. we look forward to working with michael as he advances our vision for strategic growth. in addition, mahtab fatemi recently joined our team as vice president of regulatory affairs and quality assurance.
mahtab also brings deep experience in the pulmonary space, having spent nearly a decade developing interventional pulmonology technologies while working with nuvaira and broncus technologies. lastly, we are fortunate to have brought on david lehman as our general counsel. david brings nearly 20 years of public company medical device experience to his role, having previously served as general counsel for intersect ent and thoratec. with these management additions, the significant progress we've made in building our commercial team and footprint and the advancement of our development pipeline, we are better positioned for growth than ever before.
while covid remains a transient headwind, we remain confident in our outlook as we emerge from this pandemic and work toward establishing ourselves as the global leader and trusted partner in the assessment and treatment of severe lung disease. with that said, i'll now turn the call over to derrick to provide a more detailed review of our first-quarter results.
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
thank you, glen, and good afternoon, everyone. total worldwide revenue for the three months ended march 31, 2021, was $9.2 million, a 7% increase from $8.6 million in the same period of the prior year and an increase of 2% on a constant-currency basis. u.s. revenue in the first quarter was $4.3 million, a 5% decrease from $4.5 million during the prior-year period.
the decrease in u.s. revenue resulted from the winter covid surge impacting the ability of u.s. hospitals to schedule procedures during the first two months of the quarter. international revenue was $5 million, a 20% increase from $4.1 million during the same period last year.
on a constant-currency basis, international sales increased by 10%, driven by a relative recovery of procedures in select markets as compared to the start of the pandemic last year. gross margin for the first quarter of 2021 was 71.5%, compared to 65.6% in the prior-year period. the increase resulted primarily from an increase in overhead absorption as production output recovered from the temporary manufacturing slowdown at the start of the pandemic. for the remainder of 2021, we expect gross margin to be in the 71% to 72% range, increasing modestly toward the end of the year.
total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2021 were $18.6 million, a 59% increase from the $11.8 million in the first quarter of 2020. stock-based compensation expense was $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2021 and accounted for 32% of the increase in operating expenses from the prior-year period. we continue to expect stock-based compensation to account for about $9 million of our total operating expenses for the full-year 2021. r&d expenses for the first quarter of 2021 were $3 million, compared to $1.6 million in the same period of the prior year.
aside from stock-based compensation, the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel, clinical studies and product development-related expenses needed to support our product development and clinical research activities. sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2021 were $15.6 million, compared to $10.2 million in the first quarter of 2020. aside from stock-based compensation, the increase was primarily attributable to personnel-related expenses in sales and marketing as we expanded our commercial operations, as well as public company expenses related to the scaling of our general and administrative infrastructure. we continue to expect operating expenses for the full-year 2021 to be in the range of $85 million to $90 million as we build out our commercial operations, invest in our aeriseal clinical program and further scale our business.
net loss for the first quarter of 2021 was $12 million, or a loss of $0.34 per share as compared to a net loss of $7.2 million, or a loss of $3.76 per share for the same period of the prior year. an average weighted share count of 35.4 million shares was used to determine loss per share for the first quarter of 2021. we ended march 31, 2021, with $222 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. turning now to our revenue outlook.
we expect full-year 2021 revenue to be in the range of $48 million to $50 million, representing 47% to 53% revenue growth over 2020 and up from our prior range of $46 million to $50 million. this updated guidance reflects increased confidence in our ability to achieve the high end of our prior range, given our momentum in the u.s. as we exited the first quarter, tempered by our expectation of continued covid-related pressures in international geographies that seem likely to persist through the second quarter of this year. we expect continued strengthening of our business in the back half of the year as a global recovery fully takes hold.
with that, i'd like to thank you for your attention, and we will now open the call up for questions. operator?

[operator instructions]. your first question comes from the line of bob hopkins from bank of america. your line is now open.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
all right. great. thank you, and good afternoon. congrats on all the progress.
there's so much good stuff going on at the company. i almost hate to ask this question, but i feel obligated to just obviously around the current spread of covid in the united states, and how you went about incorporating that in your guidance in the back half? because obviously, you do need a nice acceleration, it seems from q2 to q3 to q4. so understanding that hopefully will be quite temporary, but what gives you confidence that you'll be able to see that acceleration in the back half, despite what's going on with the delta variant? thank you.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think we may split this answer up and derrick can talk about how we got integrated into our guidance, and i'll just talk about how we view covid in general. it's been quite a ride. and i think everybody on this call knows that we get impacted by covid in a fairly significant way, most particularly as that flows through to the icus.
and what we've seen over time is that hospitals become significantly better at managing these patients or i should just say, you sort of managing all the things that are out in front of us. and the first wave of the pandemic, everything got shut down and 100% of everyone's attention was on covid. and i think that we've demonstrated even through the last really big wave that hit that these hospitals are able to manage it. also, what we see is that covid tends to hit us across geographies at different times and so that mitigates some of our exposure.
and what we're seeing is that in these countries, most of them -- our biggest revenue countries has a significant amount of vaccination. and though we see the rates of covid going up at alarming rates, there is not the same relationship between covid rates going up and the demand on icu beds. at least, we were certainly seeing it in certain geographies. we've definitely had situations, for example, in the united states and outside the united states where certain focused geographies have been impacted directly by covid, but we are -- we feel good, really good about how we exited the second quarter and what that means for our ability to continue to execute in the back half of the year.
so, derrick, maybe you could talk about how you've integrated things into our projections going forward.
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
sure. and i think that was a great backdrop, glen. and certainly, we integrate numerous factors, obviously, into our guidance. and so as we look to the back half of the year, we took into consideration, first off, the strong momentum that we had coming out of q2, as glen mentioned.
we took into consideration the underlying demand that we saw as we were opening up new accounts and reactivating existing ones, particularly in the u.s. we took into account kind of summer seasonality certainly that we do expect to see a bit in kind of q3. and typically, we always see sort of particularly in our international market. summer seasonality as physicians and patients go on vacation, and there's certainly a question as to whether that may be -- might be more pronounced or not this summer, given that the lockdowns are just opening up and folks are having an opportunity to take a break for the first time.
and of course, we certainly are cognizant of the delta variant and the uncertainty that this kind of strain brings on hospital icu capacity. and so we certainly have that and are watching that closely. that said, as glen said, every quarter that's gone by, we've seen both in our own business, as well as the broader healthcare system, the ability of the broader healthcare system to be able to manage these uncertainties better and better. and so that, of course, is also accounted for.
so i think we have taken as much as all of these factors as we can into account to the back half of our guidance and that's what you've got in our numbers.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. that's great. yes. i mean, sorry to ask the question.
i know it's short-term oriented, but it's not unimportant. and then i'm curious, as things recovered over the course of the second quarter, just -- i love the metric you've been providing us in terms of the percentage of accounts that have been active. how high did that go here through the second quarter in the u.s.?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so we were -- as you will recall, we found ourselves at the turn of the year down on a monthly basis with in the low 30s of our accounts that were active, and we we pulled out, obviously, the quarterly numbers are a little bit stronger in the first quarter of this year. we were at about 68% of our accounts who are activated, and we're right up around 80% coming out of the second quarter. so that's moving almost exactly the way that we had anticipated.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
that's great. thanks so much.

your next question comes from the line of cecilia furlong from morgan stanley. your line is now open.
cecilia furlong -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. good afternoon, and thank you for taking the questions. i wanted to start and ask, what you've seen from recently opened accounts versus your established accounts? just around the rate of recovery and productivity you're seeing in those accounts as covid headwinds start to subside.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
so recent -- by definition, recently opened accounts, we don't have a ton of bait on. i can tell you that we're opening accounts in the face of sort of what's been happening. we do look back quite a ways back, and we look at accounts that were kind of up and running for a year in the pre-covid phase. so when covid hit, these accounts had all been up and running for at least a year.
and then we look at the accounts that we have essentially brought on since then or that reached their one-year anniversary in the midst of covid. and at this point, we don't see significant differences between those accounts. so we find that kind of encouraging. i think there were some moments across the year where people were really able to catch their breath and catch up in some ways in terms of those newer accounts.
i was quite personally concerned about whether those groups would look fundamentally different and that whether covid would sort of retard the development of these newer accounts, but they look good.
cecilia furlong -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks, glen. and i did want to ask as well just what you're seeing from a referral basis either physician refer versus patient self-referral really trying to get out just the awareness around zephyr now versus a year ago. and then as you think forward, just what you're thinking about direct-to-patient targeting initiatives or else driving awareness among the referring community. just any other color you could provide there would be helpful.
thank you.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
ok. so to write these down these multi-part questions. the -- as far as the referrals, we -- it's about 80% of our patients come through referring physicians. so that's an area of focus.
we also want to make sure it's an interesting combination. i mean we have demonstrated the ability to drive patients more quickly than we do directly toward -- or for them to initiate. and when we've held back a bit on that on a broad basis because there is essentially three steps to the process. you've heard us talk about this before, where we need to get the treating sites in a given geography set up and have the systems in place to be able to efficiently take the patients from the front door and take them through to the procedure.
we then need to make sure that they're referring physicians that are surrounding that area and through which a lot of these patients are going to come or coming up online. and so we've spent a lot of time ensuring that we're engaging with those physicians, but whether that be through electronic means or orchestrating zoom calls between the treating physicians and the referring physicians or what have you. and even most recently, we've gotten closer with some of these referring physicians through the patients themselves who have indicated to us that they are interested in -- they said, ""hey, my doctor doesn't really know a lot about this, would you mind swinging by? and feel free to mention that i, james smith, said so."" so we've -- there's been a lot of interaction with referring physicians and both to bring them up to speed, and we've also had some good experience in driving patients themselves through some of our digital mechanisms that we've talked about a lot on prior calls.

your next question comes from the line of larry biegelsen from wells fargo. your line is now open.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
good afternoon, guys. thanks for taking this question. one on kind of the outlook and one on the strong new center adds you had in the quarter. just on the outlook, based on your comments, do we assume that things continue to get better in july, glen? and the pipeline, you have good visibility with stratx.
is that looking good? and, derrick, i know you're going to get this question or we're going to get it, but you raised the guidance by the amount you beat in the quarter. should we assume that's conservatism given the uncertainty in the environment? and i did have a follow-up.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
well, my comments on the first may actually speak a little bit to the last. july is typically a strong month for us. we had a really good july. so i mean it was -- so we came out of the second quarter feeling really good, and july is still better.
but historically, you look back at our julys and they're all pretty good. and i think it has something to do with the fact that august tends to be soft because particularly, outside the united states, in europe, where 80% of our international businesses where people take a lot of time off in that window. so yes, august was solid. pipeline, we feel good about sort of how we exited the second quarter and how things are set up.
i think that the third quarter is, there's two things that i'm sure everybody is thinking about is, what is this -- if you look at sort of covid and the impact that it has in a number of the nations that it's already passed through, whether that be india or the united kingdom where you see that sort of delta variant peak, it's not a terribly wide -- it's a very tall peak in certain situations, but not very wide. and so we're not sure exactly what the ramifications will be in the third quarter and so -- and also this vacation question, which happens every year, but it doesn't come off the back of this extended fatigue that i think a lot of these clinicians may be feeling. so we're still -- we're anxious to get on the other side of august and see what that looks like before. we're going to start multiplying july by three or something.
derrick, do you have any comment on that?
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
i think it's well said. and as i kind of mentioned before, we're trying to take all these factors into our guidance, larry. and so glen pointed to a couple that sort of temper us, which is summer seasonality. and of course, we're not ignoring covid, but then on the other side, we're really excited about the strength of our business exiting june and into july and opening up the new accounts, as you mentioned.
i think all of those are really strong signs that, that underlying demand is there. so we're doing the best we can to incorporate a lot of uncertain variables.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
that makes sense. and just to ask about a follow-up on the new center adds, very strong this quarter with 20. and i think the guidance was for over 200 this year. is there any reason you can't continue at that pace? can you accelerate the center add from where they've historically been? our survey work suggests the demand is there.
thanks for taking the questions, guys.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
sure. we -- we're very -- we want to make sure that we don't say we can do something unless we demonstrate we can do it. and what we know and what we're staying with is that we know when there isn't a massive covid headwind that we can open about 15. we have one data point that suggests we can open 20.
i guess at the end of the third quarter, we may move off to 15, but right now, we said we'd do 10, 10, 15, 15 across this year. we're still holding on to the 15. i'd probably bet the over on that, but that's where we are.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thank you, guys, for taking the questions.
operator
your next question comes from the line of rick wise from stifel. your line is now open.
rick wise -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
good afternoon to you both. glen, maybe just -- maybe you'll expand on your eu comments a little bit and the recovery. and i think you said that recovery you think is going to be sustained into the second half. i'd just be curious, a little more color on your optimism there.
and maybe talk us through, it's like are there particular countries where you're seeing a really strong recovery? are there others that are lagging that just could swing one way or the other up or down that could affect the second half?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
well, we had a lot of things that were going on in europe before this delta variant started invading, and we were just sort of coming out of that. and i would say that france and germany, our two biggest markets in europe, our second and third largest markets globally, we're just starting to come out of that and then delta variance starts to leak on in. i'm happy to say that if you look at where germany is right now and this could change dramatically in the coming weeks, it's either going to miss this to some extent or -- and get enough people vaccinated that they don't swamp the icus or it's going to -- we've got -- they're going to have a wave out in front of them. the u.k.
clearly seems to be on the back side of the wave. one of the nice things, i mean, just intellectually about kind of looking at daily data when you think about case rates and so forth is, you can start with the countries that start first. and so you can look at the how steep the curve was in india and how steep it went up and how steep it came down. you can see in the u.k.
that they seem to be on the backside of a very steep backside of a curve. other markets like france seem like they may be at the top. spain seems to be trending down. it's really too early to tell with any -- and in places like sweden and germany, it's unclear whether they're going to get hit or whether that's just going to happen later.
places like italy, looks like they're on the way up. so i don't -- it's a tricky call, but the good news about covid, as i mentioned before, is that hospitals are able to manage it way better than they used to before. and when it hits, it tends to hit in different places at different times. and so this global footprint that's being in 30 different markets even across the united states when you think about our 50 reps, 50 plus, 53, covering all these different geographies, we've got enough diversification that through the last couple of waves, we've been able to do increasingly ok in the face of this.
we'll be more than -- nobody will be happier than us when we get on the other side of this. well, i should -- i'm sure the doctors that are managing these patients will be happier than us, but we're right up high on that list.
rick wise -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
for sure. derrick, maybe one for you on gross margins. it was great to see the 74% number. and the second half, i think i heard you correctly say, 73%.
in simple amount of terms, is that 72% in the third quarter because of seasonal slowness and back to 74 in the fourth and that gives you 73. and maybe just help us understand, maybe the drivers the sustainers of this and maybe the potential to improve beyond 74 from here?
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
absolutely. thanks, rick, for that question. we were really pleased with achieving 74% gross margin in q2. this is obviously a new high for us, and it reflects increasing overhead absorption as we ramp production to meet demand and also reflect some continued production efficiencies.
and all of that we do think is sustainable. for the remainder of the year, you're right, i indicated that we're comfortable kind of forecasting gross margin around 73% for the back half. i won't get too cute around how that divides up. i think we're comfortable right now with a forecast of 73% across both quarters.
and what that reflects is relative to this quarter is high, we do think we may incur some additional kind of in-period expenses related to the scaling of our operations. and so that may sort of temporarily bring down the gross margin a bit. but the kind of underlying drivers of our gross margin expansion, primarily increasing production volumes and efficiencies driven by overhead absorption. that is sustainable, and we continue to expect that to continue to drive our gross margins even higher.
so overtime, we do expect our gross margins to step up beyond even 74%, probably to the high 70s at some point. so that's our longer-term outlook.
rick wise -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
got you. and one last one for me, if i could. just some of our recent doc checks -- just i don't know it wasn't a surprise, but glen reminded me of how important, how valued chartis is by your docs. and i want to comment it from two ways.
one, just remind us, i assume these are free software upgrades, but is there revenue associated? and just in general, i heard about all the ease-of-use comments you made that may all sound great, does it change anything? just it's not a minute off the procedure or 10 minutes. does it do anything tangible? and just last -- and sorry for so much on chartis, i'm so intrigued with these conversations. i'm very clear that this is a significant -- i was clear before, but some clear, even the significant difference competitively this is for you. are you concerned or should we be concerned that your competition could try to replicate chartis? just talk about it a little bit from those vantage points.
i'd appreciate it. thank you.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
sorry, i was on mute. chartis is an important tool for us. it essentially helps us identify patients that are most likely to benefit. and as a consequence, if one was to look at our clinical data relative to, say, clinical data that others have generated, it's undoubtedly positively impacted by -- i mean, i think we have a better valve.
but it also -- we also stacked the deck with chartis. we identify the patients that are most likely to benefit our responder rates higher, and as a consequence, our mean changes in clinical trials is better. the the new software change we will be charging for. so there is some revenue there.
we don't -- it's not a big part of our revenue. 90% of our revenue comes from selling valves, not selling chartis, but there is a nice opportunity there to upgrade. we are providing a path to upgrading for existing accounts, and it will impact, obviously, the new purchases down the road as well. the software itself is time savings.
it's measured in minutes. procedure could be 30, 40 minutes long. and so saving minutes is important. it's not going to save 10 minutes.
but there's a certain amount of noise in the data that gets generated from chartis in the old configuration and the new software improves sort of the signal-to-noise ratio, if i can -- if that's the right phrase to use. so we're looking at mean changes over time, integrating that and really simplifying the signal that comes back out to the physician. and so as a consequence with lower flow and in shorter time, you're able to identify whether you've got a good patient or not. and so that's -- it's not the most interesting part of the procedure.
so i think the physicians really appreciate the added efficiency that this new advance provides. with regard to our competitive situation, we obviously have ip in this area and tremendous expertise that has been developed across more than a decade of experience with this technology. so we got to where we are based on that data, and we continue to make improvements based on the data that we have. one of the interesting things in this field is that when you have a great therapeutic that couples with a really good patient identification tool, you can jump into a market super fast.
when we launched stratx, there were other sort of quantitative ct analysis softwares that were out there, we became the market leader in a matter of weeks, probably three weeks. we were the market leader, and we left everybody in the dust because we have the best valve, and we had chartis. and it just all fit together. and i think that, that unto itself is a pretty significant competitive challenge, ignoring the intellectual property that we have that somebody would have to navigate.

your next question comes from the line of bill plovanic with canaccord. your line is now open.
bill plovanic -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
hey. great. thanks. good evening.
i think a lot of it has been hit. i just have two questions to finish with is, just first on the seasonality. i mean, we think that ous would be flat? i think that's the messaging that i'm taking away, but i wanted to just make sure that i'm in the ballpark there. and then the second question is, i mean the strength in july, but i think you have a unique look into your pipeline given the scanning and diagnostic procedures you're doing.
and is there anything in there that would maybe say that july is not the peak for the quarter and that you can continue strong through the balance at least in the u.s.? thanks.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
i'm going to allow derrick to talk about the first part of the question. the back part of the question in terms of july, i mean, if the doctors aren't in the hospitals than the procedures aren't going to get done. and so i think that, that seasonality component is something. so if there are patients in our pipeline, yes, i think we'll probably feel the seasonality in august.
and really, the question is how much comes back in september in my view. so i don't think we power our way through a bunch of vacations because we have a pipeline. so -- and that's sort of my view on the other point. so i wouldn't -- i don't -- anyway, i'll -- maybe derrick can pick up the first part of the question.
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
sure. bill, so you're right. so in terms of seasonality, particularly in our international business, we have a little bit more history in our international business. so if we look back to our ous sales in 2018 and 2019, excluding 2020, which was an odd year, typically, we've seen kind of a flattish sales or flattish revenue between q2 and q3.
now this year -- again, it's not a normal year, so there's some question around what that means for this year, but i would say, that's kind of a baseline that we have in mind as we think about the seasonality. now in the u.s., we just don't have enough history, right, to know how we are impacted by the summer situation. so there, i think there's a little bit more uncertainty. but certainly, in the back of our mind is the -- what we're hearing about folks wanting to take vacation and not having had an opportunity for a long time.
so i would say, the u.s., it's also in the back of our mind, but we have more history, and we've seen it more historically with our international sales.
bill plovanic -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
ok. and then to go back to the with the scans in the diagnostic procedure. i guess part of the question is, if we're starting to see a lift in productivity of accounts, i understand folks will be going on vacation, but if there's just that much more of a backlog, it does sometimes give you the ability to kind of continue that momentum, right? you have more accounts. you have people who take vacations.
i think one of the questions people have is, did they take vacations earlier than normal? and you've already seen the run to that. and that's kind of what i'm trying to figure out, but i appreciate you taking my questions.
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
yes.

your next question comes from the line of jason bednar from piper sandler. your line is now open.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. congrats on nice quarter. really just a couple of follow-up questions for me to some of the earlier questions. i really appreciate the insight on the active centers that are now at around 80%.
but i guess, what's going to be needed to flip that switch even higher? and i ask is, procedure volumes have improved broadly across med tech. so i guess, is this some blocking and tackling type education and reeducation with some of your centers? or do you think we need to see covid really no longer a discussion point in order to move that active center percentage above 90 or 95%?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
i feel like 80 to 90% is a range that's solid. i think the key metric here is going to be what we have on prior calls called productivity, which is how many cases per quarter are they doing? so that's the area of our primary focus. and i don't know -- i don't think i've mentioned it in this call, but that's stepped up about 20% quarter over quarter. you may recall, we were at about four on average in our established accounts for procedures per quarter, and we're more in the five range now.
so that -- and we clearly need to continue to move that, particularly as you heard in our earlier comments about sort of getting up to the mid-50s on number of territories filled and then kind of riding that through the better part of the -- basically, through the back end of the year. the way that we drive things, particularly as we get the more and more accounts activated, the only way we grow is if we start increasing that productivity, and we've started to see that. so that's great news. and we would expect that, that will continue.
and it is, in fact -- both metrics are, in fact, impacted by covid. so the fact that arkansas or you named the state has certain regions and so forth that are becoming problematic and accounts are shutting down. we're going to have a quiet quarter with some number of accounts that's going to increase the number of inactive accounts. so that's being pushed down.
so i mean, sneaking from 80 up toward 90, that -- i would expect that, that will happen in the post-covid phase. i don't expect that we'll probably be much above that, particularly as the denominator gets bigger and bigger.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
sure. ok. yes. that makes sense, and that's helpful.
thanks, glen. and then for my other question, the patient selection tools have been a competitive advantage for pulmonx. i don't want to give your competitor too much airtime here, but they've made available an ai solution now to help with patient selection. i know it's early, but just curious if you have any opinion on this competitive offering and just how you think it might stack up with, i guess, versus what pulmonx offers clinicians? i think i know your answer, but i'll let you opine there.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
i'm aware of what you're referring to. i don't -- i think we're very -- we're happy to have a competitor in the field with us. we get a disproportionate amount of the growth of this marketplace. we think our tools are better.
we think that the way that we execute on our stratx works better as it relates to getting the right answer to the question of whether a patient is a good candidate or not. if you don't use chartis, you have to come to terms as a physician with leaving patients behind because we chartis patients who have a fisher completeness of greater than 80% and olympus says greater than 90%. what that means is that if somebody is between 80 and 90% fisher completeness, they're not going to get valves, if they are using olymphosys product. in our case, there is some number of patients that are cv negative on chartis, and they get valves and they get better.
so you've got to reconcile the idea that you're going to leave some patients who could benefit behind. and then on the other end of the spectrum, there are some patients who are 95% fisher completeness on any one of these measures, who are chartis negative, they're chartis red lights. so you've got to come to terms with the idea that you're going to put a permanent implant into a patient who you could have known in advance wasn't going to benefit. and roughly 90% of the people around the world that are doing this procedure are choosing to do it with our technology.
and i think it has a lot to do with stratx, a lot to do with chartis. and we're collaborating with them on using our tools as well to help them understand in that small proportion of patients where the technology is not successful, what went wrong, and what actionable steps can be taken to get that patient to a better place. so again, we're leading the science. we're leading the development, and we continue to feel good about where we are with our stratx, and even though there aren't acronyms it's assigned to it, like olympus may have right now.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
all right. appreciate it. thanks, glen.

your next question comes from the line of joanne wuensch from citi. your line is now open.
joanne wuensch -- citi -- analyst
thank you for taking my questions. i have two of them. i think if i heard you correctly, pent-up demand was resolved in the first month. definitely seem like a lot of pent-up demand, did i hear that correctly? or am i not thinking about it correctly?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
you heard it correctly. you -- i don't -- i can't -- i won't speak to whether you're thinking about it correctly. i think we got some pent-up demand that hit at the end of the first quarter. so i think we had some pent-up demand that we saw in march, and we saw some pent-up demand in april.
that was u.s. pent-up demand. the u.s. sort of -- although i talk about the diversification across the u.s., i think as it relates to that period of time, we were sort of coming out more broadly across the u.s.
outside the united states, we don't see pent-up demand in the same way as we do in the u.s. so probably, just because it's 20 something different countries, but in any case, it came across in two months and that's fairly typical in the u.s. in terms of other waves that we've come out of.
joanne wuensch -- citi -- analyst
all right. that's helpful. my second question has to do with understanding the pathway from getting a patient identified as a zephyr valve recipient into the physician and into having the procedure done. how much line of sight do physicians have on that? and how much line of sight do you have on that.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
well, the treating physicians and pulmonx have -- i guess it depends on what you consider line of sight. stratx is a real good indicator of -- we call them stratx screen light patients. so basically, you have a patient who meets sort of treatment criteria, you take their ct data, you run it through stratx. stratx says, they've got a better than 80% complete fisher and the patient gets scheduled.
and i mean, after you go through the process. if there are -- most of the patients are medicare patients. so about 50% of our patients just they go ahead and schedule a procedure, and about 50 -- 25% of our patients are managed medicare so they got an -- or commercial patients, so they got to go through a process. 95% of the time, they're popping out of that or better.
they're popping out of that process with a green light. so when they get treated is not exact. so it's sometime over the next month or three essentially is when that normally happens. but stratx greenlight patients are a really good indicator of future patients that are going to get -- that are going to end up getting treated and about 80% of them get valves.
joanne wuensch -- citi -- analyst
helpful. thank you.

i am showing no further questions at this time. i would now like to turn the conference back to glen french.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
well, thank you very much. i wanted to thank everybody who's on this call, and i don't think i've done this before, but i'm probably not supposed to. i'm sure my cfo will correct me after this, but i really want to acknowledge the great work that you all have done in coming up to speed. questions are always great.
i feel really good about how we came out of the second quarter. i mentioned that our july performance continued to be strong. our stratx trends are up. our calls into our reimbursement services group is up across the second quarter.
calls into accounts, web traffic, new accounts, feet on the street, and we've got this. we've got an array of both patient and physician engagement programs that we've started out across the first couple of quarters, and we have a lot more coming in the back half of the year. so i feel really good about where we are and where we're headed and just appreciate the ongoing interest and great questions. so thank you very much.
we're off and running in the third quarter and look forward to talking to you in a few months.

glen french -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, brian. good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our second-quarter 2021 earnings call. here with me today is derrick sung, our chief financial officer. i'm very pleased to report that our business was quite resilient through the second quarter as we drove adoption of our life-changing zephyr valve treatment.
in q2, we achieved worldwide sales of 12.2 million, which represents our highest level of quarterly revenue ever. in the united states, we experienced a recovery in procedure volume as hospital restrictions eased following the increase in vaccinations and decrease in covid cases across the country. after working through some backlog in the first month of the quarter, we were encouraged by the sustained recovery in activity at our u.s. treating centers and the clear resumption of underlying demand for our zephyr valve treatment.
outside the u.s., our business faced continued pressure in the first part of the quarter because of the spring covid surge that led to a new wave of lockdowns across a number of our markets in europe. however, we saw a marked recovery in sales in june as covid cases waned and hospitals began to reopen to procedures, and we remain optimistic that the recovery of our international business will be sustained in the back half of the year. through the second quarter, we also made steady progress in other key objectives, building on our success in q1. we have further augmented our commercial team, expanding our base of treatment centers, and we were successful in securing incremental commercial payer coverage in the u.s.
thus, we are updating our outlook for the rest of the year and now expect full-year 2021 revenue to be in the range of 49 to $51 million, up from our prior guidance of 48 to $50 million. as we build a foundation to deliver on these expectations and sustain future growth, we continue to expand our commercial infrastructure. in the u.s., we have nearly completed our targeted sales territory expansion for the year with a total of 53 active territories, and we expect to add just one or two more through the remainder of the year. outside the u.s., we've added two additional territories in europe, bringing our total of international sales territories to 30.
we have also continued our success in adding new zephyr treatment centers and building interest among physicians for our life-changing therapy. in the u.s., we added 20 new treating centers during the second quarter, bringing our total u.s. treating centers to 180. we have -- we are well on track to meet our year-end objective to offer zephyr valve in at least 200 treating centers in the u.s.
as we continue expanding our commercial footprint in the second quarter, we also launched a software upgrade to our charter system to new and existing customers that makes it simpler, faster, and more effective to definitively identify the patients most likely to benefit from our zephyr valve treatment. the upgrade enables highly accurate prediction of the absence of collateral ventilation at lower flow rates and in less time while also allowing physicians to easily record, export, and share video assessments. this upgrade is a testament to our dedication to innovation and further enhances the value of charters, which remains a key platform differentiator. turning now to reimbursement.
we have secured further positive policy wins across the blue cross blue shield plans. on our last call, we mentioned that we had received positive coverage policy from blue cross blue shield of massachusetts, which took effect in june. since our last call, we have also received a positive coverage policy decisions from blue cross blue shield of north carolina, the largest payer in the state with over 2 million covered lives and regent's blue cross blue shield, which covers nearly 2 million lives across oregon, washington, idaho, and utah. as we've discussed in the past, our policy wins with commercial payers in the u.s.
validate the clinical acceptance of our technology and reduce the prior authorization time for patients waiting to receive zephyr valve treatment, but we no longer see reimbursement as a major barrier to adoption of our treatment. at pulmonx, we take great pride in our scientific leadership in the field of interventional pulmonology. we are the first and only company to have demonstrated across four randomized controlled clinical trials that patients selected with our charter system and successfully treated with zephyr valves, show clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in lung function, exercise capacity, and quality of life compared to medical management alone. zephyr valve have been included in treatment guidelines for copd worldwide, and the quality of evidence for treatment with endobronchial valves has been graded a by the global initiative for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, widely known as gold.
as part of our continued efforts to lead the science in our field, we were pleased to see the presentation and publication of long-term follow-up data from two of our key studies demonstrated the durability of the benefits associated with our zephyr valve treatment. long-term follow-up data from the transform study was presented at the american thoracic society virtual conference in may. transform is the first multicenter randomized controlled trial to evaluate effectiveness and safety of zephyr valves in patients with heterogeneous emphysema selected for the absence of collateral ventilation in the target lobe. the original publication reported results out to six months, and we were pleased that the long-term follow-up data showed sustained quality of life improvement out to 24 months post treatment, lasting lung function improvement out to 24 months treatment -- post treatment, increased exercise capacity out to at least 18 months post treatment, and long-term reduction in hyperinflation, resulting in reduced breathlessness.
in late july, long-term follow-up data from the impact study was published in respiration, the international journal of thoracic medicine. impact was a multicenter randomized clinical trial that showed that zephyr valves deliver benefits to a group of patients who have very few treatment options because of wide spread and consistent destruction of lung tissue, also known as homogeneous distribution of emphysema. zephyr is the only endobronchial valve to receive approval from fda for the treatment of patients with homogeneous distribution of emphysema and is the only minimally invasive option available to help these patients breathe easier. we estimate that patients with homogeneous emphysema make up approximately half of the severe emphysema patients who are candidates for our treatment, and we believe our unique indication for treatment of this group of patients is a key differentiator that sets us apart from other competing technologies.
data from the july impact publication demonstrated that improvements from baseline to six months seen in the zephyr valve group were maintained out to 12 months with clinically and statistically significant improvements in lung function, exercise capacity, quality of life, and reduced breathlessness. that is the -- this is the first report of a multicenter study, showing benefit out to at least one year of this homogeneous emphysema patient population. together, the long-term data from both transform and impact demonstrate that our zephyr valve is a safe and effective treatment option with long-term benefits for patients with severe emphysema, including those with homogeneous disease who have few other alternatives. to summarize, we've continued to make strong progress across all of our key commercial objectives, have made progress in advancing both science and technology around our offering and continue to receive validation from our clinical and economic stakeholders that zephyr valve offer lasting and life-changing benefits to our patients.
as we look ahead, we are optimistic in our long-term growth trajectory given our performance to date. with that said, i will now turn the call over to derrick to provide a more detailed review of our second-quarter results.
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
thank you, glen, and good afternoon, everyone. total worldwide revenue for the three months ended june 30, 2021, was $12.2 million, a 232% increase from $3.7 million in the same period of the prior year and an increase of 218% on a constant currency basis. u.s. revenue in the second quarter was $6.6 million, our highest quarter of u.s.
sales to date and represents a 343% increase from $1.5 million during the prior-year period. the record u.s. sales reflect an easing and covid-related hospital restrictions and a recovery in procedure volumes, as well as the commercial progress that we've made in driving adoption of our zephyr valve into new accounts. international revenue in the second quarter of 2021 was $5.6 million, a 157% increase from $2.2 million during the same period last year and represents a return of our international sales to pre-pandemic level.
on a constant currency basis, international sales increased by 134%, driven by a recovery in the last month of the quarter as hospitals in certain european markets began to resume procedures following the spring covid lockdowns. gross margin for the second quarter of 2021 reached 74% compared to 28% in the prior period -- year period, which was depressed due to a slowdown in production during the first few months of the pandemic. gross margin in the second quarter of 2021 benefited from increasing overhead absorption and production efficiencies. given these improvements, we are increasing our outlook for gross margin in the back half of the year to around 73%.
total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2021 were $21.1 million, a 68% increase from $12.5 million in the second quarter of 2020. stock-based compensation expense was $2.2 million in the second quarter of 2021 and accounted for 24% of the increase in operating expenses from the prior-year period. we now expect noncash stock-based compensation to account for about $10 million of our total operating expenses for the full-year 2021, up from our prior forecast of $9 million. despite this increase in noncash expense, we continue to expect operating expenses for the full year of 2021 to be in the range of 85 to $90 million as we build out our commercial operations, invest in our research and development programs and further scale our business.
r&d expenses for the second quarter of 2021 were $3.5 million compared to $1.4 million in the same period of the prior year. aside from stock-based compensation, the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel, clinical studies, and development-related expenses needed to support our product development and clinical research activities. sales and general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2021 were $17.6 million compared to $11.1 million in the second quarter of 2020. aside from stock-based compensation, the increase was attributable to an increase in sales and marketing expenses as we expanded our commercial team and increased commercial activities, as well as public company expenses related to the scaling of our general and administrative infrastructure.
net loss for the second quarter of 2021 was $12.4 million or a loss of $0.34 per share as compared to a net loss of $11.9 million or a loss of $6.15 per share for the same period of the prior year. an average weighted share count of 36 million shares was used to determine loss per share for the second quarter 2021. we ended june 30, 2021, with $211.5 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, a decrease of $10 million from march 31, 2021. finally, turning to our outlook for the remainder of 2021.
while covid-19 continues to pose a risk of uncertainty, we now expect full-year 2021 revenue to be in the range of 49 to $51 million, representing a 50 to 56% revenue growth over 2020, and up from our prior guidance of 48 to $50 million. our revenue guidance reflects confidence from our momentum exiting q2 and the progress we've made expanding our commercial infrastructure and footprint tempered by an expectation of summer seasonality, which has historically impacted our sales in the third quarter, particularly in international markets. and with that, i'd like to thank you all for your attention, and we will now open up the call for questions. operator?

[operator instructions]. your first question is from larry biegelsen of wells fargo. your line is open.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for taking the question. congrats on a nice quarter and obviously a very difficult environment. glen, can you hear me ok?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. so i'd like to hear you talk about what you're seeing in the geographies that are less impacted by covid in terms of the growth and utilization. and if you think we'll see those types of growth rates and utilization rates in other geographies once covid subsides. and in addition, can you talk about the strong screening volumes that you mentioned in the press release? and i had one follow-up.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
well, what we're seeing in the geographies that are less impacted is precisely what we expected. i mean, we're seeing a strong performance, strong revenue generation. we, obviously, those were able to sort of overcome the tougher areas that were shut down. we had certain geographies that were completely shut down for part of the quarter.
we all read about those in the headlines across the southern part of the u.s. and in the southeast. and so that was -- those are the areas that -- and we would expect that when covid headwinds subside, that these things will continue to charge forward, and we won't be sort of running along with one hand tied behind our back, so to speak. the second part of your question was related to?
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
screening. you talked about in the press release strong screening volumes?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we have seen one of the strongest indicators of screening is stratx scans. it depending on the geography that happens either early on or later in the assessment process. and we saw an increase in stratx scans in the u.s., low double digits and in terms of percentage increase.
and on the international front, most particularly, the bulk of our business is in europe outside the united states, we saw significantly stronger increase in stratx scans when you look at the third quarter versus the second quarter, which makes complete sense to us given that the u.s. and the challenges that we're facing with covid are challenges that the europeans have already gotten through, at least on this last very large wave of covid that hit around the world.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
that's helpful. and just one follow-up for derrick. so, derrick, we understand q3 was a challenging quarter. but you kind of -- you came in line with consensus.
so what are you seeing that leads you to believe you'll be at the low end of the full year guidance. historically, you guys have shared a metric with us about the number of percenters doing procedures. anything you can share with us on q3 compared to q2 and kind of what you're seeing now? thanks for taking the questions.
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
yes. thanks for that question, larry. so just in terms of what we saw in q3 and what we're moving forward to in q4. in q3, we saw coming out of q2, really strong sort of sales momentum building through the quarter and is built through into july.
and so we saw strength in july across the board, across all our geographies. and then as the covid delta variant really began to impact the u.s., we saw -- we started to see deceleration in specific regions of the u.s. that were impacted by covid. so our q3, our strength in q3 really comes from strength in july across the board, across all geographies and then continued strength and momentum in the regions, both within the u.s.
and outside the u.s. that were not as impacted by covid through the remainder of the quarter. so as we look to q4, really kind of that the dynamics that are at play here are really kind of the recovery in those regions that were impacted by the delta variant. and what we're seeing is that, that recovery, while we've clearly bottomed, and we seem to have bottomed in kind of late september, early october.
we expect that recovery to be gradual. and so given the strength of what we saw in the early part of q2 and july and the increased impact of the delta variant that we hadn't fully factored into our guidance when we provided it last quarter, that's what leads us to determine that will be likely falling at or near the low end of our guidance for the year, and that applies to q4.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
just to put that additional context around that. i think one of the things that's important to remember, as you look across this quarter, in particular, is it, though, the sort of this bottoming out, if you will, that happened in september continued into october, we saw strengthening in the back, an increased -- an improvement in the back part of october. and as we look forward into november, we effectively lose nearly a week in november in the united states and the better part of two weeks in december. so this sort of flatness across the quarter.
if you were to calculate it on an average daily sales basis, taking into account those challenges in november and december. i think that the curve is going to look pretty strong.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thanks, glen and derrick.
operator
your next question is from bob hopkins of bank of america. your line is open.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you, and good afternoon. just a follow-up on that. so are you saying, glen, that the guidance for q4 contemplates on improvement throughout the course of the quarter in average daily sales numbers? just want to make sure i understood that, is what you're assuming for the fourth quarter relative to how you kind of exited the third quarter?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, so there's a couple of points there. one is the exiting of the third quarter was down. i mean, if we -- one of the metrics that we've looked at before is the active accounts.
and the proportion of our u.s. accounts that were active went down across the third quarter and continued down, not further down, but sort of down at that bottom through october. but in the back part of october, we saw some real nice strengthening. so it wasn't a -- we didn't have a great exit velocity coming out of the third quarter.
what i was saying. so we strengthened in october. we put up an ok number in october, and we imagine that, that number will be matched in november and december, but november and december are handicapped by fewer days. so if you divide by the number of selling days, a smaller number in november and an even smaller number in december, the average daily sales numbers will be strengthening in the back part of this quarter.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it.
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
i would just -- if i could just jump in and add a little color to that as well, bob. i think if you look at it on a pure dollar number based on the fact that there are fewer selling days in the q4 than q3. and in particular, as glenn mentioned, there aren't a lot of procedures in the u.s. that are done the week of thanksgiving or the last couple of weeks of the year.
from a pure dollar amount, we would expect the u.s. in q4 to be relatively flat sequentially to q3 from a dollar perspective.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. ok. i think i got it. and one other question.
just -- i know it's early, but do you guys have any kind of early thoughts, given how weird a year it's been? and how long it might tech take for you guys to kind of get new accounts going again. consensus is up at $77 million for next year, which is a super healthy growth rate, might strike me that, that's a little aggressive, just given all the work that has to be done. just kind of any preliminary thoughts on that or too early to comment?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
i think it's probably too early to comment. we're looking forward to getting specific on that front in our next call. i will say that as it relates to covid, i mean we don't expect covid is going to disappear. but what we have seen is that we and probably more appropriately, the healthcare systems around the world have become increasingly adept at managing covid.
and as more and more people get vaccinated, there's fewer and fewer people that are heading to the hospital or into the intensive care units, which were super sensitive about. and when i look at kind of a good example of how that's shown itself, i think about our 2020 numbers being essentially a match to 2019. i mean we we're flat in 2020 because we were shut down for a good part of the year. though the covid impact on 2021 was at least as much as what we saw in 2020, we're on track, as derrick had said and indicated we're still tracking toward consensus or toward the target that we had provided, which represents about a 50% -- a little bit better than a 50% increase year over year.
so i think that, that shows that everyone is getting a lot better at managing covid. and i think as we look into next year, i would expect that covid will not be gone, but that we will continue to move in the direction of -- everybody will be managing it much better.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
your next question is from cecilia furlong of morgan stanley. your line is open.
cecilia furlong -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you for taking the questions. glen and derrick, i wanted to start just on second straight quarter of very strong new account growth in the u.s., but just how you're thinking about going forward, the potential to continue to add at this kind of closer to '20 accounts per quarter rate? and then just alongside that, any other commentary you can provide from a physician training standpoint, what you've been able to do over the last several months, notwithstanding covid headwind?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so the new accounts, we feel fortunate. we were able to do '20 and then '18 and but i do believe that in these covid quarters, it's very tricky, and the fourth quarter is a covid quarter. so i think that it would -- we would be very lucky to put up a number like we have in the last couple of quarters.
so i don't see that accelerating as it relates to this quarter. as it relates -- so i think we've been saying that they would be more around 10 to 15 would be a number that would seem reasonable to us for the coming quarter. the -- as far as doctor training goes, we got pretty good at training folks remotely during the height of covid. we've started back up face-to-face training, which we think is better.
and we have been executing at least one training class per month, those have been oversubscribed as a result -- so there's a waiting list for each of these. and we are in the process of opening up an additional training center in another geography to help support that demand.
cecilia furlong -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. great. and i wanted to ask as well on the staffing shortage commentary that you touched on earlier. just how much of a headwind that was in 3q when you really started to see this evolve? and as you think about 4q, just how much pressure you contemplated from that standpoint?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
that's a great question. we've definitely been hearing about it, and we experienced some of it in the third quarter. i would not -- i mean, if i had to lay covid next to staffing shortages in the third quarter, clearly, covid was a bigger impact than staffing shortages. but what has happened is -- and i'm sure you guys have heard this.
and what i'm about to say is entirely my perspective on this, but a lot of people have gotten fatigue from covid. there's a lot of reasons why people are stepping away that are related and unrelated to covid, whether that be vaccination or just fatigue or what have you. but the availability of resources is being constrained and the competition between hospitals to secure those resources, particularly those that allow them to do procedures and so forth and generate revenue has become truly extraordinary. and so there's a lot of demand and not only individuals, but groups of people are getting attracted away from centers, and there's this mad scramble.
so i think as i look ahead, i would imagine -- i don't know how covid and staffing will balance in the fourth quarter, but i'm quite certain that staffing will become a more pronounced theme in the fourth quarter than it was at least for us in the third quarter.
cecilia furlong -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you for taking the questions.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
operator
your next question is from rick wise of stifel. your line is open.
rick wise -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
good afternoon to you both. maybe, glen, we could start with the really solid international performance. is it the recovery from covid? i know you added a couple of new international sales territories. i'm not sure in the second quarter, you had ended up at 30%.
i'm not sure whether that expanded again. i know -- maybe i missed that. maybe you could talk about that. and sort of where from here, i mean, you outperformed my international numbers, is another strong quarter expected as well in the fourth quarter?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so what's happened in some of these markets? and of course, we're in about 25 different markets around the world. most of our international sales come from europe. and i think one of the things that was pretty remarkable for us was probably the biggest country that was the was the united kingdom.
and the united kingdom is the nation in europe that has the least capacity to withstand any kind of an insult. i mean it's not uncommon in the last six years. there were several occasions where we were down -- our business was down for a month here or there because of a tough flu season. so to get the uk back and running was a real plus for us.
and they made a nice contribution, and we're our third largest international market in the last quarter. germany also came back, france came back strong. these are all major markets for us. so that's where our strength was.
as far as number of territories, it did go up. it wasn't material. it's sort of just filling taking advantage of opportunities and geographies that weren't optimally covered. we added somebody in western switzerland that we didn't have before.
we picked up a resource in italy. so there's a number of different one in china. so there's a number of different folks. we ended the quarter with 34.
so i wouldn't look at that and say it's more than -- i mean, it is more than a 10% expansion of the size, but it didn't really drive revenue per se. but it does put us in -- we're very opportunistic. we have a low threshold for adding reps where it makes sense. we saw an opportunity and we took it.
rick wise -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. and just as part of that to make sure i'm thinking about it correctly. i think the u.s. revenues per procedure, something like $11,000, if i remember correctly, please correct me if i'm wrong.
is it the same internationally less or more? just if a quick reminder.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
just a little bit less. we talk about 10,000 as the sort of global as our average revenue per procedure, and our number in the u.s. is about 11.
rick wise -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. and if i could finish up with a couple of guidance questions. just want to make sure, derrick, i'm understanding some of your comments. the commentary about the fourth quarter revenue not unlike the third, if i'm adding up correctly here and bumpy up, let's say, more in the 13.5 range for the fourth quarter.
that would be a little over 48 million, slightly below your range. when you say at the low end of the range, does that incorporate a little below? or not trying to get too [inaudible], but just want to make sure i'm hearing you correctly.
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
yes. thanks for the opportunity to clarify. so when i was referring to relatively flat, i was speaking about the u.s. specifically.
so we do expect a sequential increase in ous revenue. so to get to kind of the bottom end of our guidance of 49 million. another way to look at it would be to say, roughly, we might expect kind of a 50-50 or so mix between the u.s. and ous in q4.
but the flat -- the relatively flatness on a aggregate dollar value is the u.s., and we would expect a modest increase sequentially outside the u.s. in revenue dollars.
rick wise -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
got you. got you. and two more p&l questions if i could. you said that gross margin, you said 74% -- if i heard your words correctly, 74% for the rest of the year.
does that mean for the full year or for the fourth quarter? just wondered what you intended there just to make sure?
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue -- gross margin to be around -- back up to 74% in q4.
rick wise -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
and that's because roughly similar equal volumes roughly --
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
right. so we -- exactly. so we've averaged gross margin of about 73% through the first nine months of this year, that's been primarily driven by increased production throughput, leading to increased overhead absorption, as well as some other cost reduction initiatives that we have in place. we continue to expect those initiatives to, as well as overhead absorption to continue to step our gross margin out from where we are today.
in q3, in particular, this quarter, we had a little bit of higher scrap costs that are onetime in nature. so we feel comfortable that we'll be back up to 74% next quarter. and then moving forward, gradually, we continue to expect that we'll be moving up from 74% over time due to these continued initiatives that i mentioned.
rick wise -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
got you. and one last one, if i could. opex, if -- again, if i'm understanding correctly, i think your prior guide was 85 to 90, now you're saying 83 to 85. can you help us -- i mean, that's excellent, good.
can you help us appreciate what's happening there? thank you so much.
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
sure. right. so on the opex side, we continue, of course, to focus on expense management. and certainly, we were happy to see this drive some incremental leverage across our p&l throughout the first nine months of the year.
so that's one piece to it. the other piece is timing related. it's simply timing related and that there's some spend on the r&d side, particularly on the clinical research side related to airseal, that has been impacted by covid. so some of that clinical spend, we expect to be pushed out a little bit into q4 and maybe into next year.
so those, i'd say are the two drivers of the opex, our expectation of opex coming in slightly lower than the range that we had originally set out for 2021. i will say that in q4, that we do expect a meaningful step-up of a few million as our guidance implies from q3 to q4. and again, we expect that to be coming from clinical spend in aeriseal on the r&d side and continued investments in sg&a as well as some sort of typical year-end increase in professional services that we'll see on the sg&a side.
rick wise -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thanks for all of it, you two.
operator
your next question is from bill plovanic of canaccord. your line is open.
bill plovanic -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. really covid obviously masks a lot of things. so what i'm trying to get a feel for is in the areas, at least the geographies in the u.s.
that weren't impacted. i was wondering if you could give us any color, granularity on what the penetration of an account looks like a mature account and kind of what volumes you might be getting to and whether that be your top 10% of your accounts that weren't impacted in the quarter? or you've had them for two years, the longest mature accounts. just trying to get a feeling for what a top account looks like that maybe didn't have a significant impact from covid?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, nobody has been untouched by covid. so this is just kind of this last wave, and it's a relative thing. so everybody got hit to some extent, some way more than others.
and nobody has avoided getting hit very hard some number of times in the past. and so we have no -- when you talk about like a two-year horizon or something, there's nobody who hasn't been down for months through that time point. so the good news is we had 200 accounts in the united states roughly. and so when these things -- it has always moved along in never really knocking down everybody at once, but moving across the geography.
and i would say good is what people are striving toward is to get to a place where they're sort of running at 500,000 to $1 million kind of run rate on an annualized basis. so that's what good look like in the pre covid phase, that's what good looks like today. and i think that we saw a real nice growth in these unimpacted areas. you can figure it out with the kind of growth that we're -- that we delivered was, i think, solid sequential growth in the face of the headwinds that we saw.
we -- if you look over the growth over the prior year's quarter, it was also very strong, and it was largely driven not only by these sites, but had to counter act the downside that we experienced in places like texas and across the south through florida in particular, which are texas and florida are some of our bigger markets.
bill plovanic -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
thanks for taking my question.
operator
your next question is from joanne wuensch of citibank. your line is open.
joanne wuensch -- citi -- analyst
good evening, or afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. i have two, i'll put them out at the same time. the first has to do with covered lives. you added quite a number in the quarter.
and i'm curious, i don't want to say how many more but what significant pockets are still open? and my second question is for outside the united states. could you remind us of what the opportunity in japan looks like?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
got it. ok. so as far as covered lives go, just to be clear, 75% of our business is paid for by the government, 25 commercial payers. but of that government business, about a third, 25% of the whole run is managed medicare.
so those patients go for prior authorization through commercial payers. and so that's why we're focused on just trying to reduce the time line. and at blue's plans, most particularly at michigan, blue cross blue shield michigan, and at anthem, it was taken a long time, like 90 days and sometimes even longer to get prior authorization to go ahead and do the procedure. so getting those plans to the right place shortens that time line.
better than 95% of the time when we seek prior authorization, we get it. so it's not a question of whether that patient can get treated. it's just a question of how efficiently we can move through things. now one way to think about kind of where we are is that we pretty much have all the big players.
i don't think there's -- we had said that there certainly aren't many that are left that are the size of michigan or horizon that we just recently flipped. so it is -- the way i think about it is blue cross blue shield association is the only big payer that's negative. and before anthem flipped, we had about a third of blue cross blue shield association affiliates that had flipped. anthem represents another third.
so we're about two-thirds through. and then the other third is something like 30 or 40 little plans that are all -- we just kind of -- we feel like we're chopping down the tree, the tree being blue cross blue shield association by taking the lims down. and there's really no big lims left. so that's where we are on that front.
and all the other ones are neutral to -- or positive. and from a reimbursement preauthorization perspective, it really doesn't matter so long as they're not negative. so this was a really big period for us to get those 44 million lives. from a japan perspective, we size that at about 20% the size of the u.s.
opportunity, which makes it arguably our second largest opportunity on a national basis. so we're very excited about moving forward in japan. so it's a good-sized opportunity for us. very, very good-sized opportunity for us.
and we're moving ahead there. we expect to have the submission in by the end of this year. we're going to go ahead and expect that by the end of next year, we'll have approval. and then it goes through about a six-month reimbursement process, and we see ourselves commercial in 2023.
probably in the later part of that year.
joanne wuensch -- citi -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
[operator instructions]. your next question is from jason bednar of piper sandler. your line is open.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
good afternoon. i did want to ask about the recovery here in business trends that you spoke to kind of coming out of the latest covid wave. derrick, i think you alluded to business coming back in a gradual fashion here for the fourth quarter. but i think in the past, you've talked about business coming back and maybe more of a quick fashion following past covid waves.
so i guess, was this wave a bit different in how it's impacted you -- are you factoring in additional conservatism? is it the staffing dynamic that's maybe holding back the normal post-covid wave surge? any additional color there would be appreciated.
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
yes. jason, i'm going to ahead and jump on that one. the -- we are -- as we look forward, this year-end thing is very interesting. and we are seeing a dynamic where i think because of some of the staffing challenges that there are some folks who are saying, we're going to just get restarted in the new year.
so that's a nontrivial theme that we've heard. and so i think that staffing, as i sort of earlier alluded to, is going to impact us as we move through the fourth quarter. but we factored that in, and we're pressing forward. covid is -- we're still pulling out of covid on a number of fronts in a number of geographies.
and in some cases, i think we're all looking at the same data. covid is not done with certain geographies. so i think that's all sort of factored in. as it relates to the normal kind of [inaudible] that we get across one or two months coming out, that you're exactly right.
we've seen that a couple of times in the past. we don't expect to see it here. and i think it has to do with the dynamic that i just talked about. i think some of it is coming toward the end of the year and people saying, why don't we just do this in the new year.
but we're scheduling a bunch of cases. there's a lot of activity going on. but i don't -- i expect that to the extent that there is what would normally be a that would be spread across two months, i think it will be spread more broadly because of the end of the year impact and for the reasons that i just described.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. that makes sense. that's right. and then i guess, glen, you and i have talked about this in the past, but maybe hoping here you could provide some color, just really how the approach is playing out and having those assessment centers that you've got on your site, just serving as a feeder network into your training centers.
is this something that you're looking to expand further as we think out of 2022 or any learnings from that experience and having those assessment centers that you can use here going forward? thanks.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yes. as we talked about the last time we spoke on this subject, the assessment -- there aren't many of these assessment centers, and i think most of them are flipping to being treating centers. so the original -- i think the concept is that we're trying to explore a multitude of ways to sort of enrich the profile of the patients that are arriving at treating centers. and so that was the original concept behind assessment centers, where you might have an assessment center in missoula, montana that would send people into wherever, spokane, or whatever -- wherever the folks in that area would go to.
and i think what's happening is there's a certain amount of work that has to go into that process. and the trickiest or the most challenging part of doing -- of getting our -- delivering our treatment is not the procedure itself. so it's -- i think the physicians that are there are saying, well, maybe we ought to just become a treating center, which works out fine for us. so -- but this idea of coming up with tools to help the clinical coordinators at treating centers, move patients efficiently through the workup process, decentralizing or distributing assessment process out to referring doctors or referring centers is something that we have been working on in a pilot fashion.
and it's all just a way to try to reduce sort of the -- or increase flow through the tube as it relates to moving patients toward treatment.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
all right. great. very helpful. thanks so much.
operator
at this time, i would like to turn the conference back to the presenters for any further comments.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
well, thank you very much. i'd just like to close by saying that we are very pleased with having delivered another record quarter. this was largely driven by performance of sort of the less covid impacted geographies. the fundamentals related to our business, specifically, patient engagement, stratx scans, case volumes remain strong and strengthening.
thus, we remain quite optimistic about what's ahead for us, and we thank you all for your time and your ongoing interest in pulmonx.

glen french -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, brian. good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2021 earnings call. here with me today is derrick sung, our chief financial officer. the third quarter of 2021 proved to be yet another demonstration of the resilience of our business as we navigated the unpredictable course of the pandemic.
despite significant and unexpected headwinds from the delta variant, we generated $13.3 million in worldwide sales in the third quarter, our highest revenue results to date and another consecutive quarter of record sales. our strong results were driven by accelerating performance in regions less impacted by covid, highlighting the strong underlying demand for our zephyr valve procedure. in the united states, despite experiencing significant impact from the delta variant, we were still able to grow third quarter sales sequentially over second quarter and set a new high of $6.9 million of u.s. revenue.
we saw a strong acceleration of zephyr procedures in areas that were less affected by covid, such as the northeast and the midwest. this contrasted with sales deceleration of similar magnitude in regions, hard hit by covid, such as the south, where we experienced prolonged procedure delays due to hospital capacity constraints. outside the u.s., sales were strong in europe as hospitals reopened to procedures with covid cases receding across the quarter. though procedure volumes were geographically mixed, we saw clear evidence of the growing demand among patients and physicians for our zephyr valve treatment.
in the u.s., we added 18 new treating centers, an indication of the continued desire for new hospitals across the united states to bring our life-changing treatment to their patients. we now have a total of 198 treating centers in the u.s. and expect to easily surpass our target of establishing at least 200 zephyr valve treating centers in the u.s. by year end.
we also saw continued patient interest in the procedure with sustained momentum in stratx volumes across all our geographies and an increase of both patient calls directly into our u.s. treatment centers and patient engagement via our website and social media channels. in terms of milestones, i'm pleased to say that this demand and growing awareness of zephyr valves has translated into the treatment of over 25,000 patients worldwide. we've also cultivated a social media community of over 125,000 followers worldwide, enabling patients to share stories and experience of how zephyr valves have transformed their lives.
turning to our commercial expansion plans. we have completed our planned sales force expansion for the year with 54 total territories now active across the u.s. and 34 active international sales territories. we expect to continue to expand our commercial team throughout next year, and we'll provide greater detail on these plans during our next quarterly call.
on the reimbursement front, we extended our string of policy wins with a major positive coverage decision from anthem, blue cross blue shield, the largest family of blue cross blue shield plans covering 34 million lives across multiple states. we also secured wins with blue cross blue shield of michigan and horizon blue cross blue shield of new jersey, which together, cover an additional 10 million lives. these policy wins continue to validate the clinical acceptance of our technology and reduce the prior authorization time for patients waiting to receive our zephyr valve treatment. furthermore, outside the u.s., national treatment guidance documents in china, spain, and denmark were updated to recommend our procedure for patients with severe emphysema.
these recommendations, together with those already in place in the u.k., germany, and france, will support our efforts to penetrate these markets further. finally, our longer-term growth initiatives remain on track. we remain excited about aeriseal the solution that we are developing to treat severe emphysema patients who are not currently eligible for zephyr valves due to collateral ventilation. enrollment in our multicenter international clinical trial studying the use of aeriseal to convert patients with collateral ventilation into zephyr valve eligible patients has picked up as the impact of covid on our european trial sites has waned.
in addition, our efforts to introduce zephyr valves into japan continues to progress, and we expect to submit our application for regulatory approval to the japanese authorities before the end of this year. all told, we remain confident in both the near and long-term prospects of our business despite both the lingering impact of covid and indications of increasing hospital staffing challenges. as we look ahead, we maintain our strong conviction in the underlying demand for zephyr valves and believe we are building the foundation necessary to deliver sustained growth in the years ahead. with that, i will now turn the call over to derrick to provide a more detailed review of our third quarter results.
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
thank you, glen, and good afternoon, everyone. total worldwide revenue for the three months ended september 30, 2021, was $13.3 million, a 25% increase from $10.6 million in the same period of the prior year and an increase of 23% on a constant currency basis. united states revenue in the third quarter was $6.9 million, a 28% increase from $5.3 million during this prior year period. the record u.s.
sales reflect strong growth in continued commercial momentum of our business in regions less affected by covid, offset by a slowdown due to procedure restrictions at hospitals and regions of the u.s. that were significantly pressured by the delta variant. international revenue in the third quarter of 2021 was $6.4 million, a 22% increase from $5.3 million during the same period last year. on a constant currency basis, international sales increased by 18% as hospital procedure volumes continued to recover in our european markets.
gross margin for the third quarter of 2021 was 73%, compared to 70% in the prior year period. the year-over-year improvement in gross margin was driven by increased throughput and improved production efficiencies. looking ahead, we expect gross margin to come in around 74% for the remainder of the year. total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2021 were $19.5 million, a 52% increase from $12.8 million in the third quarter of 2020.
stock-based compensation expense was $2.8 million in the third quarter of 2021 and accounted for 34% of the increase in operating expenses from the prior year period. we continue to expect noncash stock-based compensation to account for about $10 million of our total operating expenses for the full year 2021. we now expect operating expenses for the full year 2021 to fall between 83 and $85 million as we build out our commercial operations, invest in our research and development programs, and further scale our business. r&d expenses for the third quarter of 2021 were $2.8 million, compared to $2 million in the same period of the prior year.
aside from stock-based compensation, the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel, clinical studies and development related expenses needed to support our product development and clinical research activities. sales, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2021 were $16.7 million compared to $10.8 million in the third quarter of 2020. aside from stock-based compensation, the increase was attributable to an increase in sales and marketing expenses as we expanded our commercial team and increased commercial activities, as well as public company expenses related to the scaling of our general and administrative infrastructure. net loss for the third quarter of 2021 was $10.2 million or a loss of $0.28 per share, as compared to a net loss of $3.9 million or a loss of $1.37 per share for the same period of the prior year.
an average weighted share count of 36.4 million shares was used to determine loss per share for the third quarter 2021. we ended september 30, 2021, with $202.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, a decrease of $8.9 million from june 30, 2021. finally, turning to our outlook for 2021. we continue to expect our full year 2021 revenue to fall within our previously communicated guidance of 49 to $51 million, albeit at the low end of this range due to additional pressures posed by covid.
this would represent at least 50% revenue growth over 2020. our ability to maintain guidance in the face of persisting covid headwinds reflects our confidence in the growing momentum of our business and in the underlying demand for zephyr valves. with that, i'd like to thank you all for your attention, and we will now open the call up for questions. operator?
",2021-Q3,LUNG
-0.9572,,,,":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions]. the first question comes from the line of joanne wuensch from citi. your line is now open.
you may ask your question.
unknown speaker
hi. this is actually anthony on for joanne. thanks for taking my question. i guess just starting with guidance at the midpoint, it's pretty fairly below consensus.
can you just talk about more some of the assumptions that went into that guidance? and then what you're seeing now that were toward the end of february?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i'll go ahead and start, and maybe derrick can join in on the discussion of guidance. so basically, what happened, or what's happening in 2022 is a reflection of a weak first quarter start which basically across all of our major geographies, we got impacted by omicron. and unlike prior waves, it all hit at once.
and the good news, i guess, is that it's going away quickly. the bad news is it came on quickly and it hit us in all different locations. as it relates to how we look ahead, what we've seen is significant weakness in the first half of the -- or the first month, certainly, of the quarter and pretty significant strengthening as we've moved through the middle and as we project out to the back half of the quarter. so we feel very good about the fundamentals of the business.
we've seen this show before, so to speak, as it relates to pulling out of these covid waves. we have never before seen a covid wave that hit all of our markets so intensively all at the same time. but it is receding very quickly.
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
yes. thanks anthony. so i would add in. so starting with q1 guidance, as glen mentioned, despite the fact that this is probably kind of the hardest and most severe impact that we've seen from covid across all of the waves that we've seen throughout the last couple of years, our q1 guidance kind of implies sort of a similar revenue level as to what we did last quarter, or last year or one year ago.
that winter wave that i guess last year did not hit us as simultaneously and as widespread as omicron did. so that's kind of what we're looking at for our q1 guidance. and as glen said, the good news is that we do feel like we're coming off the back of this. we're hearing hospitals talk about opening procedures in the march time frame.
so that timing of the reopening of two procedures, whether it's early or late march, that's going to affect and impact q1 a bit, but it's a matter of when and not if. and for the remainder of the year, we're feeling really, really good about our ability to quickly recover and regain momentum, right? so we've been consistently seeing strength and momentum in our business during periods of minimal covid impact throughout the year. we're building our base of accounts and increasing customer and patient demand. and if you overlay on top of all this an expectation that the worst of the pandemic seems to be behind us, i think we're very well set up for reacceleration through the remainder of the year.
that said, if there is one thing that we learned from last year, it's to prepare for the unexpected, and there does remain some uncertainty around things like the time course of resolution for hospital staffing shortages and potential for additional possible variants that might come later on in the year. so we've tried our best to factor all that into the guidance that we've provided. and so from where we sit today, we feel really, really good about our ability to achieve the guidance that we set out.
unknown speaker
got it. i appreciate the color.
operator
thank you. we have the next question comes from the line of larry biegelsen of wells fargo. your line is open. you may ask the question.
unknown speaker
hi, this is charles on for larry. just maybe digging in a bit more on the q1 guidance. so i'm just looking at the kind of year over year. i mean, 2021 also, i mean has a step down in q1 with the extra wave impact there.
although like this one, it's looking, your guidance is implying some 30% sequential step down over q4. so i think you've kind of explained that it's all hitting geographies at once, and so that makes sense. but is that implying that you might think that there's like a quicker rebound when it is done, if it's not a long process impacting all geographies at different times, might that come back a little bit faster than what you saw last year at the same time? and then i have another quick follow-up to that.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
well, with regard to rebound, we obviously look at a number of different measures. and right now, i think one of the things that we've reported on in the past has been the active accounts. and active accounts, for example, in january were basically 31%. so 70% of our u.s.
accounts were down in january, which you basically have to go back to the beginning of the pandemic to be down at that sort of level. late last year, or i should say, at the beginning of last year, late 2020, we got hit pretty hard as well. but that's the starting point. and we're seeing that build out in february, more and more accounts are coming back, and we're seeing our average daily sales sort of strengthen across the period.
so we are anticipating continued acceleration exiting the first quarter and then moving through the second quarter and beyond. thank you.
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
i would add to that, charles, that the other biggest difference that we have between this year and where we were a year ago is that we have about 45% more total treating centers in the u.s. than we did last year. so we have a much, much greater base of accounts. and so, when we see the recovery in procedures and the recovery and activity of our accounts, just by definition, that base of accounts that we have is much greater, and that's obviously going to be a significant tailwind for us this year versus last.
unknown speaker
ok. that's helpful. and my quick follow-up, you answered the percentage of centers doing procedures. you normally sometimes have a leading indicators with stratx scans seeing how many procedures might be coming and going forward.
when these facilities are shut down or restricted like that, do you still get that same leading indicator of stratx scans? are they still scheduling procedures further out when they -- when it might be open again? i wonder if you have any color there to share that's useful.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yes. that's a great question. so it's actually something that we talk about quite a bit, which is that when covid hits heavy in a particular geography and of course, omicron hit everywhere all at the same time. but typically, what happens is the folks that are managing the patients in the icu tend to be pulmonary and critical care specialists.
and when they get pulled away to do that service, they're not analyzing patients as possible candidates for our procedure. and as a consequence, much of the pipeline slows down. and so the pent-up demand, if you will, the sort of the first procedures that are done moving out of one of these waves are almost always largely composed of patients who are being rescheduled. so that's really what our pent-up demand is.
stratx was lumpy in the fourth quarter in the southeast, for example, which got hit hard in the third quarter, was actually strengthening in the fourth quarter. and we saw stratx up there, whereas the upper midwest and across to, through pennsylvania got hit hard in the fourth quarter, and we saw stratx down in that geography as well. so we do see stratx soften during heavy covid times. so it's not as though we were accumulating a lot of stratx scans in heavy hit areas during the omicron wave that's now receding.
unknown speaker
that's helpful. thanks glen and derrick.
operator
thank you. next question we have the line of jason bednar of piper sandler. your line is now open. you may ask your question.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
good afternoon everyone. so, i'll just ask another one here on the guide. i totally understand the challenges here that are weighing early in the year. but maybe hoping you can unpack a bit more why we shouldn't be thinking of account productivity improving even a little bit more than what seems to be reflected in the guide.
i guess is the guide just have you done some conservatism right now without yet seeing that volume come back in the door january, february? or is there something else that you're balancing with additional waves or hospital staffing issues as we think about the strength of that recovery coming back maybe beginning in that march-april time frame?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
we're obviously, jason, wanting to be very thoughtful about what we commit to here. and we did definitely see some strengthening in the productivity of accounts last year in times when there was -- in certain regions of the country that weren't being directly impacted. so that was really encouraging. i know that we've been tracking this and reporting on it across last year and the year before, and it has been significantly impacted by covid on average.
but when you break it down by region and look at the areas that are less impacted by covid, we did see strengthening. so to the extent that we see as we expect some reduction in the impact of covid across the coming year, we would expect to be moving that productivity number up.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. i guess that's helpful. and maybe i'll follow up just a bit, just by my model, playing with things here, it looks like productivity maybe doesn't improve until we get to like exiting this year and fourth quarter, maybe we can handle some of those offline. but just some quick back of the envelope, it looks like you're targeting maybe something in the range of 30% growth in u.s.
zephyr procedures for the second half of '22. and i'm not asking you to necessarily bless that, i know there's assumptions in there on what i'm assuming there for second quarter and how your international markets play out. but you've got some easy comps there from delta and omicron in third quarter and fourth quarter. i guess maybe the follow-up here is just why wouldn't procedure volumes be better than that 30% growth with the bigger customer footprint you have out there now?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
we are going to be -- we will focus on getting the engine going obviously in the back half of this quarter and accelerate, i think, pretty significantly on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the second quarter and then from the second quarter on to the third quarter. so i think we're looking at this in number of different ways, including the way that you're describing from a productivity perspective, but also when you begin to talk about increasing quarter over quarter by the magnitude that we're talking about across the year. it's -- we want to be thoughtful about what we're going to commit to.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. maybe if i could squeeze one more. is there any limitation you have like operationally or with your commercial infrastructure that would prevent like maybe a faster acceleration or whether that's anything at the end customer level or, again, with your own sales force or production? thanks.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
no. is the short answer. the business is fundamentally sound by our assessment. i mean, we're looking at metrics that are suggesting are providing us with great confidence as we talked about the calls that are going into hospitals are up 100% year over year, the social media is up over 100%, and these are big numbers.
we're in the six figures now in terms of followers. we initiated in the latter part of 2020, a patient opt-in option where we can engage with patients and really cultivate and nurture their journey toward treatment. and we've seen just a spectacular growth going from five figures to nearly six figures in that regard. so we've got a lot of things that really seem to be lining up in addition to having, as derrick said, 45% more accounts than we did the year before.
we've got more reps, referring docs are clearly focused on what we're doing and we're focused on them. and so, i don't think there's anything in our supply, our ability to supply is there. so we're just trying to get the engine sort of restarted. we hadn't experienced this before.
the only other time where we were down at this level really was at the start of the pandemic, and that was really about the reservation of capacity. what i'm saying is, like, for example, in california, you'd have 600 bed hospitals that were largely closing their doors to just about everything. and then none of the patients showed up here in california. so there's a tremendous amount of reservation, whereas with this omicron and the sort of infection rate in the u.s.
estimated at about 10 times, even though the follow-through to the icu was way less on a proportional basis, it still drove a ton of patients into the icu across the u.s. and across all of our major ous markets. so the good news is it came on -- or i guess the bad news is it came on superfast. but the good news is we're way down the curve.
and we are seeing, and we're hearing the engines start. and we're seeing this week, last week, revenues strengthened significantly and looking at our scheduled procedures going forward, we're quite encouraged by what we see and also what we hear from our customers. so no constraints here. the fundamentals are solid.
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
yes, and if i could just jump in, going back to your question on growth rates, jason. our guidance, while you're correct in that, on average, in the back three quarters of the year may imply approximately 30% growth in the u.s. our guidance implies well over 30% growth exiting the u.s., right? and so, that average really incorporates the sort of restart coming off this omicron wave that we're hitting. and frankly, some of the uncertainty is around how quickly the accounts can bounce back and how quickly we restart.
but we expect to be exiting the year at a year-over-year growth rate in the u.s. and globally, of well over 30%.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks guys.
operator
thank you. we have the next question comes from the line of rick wise from stifel. your line is now open. you may ask your question.
rick wise -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
good afternoon glen. hi, derrick. i was hoping if you could break down this sort of recovery discussion in a little more granular way. i feel like we've been sort of talking about the numbers holistically, a little more leaning toward the u.s.
maybe glen talk a little bit more about what's happening internationally. i mean, the truth is when i look at my numbers, the u.s. held up better than i might have thought, sort of sequentially flattish, 4q versus 3q. the ous was a lot weaker than i expected in modeling.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
rick wise -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
i will just squeeze this last little bit. so was ous worse than you expected? is the recovery happening equally in each geography? how are you thinking about the unfolding of the year in that way? thank you.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
boy, there's a lot in that question. so let me just try. so starting at the beginning of that. yes, we were pleased with the way that we last reported in early november, and we were looking ahead.
and a lot of things were going on at that time. if you look at any of the curves, they all seem to bend pretty dramatically upward within a day or so of that time point. but we were pleased with how things ended up in the u.s., all things considered. we were getting impacted pretty significantly in the fourth quarter in the upper midwest.
in fact, in a place like michigan, the delta variant actually impacted upper -- omicron was a bit of a reliever for them, because they were getting hit so hard late in the year in the upper midwest. and so -- but at the end of the day, we have a lot of accounts in the united states, and so we were able to perform reasonably well in the fourth quarter and came in, in a fairly solid way. i think where we didn't expect things to play out exactly the way they did was the acceleration of the delta variant, most particularly in german-speaking parts of europe. and in those german-speaking parts of europe, sort of in southern germany, bavaria and saxony, we're particularly heavily hit.
and so i think that we got impacted in a subset of europe, a big part of our business to a degree that we did not anticipate. so i think that really explained the shortfall to what our expectations were the last time we reported. so that's where we're coming out at this point. and then in those geographies, if you look at michigan, the shape of the curve in michigan is very much like the shape of the curve in a place like germany, where it looks like delta just handed off to omicron.
so they went from a really bad situation to an even worse situation. and then omicron hit in all other geographies and is essentially undermined to some extent, the one that is sort of the leaping off point that we had anticipated. and we are anticipating a much more solid first quarter, which omicron is going to get in the way of. and so that largely explains the shortfall that you see totaling across the year.
as derrick had mentioned, though, i think that if you look at -- we're not providing specific guidance, but i suppose if you're doing the math on the back of the envelope, the velocity at which we're exiting this year, 2022 is in the neighborhood of where i think we were thinking about or many of the models at the time of the ipo were having us in that kind of neighborhood exiting 2022. so we're making up a lot of ground. i think we feel really good about the foundation that we've put in place and how we're going to leverage that across the year.
rick wise -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yes. that's great color. and maybe just last from me on gross margin. here too, relative to my expectations, gross margins were better than we looked for in the fourth quarter despite these headwinds and challenges.
maybe just -- maybe i just didn't take it in. maybe you could, derrick talk about that again. and i'd be curious, you've emphasized today and as you have in the past, the long-term potential for high 70s, it's like what's required, what kind of revenue base is required to get to that territory? is it just revenues? or is it something else?
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
yes. thanks for that question, rick. so we're feeling really good about our gross margin, right? this quarter, we delivered just under 75%. that's the highest that we've ever delivered in the history of the company.
so clearly, we're seeing the benefits of our production efficiencies and overhead absorption that i talked about materializing as we expected. we're always going to see some fluctuations in margin from quarter-to-quarter depending on in-period costs and product mix and things like that. but over time, we do expect our gross margins to continue to move higher as we've seen over the last couple of years. that said, in the near-term, we are going to be making some investments in scaling our overall production infrastructure and adding some redundancy to our supply chain, which i think is ever important in the current environment.
and we're also cognizant of some of these supply chain pricing pressures. we're seeing some very modest pricing pressure, all very manageable, but we are seeing some hints of modest pricing pressure that's similar to what's being felt across the industry. so that's why we are guiding to stay kind of within this 74% to 75% range for the year right now. hopefully, we'll be able to do a little better than that, but that's where we're comfortable kind of starting the year at.
but we do expect, as i mentioned, that over time, well, as you mentioned, too, that we'll continue to creep that gross margin up. and i think we can get to kind of the high 70% range over the next few years. and i think that still is primarily driven by continued production volume increases that drives production efficiencies. and so, i think when we get into that revenue range, with a nine-digit number starting with one, somewhere in that range, and that's when i would expect that we would get to that high 70% gross margin range.
and we feel very good about getting there.
rick wise -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst

glen french -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, lane. good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. here with me is derrick sung, our chief financial officer. today, i would like to share a few highlights and contextualize our fourth-quarter results before turning to our outlook and strategic priorities for 2022.
looking back on 2021, i'm very proud of the progress our team has made in an unquestionably challenging and unpredictable environment. for the full year 2021, we delivered $48.4 million in worldwide sales, grew our business 48% over 2020 and achieved three consecutive quarters of record sales, all while executing on each of our commercial and strategic goals. specifically, we increased our commercial footprint in 2021, growing our base of u.s. treating centers 45% to 214 centers, enabling us to exceed our target of opening at least 200 centers by the end of the year.
we met our sales force expansion targets, building out our u.s. sales management team to 9 region directors, adding nine new sales territories in the u.s. to bring our total to 54 and adding 6 territories outside the u.s., bringing our total international territories to 34. we secured 10 positive coverage policies predominantly within the blue cross blue shield association, including anthem and thereby added coverage for over 50 million lives across the united states.
we submitted in december 2021, our regulatory filings seeking approval for zephyr valve in japan, and we initiated enrollment in our aeriseal convert trial, a multicenter, multinational study in europe. turning now to our performance in the fourth quarter. we delivered another quarter of record sales in the u.s., growing our business to $7.3 million. in the fourth quarter, we saw strength in the southern parts of the united states, which were previously impacted by the delta variant, offset by a new increase in covid cases in the midwest.
outside the united states, we recorded $6.4 million of sales despite being impacted by a mid- to late quarter delta variant surge across major regions of europe. as we entered 2022, the impact from the recent omicron surge was widespread and simultaneous affecting all of our major u.s. and european markets. we expect the first quarter of 2022 to be significantly impacted by covid with a recovery in our business starting in q2 and with revenues continuing to accelerate in the back half of the year.
taking this into account, we expect first quarter 2022 revenues to be similar to the first quarter of 2021 in the range of $9 million to $10 million and full year 2022 revenues to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million. despite the omicron impact in the first quarter, we have conviction in the fundamentals of our business and the strength of our team. all signs continue to point to strong underlying demand for our zephyr valve treatment. physicians and hospitals remain eager to adopt our procedure as evidenced by 16 new hospitals, which treated their first zephyr valve patients in the fourth quarter.
patient interest has never been stronger as indicated by a more than doubling of patient calls into treating centers through 2021 as compared to 2020 and a doubling of the number of social media followers. and throughout the pandemic, we have proven that we've been able to adapt and grow our business, demonstrating strong commercial momentum during periods less affected by covid. to best position ourselves for the recovery and procedure volumes, we will continue to focus on commercial initiatives in 2022 to expand our global footprint and drive awareness of our zephyr valve therapy. while we now have full geographic coverage in the u.s.
with our 54 sales territories, we will selectively and opportunistically add additional sales territories throughout the year and expect to end the year with around 60 territories in the u.s. we expect to continue our current pace of opening new centers and are targeting to have approximately 280 u.s. treating centers opened by the end of the year. on the international front, we will continue the expansion of our sales force and expect to add approximately three to five additional sales territories throughout the year, primarily within europe.
in addition, we will be making preparations for our geographic expansion into japan. as i mentioned earlier, we formally submitted our regulatory application for zephyr valve to the japanese authorities in december of 2021. under the filing time line, we anticipate regulatory approval by the end of this year. following the establishment of reimbursement, we expect to launch commercial efforts in the back half of 2023, entering what we estimate to be a $1 billion market with approximately 100,000 patients in need of our zephyr valve treatment.
to prepare for commercialization, we expect to bring on a commercial leader and to start assembling a direct presence in japan in the latter part of this year. finally, we are excited about the progress our aeriseal clinical development program has made. last year, we initiated a multicenter international clinical trial studying the use of aeriseal to convert patients with collateral ventilation into zephyr valve eligible patients and expect to continue enrollment of this study through 2022. we also continue to progress with preclinical studies required for an ida application with fda to conduct a u.s.
pivotal trial. in summary, we are well-positioned to accelerate growth in our business and to provide our life-changing zephyr valve therapy to patients as we move out of the covid pandemic. the underlying demand for our treatment and the capabilities of our team have never been stronger, and i am confident in our ability to execute on our initiatives and goals as we've done in the past. i'll now turn the call over to derrick to provide a more detailed review of our fourth-quarter results.
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
thank you, glen, and good afternoon, everyone. total worldwide revenue for the three months ended december 31, 2021, was $13.7 million, a 39% increase from $9.8 million in the same period of the prior year and an increase of 40% on a constant currency basis. u.s. revenue in the fourth quarter was $7.3 million, a 49% increase from $4.9 million during the prior-year period.
the record u.s. sales reflect strong procedure growth and commercial momentum of our business in regions less affected by covid. international revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 was $6.4 million, a 30% increase from $5 million during the same period last year and an increase of 31% on a constant currency basis. international procedure volumes were impacted by the covid wave that swept through parts of europe in the back half of the quarter and led to the regional hospital procedure restrictions.
gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 74.8% compared to 72% in the prior year period. the year-over-year expansion in gross margin was driven by improved production efficiencies. looking ahead, we expect gross margin to remain between 74% and 75% in 2022 as production efficiencies are partially offset by investments to add scale and redundancy to our supply chain as well as increases in material costs. over the longer term, we continue to expect margins to gradually move up into the high 70% range.
total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $22.6 million, a 38% increase from $16.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. stock-based compensation expense was $2.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 and $9.9 million for the full year 2021. looking ahead, we expect operating expenses for the full year 2022 to fall between 100 and $105 million, inclusive of approximately $16 million of noncash stock-based compensation expense as we continue to build out our commercial operations, invest in our research and development programs and further scale our business. r&d expenses for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $3.7 million compared to $2.5 million in the same period of the prior year.
the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel, clinical study, regulatory and development-related expenses needed to support our product development and clinical research activities. sales, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $18.9 million compared to $14.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. the increase was attributable to an increase in sales and marketing expenses as we expanded our commercial team and increased commercial activities and an increase in public company expenses related to the scaling of our general and administrative infrastructure. net loss for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $13 million or a loss of $0.35 per share as compared to a net loss of $9.3 million or a loss of $0.27 per share for the same period of the prior year.
and average weighted share count of 36.6 million shares was used to determine loss per share for the fourth quarter of 2021. we ended december 31, 2021 with $191 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, a decrease of $11.7 million from september 30, 2021. finally, turning to our revenue outlook for 2022. we expect full year 2022 revenue to fall in the range of $55 million to $60 million, which represents 14% to 24% revenue growth over 2021 and approximately 17% to 27% growth on a constant currency basis as we estimate foreign exchange to present about a 3% headwind to global sales growth.
as previously mentioned, we have been seeing a significant widespread impact from the omicron surge since the start of this year, which has resulted in the delay in disruption of zephyr valve procedures. given this unique circumstance, we are providing quarterly guidance on a one-time basis for the first quarter of 2022 to be in the range of $9 million to $10 million. based on current trends, we expect to see a recovery in our business in the second quarter and a sequential improvement in sales throughout the remainder of the year as procedure volumes normalize. with that, i'd like to thank you all for your attention, and we will now open the call up for questions.

",2021-Q4,LUNG
,1.0,,,":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from travis steed of bank of america. your line is open.
travis steed -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. congrats on the quarter, and thanks for the questions. i'd love to get a little more color on march and april kind of versus early q1. and derrick, it looks like the guidance for q2 is basically unchanged versus three months ago, still in line with q4.
but you noticed or you mentioned the recovery leading indicators. so i'd love to see why you're not updating the q2 guidance at this point.
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
sure, travis. thanks for that question. i'll take the latter part on guidance and glen can provide some of the commentary that we saw through the quarter into q2. so travis, we're feeling very good about our business based on the recovery that we saw in the back half of q1, right? all the early indicators suggest an enduring recovery is underway.
the momentum that we're seeing going into q2 does give us a lot of confidence in our ability to achieve the $55 million to $60 million guidance that we previously laid out. that said, i would say that at this early point in the year, haven't just laid out our initial guidance two and a half months ago, it just feels premature for us to be changing our guidance based only on a couple of months of relative strength coming off a pretty deep bottom that we hit at the beginning of the year. so we certainly expect and hope that the worst of the pandemic is behind us. but if we've learned one thing from last year, it's not to underestimate the continuing impact that covid might have.
so there still remains some uncertainty around the impact of hospital staffing and possible future variants, and we just don't want to get in front of our skis at this point before we get some more visibility into how some of these uncertainties might play out. so again, we feel very good about what we're seeing in the recovery to this point and the momentum going into the quarter, but we just don't want to get out in front of our skis. glen, do you want to comment on the monthly cadence and what we're seeing into the quarter?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
sorry about that. i was on mute. as we reported last time, the first half of the quarter was -- i mean, january was significantly impacted by covid. in the back half of the quarter, we accelerated out.
we had, as is always the case, the first cases that are done are those that are rescheduled. and so those january cases that were scheduled and halfway through february as well were the first ones to pull back out. so march contained a good bit of, i guess, what some people call backlog, and that explains kind of how we came out of the quarter. and we think that most of that backlog got consumed, if you will, across the latter part of february and into march.
travis steed -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
no, that -- thanks for the color, and it all makes sense in the q2 guidance. when you think about the staffing constraints, just curious what you're seeing on the ground. is that still a pretty big constraint now and how you're expecting that to improve over the course of the year?
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
yeah. so we have definitely seen -- it hits in a lot of different ways, and i'm sure you hear it a lot. i mean, we're not in that many centers, right? so we're at about in the low 200s right now. and in the centers that we're in, the way that it impacts us is in multiple ways actually.
physicians and some of the treating docs are getting impacted. but the turnaround in terms of how long folks are out before they come back is relatively short. the broader staffing issue, which i believe is probably the theme that you're talking about has impacted things. the way that we see that, we are able to continue to do procedures in virtually all the hospitals, i would say staffing probably delayed the rebound of some of the hospitals coming out of the sort of the omicron wave.
and what's happening is that i think they're trying to sort of spread things around. so it's not uncommon in certain hospitals that might have been clipping along sort of prior to the stresses on staffing at, say, four patients per month to be asked to do fewer than that as we come back out. as it relates to working our way through this, there are some broader issues that i think are going to take some time to get through. i think when i listen to folks who are running hospitals are talking about staffing issues carrying through the end of the year, i think as it relates to the kinds of patients that we're treating and the staffing associated with the execution of procedures, i think a quarter or two, and those will largely wash away just because of the revenue generation of having those procedures properly staffed.

glen french -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from cecilia furlong of morgan stanley. your line is open.
cecilia furlong -- morgan stanley -- analyst
good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. i wanted to follow up a bit on the staffing issue, but really ask just what you've seen from an account productivity standpoint coming out of this wave versus what you've seen in prior ways. and again, just factoring in what you're seeing on the ground from a staffing standpoint, potentially limiting greater acceleration.
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
yeah. well, we report on productivity really on a quarterly basis and productivity was significantly impacted in the first quarter, as you might imagine. so it was quite a bit down from sort of where we had been running through the prior waves, which is really just explained, i think, entirely by the fact that no other wave hit everywhere at the same time. and so it was whether you're talking about our global business or whether you're talking about regions within the united states, there were always engines that were running at full speed while we were getting crushed in other regions, which wasn't the case with omicron.
and as a consequence, if you can imagine, effectively shutting down, to a large extent, procedures during nearly half the quarter, that's not literally the case. but i mean it really impacted us. our productivity got impacted as well. so it's probably not even a particularly interesting measure for the quarter.
and account activity, which is another metric that we've looked at has also got impacted, as you might imagine, in similar ways to the way that it has, i think, in the past, down into the 30s and so forth, most particularly in the january and february time frame. how much of that is due to account staffing, i think it was where -- i think that the -- how we're pulling out of this is really more impacted by the actual shutdown of accounts, i think the -- our business was impacted in the first half of the quarter because there was still a significant proportion of the population that had yet to be vaccinated. there continued to be about a 13-fold increase in the number of unvaccinated people who -- the probability they were occupying an icu bed versus a vaccinated person. i think the difference in the environment that we're in right now is that nearly everyone in the united states is no longer naive to covid.
we've got two-thirds of the population that's been vaccinated twice, at least considered fully vaccinated, 77% to 85% of the u.s. population, depending on which source you want to look at, has been vaccinated once. and last week, i think there was multiple reports of new data coming out of the cdc, which indicated that 60% of people in the united states have had covid already. so if you -- i mean, there's just very few people, less than 10% of the u.s.
population, less than 10% of the european population is naive, where two years ago, the human race was naive to covid. so we anticipate that as we look ahead, we think covid is going to continue to be an issue for us. we think staffing is probably going to be a little bit of an issue for us as we pull out of this and move ahead, but we see that waning in the relatively near term, certainly before the end of the year.
cecilia furlong -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. great. and if i could follow up as well, specifically on referring physician awareness and how you would really quantify that at this point. and as you look forward, as covid is pulling back, just the initiatives you have in place to continue to drive referring physician awareness higher?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
thank you for that question, cecilia. it's a very important and insightful question. obviously, over the long haul, this business is going to really grow based on account productivity and 80% of patients are coming through -- right today, 80% of our patients that get treated are coming through referring physicians. and we don't have sufficient awareness.
at least we haven't to this point, we've been really focused on getting treating sites up and running. and i think as you've heard from us, and probably this is where the question is coming from, we believe that increasing the awareness and the support of the referring physicians is really central to both our marketing and sales activity as we move ahead. so we've fundamentally reoriented our sales process to focus more on the referring physicians than was the case in the past where we're really talking about what are the best practices for opening up new centers. we're going to continue to do that.
but we've really shifted the focus not only of sales training, but also sales execution on opening up these new sites. now this has become a primary area of focus effectively starting at the beginning of this year. so it faced a good bit of headwind and crosswind from the omicron insult that we experienced. and as a consequence, we're still gathering data as we move forward as to the direct results.
i mean it will clearly be seen we expect in our revenue numbers as we move ahead. that's probably the best metric of how we're going to have impact through the referring physicians. the other thing that i think we've talked about before, and i mentioned in the script, is that we're really focusing on engaging with the patients as well. often the patients can provide introduction to the referring doctors.
we have a talk to my doctor program where they can actually come to us in a very compliant way and ask us to follow up with their doctors to give them some information. and there's no hotter lead than you're going to get than it is for a patient to their doctor, where we can specifically go in and say that jane doe has indicated. we're seeing those going up those requests for us to engage. we're also seeing from the direct contact from patients, their willingness to opt in to provide us with authorization to go back and forth with them and help nurture their information needs and in a sense, their journey toward the treating physician.
so -- and that often will involve providing them with information to deliver to the referring physician as well. so we're attacking the referring physician, not only through sort of marketing activity, sales activity, but also equipping the patients to be their own advocates with physicians or being a surrogate with that talk to my doctor program.
cecilia furlong -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you for taking the questions.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from jason bednar of piper sandler. your line is open.
unknown speaker -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, guys. thanks for taking my questions. this is joe on for jason. so i just have a question on the japanese regulatory submission.
has there been any interaction or feedback with the japanese authorities thus far? and then in terms of any structural dynamics or anything pre or post off that we should be thinking about for when those up for launches in that market that would make the penetration factory any different from what we've seen in the previous market entries.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
the japanese regulatory process has been remarkably and consistently interactive. so we have had -- i don't -- i would say -- i haven't been directly involved, but i would say we are interacting weekly. so one way or another. so it's been great.
and we've gotten questions. we've addressed those questions. we've scheduled meetings and those meetings have gone actually shorter and better than we had anticipated. so it seems to be moving along well and the interactions to this point have been frequent and substantive, and i frankly would have expected that if there were going to be any major issues that would have popped already.
so we feel comfortable and confident that we'll get that regulatory approval before the end of this year, as we've stated multiple times in the past. with regard to structural requirements, we are in the process of trying to identify a great general manager for that marketplace. i think we talked about either in the last quarter or so that we had added our first employee in japan. so we've got feet there.
we're working through a bunch of consultants that are in market as well, and we're going to be building out sort of a relatively small framework of an organization there to ensure that we're ready to move when we've got reimbursement in place. and again, reimbursement is tagged on to the end of that process. so we see ourselves in that market late next year. so with regard to how we expect that market to behave as it relates to, for example, launching in the u.s.
or any other of the markets that we've entered relatively recently that when we enter the market is important because the u.s. was the first market that we entered in the world where we had all of the data published, we were in the global guidelines, reimbursement was in place. and so japan, like the u.s. and like markets that we've entered since we entered the u.s., we would expect to benefit from that.
having said that, it's a very hierarchical market, which means that there's a handful or two handfuls of physicians that we will be going to first. they will be setting the tone and woes to anybody who doesn't go to them first. so we know who they are. we have relationships with most of them already, and we will make sure that they were the first ones to do the cases and they will lead the way.
so we see year one and year two maybe relate in contrast to, say, france, the market that we entered around the time we entered the united states or the united states is maybe not being quite as steep a slope, but we see it sloping up and looking very much like these other markets maybe on a per capita basis.
unknown speaker -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. that's super helpful. and then just one more for me. just touching on like new roles as you mentioned in japan, but moving over to new tire tours in the u.s.
and europe, as you've mentioned. and through these calls, could you just give an update on whether there have been any other notable adds, i guess, outside of japan in the past few months? and then what's the plan today in terms of actually filling these roles?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
i missed part of that question. derrick, did you get it all?
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
i did. so i think you were asking, joe, about new territory adds outside the u.s. and within the u.s. in q1, we did not add any new territories either outside of the u.s.
or within the u.s. so we still have 34 active territories outside the u.s. and 54 in the u.s. we continue, as we mentioned now in the last call, to plan to add selectively in both geographies.
and we expect to be near 60-ish by the end of this year in the u.s. and we'll add a handful, three to five or so internationally as well throughout the year. so we plan to continue adding but none specifically in q1.

unknown speaker -- piper sandler -- analyst
good afternoon. this is actually anthony on for joanne. thanks for taking our question. can you just talk about what early demand has been like at the new training facility and then just give maybe any general commentary on what the physician training pipeline is like? thanks.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
demand. so things have been -- it's been great, i think. we opened it up. i think we're doing a training class today, i think, at that new facility in the midwest.
i think that is our second that we have done so far since we've opened it up. the first returns from the first training program was that the guy who's running it is doing a spectacular job and that all elements, ranging from the hotel to the program to the presenters has all been very, very positive. so, it effectively doubles our capacity. i think what will happen was well -- we won't likely run twice as many people through now that we have a second training center.
i think what we'll do is we'll make the classes a little bit smaller, and we'll just probably going to be happening something on the order of every other week, something on that order. so we'll be clipping along and it's great to have this new capacity in the sky, like i said, this new center is doing a spectacular job.
unknown speaker -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. thanks.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
thank you. i'm showing no further questions at this time. i'd like to turn the call back over to glen french for any closing remarks.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
wonderful. thank you very much. as we've talked about, the first half of the first quarter was just very difficult for us with omicron hitting sort of in every market effectively at the same time. in light of this, i was very, very pleased with our performance in the first quarter.
as we look ahead, we anticipate a very steep revenue slope. but given some of the challenges that we faced in the past and those that go along with scaling new medical technology, we want to be sure that we don't get ahead of ourselves. having said that, i'd like to talk about just very quickly or summarize some of the things that give us a great deal of optimism as we look ahead. number of treating centers is increasing.
we have an increasing number of trained physicians, awareness of our treatment option with referring doctors as a central focus of our marketing and sales activity. we've got a process in place where we're sharing best practices across our treating centers. and then finally, this concept of inbound patient interest, covid shut us down for roughly half of the first quarter, but it didn't shut down patient interest. when you looked at fourth quarter 2021 and you compare it to first quarter of 2022, in the first quarter, social media connections were up, calls into our treating centers were up relative to the fourth quarter.
we have now more than 100,000 patients that have opted in, which gives us that opportunity to go back and forth. and we've kicked off this patient-centric call-in center, which will allow a single point of consistent contact for two-way exchange of information with our treating physicians. so we believe we have the right plans in place and a great team in place with a great deal of experience that's working toward making those plans a reality. so i just want to thank you all for your interest in pulmonx and for your time today, and good afternoon.

glen french -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, brian. good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings call. here with me is derrick sung, our chief financial officer. overall, we were encouraged by the progress of our business in the first quarter.
we saw widespread impact from the omicron wave followed by a recovery that gained momentum as treatment centers began to reschedule and conduct procedures. the strength and timing of this recovery enabled us to achieve $10.8 million in worldwide sales above the high end of our expectations. we observed recovery trends, which extended not only to hospital procedure upticks, but also to leading indicators such as stratx uploads and calls into our patient reimbursement support team. based on these trends, we have increased confidence in our ability to achieve our previously communicated full year revenue guidance of $55 million to $60 million.
despite the impact of covid, we also continued to make steady progress on initiatives to expand our global commercial footprint and to drive clinician and patient awareness of our zephyr valve. centers and physicians remain eager to begin offering our treatment, resulting in the addition of 16 new treating centers in the u.s. during the first quarter, bringing our total u.s. treating centers to 230.
we remain on track to meet our year-end objective of offering zephyr valves to at least 280 treating centers in the united states. as we accelerate sales, we are investing in infrastructure to support increased patient and physician demand. to help respond to the significant levels of patient interest in our technology, we have launched a call center to field product-related patient inquiries. further, we recently opened our second u.s.
physician training center to provide clinical education for the growing number of clinicians interested in performing our zephyr valve procedures. on the reimbursement front, we secured yet another positive policy win, adding over 3 million covered lives with independence blue cross, the third largest payer in pennsylvania and a key payer in the mid-atlantic region. independence blue cross is the 12th blue cross blue shield plan to post positive coverage for zephyr valves, and we have now streamlined access to treatment with zephyr valves to over 75% of all blue cross blue shield covered lives and over 90% of all u.s. commercially covered lives.
reflecting additional progress on the clinical front, the society of cardiothoracic surgery in great britain and ireland released its standards for lung volume reduction, which endorsed the use of endobronchial valves to improve outcomes in patients with severe emphysema. we were also pleased that the journal respiratory medicine published a study in april finding that bronchoscopic lung volume reduction may extend the life expectancy of patients with copd and severe lung hyperinflation. in this observational study of nearly 1,500 severe copd patients, those treated with valves to reduce their lung volume survived significantly longer than those patients who did not receive an implant. and treatment with valves was found to be an independent predictor of survival.
the study adds to the ever-growing body of evidence demonstrating the clinical benefits of our zephyr valves. we also look forward to attending the american thoracic society international conference from may 13 through the 18th in san francisco. our treatment remains a central topic of discussion across the pulmonary medicine space as reflected by the numerous scientific posters and presentations that will feature bronchoscopic lung volume reduction at ats this year. this will be the first major pulmonary medical congress since the start of the pandemic where we will have an in-person booth presence, and we look forward to driving commercial and clinical awareness of our zephyr valve therapy.
we also continue to make good progress with our clinical development initiatives. we're excited about our aeriseal clinical development program, which stands to expand our addressable market to patients not currently eligible for zephyr valves due to an incomplete fissure between lobes, which allows collateral ventilation. we estimate some level of collateral ventilation to be present in just under half of severe emphysema patients presenting a tremendous opportunity for aeriseal to complement our zephyr valve therapy. our development program is now focused on using aeriseal to seal fissure gaps.
this will provide a path to treatment with zephyr valves for many patients who are not candidates today. this application of aeriseal is being studied in our convert trial, a multi-center, multinational feasibility study, which we are running in europe. we hope to present a first look at the preliminary data from a subset of these convert patients later this fall. information that we learn from convert will be used to inform the design of our u.s.
ide study. lastly, from a geographic expansion perspective, we continue to expect regulatory approval of our zephyr valve treatment in japan by the end of the year. following the establishment of reimbursement, we expect to launch commercial efforts in the back half of next year, entering what we estimate to be a $1 billion opportunity with approximately 100,000 patients in need of zephyr valve treatment. in summary, i'm optimistic about the trajectory of our business as we accelerate out of the pandemic.
in particular, i'm looking forward to the back half of this year when we expect to demonstrate our ability to grow our business in the absence of significant covid headwinds. and when we hope to achieve some of the previously mentioned long-term growth milestones to expand our addressable market. with that, i'll now turn the call over to derrick to provide a more detailed review of our first quarter results.
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
thank you, glen, and good afternoon, everyone. total worldwide revenue for the three months ended march 31, 2022, was $10.8 million, a 17% increase from $9.2 million in the same period of the prior year and an increase of 20% on a constant currency basis. u.s. revenue in the first quarter was $6 million, a 40% increase from $4.3 million during the prior year period.
international revenue in the first quarter of 2022 was $4.8 million, a 4% decrease from $5 million during the same period last year and an increase of 3% on a constant currency basis. global revenue was affected by the covid omicron variant that swept across nearly all regions of our business at the start of the year and impacted the ability of hospitals to schedule procedures. hospitals restarted procedures in the back half of the quarter as a covid wave passed through. gross margin for the first quarter of 2022 was 75%, compared to 72% in the prior year period.
the year-over-year expansion in gross margin was driven by increasing production efficiencies, and we continue to expect gross margin to remain in the 74% to 75% range for the remainder of the year. total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2022 were $23.8 million, a 24% increase from $19.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. stock-based compensation expense was $3.4 million in the first quarter of 2022. we continue to expect operating expenses for the full year of 2022 to fall between $100 million to $105 million, inclusive of approximately $16 million of noncash stock-based compensation expense, as we continue to build out our commercial operations, invest in our research and development programs and further scale our business.
r&d expenses for the first quarter of 2022 were $3.5 million, compared to $3 million in the same period of the prior year. the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel, clinical study, regulatory and development-related expenses needed to support our product development and clinical research activities. sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2022 were $20.2 million, compared to $16.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. the increase was attributable to an increase in sales and marketing expenses as we expanded our commercial team and increased commercial activities and an increase in public company expenses related to the scaling of our general and administrative infrastructure.
net loss for the first quarter of 2022 was $15.8 million or a loss of $0.43 per share, as compared to a net loss of $12.5 million or a loss of $0.35 per share for the same period of the prior year. an average weighted share count of 36.8 million shares was used to determine loss per share for the first quarter of 2022. we ended march 31, 2022, with $176.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, a decrease of $14.5 million from december 31, 2021. finally, turning to our outlook for 2022.
with the recovery that we are seeing in our business, we remain confident in our ability to achieve full year 2022 revenue in the range of $55 million to $60 million. we expect to see sales in the second quarter recover back to levels seen near the end of last year, followed by sequential growth through the remainder of 2022 as procedure volumes normalize. and with that, i'd like to thank you for your attention, and we will now open the call up for questions. operator?
",2022-Q1,LUNG
0.90725,,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from cecilia furlong with morgan stanley. your line is open.
cecilia furlong -- morgan stanley -- analyst
good afternoon and thank you for taking the questions. i wanted to start just on the quarter, but glen or derrick , if you could just talk through what you saw from an active account standpoint as the quarter progressed in the u.s.? and then, any commentary you could talk to just in terms of looking at single centers, some of your centers that adopted zephyr earlier pre-covid or non-covid, but what you saw from just a volume ramp through the quarter? and any color you could provide to just on the exit rates as you think about especially entering the summer months.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so a few different things that you brought up there. so with regard to active accounts, the june was stronger than may and april. but the average across the period was 76%, which was right where we had expected it was going to be.
so that was smack on what our expectations were. so that was good. you had asked about some of the accounts that were up and running around when covid hit, some of our stronger accounts. is that where you were going? you wanted to know how they were doing?
cecilia furlong -- morgan stanley -- analyst
correct. does it had more experience have been in the field [inaudible].
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yes. what we saw, and it's actually kind of -- i could go far afield with this, but basically, accounts that are the more deeply experienced sort of more deeply engaged accounts as you would expect, we're the first ones to come back. so we did see that. many of those accounts were the ones that had an uninterrupted year prior to covid hitting.
and obviously, all the accounts that started since the beginning of 2020 have been interrupted with covid along the way. and so, the strongest are the most experienced and the most up-to-speed accounts. so they came back early. we also saw that actually remarkably in our international numbers when you looked at those.
we've got 60% of our business that's in the united states. the other 40%, obviously, is outside the united states. and three quarters falls into four countries. so we sell product into 25-plus different countries, but 90% of our business is in the u.s., germany, france and u.k.
and austria. and in the u.s., we grew on a constant currency basis, 31% in the u.s. over prior year and 20% in those bigger markets. so combined 27.3% and what we saw was that in that small 10% of our business was virtually where all of our shortfall was.
and i think it really reflects that idea that these smaller countries, smaller accounts, most cases without a direct sales organization are much slower to come back online, and we saw that in the smaller accounts in the united states as well. about half of our shortfall in that 10% of our business came from asia, almost all from china. and the others came from smaller european markets. but anyway, i went a little bit beyond what you were asking about, but i think it is important to note that those smaller accounts tend to come back less quickly than the bigger accounts.
and so, we definitely saw that in the u.s. and across our top five markets, which all did quite well relative to our expectations. the last area that you asked about was summer and what we think about where we are. we see a lot of nice things lining up.
we don't really have perfect information on the summertime. it's been confounded by covid a bit, and it's also been confounded by our just inherent growth across prior years and so forth. so we feel good about the summer, particularly in the united states. we've always seen somewhat of a summer slowdown in europe.
we won't see it in australia, which is our fifth largest market, just because seasonality puts that more around christmas time. but in any case, we will see a little bit of a slowdown in europe, but we always see a really strong september at the end in a late august rebound in europe, and we expect to power our way through things in the united states.
cecilia furlong -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. and if i could follow up, too, just in terms of what you're seeing in the field today, just from a capacity standpoint, staffing constraints and how that factored into your back half guidance as we think about both the u.s. and ous, but sequential ramp and the ability to really be operating across the healthcare system closer to full capacity? and again, just really how you're thinking about contributions from some of your older sites versus more recent additions, especially as you think about the 3q to 4q sequential dynamic.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
sure. well, capacity is an interesting thing because it used to be that it was a binary matter. covid would present and would shut us down. and now what we're seeing, it's interesting, that blanket.
the impact of covid on our business isn't related to the number of cases because there's tons of cases out there right now. it was really impacted by how those -- if and how those patients would progress into the intensive care units. and we're clearly seeing fewer much smaller proportion of patients that are in the hospital because of covid finding their way into the icu. so that constraint, which was literally like a light switch for our business, is not presenting itself in the same sort of way.
but what it's revealing is sort of that big heavy blankets come off. and now we're for the first time experiencing what we've heard from a lot of other companies with regard to staffing and so forth. so there is a real, i think, capacity thing that hospitals are working their way out of, as i said, i mean, i feel good about the way we've been able to power our way through a lot of that given the diversity of our business across various different markets and both in the u.s. and outside the united states.
so i think that's where my thinking is on capacity. i don't know, derrick, if you have any thoughts on the question?
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
all right. i think you said [inaudible] we factored in a bit. i'm sorry, i was on mute. i apologize.
so i was just going to say that we have incorporated the thinking around hospital staffing shortages into our guidance. and so, that is incorporated into our forward-looking thinking for the remainder of the year.
cecilia furlong -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you for taking the question.
operator
our next question comes from travis steed with bofa securities. your line is open.
travis steed -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking the question. derrick, just to put a little more specifics on the q3 comment. you said typical seasonality, but still quarter-over-quarter growth. i think -- the street did like $16 million.
i just want to make sure that's the right place to be for q3. i'm curious how you think about the lower end versus the higher end of the guidance for 2022 with some of the puts and takes on that?
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
yes, it's a great question, travis. so i would continue to think about modeling to the midpoint of our guidance as kind of how we think about it moving forward. and if you do think about the midpoint of our guidance, our guidance implies $33 million in the back half of the year. and i would as you mentioned, i would weight that a bit more to q4 than to q3 because of that summer seasonality impact that we talked about.
so we would expect to see some modest sequential increase in sales on a quarter-over-quarter basis between 2q to 3q, but i would weight more heavily the bulk of that $33 million if you're modeling to the midpoint of our guidance toward the back half of -- or toward the fourth quarter of the year. ok. hopefully, that answers your question there.
travis steed -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
that's helpful. we can follow up on what modest means post-call. but i did look at like the 2023 street numbers, and then i realize you can't comment on it, but 2021, you grew revenue by $16 million. this year, the high end of the guide is $60 million or $12 million of growth.
and obviously, those are two macro challenged years. but when you look at 2023, the street's at $30 million of revenue growth. so i don't know if that's a reasonable way to think about the step-up in growth as the hospital environment and some of these challenges at ease? or if revenue dollars are more likely to be closer to historical levels kind of without giving specifics, i'd love to kind of hear how you're thinking about the business on a little bit of a longer-term basis?
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
yes, it's a fair question, and we don't want to get into 2023 guidance per se, but a couple of things that i would tell you that we're thinking about that i would have you think about. but first off, certainly, foreign exchange is a headwind for us given that 40% of our business comes from outside the u.s. and with the strengthening of the dollar and there's certainly uncertainty around where currency is going to move. we are seeing an increasing headwind from foreign exchange.
so even where the dollar sits today versus where the dollar was at the beginning of the year when we gave our guidance, for example. we're estimating a 2% greater impact -- negative impact to sales from a year-over-year perspective. so that's about $1 million and we're not going to be in the business of trying to predict where exchange rates go, but certainly, currently where the dollar sits, that's going to impact our future sales into next year if things don't move. so that's an additional headwind that has come up.
and then, i think that what you talked about is really the other sort of lingering impact of covid. so we feel very good about the fact that in all of our major markets, the u.s. and our major international markets, we're seeing a very nice recovery in procedure volumes, and we're hoping that kind of the days of these complete procedure shutdowns due to icu beds filling up are behind us. however, i think the lingering effect from our perspective is these hospital staffing shortages and inability of staff to come in and the impact that that has on our productivity per account is the way we look at it or a capacity of hospitals moving forward.
and so, i think all of that is something that we would consider carefully looking to the future. and we'll have more visibility on that certainly as things play out through the remainder of this year. but i think all of that to me is sort of the two key areas of uncertainty that we're thinking about both this year and into the future.
travis steed -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. no, that's all fair. and one quick follow-up on the cash flow breakeven. you said enough capital in hand three years forward.
but curious what revenue level that will happen out or kind of when you're expecting to hit breakeven?
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
sure, sure. so again, i don't want to get too specific on this. but at a high level, i would say we would expect to get to cash flow breakeven sometime in the next few years, in the next three to five years. and again, rough numbers, somewhere at an annualized run rate, i would say, north of $150 million-ish.
so that's kind of at the high level where we expect to reach cash flow breakeven within our current operations that we have.
travis steed -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
all right. perfect. great. thanks for taking the questions.

our next question comes from david ko with canaccord genuity. your line is open.
david ko -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
hi. this is david on for bill plovanic. thanks for taking my question and congrats on your quarter. my first question is, what do you think has been the impact from the payers that were added in 2022 and the first half of this year? and if you don't see an impact, how long does it take to flow through the system and see the benefits?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so we get all of our -- essentially all of our patients paid for so 75% of our patients are covered by the government. this is i'm talking about the u.s. so when you're talking about payers, are you talking about private payers? are you talking about reimbursement in nash -- outside the u.s.
david ko -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
private.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
private payers. ok. so 25% of our business goes through private payers and way over 90% of the time we get it through been in payers, though, even in payers that have a negative coverage decision. now every major payer with the exception of blue cross blue shield is positive or neutral, which is to say they routinely pay for us.
those that are part of the blue cross blue shield network, more than two-thirds of those have now flipped as individual plans despite the association having a negative coverage decision. we're sort of -- it's the biggest tree, and we're chopping it down the limb by limb. so we've made a lot of good progress on that front. but even when somebody comes back and says, we're not going to cover this because we have a negative policy on this.
you can protest, you can appeal that and what it requires is for you to present data. and then, there's an independent physician who's not a part, as somebody who's not a part of blue cross blue shield, who comes in and reviews that package. and i don't know, i think we've -- we're essentially close to 100% on that because our data are very clear. we got four randomized controlled trials have all been published.
it's really the standard of care. so we win that all the time. so why do we care about the private payers and where they stand because there's significant inefficiency. it's like three months to go through the process i just described as opposed to two or three weeks.
if you've got a positive coverage decision. so we're trying to reduce that resistance. and -- but at the end of the day, the thing that's been remarkable is how patient the patients are. these patients are not going through a particular acute event.
they will be there tomorrow. and they're willing to fight to get the procedure and to go through the process. we do not have meaningful follow-up fallout during those extended processes. but it is -- it would be a lot more efficient if we can move them.
but it is a small -- like i said, it's -- 25% of our business is private blue cross blue shield is the only company that's negative, and two-thirds of their individual plans, two-thirds of the covered lives under blue cross blue shield association have already flipped to a positive position. so they're full steam ahead in those accounts. so it's a really small part of our business that we end up having to wait and work through.
david ko -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
thank you for the clarification. and i have one more question, if that's all right. so how does the traction in utilization in your oldest accounts measure versus the newer ones? and kind of what is the time frame for an account to reach maximum capacity?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks for the question. it's an element that we've been commenting on for some period of time now. and really the only pure group that we have was a relatively small group of accounts that were up and running for a year prior to covid.
so remember, we were on the market for 18 months from fda approval to when covid hit. and the first things that our sales reps did when we got approval was to go introduce themselves to these hospitals because we don't sell a single thing to these hospitals until we showed up with the valves. so we had to go through a process negotiating terms and conditions and getting those hospitals up and running through the various committees and so forth. so we didn't have a ton of hospitals that had a year of experience at the time that covid hit.
it was a double-digit number, like 40 to 60 accounts or something like that. so in that small group of established accounts that didn't get the light switch turned off in the first year, we had a certain rate of productivity, which was something on the order of six or seven cases per quarter. and we have been through the covid phase working in an environment where folks were coming in and going out based on the waves of covid hitting and have been as low as in the threes on a quarterly basis up into the fours and so forth, and we're sort of digging our way out of that. but as i mentioned before, it's the most established accounts that are sort of got the strongest history that are the first ones to come back.
and basically, everyone was down just a few months ago in the first quarter. and those that popped back up where the more established accounts, many of which were in -- were the ones that were uninterrupted in the pre-covid phase.
david ko -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
thank you, glen. and that's all i had.

our next question comes from larry biegelsen with wells fargo. your line is open.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the question. glen, just a two-part question on aeriseal. i'm going to ask the both upfront.
so the convert interim results we're going to get at ers in september, how many patients are going to be presented? what would you consider a good result? and you said you were excited about presenting the data, what makes you optimistic? what changes have you made since earlier studies like the aspire trial aeriseal has been around for a long time. so kind of what makes you think you have something here.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so we will report convert at ers. the convert approach was first reported as a case study out of australia. so there was a single patient where this has been published, where the physician went in, identified that reusing chartis identified that the patient was cv positive, put in some aeriseal, converted that patient, put in valves and the patient behaved like somebody who was born cv negative.
so that was encouraging. he set off to show in his sight that he could do that in a larger group of patients, a double-digit number, a relatively small single-center study in the script earlier, we mentioned that that experience in that low double-digit group of patients has been written up and is about to be published. it's been accepted for publications, literally just that normal delay between acceptance and when it shows up in print. we're not going to it's essentially, think of that data as being embargoed until it gets published.
so we have some visibility to that. we also, in the convert trial, have tens of patients that we will -- and we're not going to talk about the specifics of how many, but it's tens of patients that we're going to look at and it's going to -- we're going to be talking primarily at ers about can you take somebody who's cv-positive and make them cv-negative with aeriseal. and that's going to -- because the second question doesn't matter whether they're going to behave the same way if valved or not, if you can't get by the first. now, you had asked what is a reasonable result? we queried -- we asked that question of world thought leaders, and they came back and said, if you could take 30 worst case to 50% of cv-positive patients that are good candidates for this procedure and convert them, then that would be great.
50 would be wonderful and 30 would be acceptable. so that gives you sort of the framework. so anything north of 30 is acceptable and anything at or above 50% is wonderful, and those data will -- i don't know when this publication is going to come out. if it pops up before ers, you'll be able to see that.
but that's in a much -- it's been a smaller group, then we'll report on at ers and then the larger -- a larger group, tens of people will be reported at ers with that fundamental question being the centerpiece. and then, the other thing that they'll focus on is how well tolerated aeriseal is, you had made reference to aspire. aspire was a trial that was executed by a company called aeris therapeutics, aeris developed aeriseal, we purchased the technology from aeris. they had commenced a study called aspire.
they didn't finish it because they ran out of money. and when we were able to get a pretty good deal on that acquisition, and we have carried things forward. one of the observations at that time, and this was like a dozen years ago was a question related to the -- how well the patients tolerated the aeriseal? in that trial, roughly twice as much aeriseal was instilled as in the current sort of approach. and so, one might contrast and learn at ers, how patients behave when given 50% or less, the volume of aeriseal that they got in aspire.
so there'll be a safety or tolerability question that will also probably be answered at ers.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst

our next question comes from rick wise with stifel. your line is open.
purnima malik -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi. this is purnima malik on for rick wise. i'm just going to go ahead and ask both my questions upfront. during the first few weeks of earnings, we've seen a number of companies report and highlight that there is a seasonally higher pressure from hospital staff limitations and their ability to do procedures.
so to what extent has this impacted your productivity per account? and then, how should we think about this impacting the third quarter, second half 2022 and going into 2023?
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
got it. yes. has it impacted our productivity? yes. it certainly has.
it's just a reality. i mean, we have folks that are coming in and they've got to go through pulmonary rehabilitation. they have to go through pulmonary function testing that you have to be run into -- through other tests around the hospital and then the procedure gets executed by a team of people. if a significant number of people are, in some cases, not even a terribly significant number of people call in sick then certain things get delayed or and they get pushed off in the future.
so we are definitely feeling that. we muscled our way through that. we didn't anticipate it. our goal, our hope was that if everything went well, we were going to deliver in the second quarter, roughly what we did in the fourth quarter, everything seemed to go pretty well.
well, things didn't go, as well as we had anticipated, and we were able to muscle our way into that zone that we had targeted. so we're definitely seeing that right now. i mean, i think that it's something that hospitals make money off of these procedures, whether they be surgical procedures or interventional procedures. and they're going to do whatever they can to ensure that they have the capacity to do the procedures that are necessary.
it's going to take a little time. we're seeing in certain situations, the situation improving for sure. and we expected that to strengthen as we move across the year and certainly in 2023. and i'm sure that the hospital systems that report like we're doing right now are going to be commenting on staffing as well.
but we're very gratified that our patients are pushing hard and our physicians are trying to get this -- trying to move things ahead. and we can see the activity, the engagement by patients and the activity by our accounts that gives us a great deal of optimism as to what's ahead.
purnima malik -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst

our next question comes from joseph downing with psc. your line is open.
joe downing
hey guys. congrats on a solid quarter. this is joe on for jason bednar today. the first one i have was on pricing.
so while it hasn't been a traditional lever we've discussed in the past through business. are you able to comment on whether you have or plan to take pricing on defer to offset any manufacturing operating inflationary pressures? and then, i got one more.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
we have taken small amounts of pricing in the past. we'll probably be taking larger -- making somewhat larger price increases as we move forward as our -- we've had great fortune with our supply chain and our -- we've got a very talented group that manages it. we got out ahead of things in terms of making sure that we have the right inventories. we've got a good bit of product that's on the shelf.
so we've been able to manage pretty well in this environment. and so yes, we would expect that we'll have some price increases. i think that where we typically, i think, focus price increases in terms of greater magnitude is on new products. so when we have a line extension or a new version of something, you typically would see a new software package or something in a chartis is typically bigger step-up in pricing as well.
so yes, we would expect we'll exercise a little bit of that as we move forward here.
joe downing
great. and then, one more on competition. so what are you seeing out there competitively with aspiration? and are you seeing olympus helping develop the valve market in any meaningful way? and then relatedly, are there any other earlier-stage technologies that you would consider evaluating that like aeriseal could help expand the addressable patient population you can treat.
glen french -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, i'm always happy to have a competitor in the marketplace to sort of help you grow like -- and obviously, it's great to grow the size of a pie when you control a disproportionate share of that pie. we've been out in the market now, albeit during a challenging time, but we've been out for a while and not only in the u.s. but in europe.
and it's we're a difficult competitor for somebody else who's got a valve that's got a different design. and we've got a lot of data. all of our data, we've got four studies. all the data are consistent.
we hit on all three endpoints across all four studies. so 12 shots on goal, 12 goals and olympus doesn't have that same data set, and we're doing -- and we're continuing to do additional work. i'm not aware of them doing significant additional work either. so anyway, they're -- they've got a good product.
it works in certain patients and -- but we continue to have what i believe is our share of the market, which depending on what country you're talking about is somewhere between 70% and 100% market share. so how are we doing? they're still in the game. i don't expect that to change. and there's a place for them in the marketplace.
i'm happy they're making noise. in terms of other technologies, there's nothing that is -- that i can see on the horizon that i think is going to be significantly competitive in the valve space. valves are reversible, which is great. these patients are all 90-plus percent of the time, they're former smokers.
it's not uncommon at three years after you place a valve that's something some spot shows up on a future x-ray and you want to go in and get at it. you can go in with our valve, and you can pull it out three, five years later and go back behind it and go do what you want to do. so i think valves are always going to be first-line therapy. now, there are other technologies that are in development with a possible application in cv-positive patients.
some have been studied before and have a very spotty record. we like the approach that we're taking with aeriseal, where you're not permanently taking down massive chunks of geography the way that some of the other technologies would be the case. you'd also referred to whether there be anything that would be complementary that's out there. and of course, in the interventional space, there's a number of different technologies that are being developed.
some are further along than others. and we are we continue to keep a close eye on those technologies. what we have that is really hard to have is we have a global sales organization, 98% of our business is direct. we sell into 25 different plus markets.
so we've built this commercial front end. it's very, very hard to get to where we are right now, where our global commercial team is paying for itself. certainly, all of our sales reps around the world. so it's just incredibly difficult for any younger company or a smaller company, a single product company to do what we've done.
and we see that as a leverageable asset. so we keep a close eye on the other things that are bringing -- that are coming forward that could be potentially complementary in the bag.
joe downing
thanks, glen. appreciate the insight.

our next question comes from joanne wuensch with citi. your line is open.
joanne wuensch -- citi -- analyst
good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. actually, the previous one just [inaudible] straight into this. when i look at the ous growth was up against a particularly tough comp. but i suspect that it masks certain pockets that are doing quite well and others that may not be so much.
could you maybe pull that apart a little bit? and then, my second question has to do with your global sales force. can you talk about the seniority or the tenure of the individuals and the stability of that sales force?
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
so looking outside -- yes, i mean, it's -- so outside the united states, united states is our biggest market, 60% of our business. 40% of our business is outside the united states. three quarters of that business is in four countries: germany, france, the u.k. and australia.
they're all 2 million plus annualized markets, 2 million to 10 million kind of range. and they really did all those -- all our top five u.s., germany, france, u.k. and australia, all did well in the quarter. as i mentioned, i think earlier, u.s.
was up 31% on a constant over the second quarter of 2021 and on a constant currency basis, those germany, france, u.k. and australia were up 20%. so that's 90% of our business was up 27.3% over the prior period. so where we have the biggest footprint where we've got the greatest number of accounts where we're up and running, and we're leveraging.
we've got marketing people there. we got salespeople there. we're building our business. and in that last 10% of our business, we were down on the order of 20%.
and about half of that miss was in asia, almost all of which was in china. now, the balance of the other half is in a bunch of countries, smaller countries where they don't -- they haven't taken the complete shutdown approach the way they have in certain asian countries. so those smaller countries that underperformed in the second quarter are just slow coming back because there's not a team on the ground that's like goosing them to come back. they're going to come back.
so that's the good news. i don't -- and i expect that probably-i mean, i fully expect that's going to happen in the back half of the year. again, it's only 5% of our business, half of that last 10%. i don't expect asia to come back this year.
i don't expect china to come back this year. i should say, because that's the biggest part of the chunk for obvious reasons. they're just -- we do a little business there. it's not like it's zero, but they're not doing what we -- china was growing compound annual growth, something on the order of 100% for a couple of years and then covid hit, and we got frozen pretty good there.

thanks, laine. good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings call. here with me is derrick sung, our chief financial officer. in the second quarter, we generated worldwide sales of $14 million, representing our highest quarterly revenue to date.
we're pleased with our second quarter performance as we continue to see strong patient demand for our zephyr valves improving end market dynamics and the ability of our team to execute and manage our business in a fluid environment. our performance was driven by particularly strong results in the united states, where we achieved sales 18% higher than our previous record in the fourth quarter of last year as procedure volumes recovered from the winter covid surge despite continued pressures from hospital staffing shortages. the momentum exiting the quarter leaves us confident in our ability to deliver on our full year 2022 revenue guidance of $55 million to $60 million even in the face of ongoing macro uncertainties and incremental foreign exchange headwinds. throughout the second quarter, we continued to execute on our initiatives to expand our global commercial footprint.
in the united states, we added 18 new treating centers, bringing our total number to 248 and keeping us on track to meet our objective of establishing at least 280 trained zephyr valve centers in the u.s. by year-end. we also added on additional sales territory in the u.s. and two additional international sales territories, bringing our total u.s.
and international sales territories to 55 and 36, respectively. one of our primary goals is to educate both healthcare providers and patients about endobronchial valves being part of the standard of care for severe emphysema. in the second quarter, we launched joint education campaigns with two leading lung advocacy organizations, the american lung association and the copd foundation. these collaborations will extend through 2022 and include educational materials for patients, physicians, nurses and respiratory therapists including accredited courses, videos, webinars, podcasts and articles.
we have also expanded our healthcare provider education outreach at the local level with a focus on a selection of community physicians who manage large populations of copd patients. together with our physician collaborators, we continue to build on the clinical evidence for zephyr valves. in june, the first prospective study to assess cardiac function following bronchoscopic lung volume reduction with zephyr valves was published in the american journal of respiratory and critical care medicine. this study found that a reduction in lung hyperinflation using zephyr valves resulted in improvements in cardiac function, such as preload, cardiac output and heart muscle contractility, thus suggesting a role for zephyr valves in modifying the risk for heart failure in severe emphysema patients.
innovative clinical work such as this continues to advance the scientific evidence demonstrating the clinical value of endobronchial valves. turning to our longer-term growth initiatives to expand our addressable market. we are excited about two upcoming data readouts associated with our aeriseal clinical development program. as a reminder, we are developing aeriseal to provide a solution for severe emphysema patients not currently eligible for zephyr valves due to the presence of a gap in the fissure separating lobes of the lungs, which results in collateral ventilation or air flow between the lobes.
this collateral ventilation prevents a target lobe from deflating when zephyr valves are inserted. aeriseal is a polymeric foam that is delivered via a bronchoscope to seal the airways leading to the fissure gaps between the lobes of the lung, potentially enabling treatment of patients who were previously ineligible for valves due to collateral ventilation. thus, we see aeriseal as a potential way to increase the number of patients who are candidates for zephyr valve therapy. we are looking forward to seeing the publication of data from a single center proof-of-concept, investigator-led feasibility study from australia that evaluated aeriseal to eliminate collateral ventilation in the target lobe, and if successful, then followed up treatment of that lobe with zephyr valves.
this manuscript was recently accepted and is expected to publish in the coming months. aeriseal is also currently being studied in our convert trial, a multicenter, multinational study, which we are conducting in europe. we are also pleased that interim data from this trial has been accepted for a podium presentation at the upcoming european respiratory society international congress in barcelona, spain on september 4. at this presentation, we expect to share data on an initial subset of convert patients that will shed light on the preliminary conversion with aeriseal of targeted patients with collateral ventilation.
this information should provide additional insight and proof-of-concept around the use of aeriseal to expand zephyr valves to severe emphysema patients with collateral ventilation in a larger multicenter study. learning from the convert trial continues to inform the design of our u.s. ide study, which we are discussing with fda and expect to initiate sometime next year. lastly, our initiative to expand geographically into the japanese market remains on track.
we recently hired an experienced leader in japan to drive our commercial efforts and we are engaged in a constructive dialogue with the japanese authorities following the submission of our regulatory application late last year. we continue to expect regulatory approval in japan by the end of this year, followed by the establishment of reimbursement and subsequent commercial launch in the back half of 2023. again, we estimate japan to be a $1 billion opportunity with approximately 100,000 patients in need of our zephyr valve treatment. in summary, i believe the record sales that we achieved in the second quarter along with the continued progress on our commercial and strategic initiatives positions us well for continued growth through the remainder of the year and well into the future.
with that, i'll now turn the call over to derrick to provide a more detailed review of our second quarter results.
derrick sung -- chief financial officer
thank you, glen, and good afternoon, everyone. total worldwide revenue for the three months ended june 30, 2022, reached a new quarterly high of $14 million, a 14% increase from $12.2 million in the same period of the prior year, and an increase of 19% on a constant currency basis. u.s. revenue in the second quarter was $8.6 million, a 31% increase from $6.6 million during the prior year period.
the record u.s. sales reflected a recovery in procedure volumes following the winter covid surge, as well as benefit from increasing -- the increasing number of treating centers that we have been opening every quarter. international revenue in the second quarter of 2022 was $5.3 million, a 5% decrease from $5.6 million during the same period last year and an increase of 4% on a constant currency basis. international revenue benefited from solid procedure growth in our major markets offset by a slower restart in some of our smaller markets, continued lockdowns in china, hospital staffing shortages and negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates.
gross margin for the second quarter of 2022 was 75% compared to 74% in the prior year period. the year-over-year expansion in gross margin was driven primarily by increasing production efficiencies. we expect gross margin to trend near 74% for the remainder of the year as negative foreign exchange impact partially offset continued gains in production efficiencies. total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2022 were $24.8 million, a 14% increase from $21.7 million in the second quarter of 2021.
non-cash stock-based compensation expense was $4.2 million in the second quarter of 2022 and accounted for 64% of the increase in operating expense from the prior year. we continue to prudently manage our operating expenses to remain within our previously communicated guidance of $100 million to $105 million for the full year 2022, inclusive of approximately $16 million of stock-based compensation expense. we remain committed to investing in growth while simultaneously managing toward cash flow breakeven within the confines of the capital that we currently have on hand. r&d expenses for the second quarter of 2022 were $3.6 million compared to $3.5 million in the same period of the prior year.
the slight increase was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense. sales, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2022 were $21.2 million compared to $18.2 million in the second quarter of 2021. the increase was attributable to an increase in sales and marketing expenses as we expanded our commercial team and increased commercial activities, as well as an increase in stock-based compensation expense. net loss for the second quarter of 2022 was $14.6 million or a loss of $0.40 per share as compared to a net loss of $13 million or a loss of $0.36 per share for the same period of the prior year.
an average weighted share count of 37 million shares was used to determine loss per share for the second quarter of 2022. we ended june 30, 2022, with $166.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, a decrease of $9.7 million from march 31, 2022. we expect to burn roughly $50 million in cash for the full year 2022 and expect to see our annual cash burn decrease in subsequent years as we continue to grow sales and see increasing leverage throughout our business. as i mentioned, we expect to reach cash flow breakeven in our current operations with the capital that we have on hand and are managing our business to maintain a cash runway of at least three years of forward cash burn until we turn cash flow positive.
finally, turning to our outlook for 2022. we now estimate foreign exchange rates will result in an approximate 5% headwind to global sales growth for the full year 2022. despite this incremental headwind and continued macro uncertainties, we remain confident in our ability to achieve full year 2022 revenue within our previously communicated range of $55 million to $60 million, keeping in mind that we do expect some level of summer seasonality and continued sequential growth throughout the year. this represents 14% to 24% year-over-year growth on a reported basis and implies 19% to 29% growth on a constant currency basis, up 2% from our previously implied constant currency growth expectations.
and with that, i'd like to thank you for your attention, and we will now open up the call for questions. operator?
