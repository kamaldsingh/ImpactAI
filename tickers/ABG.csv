[operator instructions] we'll take our first question from rick nelson with stephens incorporated. please go ahead.
rick nelson -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
thanks and good morning. so i wanted talk about the same-store units both new and used cars, new down 6%, used down 9%. it sounds like you've taken a strategy where you're going to try to maximize gpus. if you could speak to that what you think is happening from -- to market share about [indecipherable] strategy will continue.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
yes. rick, good morning and thanks for the question. this is david. i would tell you we went into it with the approach of, we can see our day supply and where we're at. we're sitting in october, we can see what we have for inventories and what's coming by the end of the year. and we know what a large month december is for luxury. so i would tell you on the new car side, we launched unit sales, because we just weren't chasing volumes because we couldn't replace the inventory. so we just thought it was a better return on our cash to maximize the gross profit as best as possible. as dan pointed out, even with that strategy in december, we had many stores below at 20 day supply and that's a 20 day supply across all model line, so individual hot models you didn't have any day supply. so there is no question that hurt the unit sales.
on the pre-owned side, again it's not about chasing volume for us it's about maximizing our returns. we make far greater profits when we sell a vehicle that we've traded for then when we go out and purchase a vehicle. so we've tried to be more opportunistic and at least that these challenging months when inventories to and prices are high at the auction to really just maintain the gross as best we can and give the greatest returns we can. so i would tell you, we sat here a quarter ago and thought by the end of the first quarter days supply would be back up to normal, but because what's going on with the microchips and some other things, it's probably going to bleed well into the second quarter before inventories gets back. you never really know how that ends up, but we're going into each month, we're looking at it, how do we maximize our return. even with some of those numbers, we actually exceeded market share in some markets and some we didn't. we're not looking at that short-term market share gain or loss, we're kind of looking at the overall picture and return. so we're happy with our strategy in the way it's played out so far.
rick nelson -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
great. that's helpful color. i hope so at the inventory front, when things do normalize, it sounds like the back half of 2021 and here current tax expectation. do you think you can hold down to some of those gpus? do we go back to 2019 pre-covid level? sort of your expectation there.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
sure. as a company, i don't think we'll go back to pre-covid because the acquisition of park place just does move our overall numbers. do i think that we will maintain this when things get back to normal, i'm sure, there'll be some drop-off in some areas, very difficult to predict what incentives are going to be, what the days supply is going to be like and what the economic conditions. but from everything that we see we're very excited about 2021. we see our business growing in 2021 compared to 2020. and there might be different things moving around in those numbers throughout, but very opportunistic about what 2021 offers. and quite honestly, the acquisition pipeline is certainly active right now. so there's a lot of good things happening in this space and we certainly want to be disciplined and execute as best we can.
rick nelson -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay. just to follow up on that comment about the acquisition pipeline. if you could speak to that what you're seeing in terms of pricing out there. i know you stepped up the buyback authorization as well as your preference to acquisition versus buybacks at the moment.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
yes. rick, i would say generally overall, what gives the greatest returns for our shareholders and the best way for us to deploy capital. the pipeline for our conversations and activity was kind of slow around the holidays, it dramatically picked up in january. and we're having a lot of meaningful conversations with different folks right now. so it's early. we'll see where it goes. but we're very engaged in a lot of conversations and excited about that. as far as the pricing and overall multiples, it's a competitive space right now. and there is a lot of buyers out there. and i'm sure there's a lot of sellers that want to make sure that they're concerned about their legacy and who they sell to. so it will be an interesting year and see what happens. but i'm sure from an m&a perspective, at least what we see so far, it should be an active year.
rick nelson -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
great. thanks for all of that. sure, go ahead.
patrick j. guido -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
sorry, this is p.j. i would just add that we do have a capital allocation policy. and first and foremost, we want to reinvest in our core business, and then we look to delever to the extent we're over our target. and as i mentioned earlier, we're well below our target, which means our balance sheet has capacity for acquisitions, which as david said, we're maintaining an active pipeline. and to the extent there is cash left over in the waterfall, we would look to return to shareholders.
rick nelson -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
great. thanks for the color and good luck.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, rick.

we'll take our next question from john murphy with bank of america. please go ahead.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
all right. good morning, everybody. first question on the park place acquisition and integration. it seems like we've gone even better than plan on the integration more hiccups whatsoever and actually they are helping to drive the better performance, [indecipherable]. i'm just curious if there's any lessons learned here on targets or the actual integration process. exactly what i mean, it's just seems like it's -- still in and actually been sort of a net benefit right off the bat, which is clearly made some acquisition.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
sure, john. this is david, i'll start. it really just speaks to the park place folks and their level of professionalism changing hands going through a buy-sell 1,400 employees. there's a lot of moving pieces and i'm sure there's a lot of frustrated folks on the park place side. i think both sides went at it with the intent that there is a level of respect and trust for one another and work through the issues that came up. but it's truly a credit to them. certainly in the quarter, the luxury mix that they have in the low-day supply that benefited us as well. but i'll tell you, post acquisition we've got exactly what we thought we're getting, which is amazing teammates, who are really passionate and professional with what they do every single day and committed to what they do.
i would say in the last couple of years, that's been our big difference. when we look at acquisitions, we just don't look at the revenue stream, we're really interested in how the business runs and whether it would be a good steward of the business. and what if the colorado acquisitions or the indiana ones, i think so far the model that we're working on as far as when we look at acquisitions and integrate, we've been pretty successful at making sure we would be a good steward of the business.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. that's incredibly helpful. just a second question around parts and service, obviously there is some choppiness here. the world and the markets are volatile. so it's somewhat understandable. but if you think about parts and service, when do you think that normalizes, is it post-production sort of mid this year or maybe the second half or could it normalized sooner and how much deferred maintenance you think there's out there that you might catch up on over time?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
sure. and just as a reminder, those numbers to our collision numbers and collision still maintains 20% to 30% back from prior year. i'll tell you, the virus, while it's only been around for a year, it feels like it's been around longer and it was dramatic when it first hit, but then it kind of cooled off through the summer and business started bouncing coming back. in the fourth quarter, we went negative in parts and service in november and we came back positive in december. and we're starting january off a little bit more volatility. so i would tell you, these high positive rates that you're seeing across the country and the number of deaths a day over 4,000 are playing an impact on the parts and service business. it varies a little bit by market, but generally that's the theme.
so we feel confident as the vaccines rollout and things normalized parts and service not only comes back, it should have a nice tailwind. to your point on pent-up demand with service work that's our opinion. and they believe right now is somewhere between june and late july, early august is when we think that we should really start to get back in a groove of a normal look in parts and service. could be sooner, it's hard to predict with what's going on to vaccine and it's very fluid, we're all reading about it every day. but that's the way we see it right now.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
i hope for all of us for the long a sooner, but that's, yes, that's helpful. and then just lastly on sg&a. obviously, last few quarters you run in the 51% range, grosses are high rates in the year, there will be the denominator it's benefited to some degree. so if you think about sg&a going forward has something structurally changed here that you think that you can operate in this low 60s or maybe even better over time as quickly and it takes off and you're able to leverage the whole base of your bricks-and-mortar.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
i would say there's three main levers. like i said in my statement, some of the divestitures and some of the acquisitions really lifted our margins and those were stores that had a history of higher margin business when we were lower margin business. i think there's definitely going to be a sustainable pickup there. we also changed our production per employee when the downturn hit and we stayed disciplined with that. and to your point with clicklane, it's only three stores, it's one full month, but it's up over 100% pretty close to each. most of them were luxury brands that we tried clicklane in. so we're very hopeful between those three levers that there is a meaningful difference here in sg&a over time as well.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. but would you underwrite 60 -- something in the low 60% range now or you really kind of, saw where this is going to land.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i would say, it's still bouncing around right now. i mean our goal through the next view, i would say, this quarter is maintaining higher operating margins and maximizing our opportunity. depending when we get back to normal, depending upon where margins lay, i think we'll certainly be in a much better position from an sg&a standpoint than we were pre-covid. but where exactly about land, i think there's too many variables to call that right now.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. thank you very much.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

we'll take our next question from ryan sigdahl with craig-hallum capital group. please go ahead.
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions. just wanted to dig in a little bit on the online, so specifically looking at slide 11 and 12. so it shows internet leads down sequentially or i guess year-over-year down a little bit, online service appointments also kind of trending lower. as you're expanding your clicklane, you talk about a lot of traction you're gaining online. i guess, can you just talk through the sequential decline and kind of the moving pieces there.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i'll talk about the decline in traffic and then the comment on clicklane. one thing is true for our industry, when you have more inventory online you have more leads and more eyeballs on your side. so part of the traffic coming down was lack of inventory, we had more inventory i don't think the leads would have been down as much. the other piece of it was too is trying to be more strategic with the marketing dollars. knowing we had less of an inventory, it really makes sense to create some supply of leads where we really didn't have the product there to sell it.
on the clicklane side, the growth that we're talking about on clicklane, i would say the material difference when we made that comment and i am going to compare pushstart which most of our stores are on today compared to clicklane it's the conversion. it's not the lead counts up with clicklane, it's the conversion on clicklane and is up dramatically from pushstart.
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
great. and then just on clicklane. four rollout by the end of q1, you have 3 beta tested in december. can you talk through the cadence of how you're going to roll that out over the next couple of months, and all at once or stage -- what the cadence plan to start?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
sure. we have the whole company set up, we're rolling out depending upon the size of the stores and when anywhere between eight to 12 stores a week. and we'll also include toward the tail end of the quarter park place, which in the fourth quarter did not offer in online transactional tool at all. so they'll get their first shot or first look at it if you will, at the end of q1. it wasn't at all in their sites in q4.
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
okay. thanks and i'll turn it over. good luck.

we'll take our next question from adam jonas with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
all right. everybody can you hear me?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
so a couple of questions for you here. so a couple of questions for you here. [indecipherable] sales in ice-powered vehicles. i'm just wondering if you could refresh us on as a rapid move to ev in any concern, a long-term debt holder about your business, including your p&s business. and i'm also noticing a lot of start-ups are moving to direct to consumer models. and they insist, they don't want to use existing dealer franchises. apple is entering the auto industry, it's our understanding they don't want to do a franchise dealer model, although that's not fully confirmed but they want to control the downstream distribution. if there are -- david that you're acquiring legacy brick-and-mortar dealerships that still sell legacy ice oem products, ice intense p&s, how can you assure shareholders that you're not doubling down on this ice legacy tech at the worst possible time at the end of the ice? thanks.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
sure, adam. i would tell you that our manufacturer partners have been building quality cars for a long time and they're all in the process of transitioning to ev and we'll certainly go along for the ride in the journey with them and be great partners to them. and i would tell you like any industry that has spurts if you will. there's a lot of ev companies that are coming out, we'll see which ones make and which ones don't, which ones consolidate and which one share and sell their technology. i would also tell you, as i'm sure you're aware, some of them that will be launching car soon. but literally as we speak, working with third-party vendors to try and figure out how they're going to handle parts and service on the back side.
so i don't think that's a well thought out model either. and i think there is something about -- there's something tried and true to the supply chain and mechanisms that work now. so the mechanism whether it's ice or electrification or hybrids or whatever it might be, it doesn't really matter. we're here locally in the community to sell and service the vehicles and have been for many years and have a strong reputation and know how to do it. we're not making it up as we go. we're figuring out as we go or how to handle a recall.
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
appreciate, david. thanks.

we'll take our next question from rajat gupta with jpmorgan. please go ahead.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
good morning everyone. thanks for taking my questions. just a follow-up on the sg&a question earlier. i'm not sure if i missed it earlier, but could you give us a sense of where you expect the sg&a growth to lined up like in some sort of range that anything you want to walk around for this year, just based on what are the expectations are for gpus [indecipherable] rest of the year. and i have a follow up. thanks.
patrick j. guido -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. rajat, it's p.j. so on sg&a, as david mentioned, it's difficult to forecast in this environment. what we do know is the leverage we generated in q3 and q4, predominantly driven on the personnel side and then the balance in advertising and other related costs. what we have confidence in is that those -- there are structural changes there that we will continue to benefit from in the form of higher productivity whether it's units per salesperson, average growth per associate, we track a lot of metrics. and we do see that our productivity is up and we hope to or we are confident that we can retain that. as the production comes back online, again, we're looking at the latter half of the year. we do expect to see some pressure on growth, which will put pressure on sg&a. but again, the structural changes we've made and the fact that we're very active in managing expense gives us confidence that our sg&a will be -- will continue to be favorable.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. is there anything within the sg&a [indecipherable] any follow in the execution around advertising might look like, which again in the context of rolling on this clicklane platform and even broadening the reach of that platform. outside just normalization in advertising spending back to pre-covid level, should we expect a further after beyond that? just for clicklane purchase or is that another case?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
this is david. and if i got the question wrong, i apologize. it was cutting in and out a little bit, but as it relates to marketing in clicklane, if you look at us against our peers, we've traditionally and still do, i guess i can't speak for the fourth quarter, but prior to that have the lowest dollars per car spend in marketing. so i think it was a business we're going to get. once clicklane is fully rolled out in our stores by the end of q1 for the first time we will make an investment and spend some dollars marketing clicklane to drive traffic. we never really marketed pushstart that much. we will market clicklane.
so i don't know that you'll see much of a meaningful difference in the pvr at the end of the quarter, but there will be some dollars spent on it. the sg&a, because we've kept our head count down our productivity is up, there is always opportunity in compensation and certainly operating expenses. and i think we've been fairly disciplined over time regarding that and we'll continue to look at that. and we think our plan moving forward will keep us certainly competitive and probably in the better half with our peer group.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. just last one for me, any color, when you talked about like the chip shortages and like the margin strength here in the near-term. any color on what january was in terms of just units? is there -- are you seeing the same situation that is in the fourth quarter with respect to the demand with the gpu trade out? or has any change so far in january? in general, how is the demand environment looking like here in january?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
sure. yes, absolutely. in january, always a little bit of a letdown from december, but i would tell you compare this january to the last 35 have been in the business was very surprised by the activity and the overall performance in january it was amazingly resilient and we're very pleased with how january look. i will tell you, it's the same frustration very low day supply in a lot of areas. so there is that potential, what you could have sold compared to what you did sell just because of lack of inventory. but considering what went on with the pandemic in the month of january in the horrible numbers, we all saw nationally it was a productive january for us.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. all right. that's all for me. thanks and good luck.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
glenn chin -- seaport global securities -- analyst
great. thank you. good morning, gentlemen. so, david perhaps a question for you. i'm getting a lot of questions from investors just regarding the achievability of revenue and implied by in targets to clicklane. can you just remind us or share with us maybe a framework or the assumption underlying some your goals for clicklane. maybe if you could just start at the top of funnel and then narrow it down first? maybe starting with tam, the number of leads you expect to get from that, the conversion rates and the market share that ultimately implies?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i'll -- and if i don't explain it well, glenn, please just come back at me. we will start to spend money on clicklane and we do expect additional traffic because of that. but when we talk about our model of the $5 billion with clicklane it actually is not accounting for any additional traffic. it's basically looking at the traffic we have now and looking at the conversion on post-start and what we believe the conversion will be with clicklane. so, for lack of a better term, if we had a 100 leads on pushstart and we close 10 of those leads out of 100 that's your conversion that 10% number. if we had those same 100 leads with clicklane, we believe that number will be more than double that in year one. and by the time we get to year five like any -- tool enabling that takes place online, you think about airlines tickets when they first converted to online people who used to calling in, if you remember at the time they actually charge you more to call and then online because they were trying to push online. once the acceptance level is there and people realize you can do a full transaction, we believe over the next five years that number will go up materially.
so we think 100% of the people are going to buy online, no, of course, not. but we certainly believe somewhere between 30% and 50% of the consumers will transact online over the next five years. so it's basically taking our traditional conversion rates. looking at what push -- i mean, what clicklane can do against pushstart and modeling that out over five years, which really no incremental growth on the clicklane tool itself. so we think we're very conservative in our numbers in our approach. and again, one month out of the gate with only three stores, but within those three stores, you had [indecipherable] luxury brands in a mid-line import. and i would tell you, again, month one out of the gate, we were conservative on our conversion numbers.
glenn chin -- seaport global securities -- analyst
okay. and just speaking about that five-year window, david. i think you're quoting in automotive news interview saying that you expected not clicklane, but sort of the clicklane type capability to be promising throughout the industry within two years. so after that two-years, when it is [indecipherable] around the dealer network nationwide, do you expect that conversion rate or the traffic to diminish given the increased competition online.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
i don't, i kind of look at is, when the websites came online in the late 1990s, early 2000, walk in and phone traffic and now there was internet. it just -- the traffic flows move into different channels. the benefit here to the overall automotive space will be the level of satisfaction to the consumers, the speed or an experience that the consumers can go through and how transparent it will be and how that will be beneficial and controlling cost within a store with the use of a tool like this really being accepted in this space. that's the opportunity that is really meaningful.
glenn chin -- seaport global securities -- analyst
and then the $5 billion target, david, is that all new and used retail? is any of that parts and service or f&i?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
well, some of it's f&i, for sure. but no, it's not parts and service, it's just simply sales. when we talked about the five-year plan and we talked about the $2 billion in revenue growth in our store count, it didn't assume any acquisitions, obviously and we looked at our same-store sales what we have now and then we look to over the next five years, we looked at our service retention numbers, our market share numbers and where we thought what we can do with the brand. we did not factor in any economic downturn in that five-year model. we kind of assume a saar somewhere between 16% and 17% over that five-year period. very conservative numbers, is everything that we do. so we just kind of modeled it that way and that's where the numbers laid if you will.
glenn chin -- seaport global securities -- analyst
okay. i guess my question around f&i, david was not so much around volume because obviously you got a less increased volume of retail sales. but more around, i guess, increased penetration or attachment rates you're expecting with that.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
that's going to be subject because it's over time. but again, and it's a small sample. i'll talk to the four luxury stores and one mid-line import. and it's in three stores, but one store has multiple brands. i would tell you we're very pleased with the f&i numbers that we've seen so far. again, i know it's only a few stores, i talked only 30-day, but in most cases were up significantly in f&i dollars per vehicle with the clicklane tool so far, more than we forecasted for.
glenn chin -- seaport global securities -- analyst
and what do you think might be driving that?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
i think there is a convenience of consumers and consumers selling themselves. most people sell themselves on something before they ever go out and purchase it and they justify why they're going to buy it and what they're going to pay for it. i think we focus on products that add value to the vehicle. the average length of ownership is almost 12 years in the country. there is a big purchase a big expense. i think if you can present products professionally price it fairly and give information on the products to allow consumers to make an educated decision. what you end up with is selling products.
glenn chin -- seaport global securities -- analyst
okay. great. thanks very much. i appreciate the feedback. and just a quick housekeeping follow-up for p.j. p.j., did you guys say that your leverage target has changed, it was 2 times to 3 times, is it now just 3 times someone's asking?
patrick j. guido -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. hey, glenn. so it's typically been or it's typically been 3 times, so 2 times to 3 times that's kind of a big window. our target 3 times, we feel like that conservative imbalances both risk enables us to put the balance sheet to work.
glenn chin -- seaport global securities -- analyst
okay. but just to clarify. has your thinking around for you guys changed?
patrick j. guido -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
no. 3 times.
glenn chin -- seaport global securities -- analyst

we'll take our next question from stephanie benjamin with truist. please go ahead.
stephanie benjamin -- truist -- analyst
hi. good morning.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
patrick j. guido -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, stephanie.
stephanie benjamin -- truist -- analyst
i wanted to ask a bit about the used side of your business, just looking at whether it's growth or margins themselves decelerated in the fourth quarter still, obviously up on the growth by year-over-year. but you could speak a little bit about that, just given, we did see actually a slight acceleration in asps and even the unit performance. so if you could kind of walk through what you're seeing on the used business. thank you.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
yes. stephanie, this is david. i would say, the best way to describe the used business right now is our goal is not to chase volume. our goal is to chase return. we really track all the different avenues whether we purchased a car and the service charge, whether we acquired off the street whether we take it in trade or buy it at an auction and we say, what's our best investment and how do we get our highest return. i would say, we're very happy with our margin performance on pre-owned being up 10% in gross profit was kind of the target where we want it to be. i would tell you, the margins are not deceiving, but the cost of sale has really jumped up a lot. and if you think about it, it's probably up a couple of thousand dollars since 2018. i think we ended the quarter over $24,000, close to $24,400.
and when you think back at the end of q4 2018, it was $22,010. so a material increase in cost of sales is going to have an effect on the margin. but just as a gpus standpoint in q4 of 2018, we were $15,041 a car. so we're still running a couple of hundred dollars a car ahead of where we were in a competitive market space and that's based on a same-store number. so we're confident in our plan. it's just really being opportunistic where we acquire inventory from. our ability to make money in pre-owned is not going to be above the sale price, because the market dictates that it's really going to be about the acquisition price. and we're really trying to have a strategic plan on how to acquire the inventory and not just turnover the inventory at a low margin, but turn it over to a fair margin.
stephanie benjamin -- truist -- analyst
great. and to follow up on that, as you rollout clicklane and you noted some incremental kind of advertising or support behind that tool. will that also include possibly some advertising about supplying your vehicle, through an online component kind of like some of your pure digital used peers out there and then buy your cars. is that something up on the table?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
yes. it's in the tool and the quick answer is, yes. it's on the homepage of the websites that are on those stores now. but absolutely as a part of it, yes.
stephanie benjamin -- truist -- analyst
got it. well, thank you so much.

we'll take our next question from bret jordan with jefferies. please go ahead.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning, guys.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
on the clicklane, i guess in the test stores, is there any, i guess, information anecdotal may be that these are incremental customers or is it just a better conversion of folks that would have been coming to an asbury store in the first place.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
bret, again, it's early on, it's a few stores. so i can share stories and give you real numbers. the answer is yes. it's both. it's higher conversion of the customers you may or may not have had before, but it's also we're seeing acquisitions, what i would call outside of our marketplace with pre-owned. and i think it's because they can actually do the transaction online, and i'll just give you one anecdotal sale. it was a $97,000 used land rover that was sold from our greenville store in south carolina and the person lived in the dfw marketplace. they put $13,000 down on their credit card, they finance the balance and did the whole transaction online and we delivered the car over 950 miles away. and obviously, there were a lot of local dealers and quite honestly, one of them was park place within that market space.
when you talk to that consumer, it was the ease and transparency with the vehicle that they wanted to be able to do the whole transaction online and have it be so transparent seamless with a great experience for them. so that's one story, we have many like that. but just i think the awareness of consumers actually they've all wanted this for a long time. so to know that it actually exists out there, a lot of them are stumbling on it by mistake when they see it on the website.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
are you finding just a different customer reaction between mid-line and luxury? i guess, you done that for us at a kia dealership in florida, are you seeing that luxury buyers are more likely to do in online and transaction in mid-line or is it similar?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
it's a fantastic question, i'd like to give you an honest answer by saying, i'd like to give you my thoughts before we started it and then tell you what the reaction was or the real numbers. before we launched it, i assume they would take off with mid-line imports. and i was concerned what would happen with the luxury buyer. after december like usual i was wrong. it was accepted really well by the luxury buyers, it had nothing to do with price transactionally, it did well with the midline imports customers too, but i expected that. i was shocked how well it did with the luxury buyers.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks. and i guess maybe you might have told us is before, but the $5 billion expected clicklane revenues in 2025, what's the mix of new versus used in that outlook.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
so we kind of stick to our same -- well, i'll tell you this, with pushstart when we initially launched pushstart right out of the gate, it was a majority of new to used sales. very soon it transitioned within months and it stayed there for years to where over two-thirds of it was pre-owned and a third of it was new. as we start off with clicklane it's close to the 50-50 right now. but the way we've modeled it in, we've kind of again, we want to get granular with our five-year plan. and so we've built the five-year plan literally by rooftop. so we kind of kept to our used to new ratio, and then we kept the same sales volume just higher conversions on clicklane.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
we'll take our next question from david whiston with morningstar. please go ahead.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
thanks. good morning. a question on toyota's announcement yesterday on their new e-commerce platform. a lot of the capability to meet on a very similar to clicklane, obviously at the end they do transfer the customer over to a dealer. but i'm just curious, having more automakers having a capability of their own like clicklane, does that help you, hurt you or is it really neutral?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
thanks for the question, dave. this is david. i'll answer it the way i did in december on the investor day. i think it helps to space overall. our franchise system is being challenged now. as john talked about earlier with start-up companies coming into this space, i think there is tool really levels that playing field and changes the experience. so i am excited to see my competitors within the franchise system get the tool and get them to see the benefits of it. so we actually see this is a very positive thing for our space and helps us in the long run dramatically.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
okay. and on the used market, i'm just wondering if you could contrast or maybe compare that today's new vehicle customer seems very like truck focused and very on the high end trims focus versus a use customer who may be -- the used customer wants a van. just what kind of differences that you're seeing in preferences between those two channels?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
dave, it's a great question. and i'll jump in and then -- this is david and then, dan, if he wants. it's the same on the pre-owned and because it's more discretional income right now with what's going on, because people are spending on vacations are in bars or restaurants that kind of things. we've seen higher down payments in 2020 and we saw higher credit scores in 2020. and you could see that by the jump in our cost of sale of pre-owned people are stepping up buying more car with more equipment. they are looking for the trucks and the suvs, when you have a used truck, you can't go wrong with it and it's going to move very quickly. when you have a nice sedan depending upon the price market that it's in, it may turn quickly or it may sit a little bit, but the used business is the same as the new, it's predominant suv and truck.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
so in your opinion are sedans just going to keep shrinking? do you think like car penetration stabilizes now or keeps growing?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
it's hard to say, i mean, over the last few decades, we've seen a lot of movement in a lot of different areas. and as you see electrification coming in, battery anxiety when you get to the suv size and bigger vehicles, how that's going to come into play. there is still a huge issue that hasn't been addressed in the country with an infrastructure to support it. the demand there from the oems coming out of the products in the start-ups and there is the incentives there from the government, but there is not an infrastructure to charge it and support it. so i think and also the range anxiety that you talk to -- when you talk to customers that aren't just willing to go there yet. all that will change over time and things will get better and battery life will get better. but i'm sure no differently than we all know this that the electric cars that have been out there for years now. as they get out there 80,000, 90,000 miles their battery life as far as charging goes isn't what it was when the car was no. so there's a lot of things to work out over time with electrification to see how that goes. and what role that will play as it relates to sedan, suv and truck market.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
okay. and last question on the new generation of f-150, your four customers really anxious to buy that truck?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
yes. it's a great question, david. i honestly can't say. we're not hearing, i'm not hearing a tremendously high demand right now. there is a tremendous amount of curiosity about seeing it and what it looks like and what the numbers would be as far as range and all that stuff. but i'm just not hearing it.
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
no, this is dan, david. i have not heard anything in regards to that to be our new f-150. although as you know the truck buyer is very, very loyal to the brand, probably one of the most loyal ones out there. so i would expect that there are loyal ford buyer is definitely excited about it and can't wait for it to come out.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
okay. thanks, guys.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer

operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the asbury automotive group q4 2020 earnings call. [operator instructions] and at this time, i'd like to turn the conference over to matt pettoni. please go ahead.
matt pettoni -- vice president of finance and treasurer
thanks, operator and good morning, everyone. welcome to asbury automotive group's fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay later today. the press release detailing asbury's fourth quarter results were issued earlier this morning and is posted on our website at asburyauto.com.

david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, matt. good morning, everyone. welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. we just reported another all-time record fourth quarter despite continued volatility and uncertainty in the economy. as saar recovered from q2 lows, we delivered a strong gross margin of 16.7%, which expanded 80 basis points versus q4 of last year. we also remain very active in managing expenses and we achieved sg&a as a percentage of gross profit of 61.4%. our focus on gross profit and expense management once again produced a great quarter. with adjusted eps of $4.44, up 76% over the prior year.
i would also like to call out that 2020 as a whole was a record year for asbury. for the full year, we grew adjusted eps by 36%. increased adjusted income from operations by over $70 million to $405 million, an increase of 21% and the highest level ever. we acquired a chrysler jeep dodge store in denver from john elway. we acquired eight park place's dealerships, two collision centers and one auction center in dallas, which in total added $1.9 billion in annualized revenue. we launched clicklane, our communication technology and ecosystem, which allows for a true online car buying and selling transaction. we publicly announced our five-year strategic plan, which targets growing the company to $20 billion in revenue by 2025.
our balance sheet remains strong due to our performance in cash flow. our pro forma net leverage ended this quarter at 2.1 times. this will allow us to maintain a more active acquisition pipeline and grow our business strategically by deploying capital. looking back over the last three years. we have dramatically transformed our portfolio by acquiring $2.5 billion and divesting $700 million in annualized revenue. our acquisitions had much higher margins than our divestitures and were accretive to our overall margin. this helped us achieve our 5.7% operating margin compared to 4.6% in 2018. we will continue to optimize our portfolio in the future.
turning to our key objectives in 2021. we will continue to build a strong culture obsessed with the guest experience. rollout our clicklane platform to all stores by the end of q1, be great partners to our oems by delivering an exceptional and transparent guest experience. grow our same-store revenue across all departments, build our m&a pipeline to support our goal of acquiring $5 billion of revenue by 2025 and maintain net leverage at or below 3 times, while executing a more active capital allocation strategy.
finally, we know the only differentiator we have in our franchise system is the level of service we offer. our strong performance is because of all the men and women in our stores who'd show up every day committed to serving our guests with passion and professionalism. their incredible performance inspires all of us to be better today than we were yesterday. our future is bright and we look forward to sharing this journey with all of our teammates, who run our business every day. we are thankful they are here making a meaningful difference.
i will now hand the call over to dan to discuss our operating performance, dan?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
thank you, david and good morning, everyone. my remarks will pertain to our same-store performance compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. looking at new vehicles. based on current market conditions, our focus remains on improving margins and not chasing volume. our new gross profit per vehicle was up $779 per car or 49% from the prior year period. all segment margins were up significantly from the prior year period. factoring in the acquisition of park place, we increased our luxury mix to 48%, driving our all store pvrs up $1,282 a car or 79%. at the end of december, our total new vehicle inventory was $640 million and our day supply was 40 days, down 26 days from the prior year. as a reminder, 40 days is an average composite of all of our brands. some of our brands were below 20 day supply during the quarter and experienced major challenges due to the lack of inventory. we expect that day supply to remain low for the first half of the year, but gradually recover for the back half as production capacity recovers.
turning to used vehicles. our gross profit margin was 7.1%, up 60 basis points from the prior period, representing our gross profit per vehicle of $1,741. similar to our new vehicle strategy in the current market condition, we focused on being opportunistic with our inventory and improving growth to maximize profits. as a result of our performance, our used retail gross profit was up 10%. our used vehicle inventory ended december at $189 million, which represents a 31 day supply, up two days from the prior year.
turning to f&i. our strong consistent and sustainable growth in f&i delivered an increase of $126 to $1,817 per vehicle retail from the prior year quarter. in the fourth quarter, our front-end yield per vehicle increased $701 per car to a fourth quarter record of $3,924. in addition, if you include reconditioning gross profit, which we report in parts and service, our front-end yield per vehicle was $4,582 per car. turning to parts and service. although our parts and service revenue decreased in the quarter, our business improved from the lows in april, but the recovery continues to be choppy due to the pandemic.
and now, i would like to provide an update on our omnichannel initiatives. in december, we launched clicklane, which is the latest evolution in our omnichannel strategy that we began more than five years ago. clicklane is a communications technology ecosystem, which allows for a true online car buying and selling experience. it feels many other guests that exist with online automotive retail platforms currently on the market. features that are unique to this platform includes, penny perfect trading values and loan payoffs, real payment figures based on local taxes and fees, a loan marketplace, which now includes more than 30 lenders, vin-specific finance and insurance products customized to the vehicle and consumer, the ability to sign all documents online via docusign, the in-tool service and collision appointment scheduled scheduler. early results and guest feedback on our clicklane platform have been extremely encouraging.
we piloted clicklane in three stores for the full month of december and the results have exceeded expectations. these three stores double their online car sales versus the prior year period. in addition, customers have commented on the great transparency, ease of use and ability to complete a transaction in minutes. the average timing to the guest to complete a total online transaction, including arranging the financing was 14 minutes and it took only 8 minutes for an entire transaction without financing or an all-cash deal. since the end of q4, we've continued with our rollout of clicklane and expect to have all the stores rolled out by the end of q1. with the majority of stores connected during the second half of q1.
and finally, looking at the results from our first full quarter of park place, reconfirms why we made the acquisition. the first full quarter contributed meaningfully to our top line and profitability results. and we are well on track to deliver the synergies we have targeted within the timeframe previously outlined. i would like to take this opportunity to express appreciation to all of our teammates in the field for their continued focus on the guest experience, their commitment to continuous improvement and their perseverance during 2020.
i will now hand the call over to p.j. to discuss our financial performance. p.j.?
patrick j. guido -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, dan and good morning, everyone. i would like to provide some financial highlights, which marks another record quarter for our company in this still uncertain macro environment. for additional details on our financial performance for the quarter, i would refer you to our financial supplement in our press release dated today february 2. overall compared to the fourth quarter of last year, total revenue was 18% higher than last year due to completed acquisitions and improvement in f&i, pvrs and higher average selling prices for both new and used. gross margin expanded by 80 basis points to 16.7% driven by our proactive inventory management and focus on improving gross profit per unit.
moving down the p&l. we saw sg&a as a percent of gross profit decreased by 690 basis points to 61.4%. this is due to proactive expense reductions and efficiencies gained on personnel and advertising. our actions to maximize gross profit and control expenses resulted in a record fourth quarter adjusted operating margin of 6%, an increase of 140 basis points about the same period last year. adjusted eps increased by 76% versus the prior period, maintaining momentum from the previous quarter. net income for the fourth quarter 2020 was adjusted for a $3.9 million or $0.15 per diluted share pre-tax gain on a dealership divestiture.
net income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was adjusted for a $7.1 million pre-tax charge for franchise rights imperatives or $0.27 per diluted share. a $6 million -- $600,000 pre-tax charge for real estate related charges or $0.03 per diluted share and a $600,000 pre-tax gain from a legal settlement or $0.03 per diluted share. our effective tax rate was 24.8% for the full year 2020 compared to 24.4% in 2019. floor plan interest expense for the quarter decreased by $4.6 million over the prior year quarter, driven primarily by lower inventory levels and lower libor rates. with respect to capital deployed this quarter, we spent approximately $20 million on store improvements and real estate and we spent approximately $80 million on debt repayment, which includes fully paying off our used line. also during the quarter, we divested a ford dealership in georgia, which generated approximately $50 million in annualized revenues. as a result of our operational performance, our balance sheet remains in a very strong position and we ended the quarter with approximately $462 million of liquidity comprised of cash, floor plan offset accounts, availability and availability on both our used line and revolving credit facility. also at the end of the quarter, our pro forma net leverage stood at 2.1 times, well below our targeted leverage range of 3.0 times.
i would now like to make a few comments regarding our expectations for 2021. we are still operating in a volatile environment with limited visibility, but do anticipate a gradual recovery in the second half of 2021 as covid vaccines get rolled out and oem production capacity improves. as a result, we are planning our business for a saar approximating 16 million units. but we'll remain nimble and vigilant to adapt to whatever conditions evolve. and inventories begin to normalize and the economy opens up, we believe our parts and service gross profit see the full recovery. we also believe that sg&a as a percentage of gross profit should continue to benefit from active expense management and improved productivity. we are also planning for a tax rate in 2021 of approximately 25% and capex of approximately $55 million. this amount excludes real estate purchases and potential lease buyout opportunities that we consider to be financing transactions.
finally, i would like to also provide a quick review of our five-year plan we unveiled at our launch of clicklane in december. our five-year strategic plan is to add $12 billion of revenue by 2025, expand our operating margins and grow eps in excess of revenue growth. specifically, this includes driving same-store revenue growth of $2 billion over five years, acquiring $5 billion of additional revenue over five years and adding an incremental $5 billion of revenue through the new clicklane platform. in closing, i would also like to thank our teams across the business, who continued to work tirelessly during this unprecedented time to ensure our current and long-term success.
we will now turn the call over to the operator and take your questions. operator?
",2020-Q4,ABG
,,,,":
operator
thank you, ladies and gentlemen. [operator instructions] our first question comes from rick nelson with stephens.
rick nelson -- stephens inc -- analyst
thanks a lot. good morning. so it sounds like you're expecting inventory to remain tight here. do you think you can maintain these gpus and the sg&a expense ratio in an environment like this? and because their potential [inaudible] here at 34 days of supply now, where you see that going to potentially become even more problematic.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
you know, eric, as we all know -- this is david. it's a fluid situation. it's a fantastic question. as we sit here today, we received far less cars in the month of april than we anticipated. but looking forward at may, we're anticipating more inventory to come in than we received in april. so, based upon what we have on the ground now and what we perceive we're going to receive in may, which could certainly get pushed, we think we're in fine shape to deliver what we need to from a unit perspective, but also keep the margins as well. it's really tough to look beyond a month at a time not knowing what's going to happen with the chip shortage and inventory and what's going to come. i mean it's really, really too hard to see how much beyond that, but we have strong confidence as we're positioned in april and what we anticipate receiving in may.
rick nelson -- stephens inc -- analyst
thanks for that color, david. are there brands that are more impacted by the semiconductor shortage than others, or how those have looked across the spectrum?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
good morning, rick. this is dan. yes, listen, every every brand is definitely impacted, but i would say domestics are more impacted than some of the other ones that we're seeing out there.
rick nelson -- stephens inc -- analyst
got you. thanks. i'm curious on the used side of the house, what proportion of vehicles are you sourcing internally and what proportion are you going to auction and what do you see going on in the auction market nowadays.
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
yeah, rick, another great question. so we source in -- over 50% of our cars come in from the trading perspective, auction prices as you can imagine are at an all time high and the availability is -- continues to be scarce at the auction.
rick nelson -- stephens inc -- analyst
in parts and service, it was quite a differential customer pay same-store up 3%, warranty down 13%. curious what's driving that differential and pl outlook i just for those two drivers to service and parts
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
rick, this is david. the warranty, it did have [phonetic] some blows with the brand and what's going on with recalls and everything. so across the board, import domestic luxury which is down everywhere in warranty, don't read much into that. i mean that kind of pops up and down and will continue to do that throughout the year. we're really excited about customer pay when you think about it. we probably had close to 40% of our stores at one point or another closed down in february. so we were dramatically impacted in february, not only with sales but in parts and service. march came back so strong, it was actually ahead of '19 pace numbers. and as we sit here in april, we're experiencing the same. so, the customers are back on the road, the service business is back. we always had a laddering [phonetic] collision coming back, and now collision is back as well. so while we're feeling it on the variable side with some shortages with inventory, thankfully parts and service is picking up on that. and just to go back and touch on what dan said about the used cars and acquisitions with 50% coming from trades. our other resources is buying directly from consumers off lease vehicles from the manufacturers, certainly within our service drive and loaner car fleet. so we got a -- certainly a tight day supply but we think it's one that the inventory turns quickly and we're creating great margins with it.
rick nelson -- stephens inc -- analyst
great. and i would like to sneak one more in here about april. you talked about the inventory challenges, how do sales look and gpus. are they continuing to be elevated?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, just what you've seen in the first quarter results, we're experiencing that as we sit here today in april as well.
rick nelson -- stephens inc -- analyst
great. thanks a lot, and good luck.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from john murphy with bank of america.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning, guys. i just had a first question on [indecipherable] on inventory. i mean, you, as well as rest of the industry has done a great job of turning inventory faster and it hasn't had a significant impact on sales, and short tendered it to some extent, but it's not been a major negative. what point or what inventory level you think you start running into constraints on supply being able to deliver the consumer what they want. and also on the inventory side, we all know often dogs sit around in inventory, i'm just curious if you think that you've kind of -- you and the industry have worked out a lot of these unattractive vehicles and now we're really just looking at really hot selling vehicles in inventory that are turning fast.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
it's a great question. and again it's such a fluid situation and you don't have a long runway to look over the next 90 days what's coming. so my comments that i'm going to make are based on sitting here today. our perception is we're going to receive almost double the inventory in may that we received in april. i can tell you sitting here today, if we receive the same inventory levels in may that we received in april, we would struggle to get to the new unit sales that we need to get to. so, no insight to june at this point, but we're confident where we're sitting in april and we're confident with may assuming we receive the production that we were told we're going to receive.
as it relates to the hot selling products as you point to, the oems are really great at this. and while the chip shortage is there, they've really been shifting their production to the faster selling vehicles. so to your point about some of the dogs that sit out there, i'm sure there is a few strays every now and then. but it's really very light inventory and it's moving pretty quickly. the demand is very high, which is obviously, you can see everyone's benefiting from in the margins, and i can't see it slowing down anytime soon. because it's also with people coming back is going to be a pent-up demand on the fleet side as well.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
yeah, it's pretty encouraging. okay. and then just second question, park place obviously was a big acquisition, but you guys didn't even mention it much in the quarter. just curious it sounds the integration is going very smoothly because there's no noise about it. so i mean that's a good sign. and given that that appears to be going so well, you've got a $5 billion target over your five year plan. could you get more aggressive on acquisitions? i mean, some of your peers are talking about that kind of number almost on an annual basis, or doing that almost on an annual basis. i mean is there opportunity to get more aggressive and even larger than what you're targeting at the moment?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, it's a great question, john, i'll touch on park place real quick. the largest acquisition asbury's history from a dollar standpoint, but from a meaning standpoint and really setting us up for who we want to be. i mean we look at park place as the crown jewel in the automotive industry. the professionals that we have there, the general managers, the senior team that runs the business there is everything we thought it was and more, but it takes a lot of communication and care to make sure things go smoothly, and we're looking at the long-term relationships and run. so very, very excited what we're seeing there and it kind of shows in our total numbers compared to the same-store. so that'll continue to progress and the relationship is great and acquisition transition is going great at this point.
as it relates to acquisitions, in the time that i've been with the company, we've never had more conversations going on than what we have now. everyone one month, their price is based off covid numbers. i don't think that that's in the shareholders' best interest to buy every acquisition based on covid numbers and there has to be some discipline and common sense of the numbers. so while we feel the need to want to acquire things right now, we're not going to go outside our structure because it's about the long game and doing the right thing with the shareholders' equity. so we'll stay disciplined. we know deals will come our way. we like a lot of the conversations that we're in now. there aren't any deals being announced that we haven't looked at, but we're really not just into acquiring revenue. we really want to make sure it's revenue that is meaningful for the company for five, ten years from now. and we're not just buying at a moment in time when the earnings and multiples are very high.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and then the last question that all kind of weave together with that, i mean quickly you gave us some metrics which were helpful. but very curious what kind of geographic reach or extension in your reach that is giving you if you can tell us sort of early days and even with that, what kind of market share gains you may be seeing in your existing markets because of the ease of transaction for the consumer.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
sure. it's a great question. and keep in mind, every store in the company has it, but some stores were rolled out in the last week of the quarter. we're seeing the luxury customers really take advantage of the tool. we're seeing the import customers really take advantage of the tool, seeing it a little bit on the domestic side, but i think we're really hurting with inventory on the domestic side which is making it difficult, you can't purchase what you don't have. with push start, we were seeing 70%, 80% used, and 20%, 30% new. it's about a 60/4o split used to new right now. and we're certainly obviously acquiring a lot of customers with sales transactions that we never did business with before. we're shipping a lot of vehicles. but i think that is somewhat normal as well right now with low day supply and people really looking for their vehicles. i think the key metrics to really focus on, it's not a lead generation to transactional tool. most people's tools are seeing a lot of subprime and are struggling to get the financing. our average credit score so far in clicklane is higher than the store average. nine out of ten people are getting financed. double the cash being put down on a clicklane consumer compared to in-store. these are very strong metric that says strong creditworthy people are buying these cars online, trading vehicles with pay-offs and taking delivery of them at home. and i can't emphasize enough, it's just started. so this is only going to build incrementally over time. and we believe we're the first in this space to have a full transactional tool, not a lead generation, not a piece of the sale, a full transactional tool, which puts us in the driver's seat for really growing the tool. and like i said, we launched dallas store at the end of the quarter, we've already launched parts and accessories on it now as well. so we're going to continue to innovate with this tool and we're going to get better each and every month. and we'll certainly continue every quarter to share the information what we're seeing. but it's very, very promising.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
and sorry, david, if i can follow-up on that. so if we think about clicklane and your acquisition strategy, i mean you could argue that this digital overlay means that you might not need to make as any acquisitions and you have a much farther reach so you can gain market share that way, or conversely some are arguing that you need to build a greater national network to really leverage the digital overlay. which way do you think it is [inaudible]. how do you approach the marriage of the two?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
hey, john, it's an excellent question, and look there is more than one way to climb a mountain, but from our perspective is brick and mortar is permanent and it's expensive. and if the transaction happens online, then it's really just a supply chain delivery. i've used this example before so i used it again. as we sit here today, we currently don't have any stores in phoenix. if we chose to put a ring around the city of phoenix with 5.5 million population and start marketing clicklane, no differently than carvana we could start doing transactions within that marketplace, which would create much higher sg&a numbers than what we're currently doing without that brick and mortar. so we will continue to build out our markets, but because of the tool that we have and our ability to move vehicles around, we absolutely do not believe we have to be in every market to do business in each segment of the country.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. that's incredibly helpful, thank you very much.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer

thank you. our next question comes from ryan sigdahl with the craig hallum capital group.
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
good morning, guys, thanks for taking my questions.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
just one quick follow-up on clicklane. so looking at the clicklane website, also looking at asbury website, seems very similar between the two. curious if you plan to run kind of side by side websites there or if you plan to consolidate those at any point in the future.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
sure, ryan. as a reminder, with the franchise stores, all the oems require us to use certain vendors for our websites. so we certainly have to stick to those policies. clicklane will continue to grow, and depending upon whether we have franchise stores in that market or not, it will grow in different ways. when i talked about the [inaudible launch in the parts and accessory piece, because we didn't want it to be a distraction during the purchase of the vehicle and people accessorizing the car, we actually put it in the back end of clicklane. so after the consumer purchases the vehicle and we pdf them their docusign documents, they have access to the back end of the tool for service and parts and collision. that's where they have the ability to accessorize it as well. so we have a roadmap. we're not done innovating this tool. and we have a long ways to go from where we see it. but being the first with the lending marketplace and a full transactional tool and the only one out there in the market right now being able to do pay-offs, we think we are at a competitive advantage and now we just need to scale our product and get the word out there to consumers the ease it is of doing business with us.
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
great. and then you mentioned the used versus new mix, it is higher on the used side on clicklane. do you think that's purely a function of inventory availability right now or do you think over time used will stay stronger online as far as the mix goes?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. it's an excellent question. it's hard to say. i mean, we were close to 80% with push start and 60-40 to us is very promising. we're selling $100,000 land rovers on the tool new, and we're selling pre-owned that way as well. it's kind of hard to judge when your inventories are still low whether someone would transact that way or not. we believe no differently than technology in any other space, as the consumers become more comfortable and the tool to actually get out there more often, we believe that these numbers are going to double every year as far as used, because the convenience factor and transparency is second to none, and it's what the space has been craving for for years. and seeing their f&i results, to be 17% higher per vehicle on clicklane compared to the actual stores is extremely promising.
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
last one for me, you mentioned you quantified the eps impact from weather in texas and closures there, is there a way you can quantify what the impact was to same-store sales?
patrick j. guido -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, sure. ryan, this is pj. we estimated the total impact to growth split evenly between sales and service at roughly $5 million of gross profit impact. the stores -- our stores in texas, our park place in mcdavid dealer groups were closed for nearly a full week. and our plaza group, our group in indiana and our crown group were also closed for a full day. so again, we estimate the total impact of that on gross profit at $5 million.
in addition to that, we also had roughly $1 million worth of damage to two of our stores in texas, our lexus [indecipherable] plano stores. so we incurred the expense associated with that. and then lastly, we did a guarantee pay for all our associates in those markets for the time that the stores were closed. so that was it approximately an additional $800,000 of compensation expense.
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
great, thanks guys, good luck.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from adam jonas with morgan stanley.
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey everybody. thanks so much for your -- those kpis around clicklane, that's really great. i wanted to hone in on one where you said over -- i think you said over 50% preferred or chose home delivery. is that correct? is that you said?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
yes, correct.
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. can you tell us how many units that was in the quarter?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, adam, we're not disclosing that at this point because again, [indecipherable] doing 90 stores that came went off the road, but i can tell you it -- as we sit here, the number is growing every week.
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
so, when are we going to start seeing that stuff because -- and the kpis were great, i'm looking for the slide in your deck and of course, there is no slide with all the stuff, and it's important that the kpis are consistent. so obviously we can do the whole dog and pony thing and check the transcripts and talk with you after, but it is nice if it's on the deck. just some feedback, when are we going to start seeing more formal unit volume that we can track so we can start tracking digital comps sequentially and then eventually year-on-year?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i appreciate your passion in wanting to see the numbers. as i said we were launched in stores the last quarter -- or the last week of the quarter. so i don't think it's too much to say, well, let's get a full quarter under our belt and we'll be talking about it every quarter. so certainly [indecipherable] by, we'll be happy to share that information.
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks, david. last one from me. auto companies are starting to explore going direct to consumer with insurance. and then yeah, insurance has been -- and even legacy guys are starting to do that. gm using partners with onstar, tesla, going themselves with partners but then eventually themselves. i'm wondering if -- what you think of that. do you think this is -- does that make sense of that part of where you see that digital expression of auto retailing, and if oems start to do more kind of cutting out the third-party kind of parasitic insurance folks -- and i'm not saying that mainly because of the cars become the actuary and the agent and just makes sense to do that. how do you see that affecting your role on the eye part of f&i. thanks.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
so i think it's an excellent question and i don't want -- really want to talk too much about things we're working on in innovation, but i mean for 35, 40 years within dealership people refer insurance business to other locations. it's natural to assume that this would be logical down the road to have it be one-stop shopping and everything available at one location. but i really don't want to get into any details at this point, but it's an excellent point. it's only logical that it's altogether.
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
alright. well, that answers part of the question. thanks, david. appreciate it.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from rajat gupta with jpmorgan.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
good morning, thanks for taking the question. i just had a question on the used vehicle unit growth. you talked about the overall $5 million gross profit impact overall for the company. i mean suggest something like two to three points of unit growth impact, am i close on that? and then just relatedly obviously pretty strong numbers year-over-year and on a two year basis, but still seems to be lagging, some of the peers that have reported recently. are you satisfied with the performance there? do you think there is more you could do in terms of sourcing or the mix of the vehicles that you're selling to grow that business even faster, and i had a follow-up. thanks.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. it's an excellent question. no, we're not satisfied and it's more than fair to say we're not performing at the level we should with pre-owned. it's hard to quantify, pj talked about some of the markets that were close but we literally had 40% of our stores closed. and while they were physically closed for a week, you know the hyper storms they closed down before and closed down after. so i would think it's probably fair to say looking at all the stores the markets that were closed for some periods of time and the effect on business, it had to be somewhere in the 4% to 6% range in volume, but it's really hard to quantify, it's really just a guess at that point. but to answer your question simplistically, we're not performing at the level we need to with pre-owned. we think in every other category, we're more than holding our own, and this is an area of opportunity for us, we need to get going.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. that's really helpful. and just a follow-up on the m&a -- the m&a environment. we talked about like unreasonable earnings and probably not appropriate multiple right now in the market. i mean, and there is -- it looks like these gross margin tailwinds could probably last for another year or maybe, you know, like mid 2022 or later 2022. so when do you make the decision to start deploying that capital finally, because it's already been six months since you announced the plan. you know, it will be 18 months a year from now and earnings might still look elevated. so, i mean would you continue to sit on the cash on the balance sheet or -- just trying to understand like how that capital might be deployed now and then. and then when would be the right time to finally make that decision to work toward your five year plan? thanks. yeah.
patrick j. guido -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
hey, rajat, it's pj. so i'll start and then maybe hand it off to david. but it's actually been three months since we announced the plan in december. and as we've said before, we're very disciplined in our approach to acquisitions. we do -- we look -- when we evaluate an opportunity, we're looking at ebitda multiples and then factoring in the synergies we think we can achieve, and then we look at the irr relative to our cost of capital. and we need to see a margin there to deliver an accretive deal. so we are evaluating deals, it's on a deal by deal basis. and so we'll continue to fill the pipeline but we're only going to look at or execute on those deals that make the most sense for asbury.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
and i'll just follow-up on that and talk about the two points. when you look at 2020, prior to 2020, a dealer was making $5 million annually. and then in covid they started making $10 million and they want to work off to $10 million and they want a multiple that's higher than what the brand has ever run. that makes it difficult. while i agree with you the way margins and this space is going to be for the next year, and again it's one person's opinion, this isn't a forward-looking statement. but you have to think about '23 and '24, the amount of evs that are going to be on the market, where the infrastructure is going to be for that in the country at that time, and where is supply and demand going to mix. so i don't think you can get caught up in the hype of just buying at the moment in time and you have to look out a few years to really see what the value and trend is going to be. and as what we talked about when we launched the five year plan, which is no doubt we'll hit it, that $5 billion doesn't all have to come in one year that -- it doesn't have to be $1 billion a year. we have to be disciplined. we've been doing this a long time, i've been in automotive for 35 years. there is always highs and lows. we're talking to more acquisitions today than we ever have since i've been employed here. so i think things will happen, but i think we should be judged in the long run by the acquisitions that we did and how accretive they were for the company, instead of just having nervous energy [phonetic] buying revenue and then may be struggling with performance over time.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it, got it. that's really helpful. one last one, just following up on clicklane. and i know you don't want to give out like the unit numbers, but had it not been for clicklane, would you have grown slower than what you did in the first quarter. i'm just curious if it contributed to incremental volumes and not just replacing one for one. thanks.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
no, it's an excellent question. and i can't stress this enough, we only had a few pilot stores on it in december, so we essentially -- and no other public group really has this full transactional tool nor that they have it in all their stores, we rolled out 86 stores in two and a half months. so the numbers are, you know what i mean, that week over week you're adding so many stores. there is a lot of incremental sales that we would not have received, and i made that comment, because looking at the information we weren't doing business with them before. but when you're adding 40 stores in the last three weeks of the quarter, it's just not a material number. i can tell you every single week the number grows and the transactions are growing on the tool. and we haven't hit our stride with marketing, where -- we really just start marketing now. we really want to protect the tool, make sure everything was rolled out properly, and it was efficiently working. and i know it sounds crazy to roll it out, it's just plug and play software. but when you think about all the different counties and different tax codes and making sure that it's perfect and everything is working correctly, there's a little bit of discipline in time to make sure it's right. you just don't want to invite people to the tool and not have it be a great experience. and what we quoted last time with the pilot stores is still holding true. it's a 14 minute transaction if there's a pay-off and there is financing needed in [indecipherable] paying cash it's 8 minutes. it's hard to beat that kind of time. and it's very encouraging for us from our perspective. and i'm not saying it won't change over time, but it's information we're sharing as it's coming, 50% of the people are taking delivery at home. that didn't happen in the heat of covid with push start. so we're very excited about what we're seeing. we're also seeing a higher credit score with clicklane compared to push start. so it's very, very encouraging. and i promise we'll talk about it in great detail every quarter, but it's not just the unit sales, it's the type of person that's using the tool and transacting on it that is most encouraging to us.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it, got it. makes sense. thanks for all the color, and good luck.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
absolutely. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from stephanie benjamin with truist.
stephanie benjamin -- truist -- analyst
hi, good morning.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
stephanie benjamin -- truist -- analyst
just we really appreciate all the additional color that you've given on clicklane. but question -- i understand that it was a pretty, pretty large task to roll this out to all of the -- your stores this quarter. so how should we think about any kind of incremental advertising or investments as we move through the year? is -- should there -- should we expect a step up as you kind of look to get the name out there a little bit more in some of your markets. is that something we should just kind of expect not only in store but maybe also on a local level just so customers know what their options are.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
yes, stephanie, it's a great question. yes, we've allocated several million dollars between now and the end of the year and we spread the dollars by market depending upon unit sales and traffic counts and density of population. now the numbers may change but what our plan is depending upon what happens with inventories, it's too hard to predict sitting here today what things are going to look like in july and august from an inventory standpoint. but our intent is to get that out there. we think we have some interesting marketing things coming out that will help us. and again, we're sitting here the third week in april, or the fourth week i should say, and we're talking about first quarter data. i can't stress that enough, it's incrementally growing every week. so we're very excited to talk about it in the future as it comes. we're hoping that the marketing really sticks and it's noteworthy. and i can't stress this enough, this is different than a lot of the other transaction -- or a lot of the other tools that are out there in the market right now. this was built on a chat platform. and what that means is the ability to walk people through the tool if they're getting stuck or if there is an issue at a moment in time. and there is also the ability when they leave the tool to send them a link to start right back where they were so there is no starting over. so it's not just the incremental sale or the conquest sale when they go through the whole tool, but it's also the follow up and recovering the sale and bringing them back. and we're very hyper-focused on tracking all the kpi. and as we accumulate more, we'll certainly share that as well.
stephanie benjamin -- truist -- analyst
absolutely. and then just to follow up on that. when you speak to the incremental advertising, is that going to be just in your existing markets or will you also look to maybe you mentioned phoenix as an example kind of entering a new market as well with some of these investments or advertising investments.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
sure, stephanie, i'll say this. our intent soon will be to test this product in markets we don't do business in. i really don't want to start talking about specifics, but it will be in short time that we experiment in markets where we don't currently do business. that is the fact.
stephanie benjamin -- truist -- analyst
got it. and then lastly for me, just on acquisitions, you've mentioned that -- and it's pretty apparent that it's a pretty active market right now. so i'm just curious if you're -- if what you're targeting i think in the past, looking to expand a little bit more on luxury, so maybe in terms of brand concentration or geography. has that changed at all just those new opportunities. may we have come up as of late. i mean, really you couldn't really consider in your past just trying to to kind of gauge as you're looking at the m&a environment what's most appealing at this stage?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
no, it's a great question, stephanie. again, 35 years of doing this. brand strengths come and go. certain luxury brands are hotter than heck and years later they slow down and i think it's really about having a balanced portfolio. after doing the park place deal we had a lot of conversations where dealers in other parts of the country wanted same multiple that we paid park place. and i'll just pick a brand just for a conversation. if you have one luxury brand, the multiple is different, even though it's the same brand, whether you're talking, massachusetts, california, michigan or texas or florida, because the franchise laws are different within each individual state, seasonality of the business, density of population, business friendly state or not. so we really spend a lot of time looking at each individual acquisition and where it sits within the market and do we think that this is a proper return for us. i mean, i've just recently had this conversation with someone else asking why we wouldn't offer them the same as what we paid for park place and i just simplistically said it's not texas. i mean, it's a different market with different franchise laws. if one state has a franchise law no franchise within 15 miles, in another state it's five miles, i don't know how you don't factor that in when you're looking at the pricing.
stephanie benjamin -- truist -- analyst
absolutely. that's really helpful. well, i appreciate all the additional color today.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from bret jordan with jefferies.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning, this is mark jordan on for bret. well, a lot of good questions have already been asked, but i guess i have two quick questions and you may have touched on them both already, but thinking about the parts and service segment and in particular our customer pay. can you talk about how it trended throughout the quarter and many if trends have continued to accelerate through april kind of what you're seeing there.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i would call january pretty promising and stable. it wasn't quite pre-covid numbers, but it was continuing to come back and i would call it close to being flat. just because the way february played out, it really varied by market because of weather, but i'll call february a step back, but i think it was more to do to weather than anything else and march was just the full acceleration forward, and all the numbers, specifically around customer pay, were ahead of pre-covid numbers going back to '19. we're seeing that same result as we sit here in april, and we anticipate that for the rest of the year. we think there's a lot of pent-up demand. now, if something happens in the fall, the virus comes back, i mean i can't obviously comment on that. i'm just saying, as i said in my comments earlier, people are back on the road, the collision business is back, the customer pay business is back. warranty being down, i don't look at that is anything. it is what it is, you can't do warranty work if it's not needed. so that's just a reactionary thing.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
okay, great. and then it seems like competition for sourcing attractive used vehicles is very high right now, and thinking trade-ins might be down in terms of unit volume. are you having to shift more to purchasing vehicles directly from customers, and if so, kind of how competitive would you say that channel is right now given may competitors might be increasing sourcing from the same channel?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
it's an excellent question. we're taking in less trades because we're selling -- we're not selling the cars we should be selling based upon the demand right now. but we're still from a percentage standpoint, we're still taking in the amount of trades we always did prior, it's just different volume levels. we are having to seek other avenues and some of those avenues have dried up. there's a lot of -- it's kind of like the residential real estate market. i mean there is an awful lot of buyers out there and there's not a lot of sellers out there. so it's a little bit more difficult getting inventory. people are certainly paying up for that, you see it at the auctions and you certainly see it in the manheim data that comes out. we don't think that that's going to change anytime soon, especially with what's going on with the new car inventory. i don't know if dan want to comment or add to that dan or?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
no, i think you covered it well, david.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
okay, great, thank you very much for taking my questions.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our last question here is david whiston with morningstar.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
thanks, good morning. do you guys -- i guess how bad did you guys want higher inventory or -- at the risk of giving up some of your pricing power you are now enjoying? do you want a lot more, a little more, or can it stay where it is even?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, david, we're smiling over here, and listen, because it's such a fair and greedy question to ask. yeah, that's a great question. the problem is, look at -- it's all -- everyone looks great, everyone is reporting good numbers, everyone is showing high margins. we didn't all of a sudden get that much better, it's simplistically supply and demand. there is that point where you're missing a lot of sales because you just don't have the inventory. domestic truck for us was brutal in the quarter. we were really down in trucks. i mean, we didn't have the inventory to sell, so we wanted a lot more than what we had. i would tell you the industry performs well and stability exist when there's probably a 60 to 70 days supply in the market. and right now with all the government spending that's going on and people coming out, the demand is going to be high right now, and the fear is the inventory won't be there to match the demand.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
okay. and what happens now when the customers coming in really set [phonetic] on buying a new -- a particular new vehicle, you have to tell them you don't have it due to inventory. does that customer intent on buying another new vehicle, buying a used vehicle, or just [inaudible]
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
hi, good morning, david. this is dan. so in a lot of cases we have really become even more efficient on taking a pre-order for a lack of a better term. so perhaps the car that is an income in unit, that is actually being built or already on the transportation. in a lot of cases we're seeing a lot of cars that are being delivered by the trucking company and they're going in for our pre-delivery inspection, getting detailed and coming right out for delivery. so i can tell -- and in a lot of cases where we just don't have that availability of that particular model, customers are a little bit more flexible on maybe giving of a particular package or maybe taking additional package that they were not considered at the beginning.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
okay. and shifting over to the rise of tesla in particular their model y. i'm just curious is that hurting your toyota honda or your premium brand stores at all, and do you have any customers, especially at the park place group wanting to pay in bitcoin?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
no, to answer all your questions. no, not yet. not at this point, no. haven't had the consumers come to us with a bitcoin request yet, and haven't really felt a strong competitive point from tesla. i think a lot of their sales come from california and certainly other parts of the country, but it's not a real dominant player in the markets we currently transact in.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
okay. i appreciate the detail. that's helpful. and just for pj or karen, just real quick. the three special items, where were they booked for gaap?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
they're booked in other income, david.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
okay, all right, thanks guys.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you very much. appreciate it. this concludes today's discussion. we appreciate your participation and we look forward to speaking with you all in the next quarter. have a great day.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, good day and welcome to the asbury automotive group first quarter 2021 earnings call. today's conference is being recorded. at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to ms. karen reid. please go ahead.
karen reid -- head of investor relations and treasurer
thanks, david, and good morning everyone. as david mentioned, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay later this afternoon. welcome to asbury automotive first quarter 2021 earnings call. i'm karen reid, asbury's new treasurer, and head of investor relations. i look forward to engaging with our analysts and our investor community. the press release detailing asbury's first quarter results was issued earlier this morning and is posted on our website at asburyauto.com. participating with me today are david hult, our president and chief executive officer; pj guido, our chief financial officer; and dan clara, our senior vice president of operations. at the conclusion of our remarks, we will open up the call for questions, and i will be available later for any follow-up questions that you may have.
before we begin, we must remind you that the discussion during the call today is likely to contain forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements are statements other than those which are historical in nature, including those statements relating to the duration and contemplated impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance, the impact of the chip shortage, as well as the financial projections and expectations about our products, markets and growth.
all forward-looking statements are subject to significant uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from those suggested by these statements, including potential impacts from the covid 19 pandemic and the semiconductor chip shortage on us, our industry and our customers, suppliers, vendors and business partners. for information regarding certain of the risks that may cause actual results to differ, please see our filings with the sec from time to time, including our form 10-k for the year ended december 2020, any subsequently filed quarterly reports on form 10-q, and our earnings release issued earlier today. we expressly disclaim any responsibility to update forward-looking statements. in addition, certain non-gaap financial measures as defined under sec rules, may be discussed on this call. as required by applicable sec rules, we provide reconciliations of any such non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures on our website. we have also posted an updated investor presentation on our website asbury.com highlighting our first quarter results. it is now my pleasure to hand the call over to our ceo, david hult. david?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, karen. we are excited to have you on our team. welcome to our first quarter earnings call. we have just reported record adjusted eps of $4.68, up 160% over the prior year. saar continues to recover from prior year lows despite supply chain disruptions due to the chip shortage and covid. the strong demand in the face of lower days supply helped us deliver a strong gross margin of 17.5%, an expansion of 60 basis points versus the first quarter of last year. we've also stayed disciplined in managing expenses, resulting in sg&a as a percentage of gross profit of 62.7%, an 880 basis point improvement versus prior year. of note, this result includes an estimated $0.22 negative eps impact from the winter storm experience in february that caused us to close stores in several markets along with some structural damage.
our total revenue for the quarter was up 36% year-over-year, and total gross profit was up 40%. showing strong signs of recovery, new unit sales were up 24%, and used unit sales were up 16% with margin expansion in both segments. total f&i revenue was up 25%, while revenue from parts and service was up 18% from last year. we saw signs of growth in parts and service over this past quarter as drivers are returning to the road. our balance sheet remains strong due to our performance in cash flow. our pro forma adjusted net leverage ended this quarter at 1.7 times. this leverage level will allow us to maintain a more active acquisition pipeline and grow our business by strategically deploying capital.
a couple of additional comments regarding performance. we achieved an adjusted operating margin of 6.1%, up 180 basis points over last year, and we successfully launched clicklane, which dan will discuss further. regarding acquisitions, it is a very active market and we are engaged in many conversations, but remain disciplined in our approach. we are confident we will find deals that make sense for asbury. looking forward, we are focused on our five year plan, while we continue our disciplined approach to operating our business and allocating capital to its highest returns.
finally, i would like to thank all the hard working men and women who showed up every day throughout the past year with a positive attitude and a commitment to serving our guests. once again, you delivered great results for our company. i will now hand the call over to dan to discuss our operating performance. dan?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
thank you, david, and good morning everyone. my remarks will pertain to our same store performance compared to the first quarter of 2020. looking at new vehicles. based on current market conditions, we are focused on being opportunistic with our inventory and improving gross [phonetic] to maximize profit. our new average gross profit per vehicle was up $640 per car or 39% from the prior year period. all segment margins were up significantly from the prior year period. factoring in the acquisition of park place, luxury represented 45% of our total revenue, up from 34% in the first quarter of 2020, driving our all-store new vehicle pvrs up $1,114 or 67%. at the end of march, our total new vehicle inventory was $527 million and our days supply was at an all-time low of 34 days, down 71 days from the prior year. some of our brands were below 20 day supply during the quarter and experienced major challenges due to the lack of inventory. with no clear understanding of when production will return to normal levels, we expect that the days supply to remain low throughout the remainder of the year.
turning to used vehicles. our gross margin was 8.1%, up 100 basis point from the prior period, representing an average gross profit per vehicle of $1,943. as a result of our performance, our gross profit was up 36%. our used vehicle inventory ended march at $193 million, which represents a 27-day supply, down 15 days from the prior year. we remain focused on sourcing inventory that will generate a fair return.
turning to f&i. our strong consistent and sustainable growth in f&i delivered an increase of $114 to $1,798 per vehicle retail from the prior year quarter. in the first quarter, our front-end yield per vehicle increased $637 per vehicle to a first quarter record of $3,932.
turning to parts and service. our parts and service revenue increased 1% in the quarter with business exceeding pre-covid numbers in march. we continue to see this trend thus far in april. and now, i would like to provide an update on our omnichannel initiatives.
in december, we launched clicklane, which is a latest evolution in our omnichannel strategy that we began more than five years ago. we are excited to announce that we have completed the rollout of clicklane to all stores in this quarter. as a reminder, clicklane is a complete transactional tool, which allows for a true online car buying and selling experience. it fills many of the gaps that exist with online automotive retail platforms currently on the market, which basically are lead generators and unable to fully complete an online transaction. features that are unique to clicklane include penny perfect trading values and loan payoffs, real payment figures based on local taxes and fees, a loan marketplace, which now includes more than 30 lenders, vin-specific finance and insurance products customized to the vehicle and consumer, the ability to sign all documents online via docusign, the in-tool service and collision appointment scheduler, and we just added parts and accessories. although clicklane just fully launched in all stores, we have some promising initial metrics to share.
average down payment is more than double our in-store average f&i pvr is 17% higher when compared to our stores. nearly 50% of customers chose to take delivery at home. credit scores on average are higher than our stores. on average, nine out of ten customers that apply for a loan are approved through clicklane. 50% of transactions had a pay-off with their trade. trades taken through clicklane that were retailed are averaging higher for end-to-end pvrs when compared to our stores. trades through clicklane are turning in less than 15 days. we are certainly excited about these early indicators.
and finally, i would like to take this opportunity to express appreciation to all of our teammates in the field for their continued focus on the guest experience, their commitment to continuous improvement, and the perseverance. i will now hand the call over to pj to discuss our financial performance. pj?
patrick j. guido -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, dan, and good morning everyone. i'd like to provide some financial highlights which mark yet another record quarter for our company. for additional details on our financial performance for the quarter, i would refer you to our financial supplement in our press release dated today, april 27th, 2021.
overall, compared to the first quarter of last year, total revenue was 36% higher than last year. gross margin expanded by 60 basis points to 17.5%, driven by our focus on maximizing gross profit in a market where demand continues to outweigh supply. moving down the p&l, we saw sg&a as a percent of gross profit decreased by 880 basis points to 62.7%. we estimate that sg&a would have been approximately 100 basis points lower, absent the impact on gross profit and expenses of the winter storm that resulted in store closures in several markets and also caused damage to a few of our texas stores. our actions to manage gross profit and control expenses resulted in a record first quarter adjusted operating margin of 6.1%, an increase of 180 basis points above the same period last year. adjusted net income increased 161% to $90.7 million, and adjusted eps increased by 160% versus the prior year period, maintaining our momentum coming out of 2020.
net income for the first quarter 2021 was adjusted for the following pre-tax items. gain on legal settlements of $3.5 million or $0.14 per diluted share. gain on real estate sales of $1.1 million or $0.03 per diluted share. and real estate related charges of $1.8 million or $0.07 per diluted share. net income for the first quarter of 2020 was adjusted up -- up for pre-tax items totaling $20.4 million or $0.79 per diluted share. for specific details on 2020 adjustments, please reference this morning's press release.
our effective tax rate was 22.3% for the first quarter 2021 compared to 19.1% in 2020. floor plan interest expense for the quarter decreased by $4.1 million over the prior year quarter, driven primarily by lower inventory levels and lower libor rates. with respect to capital deployed this quarter, we spent approximately $17 million on store improvements in real estate and we repaid approximately $14 million of debt. as a result of our operational performance, our balance sheet remains in a very strong position, and we ended the quarter with approximately $550 million of liquidity comprised of cash floor plan offset accounts and availability on both our used line and revolving credit facility. also at the end of the quarter, our pro forma adjusted net leverage ratio stood at 1.7 times, well below our targeted leverage range of 3.0 times.
as we look forward to the remainder of 2021, we anticipate similar conditions to what we have seen the last few quarters. inventories are likely to remain low and there will be continued opportunity to drive gross margin. overall, as we did in q1, we are still planning to a $16 million saar environment, but we'll keep our business nimble and flexible with an emphasis on gross margin and sg&a expense management. one shift worth noting is that as the economy opens up more, we expect to see higher growth and a bigger contribution from our parts and service business.
with regard to our five year plan, we are only one quarter into it but are off to a great start. our clicklane platform is up and running across all our stores. our same-store sales revenue in q1 was a strong 18% and we are building an active acquisition pipeline to pursue those deals that make the most sense for asbury. as we progress, we will provide regular updates on the five year plan and how we are delivering.
in closing, i would also like to thank our teams across the business who continue to work tirelessly during this unprecedented time to ensure our current and long-term success. this concludes our prepared remarks. we will now turn the call over to the operator and take your questions. operator?

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from rick nelson with stephens.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
thanks. good morning. nice quarter. david, i'd like to ask about the acquisition environment. you've got $400 million now in loi. if you could speak to the pricing that you're seeing there and this additional $8 billion that's in active discussions, how does the pricing look there?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
rick, thanks for the question and good morning. it's really a mix. as you can imagine, there's a lot of different -- excuse me, sellers out there right now that would like to work multiples off of covid earnings. and the key from our perspective is to have a blended look at it and stay disciplined on our approach. so, i would say, it's a little bit all over the board.
we've probably, in the last six months, walked away from $3 billion or $4 billion in business because we just didn't feel like it was priced appropriately. we feel very confident about the $400 million under loi as far as the locations and brands and how they fit into our portfolio. and the other $8 billion and we're assessing right now, it's actually closer to $9 million, it's the same thing. they are a little bit larger in size, so it's a little bit longer conversations and they're a little bit slower to proceed. so, still up in the year and what the multiples will be for there, but what we have under loi, we feel really confident with where we've landed.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
thanks for that. so [phonetic], on the inventory, i can appreciate you don't have a lot of visibility as to when suppliers will normalize from the current 17 days. but when things do normalize, do you think the oems will run tighter on inventory than they have in the past or do they go back to their prior habits? it seems everybody is more profitable in a tighter supply environment.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
rick, it's a great question and one that i certainly don't know the answer to. i would say, they've done a fantastic job at managing the chip shortage and really trying to produce vehicles that consumers want to purchase. and we're very thankful for that and the partnership. there is a lot of talk internally with the manufacturers about operating in this environment. i'm hopeful that when things normalize, we don't quite settle back in at the 70, 80 days supply, we run a good 20 days below that.
too early to tell. i think next year is going to be a strong year for retail automotive. and then we should start to see a lot of electric vehicles come into the market soon after that. so, interesting times. as you look forward even with that coming back a little bit, i think you look at the transactions that are taking place online and how that will grow over time. there's still some opportunity with sg&a even if those margins come somewhat closer to pre-covid numbers.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
you mentioned electric vehicles. do you think overtime that the oems with evs that they start going direct-to-consumer and how do you think that impacts the traditional dealers like asbury?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
sure. we feel that the best model of supply to the consumer is through the dealer franchise system. these cars are very complex. people need to be able to communicate locally. and i think we're in the perfect position to do that, it's a very mature system. the dealer body is embracing and welcoming electric vehicles and certainly invest -- making a lot of investments in training and equipment and material. so, we feel really strongly about the future for the franchise model, especially with the online transactions that are coming. i think the direct-to-consumer is really all about the online transaction. and as the franchise dealer adapts to that, it seems like a winning model.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
and if you could speak to overall profitability of a clicklane sale compared to an in-store sale, the f&i attachment, how does that look relative to in-store overall profits?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
sure. the front-end margin on clicklane right now in the quarter ran about $250 to $300 below the store average and the f&i was mixed. it was a little bit higher on used f&i and a little bit lower on new, but it averaged out similar. we're really happy with the growth rate of clicklane with the sales in the adaption. and we're the smallest public out there and you heard one pays for 30,000 sales and you've heard some of our peers.
so, we're excited about the direction that we're going. and again, these are 30,000 sales that were 100% completed online. nine out of 10 people are getting financed, eight out of 10 are being done automatically, if you will, instant approval. of the 35 lenders, a little over 18 of them have instant decisioning. so they're getting their answers in 45 seconds, which is really fast. and now that we have a good handful or, i should say, a dozen banks accepting docusign, it's making it that much more convenient as well. so, very optimistic. it's going to continue to grow. and we see good upside and opportunity with our partnership with salty as well.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
thanks for all the color. good luck.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, rick.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from john murphy with bank of america.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning, everybody. david, just on the inventory shortage, i'm just curious what you're seeing on vehicles in transit coming in the next month or two. i mean, it just seems like the inventory is crunching a little bit tighter, i mean, saying there is volatility and unknowns kind of code for -- it's getting a bit tougher. and i'm just curious, what you're seeing and how you're going to handle what seems to be a tightening situation on a new vehicle side which is actually crunching sales in the july plus period?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
sure, john, i'll start and then dan can jump in if he wants. we came into this quarter anticipating july and august to be probably the toughest months for availability in the sense of what the demand is going to be relevant to what we'll receive. what we're experiencing so far in july is just that. again, the manufacturers are doing a great job with what they have and producing vehicles and getting them out to us, but it's difficult. i mean, the demand is high right now and we anticipate this quarter to be pretty tough. don't know about september, you get some seasonality adjustment after labor day. so we're hopeful that we'll see an incremental increase in days supply as we go into the fourth quarter, but well behind where we anticipate we should be.
dan clara -- senior vice president, operations
yeah. the only thing i would add to that, john -- good morning by the way -- is, we have july and august is what we expected it to be the lowest months. but also to david's point, the good job that the oems are doing, building the inventory that the consumer wants is also allowing us to be very good at selling on order vehicles and delivering them as soon as they're hitting the lot. so, a lot of benefits to that. our turn rate is very high. and we'll just continue to navigate throughout the next two months and we know that we have the support from the oems on shipping of the inventory.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
that's helpful. and when you think about backfilling for this, i mean, is there enough used inventory to which you can transfer some of these customers over for -- are you finding that consumers are willing to wait in sort of, in some cases, an indeterminate amount of time for the vehicle that they want. i mean, what sort of the capture rate on the used side? and is that used inventory even available to kind of make that kind of push to the consumer?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
yes. great question. the inventory, although it's a little bit harder to find, but it is available out there. and the great news is, like i mentioned earlier, we do have a pretty good amount of sold orders coming our way. and the biggest stream of inventory for our used car department is coming from the trade. and then, we also have specific items that are only available to the body [phonetic] first-come-first-serve, which will be your least earnings and also your -- some of the loaner cars as well.
so, are consumers willing to wait for the vehicle of their choice? yes, we're seeing a lot more patience from the consumer standpoint, waiting an additional few weeks for the car of their choice is definitely not an issue. and again, that goes back to what i said it earlier, it allows us to really have a very high turn rate when those new cars come in.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
got you. and can you pre-sell that used as well because you know what's going to be coming in and trade, i mean, can you work that deal ahead of time? is that something that's possible?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we can definitely -- yes. to answer your question is yes. we can market for a lack of a better term on a retail standpoint, we can market still to the consumer, but we're not able to process any of the paperwork until the mother deal or the first deal is completed.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
got you. and then, if you think about the sg&a gross, i mean, obviously you're -- i mean, you're getting the benefit of very high grosses, but you're also clearly executing well. so it's a combination of the two. i mean, as we step forward into a normal period, let's say, hopefully in 2022, how much of this front-end yields do you think you can hold on to you? and at the same time, how much of the sg&a savings do you think you can hold on to? i mean, obviously there is a lot of variables in that equation or in that question.
but when you think about things normalizing, i mean, north of $5,000 on front-end yield is $1,500 or $2,000 higher than we would typically think about this stuff and sg&a to gross is 10 points lower than we typically think about this stuff, even i mean that's maybe even a little bit better than that. how should we think about those two metrics going forward in a normal state? it's tough to answer.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
it's a great question, john. and i'll try and answer as best i can. yeah, as we sit here today, i think we're a different company than we were pre-covid both in the expenses that we cut, in the brand mix that we have being almost 50% luxury. so, i think, post-covid to use that term '22 and forward will float well above our past margins pre-covid. and we see opportunities with sg&a going forward through our digitization of our sales online. so, while margins may fall back a little bit, not back to where they were but lower than where they are today, we believe there is upside and expense down the road. so we think we're in a very healthy position to still create strong returns, low sg&a and great operating margin.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and then, just lastly on the five-year plan, i mean, you're saying you're running ahead. if we strip out the pressures of market dynamics at the moment, it's hard to disagree within -- you seem like you're probably running on an execution basis well ahead of plan. clicklane is firing fairly well. i mean, how do you think about reassessing the five-year plan and maybe giving us an update or where do you think that will ultimately land? i mean, how should we think about that? because that's now just given your performance not necessarily time, but just given how well you perform, it seems a little dated.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
john, it is a fair point, but i would also respectfully say patience is tough in these markets. we're only six months in. i would say, depending upon how the chips fall on the m&a side in the next few months, that could certainly warrant and update. our same-store revenue is probably best to reassess that when we hit the 12-month period, we're well ahead of that $2 billion target at this point in time. but we also don't want to get too far ahead of our skis and let 12 months to normalize to kind of see where we're at. but to your point, i understand that where we sit here today, what we have under loi, what we're looking at the potential there to far exceed it is there, but i really don't want to get ahead of ourselves because it's not in the bank, so to speak.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
got you. okay. thank you very much guys. i appreciate it.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
dan clara -- senior vice president, operations

operator
thank you. our next question comes from adam jonas with morgan stanley.
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, everybody. can you hear me?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
sure, can. good morning.
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. great, great. i might have missed this. did you actually disclose how many units were sold on clicklane?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
no, adam, we didn't, but i'll tell you, it was just under 4,500 units in the quarter.
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. thanks for that. and i don't know, of the 4,500, how many would you say were kind of fully -- like digitally fulfilled, kind of -- sorry, i'm sorry to use the word but carvana ask if you will and i know they're not, you don't i mean like what you would describe as the most digitally fulfilled of the 4,500.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so we quote that number different than push start because push start was more of a semi-completed online and completed in the store. and i'm going to use to round that 4,500. they were 100% completed online in the sense of it was paid for a signed up. when we pull credit on clicklane, they're hard falls on the credit, their instant approval are real, the payoffs are done in the signage through docusign.
now, if they pick a lender and they sign up everything on docusign and it's lended that doesn't accept docusign, then we're presenting some new documents on delivery. if the bank accepts docusign, it's all said and done and payment online is be our strife relationship that we have. so, they're all completed online, there's nothing additional coming in. if they start on clicklane and then they come in the store and finish it, that is not a clicklane sale to us.
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
all right. appreciate the color, david. and just finally, dave, from your experience, what can you say about the parts and service profile or the revenue derived from parts and service and maintenance, etc, on the evs coming into your base versus the ice equivalent vehicle? i didn't know if there was -- i realize the numbers are still small, but the parks are -- the park is growing geometrically and you'll get more and more of these units. i'm just curious what color you can give us?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
sure. every quarter we kind of looked at service in three different buckets and we can't control warranty and internally is what it is. so we focus on customer pay. so, from that standpoint, the three buckets are combustible engine, hybrid cars and then ev or complete electric cars and this is going to change. but right now, for the last few quarters it's very consistent, that's the highest dollar spent on electric vehicles. and i think it's first generation technology. there's a lot of software glitches and issues with that. we think that will change over time, but we are also of the belief that our service retention will go up double digits because that consumer will have to come back for us for service because of the complexity with the vehicle.
so, we're very excited and bullish on electric vehicles and where we're going. we're already working on them in our collision center. we certainly were touring last week in some of our stores, which is done a lot of ev cars in there for maintenance. so, we think we're well positioned then. i think over time the dollars will come down, but they still need brakes, batteries -- excuse me -- brakes and everything else, tires [speech overlap]. we have actually already replaced some of those batteries. so when i brought that up, it is true. but the oil change in that, sense combustible engine cars are made so well nowadays, there really isn't a whole lot breakdown and there's really no money to be made in oil changes.
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
i appreciate the extra color there. if i can just slip one more in, are the oems that are using franchises to distribute evs? are they coming to you with a bit more stringent -- if you want to be the authorized retailer of hummer or electric corvette or whatever it might be that you need to make investments in people and technology diagnostic software, etc, at the point of service and sale in order to get authorized, are you kind of seeing that? i would imagine that could play to your advantage too versus a lot of the mom and pops.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
we do see that. and we've made a lot of investments already and will continue to make more investments both in physical training and equipment. but naturally that would be requirements from the oems, as you'd expect. i mean if you're going to have the opportunity to sell the vehicle, you certainly have to be trained and have the equipment to work on the car as well.
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks, david.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from rajat gupta with jpmorgan.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking the question. i just had a follow-up question on clicklane. the 30,000 units that you mentioned for the full-year 2021, if we exclude clicklane units from the overall business, would the same-store units still be up for 2021? just trying to get a sense of how much of the units being sold on clicklane is incremental to what your existing business would have done either way. and i had a follow-up. thanks.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
sure. as dan stated in his script, 93% of the clicklane customers were new to asbury. so we hadn't sold them a vehicle before. we think that number will change over time, but it's a new tool. and it's 4,500 sales in the quarter. i can tell you, in the quarter, it was growing at a little bit over 20% a month from april to may and may to june. and we're continuing to see that growth in july. so it's just a logical full transactional tool. they're not soft pulls on credits, there is no issues with the lending.
we do have 35, but only about 18 of them have instant decisioning and only a dozen of them are accepting docusign. so still we have progress to go there. but between instant decisioning and the banks that do accept docusign, it's a very seamless transaction. and logically, if you can do the transaction in 14, 15 minutes at home, have it delivered to your house, why would just sit in the showroom for two hours? and i would tell you, for lack of a better term nationally in the quarter, the country opened up traffic and everything got back to normal, yet the home deliveries went up 15% over the prior quarter to 65%. so, we certainly see the benefit and our consumers are seeing the benefit in the tool.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. so, you're saying, i mean, in that 30,000 target that you had for the full year for clicklane in your new and used combined, i mean, on a run-rate basis, it seems like almost 15% of your units overall.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
right.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and all of that is like incremental to the business basically or at least majority of that. and the installed business can also grow simultaneously. is that fair to you?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
it is fair. again, this tool is new. so, does the 93% stick for the next three quarters, the next three years? i couldn't give guidance on that. i would just logically say that tool is going to continue to grow as the awareness gets out there and there will certainly be incremental sales. it's a little challenging right now with low days supply to see what you could really sell, it's hard to sell something online you don't have. and you have the sophisticated sales professionals that we have in the store that are selling deep into the pipeline, meaning, well before these cars arrive.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it, got it. great. thanks for the color there. i just had a question on just the employee headcount, just following up on the sg&a productivity question. what's the current employee count as a company? could you remind us including park place, where do we stand today also taking into account like some of the layoffs that you had last year?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
just over 8,300 associates currently on staff.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. got it. that's helpful. and just one last one in parts and services. really nice recovery here in the second quarter, customer pay in particular. you mentioned last month around some part supply shortages, which was holding warranty. could you give us a sense where we are there? how do you see that coming back? and can we expect this kind of growth rate that you saw on a two-year term basis continue here and in the third quarter as well? thanks.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
sure, rajat. we absolutely expect the parts and service numbers to continue into the third quarter that we're currently seeing. some of it is, people have been sheltering in place per year and they're just catching up on maintenance from the car sitting and some of it is planning trips for the summer and doing different things like that. so, we anticipate a very strong summer for parts and service. as far as the parts business, again, the oems are doing a really great job. it's hit or miss and we certainly do have some parts issues with some brands. but overall, i wouldn't say it's materially holding us back at this point as a company.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. great. thanks for all the color and good luck.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you. take care.

thank you. our next question comes from stephanie moore with truist.
stephanie moore -- truist -- analyst
hi, good morning. thank you for the question.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
stephanie moore -- truist -- analyst
i wanted to touch on your clicklane platform again. and if you could kind of give us an update on where we stand on marketing the platform in your existing territories as well as from your plans to expand the platform into some territories that are not legacy asbury market. so, any update there would be helpful. thank you.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
sure, stephanie. right now -- and i'm sure it's the same for all our peers. i don't think anyone is spending a tremendous amount of dollars on marketing simply because the inventories are so light. you're marketing to some you can't sell. so, i think we'll keep the marketing dollars governed right now and so we can see inventory return. to your point about entering a market on the pre-owned side that we don't currently occupy brick-and-mortar, we absolutely intend to do that. that is part of our omni-channel approach, that is part of our sg&a benefit we think we can do it, more efficient, faster and retain more dollars by doing it this way. i would say, somewhere toward the end of the year, beginning of next year, you'll see us enter into new markets on the pre-owned side.
stephanie moore -- truist -- analyst
great. thank you so much. and that's it from me.

thank you. our next question comes from bret jordan with jefferies.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
dan clara -- senior vice president, operations
good morning, bret.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
on the clicklane, could you talk about -- yeah, i guess, 93% new customers, could you talk about geographic reach and how far are you sending these cars out? and i guess, is 65% home delivery? is there a dixie cup circle that you're working in that you can't go outside of? and i guess the same kind of question on new vehicles. is there any restriction as far as selling cars in markets where you don't own franchises?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, bret. great question. to your point, i mean, 65% of our consumers are electing to take delivery at home. we're not advertising outside of our primary area, for a lack of a better term. we stay in and abide by all the oem rules when it comes down to that. we have seen the vast majority of our in-home deliveries that we're seeing is taking place, i would say, probably around a 50-mile radius. but we have seen deliveries that have, for a lack of a better term, that have gone from greenville, south carolina to texas and from georgia to florida. so we have seen that as well in several locations.
dan clara -- senior vice president, operations
i would tell you, bret, just to follow-up on that. being a franchisee, we have a store in atlanta, we can't market toyotas in chicago or new york. however, we spend a lot of money optimizing our sites. and if people find us in other states and they choose to buy a car from us and ship it up, we certainly do that, but we very much adhere to our relationship and our policies with the manufacturer.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
what do you think -- i guess, do you have an average distance that your buyers coming in from for the clicklane?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i would say, in the quarter and i know others have quoted some long distances, we're under 75 miles is 80% of our business. and we actually think that's a great thing because we don't want to just sell the car. carvana's model is great selling the car, making some money in the front and back of the parts and service business is really where it's at. so in a perfect world to us is doing that transaction online locally and having them do the maintenance with us.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. and then, one final question. i guess, on the used inventory, could you give us the percentage, i guess, that you're sourcing in-house versus auction?
dan clara -- senior vice president, operations
yeah. absolutely, bret. so, less than 10% of the cars that we acquired in q2 were acquired at the auction. the rest of it -- like i said, the vast majority of it comes from trades, lease turn-ins, loaner cars and also acquisitions at the store level through consumers.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
and i would tell you. that's a credit to the other general managers in our stores and the used car managers. pre-covid, we've been very disciplined in not buying more than 10% of our cars from auction. you get in that bidding process, you walk away with cars no one paid more than you. margin nowadays is about the acquisition price. so, they are tremendously talented at sourcing local vehicles direct from consumers and trade-ins and the service drives and loaner cars and other things, which is getting us to healthy margins that we're seeing.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from ryan sigdahl with craig-hallum.
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum -- analyst
good morning, guys. and congrats on the strong results.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
dan clara -- senior vice president, operations
thank you.
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum -- analyst
just one follow-up question from us. so, asbury looking back two decades ago when the ipo, do you have a similar number of stores, a few more today, but you spent -- you've done a decent amount of rationalization, divesting, adding kind of offsetting each other. i guess, one, how do you feel about your current store base today? is there more rationalization that's needed? and then, two, given the importance of scale and really nationwide footprint and you mentioned kind of the close proximity even on clicklane for those customers, i guess, why not accelerate that m&a cadence to really build scale faster? thanks.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
it's a great question. we're one of the smaller companies. and there's always so much capital to deploy and so much leverage that we're willing to take on. the other thing that i would say and just doing this for 35 years mostly as an operator running and integrating stores that people above me purchase, it's a lot easier to buy things than it is to run it. we think that with the healthiest that we've ever been from a brand mix, we really like the platforms that we have, the states that we do business in and the leadership that we have in the field because that's where the results are happening, they're not happening here.
we're disciplined. we're going to be thoughtful. we do have $400 million under loi. we are looking at more, but we're also not getting enticed by just the revenue number. we're really saying that this is going to be a good part for us going forward and this is something that we can integrate well into our system and continue the synergies that we have.
we have the highest operating margins and lowest sg&a in the space and we're proud of that and we're not the biggest. and we think we can keep those two credits as we continue to grow the company thoughtfully. as far as expanding in every market, everywhere, i don't know that that's our goal, it truly isn't. our goal is to kind of -- for lack of a better term -- skate to where the puck is going. not every market is maybe ideal or perfect for us. we want to grow thoughtfully in the markets we want to be in and be dense and have meaningful relationships with our consumers through our service retention and market share within the markets we do business in. you'll see us expand in new states for sure, but the goal isn't to be in every state.
still there, ryan?
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum -- analyst
that's it from me. thanks, guys. just had the one. good luck.
dan clara -- senior vice president, operations
thank you.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. we will take our last question from david whiston with morningstar equity research.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
thanks. good morning. i guess, first on, you're talking about how great docusign is and i certainly agree with you. but as of today, are there still states that require a wet signature?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
well, absolutely, especially on the dmv side. there's actually only a couple of states that are digital on the dmv and there's many more in process right now. but the bulk of your documents are more to do with lending and the vehicle and trade in vehicle itself. so there are some documents to your point that we have to redo. the way we've designed clicklane, regardless of what the state requirements are, every single possible form is in clicklane and every single form is signed through docusign.
there's two main reasons for that even though we're redoing them. one, we want the customers visualization to go through the entire process and see how the documents, no surprises on delivery for lack of a better term. and then, their awareness of the transaction, the numbers that take place. so when we go to -- again, 65% of the time when we're delivering the vehicle at the home, it's a very smooth transition to the few signatures that we may need, in some cases one or two, in other cases maybe six. it just really depends upon the state. but to us, it's the experience. people create the experience, software creates the convenience and that's where we're focused.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
okay. so, any document that doesn't require wet signature you just had, when you actually see the customer regardless of where the customer is, that's when they actually physically sign that piece of paper, correct?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, if there's -- again, if georgia requires a wet signature on a dmv form, they're signing that form on docusign, so they can visually see it. but then when we show up, they're going to sign that dmv form again with a wet signature.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
okay. yeah. that makes sense. on the 65% home delivery, was that just clicklane or the entire company?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
that was just clicklane.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
okay.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
it was single-digits for its regular store.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
okay. and the biden administration is talking about possibly raising the federal tax rate. i know you're in between cfos, but can you comment at all federal statutory increase would be a one-for-one increase in your own tax rate?
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
really haven't looked at that yet to be honest, david. so i couldn't comment on it.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
okay. and i guess, just one more question on the domestic gpu over $4,000 a unit. obviously it's probably inflated a bit due to the inventory situation, but was there just a total massive decline in discounting this quarter or is mix playing a role there too?
dan clara -- senior vice president, operations
it's a -- the margins that we're seeing, it's all related to the -- well, a lot of it is related to the lack of inventory. it's a supply and demand equation. and the level of discounting that you're seeing right now is very, very, very minor, if any at all, just because again, just a simple supply and demand equation.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
but i'd also tell you, it's a little deceiving because those numbers could actually be higher. our lack of truck inventory on the domestic side is significant. and that's really harboring or governing our sales, if you will, on that side. but if you go post -- pre-covid, excuse me, we've always had healthy -- generally healthy pvrs on our domestic vehicles.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
and speaking of trucks, are you getting any feedback from customers on early interest in the f-150 lightning?
dan clara -- senior vice president, operations
yeah. i mean, there has been a lot of positive reaction, as you would imagine. there is also not only excitement from the consumers, but also within the stores that represent that truck.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
we're excited about the evs that are coming. we've had the opportunity to drive and see a lot of them and some really impressive vehicles coming down the road, so exciting times.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
yeah, i agree. thank you.
david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you very much.

david w. hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, karen. and good morning, everyone. welcome to our second quarter earnings call. in our earnings release this morning, we reported adjusted eps of $7.78, an all-time record, up 209% over the prior year. that continues to recover from prior year lows despite supply disruptions due to the chip shortage. this strong execution in the face of a challenging macro environment enabled us to deliver a strong gross margin of 19.2%, an expansion of 240 basis points versus the second quarter last year.
we've also stayed disciplined in managing expenses, resulting in sg&a as a percentage of gross profit of 54.2%, an 850 basis point improvement versus prior year. our total revenue for the quarter was up 79% year-over-year and total gross profit was up 105%. our balance sheet remained strong due to our performance in cash flow. our net leverage ended this quarter at 1.6 times. we're in a perfect position to deploy capital and are aggressively pursuing opportunities for growth.
a quick update on our strategic five-year plan as we announced six months then. same-store revenue growth, assuming 2020 annualized revenue for park place, is up double-digit and is exceeding expectations. regarding clicklane, our unit sales are pacing ahead of our plan.
regarding acquisitions, we have about $400 million in revenue under loi right now. we are also reviewing other opportunities totaling over $8 billion in revenue. we are confident in our goal of $5 billion in revenue over the next five years. with these trending results, we maintain full confidence in our execution on our growth strategy. we'll continue to provide quarterly updates on our five-year plan.
finally, i'd like to thank all the hard-working men and women in our company who are focused on our journey to become the most guest-centric retail automotive company. their passion to serve is inspiring. thank you.
i'll now hand the call over to dan to discuss our operating performance. dan? thank you, david. and good morning, everyone. my remarks will pertain to our same-store performance compared to the second quarter of 2020 and comparable stores in 2019 when applicable, unless stated otherwise. looking at new vehicles, based on current market conditions, we are focused on being opportunistic with our inventory and improving grosses to maximize profit. our new average gross profit per vehicle was $3,496, up $1,599 or 84% from the prior-year period. all segment margins were up significantly from the prior year period. at the end of june, our total new vehicle inventory was $226 million and our days supply was at an all-time low of 17 days, down 35 days from the prior year. some of our stores were at five-day supply during the quarter as we experienced major challenges due to the lack of inventory. with no clear understanding of when production will return to normal levels, we expect that days supply to remain low throughout the remainder of the year. turning to used vehicles. our used retail volume increased 29%, while gross margin was 10%, up 230 basis points from the prior year, representing an average gross profit per vehicle of $2,635. as a result of our performance, our gross profit was up 96%. our used vehicle inventory ended the quarter at 286 million, which represents a 37-day supply, up 11 days from the prior year. we've remained focused on sourcing inventory that will generate a fair return. turning to f&i. our strong consistent and sustainable growth in f&i delivered an increase of $160 to $1,898 per vehicle retail from the prior quarter -- prior year quarter. in the second quarter, our front-end yield per vehicle increased $1,448 per vehicle to an all-time record of $5,004. turning to parts and service. our parts and service revenue increased 41% in the quarter. gross profit increased 48% and total fixed margin was 62.3%, up 300 basis points. i would like to make a couple of additional comments about our performance compared to the second quarter of 2019 on a comparable store basis. new unit sales were up 11%. new vehicle gross profit was up 172%. used retail unit sales were up 10%. used retail gross profit was up 88%. f&i per vehicle retailed increased $261 or 18%. front-end yield per vehicle retailed increased $1,831 or 64%. parts and service customer pay revenue and gross profit increased 9%. and now, i would like to provide an update on our omni-channel initiatives. in 2016, we started focusing strategically on several omni-channel initiatives. one of those initiative is to increase organic website traffic. through our sophisticated digital marketing efforts since q2 2016, our organic traffic of unique visitors to our dealership website has increased by over 6 million consumers, an increase of over 5,000%. another initiative is to increase online service appointment. we achieved bookings of over 142,000 online service appointments, an increase of over 400% since q2 2016 and an all-time record. this component positively impact service retention and increases the dollars per repair order. and of course, clicklane, the latest evolution in our omni-channel strategy, which was fully active at all of our dealerships for the complete quarter. before i go over the clicklane metrics, i want to remind you the unique features of clicklane as well as highlight our recent enhancements as we are constantly evolving the tool to provide our guest with a seamless and complete buying experience and strengthening that relationship. penny perfect loan payoffs, a loan marketplace, which now includes more than 35 lenders. on average, nine out of 10 customers that apply for a loan are approved through clicklane. the ability to sign all documents online via docusign with 14 of our lenders now accepting documents executed via docusign. the in-tool service and commission appointment scheduler with ability to purchase parts and accessories within the tool as well. we recently partnered with salty to deliver transparency and convenience by providing a one-stop shopping experience for our guests to include their car insurance needs. salty is an embedded ecosystem for our consumers that provides competitive personalized insurance quotes from over a dozen large national carriers. clicklane guest benefit from an intuitive platform that retrieves a competitive quote from major carriers and provides a custom-built policy tailored toward the consumers' wants and needs. asbury customers spend over $350 million in insurance every year. through out partnership with salty, we receive a commission on the premium of each auto insurance policy as well as any additional policies that the guest originates. we also partner with insignia to enhance our accessories tool and to enable visualization within clicklane. asbury customers often look to third-parties to outfit their vehicles after the point of purchase. this new integration allows customers to add accessories in the back end of their clicklane account. this enhancement allows customers to fully visualize accessories on the vehicle of their choice in real time. now, with a full quarter at all stores under our belt, we would like to share some performance metrics. of our vehicles sold through clicklane, 54% of them were new vehicles and 46% were used. as a reminder, with push start, 80% of our sales were used vehicles. we expect annualized volume through clicklane of at least 30,000 vehicles by year-end. 93% of our transactions this quarter were with customers that were new to asbury's dealership network. average transaction time is eight minutes for cash deals and 14 minutes for finance deals. average down-payment for new vehicles is $10,252, more than 4 times our store average of $2,242. average down-payment for used vehicles is $4,716, more than double our store average of $2,078. f&i pvr of $2,066, 64% of new car customers and 68% of used car customers chose to take delivery at home, an increase of over 15% from the first quarter. average credit score is higher than the average credit score at our stores. trades taken through clicklane are averaging the front-end pvr of $2,392. trades taken through clicklane are turning on average in 19 days. as expected, clicklane customers are converting at greater rates than traditional internet leads. not surprisingly, we are quite excited about the performance of clicklane thus far as it is tracking ahead of target. and finally, i would like to take this opportunity to express appreciation to all of our teammates in the field for their continued focus on the guest experience, their commitment to continuous improvement and their perseverance. i will now hand the call over to karen to discuss our financial performance. karen?
karen reid -- vice president of corporate planning and analysis & treasurer
thank you, dan. i would like to provide some financial highlights, which marks yet another record quarter for our company. for additional details on our financial performance for the quarter, i refer you to our financial supplement in our press release dated today, july 27, 2021.
overall, compared to the second quarter of last year, our actions to manage gross profit and control expenses resulted in a second quarter adjusted operating margin of 8.4%, an increase of 280 basis points above the same period last year and an all-time record. and adjusted net income increased 211% to $151.7 million, displaying our resilience through these interesting times.
for comparison to our pre-covid performance thus compared to the second quarter of 2019 for all stores, our total revenue was up 43%. total gross profit was up 69% and total gross margin was up 280 basis points. new unit sales were up 20%, while used retail unit sales were up 21%. new margins improved 510 basis points, while used retail margins improved 260 basis points. total f&i revenue was up 33%. total parts and service revenue was up 30%. our sg&a as a percentage of gross profit improved 1,380 basis points and our adjusted operating margin improved 370 basis points.
now, back to current results. net income for the second quarter 2021 was adjusted for real estate net gains of $0.5 million or $0.02 per diluted share. net income for the second quarter 2020 was adjusted for $1.2 million or $0.5 per diluted share legal settlement gain.
our effective tax rate was 24.7% for the second quarter 2021 compared to 25.2% in 2020. floor plan interest expense for the quarter decreased by $2 million over the prior year quarter, driven primarily by lower inventory levels, coupled with lower libor rates.
with respect to capital deployed this quarter, we exercised our purchase option on the park place properties utilizing approximately $33 million of our cash on balance sheet, with the remainder $184 million financed through a mortgage facility. in addition, we spent approximately $15 million on capital expenditures and we repaid approximately $9 million of debt.
also, in planning for our new plano acura site, we sold and leased back our plano acura facility, resulting in incoming funds of $4 million, net of its mortgage payoff. as a result of our operational performance, our balance sheet remains in a very strong position and we ended the quarter with approximately $576 million of liquidity comprised of cash, floor plan offset accounts and availability on both our used lines and revolving credit facility.
also, at the end of the quarter, our net leverage ratio stood at 1.6 times, well below our targeted net leverage of 3 times. as we look forward to the remainder of 2021, we anticipate similar conditions to what we have seen this quarter. new vehicle inventory supplies are likely to remain low and unpredictable through at least the end of the year.
overall, as we did in q2, we are still planning to a $16 million saar environment that will keep our business nimble and flexible with an emphasis on gross margins and sg&a expense management. one shift we're highlighting is that as the economy opens up more, we expect our parts and service business to return to its historical growth rate.
in closing, i would also like to thank our teams across the business who continue to work tirelessly during this unprecedented times to ensure our current and long-term success. this concludes our prepared remarks.
we will now turn the call over to the operator and take your questions. operator?
",2021-Q2,ABG
,,,,":
operator
thank you, sir. [operator instructions] our first question comes from rick nelson with stephens.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
thanks. good morning. terrific quarter. so i guess, to begin, from a balance sheet standpoint, where you see the pro forma leverage going post the $6.6 billion in revenue that you're acquiring? and how should we think about the capital priorities going forward? are we in deleverage mode? is that the focus of some of the near-term post these deals?
michael d. welch -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
rick, thank you for your question. yes, from a leverage perspective, after we close the deals, we expect leverage to be in the high 3s. from a capital deployment perspective, just allocation in the future, we will be in a deleveraging mode in '22 and '23, just to bring that leverage back down to our three times target. but we can also take the cash flow from a deleveraging perspective and either pay back debt or if we found some acquisitions that provided ebitda, that then would provide additional leverage, that would also provide some deleveraging ability as well.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
thanks for that, michael. also, the $900 million in incremental revenues, you could talk about the composition of those dealerships, maybe what markets are in and the size of the groups that you're bringing in.
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
rick, this is david. we discussed this morning, kahlo, the greeley subaru and arapahoe hyundai today. when you take those three out, it leaves a balance of about $740 million in revenue, which is all in one group. because it hasn't been fully announced yet, we don't want to say it, but the brand mix is about 50% luxury and then mostly import with one domestic store as well. really a very strong group with the right brand mix in a market that we've been trying to grow.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
great. thanks for that. maybe as a follow-up to that, if you could speak to the multiples that you're looking at for those stores.
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
yes. so on the one that we haven't announced yet, off the top of my head, i believe it's about an eight multiple -- between seven and eight multiple. there's good upside in the stores and opportunity to grow them within the marketplace, and there's a little bit of capex involved as well.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
okay. the larry miller deal, i'm sure they're bringing some digital assets to the group. and if you could speak to any potential challenges integrating that group into clicklane and the opportunities there?
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
sure, absolutely. i would tell you, it's -- the integration should go pretty smooth. we're all in the same software, same dms. we're retaining all the senior executive management team and really kind of like we did park place, let it operate in its own silo. they're extremely strong brands, great leadership, and the store has performed extremely well. there's a lot of capabilities there for us to enhance their digital side. they're extremely strong operators, but there's an opportunity for digital. i don't think that will be a focus the first few months. it will be mainly more integrating the folks and getting to know one another and creating that trust and relationship and then starting to integrate the software. but like anything, there's always potential in every acquisition to grow.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
great. thanks for that. finally, if i could ask you about total care auto, the opportunities to bring that in. how is -- what sort of financial implications that has on the f&i side and any potential risks that, that strategy brings?
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
rick, this is david. i'll start and then michael can jump in. i would tell you it's a very stable business. the miller organization has had it over 30 years. it's am best rated. they're doing extremely great job at paying claims, a strong balance sheet. really, we see it as very accretive to us. margin is significantly higher than our operations. and they're essentially just high level, making above $50 million a year ebitda on 115,000 car sales. when you integrate asbury at over 200,000 car sales into that, you can kind of see the upside potential there. so we're excited about what it can do. and the other huge benefit that it's had for that organization, they have extremely strong service retention numbers. it's a true hand-in-glove relationship between tca and the miller organization.
michael d. welch -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
rick, one thing that will cause a little bit of, i guess, slowness on how we integrate is from an accounting perspective, it costs a little bit of noise of moving dealership profits from a day one profit to kind of we have to kind of defer and amortize it over the life of the contract because it's an insurance business. so because of that, it will take us a few years to be able to bring in asbury at a measured clip. the other thing is that business to bring in asbury has to just size itself a little bit for the additional business and obtain some insurance licenses in some states that they don't do business right now. and so we just have a little bit of leg work to do to be able to get asbury fully brought into their mix.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
got it. okay. thanks a lot.
michael d. welch -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
it's about two to three years -- it's going to be two to three year period.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
okay. thanks for that. good luck.
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, rick.
michael d. welch -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from john murphy with bank of america.
aileen smith -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning, everyone. this is aileen smith on for john. first question on the new vehicle business. can you talk about the entrance versus exit rate in the quarter on gross margins in gpus? and more specifically, is it fair to assume that growth has improved through the quarter as the inventory environment tightened or rather dropped off with sales trends? just trying to think about what the launch point should be for 3q into 4q and then further into 2022?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
yeah. good morning. this is dan. the margins, as we enter into our q3, saw pretty stable throughout the quarter, although i would say probably a little bit of an uptick as we were exiting the quarter, mainly driven for the -- due to the supply and demand. as we move forward, we -- as i stated on my script, we see the inventory constraints continue well into 2022. so we expect the margins to ride right along the inventory.
aileen smith -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. great. and then can you talk a bit about the prioritization, if at all, for the used vehicle business between same-store sales comps versus gross margins and gpus? relative to the new vehicle business quarter-on-quarter, gross margins are down, but the offsetting factor for this is obviously a material acceleration in same-store sales growth. is this something we should look at as a structural trend going forward as you continue to focus on the used vehicle market for growth opportunity? or is this purely a function of broader market dynamics, namely the inventory shortage that's more transitory in nature?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
yeah. i think that it's just a product of the market. if you look at our cost of sale or average selling price in used cars, it increased 16%, and that is something that we're seeing. as inventories drop down in new cars, our cost of sale for used cars is going up. a lot of people, customers that have purchased cars in the recent years, their car is not going to be worth more than today. so they're opting to trade that car in or sell it back to us. so i believe that that's part of the issue.
the other aspect is we expect this to continue as long as the market conditions stay the same. and to be honest, we're not saying, hey, let's grow the used car business from a volume standpoint and sacrifice margin, we believe that we can get both in this market.
aileen smith -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. and one last one, if i may. i know you referenced you're going to update your five-year plan next year, which i think we can reasonably assume as a function of the larry miller acquisition and obviously, driving acquired revenue much higher than the target you've previously outlined. but the other key component of your five-year plan is clicklane. should we also be thinking about clicklane and organic growth in the business as having upside versus your prior target? or would you say the rollout on this front is coming more in line with expectations?
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
yes. this is david. i'll try and address it, and if i don't hit it right, please come back. when we look at clicklane for the next five years, we did it on a monthly basis by store, with conversions increasing each and every year to get to that valuation. as it relates to year 1, we're technically six months fully into it.
from a conversion standpoint, we're about two percentage points below where we expect it to be. but because there's been additional traffic, we're exceeding our volume target. i would tell you it's a little bit tricky with clicklane right now because of the lack of inventory. there's a lot of traffic, but there's not a lot of inventory to purchase from.
so it's hard to fully assess the conversions right now with lack of inventory. but we're real happy with what we've seen, how it's being treated and the consumer responds to it. and our belief is next year in '22 and certainly in '23 and '24, each year, we're anticipating that conversion rate to go higher as the consumer becomes more comfortable transacting online and the tools continue to become more sophisticated and easier to use.
aileen smith -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. that makes a lot of sense. thanks for taking my questions.
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from ryan sigdahl with craig-hallum capital group.
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
morning. nice quarter and thank for taking my questions.
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, ryan.
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
curious on mobile mechanic. i mean you talked clicklane a lot, but how much opportunity is there from a parts and service standpoint to really digitize that and go closer to the consumer and bring it to them?
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
yes, it's a great question. i would tell you, over the last five years, between different things we've done to enhance it on our own and adding a service tracker element, we're seeing higher conversion rates than we've seen in the last four or five years, meaning consumers are approving more work than they have in years past, and they're spending more dollars per repair order. that has a lot to do with the age of the car as well. we do see more opportunity to be more digital and more engaged and transparent with the consumer, and that will come over time. but tremendous benefits so far from what we've seen, and it's mainly our source is text messaging.
we're communicating through text message, the mpis and how -- the multi-point inspections on how the car is doing, their ability to communicate directly with the technician and then being able to pay for the service via text as well. so continues to grow, great feedback. and with the consumers converting at a higher rate, that tells us their level of comfort and transparency is there as well.
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
got you. and then just on the inventory, i know not to belabor the point, but 12 days supply on the new side, i guess, how has that trended in the months subsequent to the quarter end? and then also comment on used as well.
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
so thanks. good morning. this is dan, by the way. the day supply around the quarter, we have been around that 12-day supply from the beginning of the quarter, and we remain consistent. the stores are doing a great job. and i think i mentioned this in the previous call, doing a great job really preselling incoming units. so we've adjusted to the market demands.
and again, the stores and the operators are doing a fantastic job. from a used car perspective, i'll tell you, our day supply, you can see it is lower than where we were operating a year ago, but we continue to acquire inventory from our main stream, which will be your trade-in, your lease turn-ins and direct-to-consumer purchases. approximately about 79% of our inventory are coming from those three venues.
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
last question for me, and i'll turn it over to the others. but mercedes, they're cutting dealer trade margins by 50 bps to help pay for evs. any comment there, any concern, i guess, with other oems doing this and potentially squeezing the dealer margins?
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
this is david. so the quick reaction is no, as it relates to mercedes. we really enjoy the partnership with them and the brand. we have high-margin business with them. consumers really appreciate the brand as well. and we look at this as a partnership. a small cut into the margin to set up for the future is an investment for both of us to make, and we're proud to represent the brand. as it pertains to other manufacturers that might do it, it's hard to comment on something that you can't see and not aware of yet. but certainly, we look at the relationship as a partnership, and we have to have skin in the game as well. but we don't see that margin percent with mercedes materially affecting us.
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
thanks, guys. good luck
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from grace kim with morgan stanley.
grace kim -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. thank you for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. on behalf of adam jonas, how sustainable do you expect sg&a to growth to be going forward, taking into account your digital strategy and recent acquisitions?
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
sure, grace. this is david, and i'm sure after what i say, michael will jump in and try and clean that up. i would tell you the sg&a is impressive right now for a couple of different reasons. the obvious supply and demand, high margins is helping dramatically. but as the pandemic started, we really got our production per employee at a much higher rate.
we're of the belief as you look three to five years out, the retail franchise model changes a little bit on how you compensate and what that looks like. so we think that the current sg&a is certainly there, is here to stay for at least the next year. and then with improving software and capabilities and clicklane growing, we think there's future opportunities to strengthen the sg&a or tighten it up for lack of a better term.
grace kim -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. that's really helpful. and shifting gears a bit, how would you characterize high-quality strategic acquisitions going forward?
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
it's a great question. we came out with the five -year plan for $5 billion in revenue. you're never going to get $1 billion each year, but the thought process is what are we generating cash flow and what do we take on, not knowing that an acquisition like larry h. miller would be out there. there's a lot of stores for sale.
there's a lot of stores that transact, but every store is not the same, even though the brand name might be the same. some groups and the cultures that they have are pretty strong and align really well with us. when we find a group that we think aligns really well with us and the synergies are there, we try to be very aggressive and go after it. and the other stuff, we just simply don't go after, not that it's a bad asset, but it just might not align with us.
i think in the last 3.5 years, when you look at the acquisitions we've done, they've shown to be extremely accretive to our group with extremely low turnover numbers. so that tells us that we're finding the right acquisitions, we're properly aligned, and we're making good investments with the shareholders' money.
grace kim -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. thank you very much and congrats again.
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from rajat gupta with jpmorgan.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking the question. just had a follow-up question on productivity savings. could you remind us of where your head count level is currently?
michael d. welch -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
well, i think before the couple of acquisitions we just did, rajat, our head count was right at 8,300.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. got it. so it looks like you were at 8,500 before park place, you're roughly around 8,300 today. your volumes are up meaningfully versus 2019 levels on a combined basis. so just any way to parse out these productivity benefits across permanent head count reductions, move to digital like clicklane and then maybe just lower inventory levels we're dealing with at the stores today. just trying to get a sense as inventory starts to come back, who knows it maybe 2023, where does your like-for-like head count go? and can you maintain these current levels of productivity once you are there? and i have a follow-up. thanks.
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
sure, rajat, this is david. yes, we believe we can maintain these productivity levels per employee, mainly because of the software applications that we've had is making it easier for our folks to become more productive. we think the current numbers were at productivity per employee probably stay stable for the next 18 months to 24 months. and then we think at that point, we have another opportunity to increase the production per employee and that's where our focus is. and the reason why it's 18 months to 24 months out, quite honestly, it's software-related.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
understood. great. that's encouraging. just shifting gears completely to parts and services. can you give us a sense of how the exit rate was for that business in the third quarter? how the fourth quarter is shaping up there in terms of just improvement in that trajectory? and i also thought to ask on the warranty business specifically, given the supply shortages, but also given we have sold fewer than normal level of new vehicles the last couple of years, how do you see that playing through in terms of impact to the overall business in maybe 2022, 2023, given the retention rates are pretty high in like the first two to three years? so just if you could tie this together, that would be really helpful and also just some of the near-term trends? thanks.
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
so rajat, this is dan. good morning. from a fixed operations business for the quarter, as you can see, the warranty business really pulled back. that's really got to do a lot, and it's just really across all domestic import and luxury. just some of the campaigns that we saw last year, fuel pumps to name a few, maybe a few dashboards, door actuators, you name it, we've seen a pullback from that perspective. and that's affecting, obviously, our warranty traffic.
customer pay is recovering pretty good, as you saw. our customer pay gross profit was up 10%, and we continue to see the healthy recovery as well. as we move forward from a unit and operational standpoint, from a warranty perspective, it's hard to tell because warranty is not something that we forecast for. it's really driven by if there's a recall, if there is an issue with fuel pumps, again, you name it. so we really don't control that. to the extent that, something like that happens, we expect warranty to come back up around. and if not, then we'll just -- we'll keep focusing on growing the customer pay.
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
and just to touch on that, dan mentioned the customer pays up 10% growth. it's actually up 12% growth. it's the dollars per repair order going up. and if i heard you right, with the new car customer hangs around for the first few years and weans off, in our organization, the one metric that we track every day on the customer pay side is what's the average miles coming into our store. and naturally, the higher the miles that tells us we're retaining a much deeper into the channel, if you will. and we're just under 70,000 miles for the average car from a customer pay standpoint coming into the company. so we think that's pretty healthy and as the car park continues to age and there is an availability really the product for everyone to keep up with the demand, we see parts and service continuing to stay on this, what i would call stable growth rate.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. that's really helpful. thanks so much for all the color. and good luck.
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from stephanie moore with truist.
stephanie moore -- truist -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for the question.
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
absolutely.
stephanie moore -- truist -- analyst
i wanted to touch on -- we're about one year into the park place acquisition, so would love to get any comments about how that acquisition has performed, maybe some areas that exceeded your expectations, maybe some that are a little below, maybe anything on integration that you learned. just any color there would be helpful. thank you.
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
sure, steph. this is david. yeah. i said this before the acquisition when it was announced that if we could only buy one dealership group in the united states, what would it be, and i would have said park place. and it's not the brand mix. the brand mix is fantastic, but it's the people. tremendous leadership in that organization, a tremendous tenure, dedicated employees. they just are very disciplined, well-run group that truly care about their customer base and have earned the brand recognition that they've had.
when we look at it, we're a year into it, we're exceeding our year three targets from a financial standpoint. but i'd say they're -- oddly enough, there aren't any surprises because they're everything that we thought they would be. they're just the best of the best at what they do. they're caring individuals that execute consistently. and we're proud to be associated with them and share ideas on how to get better, but it's been a phenomenal acquisition for us.
stephanie moore -- truist -- analyst
absolutely. thank you. and then just switching to the f&i front, i would love -- there's obviously been -- i think there's an opportunity that you spoke on even earlier in this call, coming out of the larry h. miller acquisition and building on your f&i. but is there anything else taking that acquisition at the side that you could be focusing on just to increase gross profit per unit on an f&i standpoint, anything more organically that you are working on? thanks.
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
good morning, stephanie. this is dan. yes, from an f&i standpoint, we believe our top performers, there's little room for growth. we continue to focus on our bottom 20%, bottom producers. and to the extent that we continue to train and improve their performance, we see the growth coming from there for our f&i pvr.
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
we like the fact that 70% of our f&i number is product sales and only 30% is reserve. and the larry h. miller group has better penetration numbers than we do. so we're certainly excited to learn from them and grow as well. so, we definitely believe there's upside in f&i. and clearly, we're certainly not at the top of the charts as it relates to our peer group.
stephanie moore -- truist -- analyst
great. thank you so much.
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from bret jordan with jefferies.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys.
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
good morning.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
question on clicklane. i guess, with a bit more experience now, does the product skew to a higher demographic or skew more to luxury? you talked about higher repair orders and higher fico scores. but does that channel really migrate to one segment of your mix, luxury or import versus domestic?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
good morning, bret. this is dan. no, we're seeing consistent use across the brands from ultra-luxury, luxury, import and domestic. so, pretty well received across the board.
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
and i would tell you that some of the brands, and -- i can't really explain it, but some of the brands that are converting at a high rate or have the high user, hyundai, kia and lexus are a few of the brands that just do extremely well with the tool.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
okay, great. and then a question, i guess, on the m&a side. you said multiple sort of in that six to eight times. are we looking at trailing 12? or are we adjusting sort of for what we've seen in the surge and profitability recently and looking at a longer term to get to that six to eight?
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
yes. no, i appreciate that question. i don't think anyone is pricing the multiple on the trailing 12 months. you really have to do -- you have to look at the last three to five years in the market that it's in and the brand that it's in. and then the performance within the brand within the market. an example would be if a store is 200% sales efficient compared to 80% sales efficient when looking at the upside in it. so, it's more based upon a three- to five -year look average is when we refer to those multiples.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. thank you. appreciate it.
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
yes.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from david whiston with morningstar.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
hi, everyone. going back to the clicklane demographic discussion from a second ago, you're getting -- it sounds like you're getting a lot of exposure across all your brands, even the volume brands, but at the end of the day, it's more the higher fico credit customers that are transacting with the tool. so why is that? and can you get the lower fico credit customers to engage more and actually transact?
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
hey david, this is david. i'll jump in and then dan can certainly. i would tell you, on an average quarter between 8% and 10% of our business is what we refer to as lower credit or sub-prime and the rest of it isn't. it becomes a lot more complicated with sub-prime online transactions, because of the documentations and what's needed. it's not impossible.
i think the reason you're seeing higher credit scores and higher down payments on the tool is it's simplistically someone with a 750-plus beacon score understands they're not worried about financing and understands that they can get what they want. so when you think about ease and convenience, that consumer who knows they have the credit power and wherewithal to transact, would they prefer to sit in the showroom for 2.5 hours or do a 14-minute transaction online? so i think that's the gravity that's pulling it there.
we're certainly seeing lower credit scores as well on there. it's not just simplistically all 750-plus beacon score customers. there's a broad mix. but again, the score average is certainly higher. and we credit that -- that's different than what we had with our prior tool. and the main reason is -- our belief is, is because that high credit score customer actually knows they can do the complete transaction and it's not simply a lead generator.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
okay. and compared to say a few months ago, with the inventory continuing to be poor, are you seeing customers, especially new vehicle customers or would be new vehicle customers, are they more likely to buy used compared to a few months ago? or are they at a point where they're saying forget it, i'll come back when inventory is better?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
good morning. this is dan again. customers -- we're seeing a mix. i mean some customers are actually going into a used vehicle. it depends on their circumstances. if they got to have the car now, they're willing to do that. we're also seeing customers that are willing to give up a particular package or an option and may be settle for a car that is incoming in the next few days or one that might be sitting on the dealer's lot.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
okay. and finally, are you guys worried at all about inflation for consumers' ability to buy a vehicle next year?
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. look, this is david. clearly, inflation is always a concern. i would tell you, in this past quarter and in the past 12 months, it's comforting to us to see the credit scores go up, the down payments go up and the financing terms slightly go shorter term. so that tells us that there's a lot of cash in the consumer's pocket out there, and they're using it to their discretion. we've already seen the inflation in a lot of areas, but as it relates to automobiles, the -- i wouldn't call it inflation, i would say the margin pressure is simply a supply and demand. the inflationary pieces of the automotive cycle, if you will, is not material from our perspective. it's not like food and that kind of thing.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
okay. thank you.
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
thank you very much. this concludes today's discussion. we appreciate your participation and look forward to speaking with you after the fourth quarter. have a great day.

it is now my pleasure to hand the call over to our ceo, david hult. david?
david w. hult -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, karen, and good morning, everyone. welcome to our third quarter earnings call. in our earnings release this morning, we reported adjusted eps of $7.36, a record third quarter up 80% over the prior year. though our new car inventory levels continue to be challenged due to the chip shortage, our team delivered strong results and enabled us to deliver an impressive gross margin of 20%, an all-time record and an expansion of 180 basis points versus the third quarter last year.
these results demonstrate the resilient strength of the franchise model with its full suite of services through the car ownership journey from sales to service contributing to sustained profitability. we've also stayed disciplined in managing expenses, resulting in adjusted sg&a as a percentage of gross profit of 55.3%, a 580 basis point improvement versus prior year. our total revenue for the quarter was up 30% year-over-year, and total gross profit was up 43%. due to this record performance and strong cash flow, our balance sheet remains strong. our net leverage ratio ended this quarter at 1.2 times.
a quick update on our five-year strategic plan. same store revenue growth, assuming 2020 annualized revenue for park place, is up 10% and is exceeding expectations. regarding clicklane, our unit sales are pacing ahead of our projection for year one. and we've made great strides this quarter on our acquisition pillar. as announced, we expect to close on the transformative acquisition of the larry h. miller dealerships and total care auto in the fourth quarter. with their strong name and brand mix in the right states and our aligned cultures, we look forward to jointly deploying our capabilities and growing together. in addition, we closed two acquisitions recently. greeley subaru in the denver market and kahlo chrysler jeep dodge in indianapolis and are on schedule to close arapahoe hyundai genesis in the denver market today.
with another acquisition still under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter as well, in total, in 2021, we anticipate that we will close on $6.6 billion of annualized revenue from acquisitions. with these results, we maintain full confidence in the execution of our growth strategy, and we will update our five-year plan during our q1 earnings call in 2022. now i would like to welcome michael welch, our new cfo to the asbury team. he brings his vast knowledge of the auto retail business, along with his broad experience in finance. we worked together at group one for many years, and i'm excited to be working with him again. i am also thrilled to welcome our new team members in indianapolis and in colorado into the asbury family.
and finally, i would like to address all of my teammates at asbury. our ability to add quality stores, who like us care about serving our guests and being highly engaged in our communities could not have happened without you. you all have given us the ability to thoughtfully grow our core business, because you align behind our vision and you are executing each and every day. i appreciate all of you, and i'm thankful to be part of this team. people make the difference in any organization and you are making us the best place to work, do business and grow your careers.
thank you. i will now hand the call over to dan to discuss our operating performance. dan?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
thank you, david, and good morning, everyone. my remarks will pertain to our same store performance compared to the third quarter of 2020, unless stated otherwise. looking at new vehicles. based on current market conditions, we continue to be focused on being opportunistic with our inventory and improving grosses to maximize profits. our new average gross profit per vehicle was $4,808 up $2,369 or 97% from the prior year period. all segment margins were up significantly from the prior year period. at the end of september, our total new vehicle inventory was $121.9 million, and our day supply was at 12 days, down 35 days from the prior year.
with still no clear understanding of when production will return to a normal level, we expect the day supply to remain low throughout the remainder of the year and into 2022. turning to used vehicles. our used retail volume increased 27%, while gross margin was 8.4%, representing an average gross profit per vehicle of $2,402. as a result of our performance, our gross profit was up 45%. our used vehicle inventory ended the quarter at $236.4 million, which represents a 28-day supply, down seven days from the prior year. our used to new ratio for the quarter was 113%. turning to f&i. our strong, consistent and sustainable growth in f&i delivered an increase of $155 to $1,955 per vehicle retail from the prior quarter. in the third quarter, our front-end yield per vehicle increased $1,400 per vehicle to an all-time record of $5,487.
turning to parts and service. our parts and service revenue increased 10% in the quarter. though warranty revenue dropped 18%, our customer paid revenue continues its healthy recovery, posting a 13% growth. overall, our total fixed gross profit increased 10%, while total fixed margin was 60.9%. and now i would like to provide an update on our omnichannel initiatives. our digital marketing team continues to do an outstanding job generating traffic to our websites. our commitment years ago to google organic search continues to drive efficiencies in times where inventory is shrinking, allowing us to increase traffic without spending media dollars. in q3, we had over 6.3 million unique visitors, a 12% increase versus q3 2020. another initiative is to increase online service appointments. we achieved over 143,000 online service appointments, an all-time record and a 12% increase versus q3 2020.
this component positively impacts service retention and increases the dollars per repair order. now with two full quarters of clicklane at all stores under our belt, we would like to share some performance metrics. we sold 6,000 vehicles through clicklane in q3, of which 47% of them were new vehicles and 53% used. 93% of our transactions this quarter were with customers that were new to asbury's dealership network. average transaction time continues to be consistent with previous quarter, eight minutes for cash deals and 14 minutes for finance deals. total front-end yield of $5,400. average credit score is higher than the average credit score at our stores. total front-end yield of $4,396 on trades taken through clicklane.
we continue to expect annualized volume through clicklane of approximately 30,000 vehicles by year-end. as expected, clicklane customers are converting at greater rates than traditional internet leads. we remain quite excited about the performance of clicklane thus far as it is tracking ahead of its target. and finally, i would like to thank all our teams in the field for their hard work, dedication and commitment to delivering an exceptional guest experience.
in addition, i would like to extend a warm welcome to our new team members from greeley subaru, kahlo cdjr and arapahoe hyundai genesis. all of you have built tremendous organizations that properly align with our north star of being the most guest-centric automotive retailer. our future is bright, and i look forward to meeting all of you. michael, welcome to asbury. your depth of knowledge in the automotive business is already making a significant impact on our company. i am enjoying working with you and look forward to growing asbury together.
i will now hand the call over to michael to discuss our financial performance. michael?
michael d. welch -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
thank you both for the warm welcome. i'm excited to be part of the asbury team and have the opportunity to work with david again. i look forward to working with the team on our growth journey. to our investors, analysts and other participants on our call, good morning. i would like to provide some financial highlights, which marked another record quarter for our company. for additional details on our financial performance for the quarter, please see our financial supplement in our press release today. overall, compared to the third quarter of last year, our actions to manage gross profit and control expenses resulted in a third quarter adjusted operating margin of 8.5%, an increase of 109 basis points above the same period last year and an all-time record.
adjusted operating income increased 69% to $204.5 million, a third quarter record. and adjusted net income increased 81% to $143.6 million, another third quarter record. net income for the third quarter 2021 was adjusted for acquisition expenses of $3.5 million or $0.13 per diluted share and a gain on dealership divestitures of $8 million or $0.31 per diluted share. net income for the third quarter of 2020 was adjusted for a gain on dealership divestiture of $24.7 million or $0.96 per diluted share, acquisition costs of $1.3 million or $0.05 per diluted share and $700,000 or $0.03 per diluted share for a real estate-related charge. our effective tax rate was 23.7% for the third quarter of 2021 compared to 24.8% in 2020. floor plan interest expense for the quarter decreased by $1.5 million over the prior year, driven by lower inventory levels.
with respect to capital deployed this quarter, we acquired a subaru store in colorado, utilizing approximately $16 million of our cash on the balance sheet. in addition, we spent approximately $15 million on capital expenditures, and we repaid approximately $9 million of debt. also as part of our strategy to optimize our portfolio, we divested of our bmw store in charlottesville, resulting in proceeds of $18 million, net of its mortgage payoff. as a result of our operational performance, our balance sheet is quite healthy as we ended the quarter with approximately $780 million of liquidity comprised of cash, floor plan offset accounts and availability on both our used line and revolving credit facility. also, at the end of the quarter, our net leverage ratio stood at 1.2 times, well below our targeted net leverage of three.
with our announced acquisitions under contract, we are working toward financing the exciting growth at asbury. as announced in late september, we plan to raise the combined -- a combination of permanent debt and equity financing prior to the closing of larry h. miller acquisition. we are working with our supportive lender group to upsize our credit facility and syndicate the real estate mortgage financing with plans to close both ahead of our acquisition of larry h. miller dealerships later this year. although the transaction is initially expected to take our net leverage above our targeted range of three times, we believe that we can deleverage approximately three times during 2023, given the highly accretive nature of the deal combined with strong free cash flow generation.
as we look forward to the remainder of 2021, we anticipate similar conditions to what we have seen this quarter. new vehicle inventory supplies will likely remain low and unpredictable into the next year. in closing, i would like to thank our teams across the businesses, who continue to work tirelessly during the unprecedented times to ensure our current and long-term success. i would also like to welcome our new team members from our recent acquisitions. i look forward to working with you and continue to build on the strong cultures that you are bringing to asbury. this concludes our prepared remarks.
we will now turn the call over to the operator and take your questions. operator?

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we'll take our first question from the line of rick nelson with stephens. please go ahead. your line is open.
rick nelson -- stephens inc. -- analyst
thanks a lot. good morning, and another great quarter. i like to ask about the acquired stores, pay operate at a higher front-end yield and lower sg&a than the core asbury. as i looked at that consolidated sg&a, for example, was slightly lower than the same store.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
rick, this is david. i'll start and michael can certainly jump in. as when we announced the deals, the comment was made there accretive to asbury. it's early on in the fourth quarter, i think we had maybe 12 or 13 days in the quarter with larry h.
miller numbers and then you add in the holidays, it was probably 10 or 11 days. so those acquisitions, as stated before, are accretive to asbury in what you acknowledge and recognized as accurate.
rick nelson -- stephens inc. -- analyst
and are there opportunities to improve performance of the acquired stores or is there a bigger opportunity rolling to ca, for example, across the asbury chain?
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, it's a great question. a couple of things. the best operation in the world has plenty of room for improvement and we certainly do at our core stores and our new acquisitions. we certainly have an opportunity to continue to grow our used car performance.
and with the rollout of total care into the asbury stores, that will certainly boost our f&i numbers as well, while parts and service continues to grow at a steady rate.
michael welch -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
one other thing to add, rick, is another opportunity for us is putting clicklane in those acquisitions. and that will just give us some technology that they didn't have before. so that is an opportunity for us to just help them from a technology perspective.
rick nelson -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok, thanks for that. also, like to gauge your appetite to do more acquisitions. do you slow things here temporarily to integrate what you've got or is there an appetite to do something over the near term?
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. rick, this is david. i'll start and michael might jump in. our goal was never to grow to be the largest or grow the fastest.
it is really about being opportunistic in finding groups that are really aligned with us. we allow them to continue to operate as they have been. so it's a much longer integration period to get to know each other and integrate everything over. we feel like our stock price is extremely cheap right now and we're trading at an extremely low multiple and we want to be great capital allocators.
so there could be a potential for some acquisitions or buying back our stock. but it's tough to say how the year will play out. if something comes up that's accretive to our company and for our shareholders, we'll certainly act upon it. and if it makes sense, if we feel like our stock price is being devalued, we will certainly acquire some of our stock back.
rick nelson -- stephens inc. -- analyst
great. and the expectation for stable gpus in 2022. what -- talk there about things would advance maybe in the front end of the year and then we'd see some pressure in the back end and given your expectations for inventories to normalize?
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
sure. the good news is in the last year, everyone has been wrong all the time about inventory trying to figure it out. but the way we see '22 as we sit here today, when you look at '21, the first two quarters, inventory levels were higher and margins were a little bit lower. and then that reversed itself in the second half of '21.
inventory really came down and margins went up. we see the reverse of that in '22. i don't know that we'll be right, but we think the first half of '22 will certainly have elevated margins like we saw in the fourth quarter. and then the second half of the year might look a little bit like the first half of '21.
really difficult to gauge what's going to happen between the pandemic and the chip shortage and everything else. but as we sit here today, that's the way we see it.
rick nelson -- stephens inc. -- analyst
great. thanks for all the color and good luck.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
we'll take our next question from the line of john murphy with bank of america. please go ahead. your line is open.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning, everybody.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, john.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
maybe a follow-up on -- good morning. maybe just a follow-up on rick's just last question there. i mean where do you think inventory is going to normalize? i know, i mean, obviously, calling the second half this year is tough, right, because it's a very tough thing to call the timing. but when things -- the logjam is broken here, what do you think the level is that the automakers are going to go back to and what do you think it means for -- your approach is? is it somewhere between here and where it used to be or is it all the way back to where it used to be?
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
very tough to predict. it's a competitive world and you never know what someone is going to do to try and gain market share and grow their business. i think everyone's learned from the concept that we can be effective with a lower days supply and everyone can benefit from that. does that mean we'll stabilize at a 35, 40 days supply compared to a 65 or 70? i think it's too early to tell.
but to me, the demand seems so high right now even when they're able to start catching up on the inventory between the rental car companies and fleet businesses and everything else, i just don't see the demand settling until sometime into '23.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah, i generally agree with you there. it's going to be a while before the things normalize. on the sg&a front, the absolute dollars as well as the percent of gross is pretty impressive. is there a way to think about that going forward? is it tied more toward units than the grosses? or is there a way to -- for you to maybe link it a little bit more to grosses so we don't have this kind of variability in the numerator denominator stays a little bit more static and yet you keep more of the gross consistently over time.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i would -- it's a tough one, john. i would tell you, prior to pandemic, we were focused on our productivity per employee and that generally keeps your cost down. however, if margins certainly start to go backwards a lot, there will be some leakage into sg&a. i also think as technology continues to evolve over the next few years, that gives you an opportunity to hit new ceiling levels with production per employee.
so we see it as a pretty stable environment. and as margins start to come back and say, call it, '23 at this point, again, who knows. but if it's '23, we also think we're going to be that much more productive per employee in '23. so we think we run lean and mean and the stores do a tremendous job of keeping their expenses down and operating extremely efficiently, whether it's our marketing dollars that we spend or how we staff the stores.
we just think it's a discipline and a core behavior of ours.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. and then just lastly, could you just kind of remind us exactly what's going on in total care auto and larry miller? and really, is there an or is this kind of shedding light on not just as rick mentioned, spreading it across stores, but maybe even doing more on f&i and becoming your own underwriter in some cases because that's -- some of your peers are looking at this stuff and it seems like it might be an incremental opportunity, but also a little bit touchy because you don't want to compete with the captives.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, total care auto is a full f&i product suppliers. they take the place of some of the third parties out there. and so we basically retain all the profitability that used to go to the third parties.
the other benefit is because we control both sides of the equation, we have the f&i side and we have the sale and the parts and service side. it allows us to kind of hold the customer throughout the whole process and really provide a better customer experience. so there is some tremendous upside for us as we roll this out to our stores. one thing we'll have to do just in next quarter just for transparency is we're going to have to be able to show you guys dealership operations, tca operations and then the consolidated operations and make sure we kind of present that to you guys in a way that you can really see the impact.
and so you'll see that coming next quarter when we have a full quarter of operations with tca. so we'll hopefully be able to give you guys the transparency to kind of see the benefits of that operations.
michael welch -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
and then one quick comment on top of that. tca is an extremely insurance company that's been in business over 30 years and is a.m. best rated. it's woven into the fabric and dna of the miller organization and their stores.
for that benefit, they have increased penetrations in product sales compared to the legacy asbury stores. so we feel confident as that gets rolled into asbury, we will see the benefit as well in future improved product sales.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
so that function is offshore self-insurance. is that essentially kind of what's going on there at tca?
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
it's onshore. it's just a -- again, it's just the underwriter behind the f&i products like vehicle service contracts, maintenance contracts, things like that on the f&i side.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. all right. thank you very much.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, john.
operator
we'll take our next question from the line of rajat gupta with j.p. morgan. please go ahead. your line is open.
rajat gupta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the question. i was just hoping maybe you could provide us a quick preview of what to expect during the first quarter print with regard to the long-term plan, clearly, acquisitions are ahead of -- well ahead of plan. overall, cumulative cash generation is going to be much higher than what you had in mind when you put out those targets.
look, you have talked about a number of horizons or vertical adjacencies. you already have tca and salty, is captive finance mix on the cards? maybe any color on what could be that extra use of that cash. you obviously have the buyback. and could that be a more consistent and bigger portion of the capital allocation mix going forward? and i have a follow-up.
thanks.
michael welch -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so i'll just hit on the capital allocation portion. i think with the share price, we always look at share buybacks and acquisitions in terms of the best return for the shareholder. and of course, at these share prices, share buybacks look pretty attractive. we'll -- we have that kind of built into the five-year model, too, but it's hard to say where the share price is going to trade and where the acquisitions are going to price at three, four years into the future.
so it's the same capital deployment we've always looked at in terms of what's the share price versus what's acquisitions at. so no changes there, just more -- like you said, more cash flow to put into both those buckets. on the five-year plan on the update, the key there is we did more acquisitions than we originally anticipated upfront. and so that will, of course, give us a larger base do same-store off of and clicklane.
so i don't see a bunch of changes in terms of the path we're looking to go down. it's just the numbers will get updated with the larger base.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
and your comment regarding the finance company, i would say we're in the really early stages of investigating and looking at it and see if that's something that makes sense for us or not. it's too early to tell at this point. we're clearly going to generate a lot more cash this year. we will pay down mortgages and some debt that we have available.
and whether it's through acquisitions or buybacks, really depending upon what the market gives us and what acquisitions are out there. we've seen a lot of opportunities for acquisitions already this year and we've passed on them just because it doesn't fit our threshold and our disciplined look at finding stores that are accretive to our company.
operator
we'll take our next question from the line of stephanie moore with truist. please go ahead. your line is open.
stephanie moore -- truist securities -- analyst
hi. good morning. 
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
yes. this is david, stephanie. i would tell you, we started off '21 thinking we're going to spend a chunk of money marketing clicklane, and we quickly canceled all of that because it didn't make sense with the lack of inventory that we have. we constantly look at the tools that are out there.
we still believe we have the best tool in the market, and it's a fully transactional tool. the benefit of that is the consumer experience. the downside to that is integrating that into new stores. it takes a little bit longer than if it was simply a lead generator and overlaying it into a website.
so it's going to take us a little time to integrate the rest. i would tell you the marketing dollars won't pick up until the inventory levels are there. the software right now because we don't want to ruin the experience for the consumer, you could go on a website in one of our stores and see some stores had the clicklane on the vehicle display page and some don't. and the reason that is, is really the availability of the product.
we don't want to ruin the experience and have someone purchase a car that isn't available. and while you have seasoned professional salespeople in the stores, that can see inventory come in a month ahead of time, they're preselling into the pipeline, which is really shrinking the inventory availability for clicklane. so it's just not prudent to spend the money right now to market it. we'll wait for inventory to catch up.
stephanie moore -- truist securities -- analyst
understood. and then shifting gears, i think we're all pretty aware that the majority of the oems are exploring pretty aggressive ev expansion goals as well as a lot of kind of new exciting models. maybe you could talk a little bit about the conversations you're having with the oems about new models, particularly around evs, new selling methods, direct to consumer. and just kind of in general, how you're preparing yourself those dealers to meet this -- a lot of these new models and kind of the years ahead? thanks.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
sure. we started about almost four years ago now starting to install charging stations at our facilities and so on and getting up to speed on training as new product has come out. a few years ago, there was some concern about the consumer adoption to ev. you can really feel the wave now coming where the consumers are being far more accepting of evs, and we're excited about the opportunity to sell some of these products.
we believe some of the electric cars that are coming out from some of the legacy oems. the quality and fit and finish to us is superior than some of the start-ups that we've seen touched and as far as their products. so we're adapting, and we're healthy and we're ready to go. we're still of the belief that as far as the supply chain goes, from the legacy oems and the franchise dealer is the best model for the consumer.
these cars are complex, and they need people locally that they can count on to help them when issues arise. on a quarterly basis, we track in our service departments, combustible engine dollars spent per repair order, hybrid and then fully electric. and it's still consistently the same. right now, the highest dollar spent per repair order on the fully electric cars.
and you'd expect that with the new technology that's coming out. so that will improve over time as well. we think by having a tool like clicklane, that is a complete transactional tool, not a lead generator that's going to get back to you. that really negates the need to sell direct to consumer from some of these electric car companies.
and as inventory becomes available and car companies have to compete with one another, the differentiator they have is the people on the ground selling the product. so we like our position. we believe as long as we take care of our consumers and we offer them a high level of service that the franchise model makes a lot of sense.
stephanie moore -- truist securities -- analyst
great. no, that's all very helpful. thank you so much.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
absolutely.
operator
we'll take our next question from the line of bret jordan with jefferies. please go ahead. your line is now open.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
how should we think about used vehicle valuations as the year progresses? is it just sort of an inverse as new supply comes up, used comes down? or do you think used can soften before that? and then the follow-through on that is sort of in the clicklane mix, as you're selling 53% used, is it a different profile car than what you would be selling on average? you say the fico score is higher. is this a younger, higher value used car?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
bret, good morning. this is dan. so i'll address the first one, the first question regarding the values. it's hard to tell, but we see the values starting in november, december have adjusted, meaning that they're not growing exponentially as they were before.
and until the inventory levels, our belief is until the inventory levels for new cars somewhat stabilize, the used car valuation is going to remain where it is right now. and i don't -- we don't believe that when there is a correction that it will be an immediate correction. it's going to be a gradual correction. so -- but we do believe that is going to be dependent on the new dsi, new car dsi.
on the second question as far as clicklane sales, we're selling a low cost of sale call under, call it, $10,000, $8,000, and we're selling the high cost of sales, certified preowned luxury vehicle in our clicklane tool. so no different than what we're selling in our stores, just a much better experience and a much faster transaction.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
i would add that down payments are higher on clicklane, when the credit scores are higher for this simple reason, bret. it's consumers that have the ability and aren't worried about financing, but they value their time. and they realize that it's a full transactional tool that they can get the purchase done in a 15-minute span and they move on. we certainly have a seven-day buyback, no questions asked, which probably gives them some level of comfort.
but i think at the end of the day, it's clearly about convenience, which is what's driving the higher credit scores.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. and then you called out a $4,400 plus gpu on the clicklane used. was that just the used cars you were selling that you've taken on trade via clicklane as well so you've built really some well-sourced inventory?
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so those -- so that was the consumer who purchased a new vehicle on clicklane traded a car. and we took that trade reconditioned it and sold it.
ok, great. thank you.
operator
we'll take our next question from the line of david whiston with morningstar. please go ahead. your line is open.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
thanks. good morning. on the m&a front, have you noticed so far this year any difference in seller asking prices compared to 2021?
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
it's a great question, david. i would say it's really depending upon the brand and the location of where it's at in what i would call some markets that are not growing at some rate as others and weaker brands. they're bringing lower multiples for sure. but in those highly desirable markets and big stores, they're still bringing a premium at this point in time.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
do you see a lot of selling -- sellers being unreasonable though, thinking well, look at the margins now, i should be able to assume that into perpetuity and you're having to push back?
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
i think when anyone is selling anything and then you have a buyer, everyone's going to take their position and the seller certainly wants to assume that. i think you also have some people maybe that aren't fully sellers. they're just testing the waters in the markets to see what valuations are and what they could possibly get. we don't spend a lot of time looking at a lot of deals.
we say no pretty fast, and we really only spend time on the deals that we think make sense for us. so it's hard to really say. i can tell you the activity we've seen in the last 60 days has been every bit as great as it has been for the last 12 months.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
ok. and on the tca restricted cash, i was just curious, if there ever is a really bad crisis, like when the pandemic or say the lehman collapsing, is there any way you could access that cash for general liquidity if you needed to?
michael welch -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
on tca cash?
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
yeah.
michael welch -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
the tca cash, most of that cash is for investments that have to be there for insurance purposes to cover future claims. we do pull the cash from the excess cash gets pulled from tca and pulled over to asbury used for general corporate purposes as it earns out. so every month, we're pulling kind of the excess cash out of the business. so what's left there is just investments that are needed for future claims.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
ok. and finally, the special item in the quarter on the bridge commitment fee. was that for gaap booked in interest expense?
michael welch -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so that was -- i think i may have misspoke when i read it. i think i said $289 million. it's $28.9 million if i misspoke that one.
so yes, that is an interest expense for gaap.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
ok, thank you.
michael welch -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, david.

[operator instructions] we'll take our next question from the line of rajat gupta with j.p. morgan. please go ahead. your line is open.
rajat gupta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thanks for getting me back in the queue. i was accidentally on mute before my follow-up on the previous question. i just had a question on the used vehicle business.
clearly, nice execution there. things have started to improve in terms of the overall same-store performance after some mixed quarters in the past. what would you attribute to anything company specific that is driving that turnaround? and just how do you view the sustainability of that going forward? thanks. is clicklane also like a major part of it or not? thanks.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
i'll start and then dan can finish for that. your point was obvious. we had lower comp numbers. so that certainly helped.
there has been again focus at our stores. but i'll tell you, we're more of a conservative than an aggressive group and what i mean by that, 36 years in automotive for me, the pricing valuation right now is hard to get my head around because i haven't seen numbers like this before. so we try and stay disciplined at a 30 days supply or 30 to 35 days supply. could we have a 45, 50, 60 days supply of used cars? sure.
but if the market swings that would put us in a tougher position. so we really like that discipline of having a lower day supply. i think it will continue in the acquisitions that we have or that are coming on. i made the comment earlier, they're more accretive to our company.
one of the big areas of opportunity that they have, they're used to new ratios are lower than the core legacy asbury stores. so there's an opportunity to grow used car sales there. but behavior doesn't change overnight. it's going to take some time to work on that with them and get the potential out of those stores with preowned.
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
raj, i would add to the -- it's been a main focus of us with an entire team, but more importantly, the operators at the store level, getting behind our vision and executing. and what i mean by that is anything from a used car perspective is really about having the right car at the right store where it turns the fastest and for the highest margin. and we have the tools to -- and the historical that shows that. and we maximize it on a month-to-month basis to put the cars where they belong and turn them at a faster pace.
so very pleased with what the operators have done. i cannot thank them enough, but we've got plenty of room to continue improving.
rajat gupta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. great. thanks for that color and good luck.
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
thank you.

good day, and welcome to the asbury automotive group q4 2021 earnings call. today's conference is being recorded. at this time, i'd like to turn the conference over to ms. karen reid.
please go ahead, ma'am.
karen reid -- vice president of corporate financial planning & analysis and treasurer
thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. as noted, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay later this afternoon. welcome to asbury automotive group's fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. the press release detailing asbury's fourth quarter and full year results was issued earlier this morning and is posted on our website at asburyauto.com.

we have also posted an updated investor presentation on our website, asburyauto.com highlighting our fourth quarter and full year results. it is my pleasure to now hand the call over to our ceo, david hult. david? 
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, karen, and good morning, everyone. welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. in the fourth quarter, we closed on the transformative acquisitions of larry h. miller and total care auto, powered by landcar, kahlo chrysler jeep dodge, arapahoe hyundai-genesis and the stevinson automotive group, representing approximately $6.6 billion in annualized revenue.
these acquisitions represent the right brands in high-growth markets and are aligned with asbury's culture. we look forward to deploying our joint capabilities and growing together, and i'm excited to have our new team members as part of the asbury family. 2021 was an all-time record year for asbury. for the full year, we grew adjusted ebitda by 94% and adjusted eps by 112%.
we delivered an operating margin adjusted at 8.1%. we succeeded in adding great stores in targeted high-growth markets and we completed the rollout of our online transactional tool, clicklane to all the legacy asbury stores. in a challenging new vehicle environment, we delivered record profitability by improving our new vehicle margin, increasing our used vehicle sales and growing our parts and service business, all while maintaining our improved employee productivity levels and using our strong cash flow for acquisitions. our multiple business lines allow us to adapt and continue to deliver strong earnings in any business environment.
we will also deploy total care auto into our legacy stores and roll out clicklane into our recent acquisitions, allowing us to further grow our earnings. due to our record performance and strong cash flow, our balance sheet remains solid. our adjusted operating cash flow for 2021 was $632 million, an increase of $189 million over 2020. our net leverage ended this quarter at 2.7 times.
we will continue to use our free cash flow to manage our leverage and maximize shareholder return through share buybacks and acquisitions. in our earnings release this morning, we also announced that our board of directors has approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization by $100 million to $200 million. now, i'd like to give you a quick update on our five-year plan. our same-store adjusted revenue grew almost 12% last year, exceeding expectations.
clicklane continues to deliver impressive metrics, generating over $570 million in additional revenue for three quarters in 2021. despite lower new vehicle levels, inventory levels, clicklane contributed an incremental 7% to our same-store growth. as previously noted, we had a very successful year regarding acquisitions. with these results, we maintain full confidence in the execution of our growth strategy.
based upon our results in 2021, we will update our five-year plan during our q1 2022 earnings call. i will now hand the call over to dan to discuss our operating performance. dan?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
thank you, david, and good morning, everyone. before i share our operating performance, i would like to thank all our teammates in the field for their hard work, dedication and commitment to delivering an exceptional guest experience. in our earnings release this morning, we reported adjusted eps of $7.46, a fourth quarter record, up 68% over the prior year. we delivered strong results, enabling us to deliver an impressive gross margin of 20.4%, an all-time record and an expansion of 370 basis points versus the fourth quarter last year.
our teams continue to maximize productivity per employee, resulting in adjusted sg&a as a percentage of gross profit of 54.3%, a 710 basis point improvement versus prior year. our total revenue for the quarter was up 19% year over year and total gross profit was up 46%. we improved our adjusted operating margins for the quarter from 6% in 2020 to 8.9% in 2021, and we'll continue to optimize our portfolio in the future. now, i will turn to our same-store performance compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, unless stated otherwise.
starting with new vehicles. based on current market conditions, we continue to be focused on being opportunistic with our inventory and improving grosses to maximize profit. our new average gross profit per vehicle was $6,335, up $3,441 or 119% from the prior-year period. all segment margins were up significantly from the prior-year period.
at the end of december, our total new vehicle inventory was $207 million and our day supply was at eight days, down 32 days from the prior year. we expect the days supply to remain low as we progress into 2022, trending up moderately toward the end of the year. turning to used vehicles. our used retail volume increased 15%, while gross margin was 8.2%, representing an average gross profit per vehicle of $2,623.
as a result of our performance, our retail gross profit was up 64%. our total used vehicle inventory ended the quarter at $402 million, which represents a 34-day supply, up three days from the prior year. our used to new ratio for the quarter was 109%. shifting to f&i.
our strong, consistent and sustainable growth in f&i delivered an increase of $213 to $1,961 per vehicle retailed from the prior-year quarter. in the fourth quarter, our front-end yield per vehicle increased $2,169 per vehicle to an all-time record of $6,362. and now to parts and service. our parts and service revenue increased 13% in the quarter.
the warranty revenue dropped 19%. our customer pay revenue continues its healthy recovery, posting a 17% growth. we achieved over 149,000 online service appointments, an all-time record and a 16% increase over the prior-year quarter. some of the benefits of increasing online service appointments include enhancement to the customer experience, higher customer retention, higher conversion rates, higher margins and higher returns to our shareholders.
with three full quarters of clicklane at all legacy stores under our belt, we would like to share some performance metrics. we sold over 5,000 vehicles through clicklane in q4, of which 47% of them were new vehicles and 53% used. 91% of our transactions this quarter were with customers that were new to asbury's dealership network. average transaction time continues to be consistent with previous quarter, eight minutes for cash deals and 14 minutes for finance deals.
total variable front-end yield of $4,298 and f&i front-end yield of $1,846. average credit score is higher than the average credit score at our stores. 80% of consumers seeking financing received instant approval, while an additional 10% require some off-line assistance. 90% of those that applied were approved for financing.
43% of clicklane sales had trade-ins with 78% of such trades reconditioned in retail to consumers with a total front-end yield of $4,490. and 92% of our clicklane deliveries are within a 50-mile radius of our stores, thus allowing us the opportunity to retain our new customers in our parts and service departments. as expected, clicklane customers are converting at greater rates than traditional internet leads. during our first few months after launching clicklane, approximately 60% of our sales were new vehicles.
until inventory levels somewhat normalized, we will not be able to fully assess the full potential of clicklane. we remain quite excited about the continued growth of clicklane. lastly, i would like to extend a warm welcome to our new team members. all of you have built tremendous organizations that properly align with our north star of being the most guest-centric automotive retailer.
our future is bright, and i look forward to meeting all of you. i will now hand the call over to michael to discuss our financial performance. michael?
michael welch -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, dan. to our investors, analysts and other participants on our call, good morning. i would like to provide some financial highlights, which marked yet another record quarter for our company. for additional details on our financial performance for the quarter, please see our financial supplement in our press release today and our investor presentation on our website.
overall, compared to the fourth quarter of last year, our actions to manage gross profit and control expenses resulted in a fourth quarter adjusted operating margin of 8.9%, an increase of 290 basis points above the same period last year and an all-time record. adjusted net income increased 89% to $163 million, and adjusted eps increased 68% to $7.46. net income for the fourth quarter of 2021 was adjusted for acquisition expenses and acquisition-related financing expenses of $289 million or $1.02 per diluted share. net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 was adjusted for a gain on dealership divestiture of $3.9 million or $0.15 per diluted share.
in addition to the net income adjustments mentioned above, our fourth quarter 2021 eps was negatively impacted by the interest and additional shares issued as part of the acquisition financing that was completed prior to the acquisition closing. if the financing had closed simultaneously with the larry h. miller acquisition, our adjusted eps for the fourth quarter would have been positively impacted by $0.87 as a result of lower interest expense and fewer outstanding shares. now for the full year 2021 results compared to 2020.
adjusted operating margin was 8.1%, an increase of 240 basis points at an all-time record. adjusted net income increased 120% to $549 million and adjusted eps increased 112% to $27.29. our effective tax rate was 23.7% for 2021 compared to 24.8% in 2020. this quarter, we acquired $6.6 billion in annualized revenue.
in order to finance the acquisitions, we completed debt and equity offerings totaling approximately $2.1 billion, a syndicated mortgage facility of approximately $700 million and borrowed under our upsized syndicated credit facility. in addition, we spent approximately $34 million of capital expenditures in the quarter. we generated $632 million of adjusted operating cash flow for the year. our balance sheet remains healthy as we ended the quarter with approximately $437 million of liquidity, comprised of cash, excluding cash to total care auto, floorplan offset accounts and availability on both our used line and revolving credit facility.
also at the end of the quarter, our net leverage ratio stood at 2.7 times, below our targeted net leverage of three times. as david stated earlier, today, we announced that our board has approved an increase to our share repurchase authorization by $100 million to $200 million. for 2022, we are planning for a tax rate of approximately 25% to 26% and capex of approximately $150 million. this amount excludes real estate purchases and potential lease buyout opportunities that we consider to be financing transactions.
in closing, i would like to thank our teams across the business who continue to work hard to ensure our current and long-term success. i would also like to welcome our new team members. now, i'll turn the call back over to david to discuss our 2022 objectives and expectations. david?
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, michael. turning to 2022. our key objectives are: continue our smooth transition with all of our new value team members; execute superior allocation of capital to maximize shareholder return; continue the innovation and growth of clicklane, rolling out this fully transactional tool coast to coast into our recent acquisitions; integrate our insurance and f&i product provider, total care auto, across the entire asbury platform of dealerships, which will allow us to expand our f&i pvr; execute our companywide training initiative to continue the development and growth of our teammates; and maintain our best-in-class operating margins and sg&a. i would also like to make a few comments regarding our expectations for this year.
we are excited about 2022. we see good opportunities for automotive retail, and we expect that demand will continue to exceed supply for most of the year. we do anticipate a gradual recovery in inventory levels in the second half of '22 as oem production improves. as a result, we are planning our business for a saar of 15.5 million to 16 million units and vehicle margins consistent with 2021.
we will remain nimble and vigilant to adapt as conditions evolve. sg&a as a percentage of gross profit should continue to benefit from active expense management and improved employee productivity. we look forward to continuing to deliver strong results for our shareholders, be outstanding partners with our oems to steward their great brands and offer an environment where our team members can thrive while providing the most guest-centric experience in automotive retail. finally, i'd like to address all of my teammates at asbury.
our ability to add quality stores, who, like us, care about serving our guests and being highly engaged in our communities could not have happened without you. you all have given us the ability to thoughtfully grow our core business because you align behind our vision. i appreciate all of you and i am thankful to be a part of this team. people make the difference in any organization and you are making us a better place to work, and you are creating an environment where people want to do business.
thank you for everything. this concludes our prepared remarks. we will now turn the call over to the operator and take your questions. operator?
",2021-Q4,ABG
0.9946,,,,":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and we can now take our first question from daniel imbro of stephen inc. please go ahead.
daniel imbro -- stephens inc. -- analyst
yeah. hey, good morning, guys and congratulations ona great quarter.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
daniel imbro -- stephens inc. -- analyst
david, i want to start on the used side of the business. i mean, the organic used growth uptick was near the best of the peer group and gpu really hung in there. so could you talk about maybe what you're seeing in terms of used demand, and how are you guys successfully capturing that used sale while maintaining gpus?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
yeah. good morning. this is dan. i'll be glad to take that question.
so we're pretty satisfied with the results even though we continue to focus on the acquisition of the inventory. we all know that is in used cars, where the return is generated. close to 85%, 86% of our acquisition is coming through the consumer, whether it is in the form of our leased earnings, trades or buying cars through -- directly from the consumers. and we know and we believe that, that is what is allowing us to continue to report the margins and the pvrs that you are seeing today.
in addition to that, the benefits, the clicklane brings to be able to provide a digital retail environment online, we see the benefit of that as well from a used car perspective. so overall, we will continue to focus on that strategy and continue to execute as we move forward.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
the one thing i'll add to that, we decoupled our trade tool inside of clicklane to allow consumers to sell their vehicles direct to us. we'll talk about it in detail at the end of the second quarter because we're fully launched in the month of april, and we had it going at pilot stores or half our company, if you will, in the prior quarter or the current quarter we're talking about, the first quarter. we're seeing tremendous results in acquiring cars direct from consumers which is helping stabilize our inventory. but most importantly, our ability to create margin or gross profit per vehicle on used vehicles is really all about the acquisition of the car.
the market dictates a price. if you cannot acquire the car at the proper price, you will dramatically be impacted in the margin is our belief. so we're really trying to be opportunistic and really make it easy for consumers to sell their vehicles to us, which we believe is helping support our gross profit per vehicle.
daniel imbro -- stephens inc. -- analyst
great. that's really helpful. and then my follow-up, i wanted to ask on the rollout of tca. you have some really bullish commentary in the slides about the opportunity.
but should we expect this rollout to be linear or is there a training of store employees or some kind of infrastructure that needs to be stood up first at the asbury stores before we can really accelerate the rollout of the product?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
i'll start and then michael can jump in and clean up anything i screw up. i'll tell you the easiest piece of it will be the rollout of the stores because the folks in the stores are used to selling the product. so that will be very quick and efficient. we've really been working on the backside of the plumbing.
i mean it's a stand-alone insurance company, to get it right in all the stores before we start to implement it. michael discussed in the script that in q2, we will start to roll out the legacy asbury stores. our goal isn't the quarter-to-quarter race. it's the long-term vision of where we're going as an organization.
we plan to roll out the whole company within 12 to 18 months, so somewhere in that time frame, 100% of the asbury stores will be on tca.
michael welch -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
and just a reminder from a -- as david said, 12 to 18 months for the rollout to the stores, from the impact on the financial statement because we have to defer the revenue, there will be a lag in terms of when you'll see those results kind of come through the financials because we now have to defer that revenue over the life of the contract. and so from a p&l perspective, it's probably two to three years away before you start seeing the positive results through the p&l.
daniel imbro -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. thanks so much, guys.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
and we can now take our next question from john murphy, bank of america. please go ahead.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys. maybe just to follow up on the tca to stay on the same topic. i mean, the funding and the balance sheet, i mean that's going to be in tax advantage state or offshore.
i'm just curious how in addition to sort of the benefits of just the ongoing earnings, the potential tax implications or the lack thereof might be even more beneficial than what we just see in the earnings.
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
so currently, tca is set up in as a utah entity. and so that's the current setup. we're looking into the kind of tax advantage pieces to kind of handle with the bigger scale now. and so currently, we do not have any of those baked into the forecast, but something we are looking at from a perspective of -- currently it's utah and doesn't make sense to have any of it elsewhere.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i've got to imagine it makes sense to have it elsewhere, right? i mean it can be meaningfully positive to right the ongoing earnings distribution as far as cash versus what you would rather otherwise, the tax.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
yes. there was tax benefit.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah, that's huge, right? i mean on just the structure of that, forget about the rollout, isn't it?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
so there's two pieces of tca. there's a true regulated insurance company and then it's an f&i product piece. and so yes, there's some tax benefits, which got away the cost of the setup and the different pieces and then what that read is worth on a tax basis. so i agree with you that there's some benefits there.
we just got to go through and kind of figure out the pieces of that and give it -- get it set up for a bigger company.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. ok. that seems like there might be more upside. and i get to the sort of second question on slide 25.
when you're looking at this range, i understand the benefit of leverage and being maybe more aggressive in expansion. but david, as you look at this, how do you think about leverage? i mean, going from one to two turns, going from $55 to $70 plus, it seems like two turns is not too aggressive or really risky. i mean, how are you thinking about leverage in general as you're redeploying capital for growth here?
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and just to clarify, the leverage is 2025 so back to kind of a more normalized margin environment. so that two times leverage is on a normalized basis. i agree with you that two times is not an overly aggressive target.
i think that two to three times leverage is still kind of where we want to be in a normalized environment, but being below two times just allows you the flexibility to go after larger acquisitions. where if you're kind of up near that three times, you don't have that same flexibility. so i think a one to two times leverage is the right place to be -- to have the opportunity to go after those larger deals.
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
and i would just add, i mean, our history is we're a conservative company and any targets we put out there, we certainly hit or exceed and usually exceed them. it's difficult to know what the environment is going to be at that moment in time. this was a conservative approach to us. and certainly, in this '25 year plan, we've normalized margins as well.
this whole plan is not baked on current margins. we certainly brought them back down to a normalization in the future years coming up to '25.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. and i mean, i guess, the big of the question is, what does normal mean going forward? is it 2019 and prior margins is what you're thinking there? or is there some potential benefit from automakers now being much more disciplined on supply versus demand and maybe getting a little bit better growth on the new side? and then the mix of the business obviously shifting to used in part, more parts and service. that means that there could be just from a mixed basis upside in margins. is that how you're thinking about it? is it you just kept the 2019 levels to just get the benefit from the mix of what you're driving in the business or there is some potential slight upside from the 2019 levels?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
yeah. no, and everyone keeps referring to 2019, and i brought this up a few times. i'll bring it up again. we will never see 2019 margins again in our company.
we're a different company, not because of our size, but because of the accretive acquisitions that we've done. we sold off all of mississippi, which was our lowest margin platform. and we've increased through park place, lhm and stevinson, all of them are accretive in margins to where we were in '19. we're also, from a productivity standpoint, under the legacy asbury stores alone, it hasn't been integrated in any of the acquisitions yet.
but from a productivity standpoint, from 2019, we've had a 50% increase on the variable side for production per employee for sales advisors. so that's significant, and we see more upside where technology is going and where clicklane is going. so i would tell you, john, and i'll just speak specifically to asbury. we're in that high 4%, 5% margin business.
my belief is we'll be somewhere in the 6% or higher range on new car margins when things normalize. now, as it relates to margins on used cars, i would simply tell you the cost of sales are reflection of margin. our gross profit now is in the $2,200 range. we don't see that materially changing much when we get back to a normalized environment.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. and that just gets to my last question on the sg&a front. i mean how do you -- i mean, we always like to think about it as a percent of gross margin. i mean, it's a reasonable way to think about it, but then there's an absolute dollar level, and then there's all this technological efficiency that you just kind of highlighted.
how should we think about sg&a going forward? i mean the dumb guy simple way is, hey, it's mid-50% to 60%, maybe it's higher than that, maybe it's slower than that. but how do you think about that because it's much more complicated than just, hey, it's a percent of gross, a good starting place to talk about it. but i mean how do you think about it?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
sure. i'll start and michael can finish it. the way we've modeled this and looked at it, and we're tracking exactly where we expect it to be at this point. so it gives us confidence that we're on the right track to execute the 25-year plan.
we believe that there is an opportunity to improve sg&a significantly over where we were in 2019, but somewhere around where we are today. so i don't see it, what's going on in the macro sense, what's going on in the economy, what interest rate, different things look like at that moment in time. but as we sit here today and we forecast it out, and you see our soft plan that we forecasted, that doesn't assume a recession. so assuming as we sit here today, we model this out, we have the opportunity both through efficiency of our software production per employee to have a tailwind with sg&a.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
so baseline, we should think about high 50s and with an opportunity to maybe grind better as grosses improve and you get efficiency in the system. is that a fair way to say, but you're not even really assuming that just yet?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
yeah. so look, we have it. what we did these five-year plans, we don't aggregate the numbers. we do it literally by store, by market.
i would tell you, if things play out the way we anticipate, we should be in the mid-50s to upper 50s somewhere in that bracket.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok, that's very helpful. thank you so much.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
and we can now take our next question from ryan sigdahl of craig-hallum capital group. please go ahead.
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
good morning, guys. congrats on the results, progress. 
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
thank you.
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
curious on two kind of, i guess, financial questions. one, divesting seven stores, what's the annual revenue you're going to lose from those? and then secondly, on parts and service, same-store sales strong at 14%, even excluding tca, but the gross margin was a bit weaker kind of year over year. anything to call out there?
michael welch -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so on the divestitures, just -- i'll give you just a quarter. for the quarter, those stores represented $162 million of revenue on the quarter. so that just kind of gives you a run rate for the quarter to back that number on.
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
and similar for the other three, i guess, are they all similar sized?
michael welch -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
that includes all. that includes the four stores sold in the quarter plus the three stores that we sold on april 1. so that's all seven stores, what they represented in the quarter.
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
got it. and then on parts and service?
michael welch -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
we have $3.75 billion.
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
ryan, this is dan. i'll take the other parts and service. so the parts and service margin is a direct reflection of just the mix that we're seeing. as you see on our tables, our wholesale parts grew up 25%, which carries your lowest margin.
and then in addition to that, when you see some of the warranty pullback that we have experienced out there with some of the oems, the mix of that warranty pullback in the margin that we carried in there is what is bringing us down.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
and i'll say with the miller organization, we're happy to sacrifice that margin. they're impressive as it relates to wholesale parts and many other areas, but that's just one that sticks out. and there's certainly a lot of learnings there for us for our legacy asbury stores as well.
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
great. one more for me. so on clicklane, a lot of good incremental progress there. curious on the traffic sources to get break out, kind of what percent of that is organic versus paid sem or other paid channels?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
so ryan, this is dan again. i'll start and then david can clean it up. since we launched clicklane, we have not gone out there and spent millions of dollars advertising clicklane. and the vast majority of our advertising dollars go -- from a store standpoint, go for the digital transaction and the digital traffic that we've pushed to our websites.
so i will tell you that the vast majority of the traffic is coming from organic growth and the traffic that we pushed to the website.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
and just to put a harder number on it, i'd tell you about 25% is for paid search. there just hasn't been a logical reason for us to really promote it without any inventory. and i can't stress it enough that the 5,600 sales are simply the 90 legacy asbury stores. we haven't rolled it out to any of the acquisitions yet.
again, because of tca, the forming clicklane being a fully transactional tool, not a lead generator, it takes time to do that. we'll start to roll out our first store toward the end of this quarter. but none of the additional 70 stores that we purchased are on clicklane at all. so that growth, that number is solely the legacy stores.
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
great. thanks guys. good luck.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
thank you.
operator
we can now take our next question from glenn chin of seaport research partners. please go ahead.
glenn chin -- seaport global securities -- analyst
hi. thank you. good morning, folks and congratulations on the upsize plan. nice to see such an ambitious plan, very encouraging.
and thank you for all the detail around it. david, i just want to probe your comments a little about normalized margins, what those might be going forward. i mean, i understood that you will benefit from these terrific acquisitions you've made. but maybe just from a broader industry perspective, i mean, is it safe even to use or look at 2019 as a baseline only because prior to that, i mean new margins, at least if not as much on the used side, but new margins were in secular decline for a very long period.
is that to say that you think 2019 may have been the bottom?
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
i would say a bottom and kind of the end of an era. you've had a tremendous amount of acquisitions and growth and consolidation since '19. you've had really disruption of electric evs coming in, consumers preordering at more acceptable margins, for lack of a better term. the question is if you believe normalized margins are end of '23, '24, what does that mean? how many electric cars are going to be on the road? what's the incentives going to be for the government? the stronger the incentives, the more it supports margins.
i just don't think as an industry, you'll see '19 again for a long time. i think a lot has changed since then. and you see the profit from our partners with the manufacturers, they found ways to be more efficient in what they do. so i think between technology finally catching up to an archaic space, meaning automotive retail, the introduction of evs, the consumer perception, demand and their comfort level acquiring online.
and oddly enough, when you go online and won't price it, for lack of a better term, you end up at a better margin place than letting someone negotiate. so i just think our industry has been hampered the last year or two with what happens with ev, does the franchise model go away? as i sit here today and i worry about the franchise model, i feel better every day about the franchise model and know the meaningful role that we play and the strong partner that we can be. and just looking at some of these start-up electric companies and how they're struggling and what they're going through and the quality of the products that our manufacturers make and our ability to present those products and sell them, i just think we're in a different space. and now you add technology to it and you add efficiency to it and you change how you compensate people, i just see this as a much better value proposition and i use this term around here, so i'll use it again.
right now, we're a plane taking off and we're in the clouds. it's a little bumpy and everyone can't see above the clouds yet. but when we get above the cloud in the next 18 to 24 months, i think things are going to look really good for our industry as a whole. that's my belief.
glenn chin -- seaport global securities -- analyst
ok. yeah, understood. and i appreciate the thoughts. and then next, i apologize if i missed it, but did you guys talk about how the upsize plan will be funded? do you think it can be funded internally or organically or do you anticipate having to access the capital markets?
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
no. if you look at the onetime leverage number, that is all, the acquisitions are paid for out of free cash flow. so no additional debt needs. our equity needs to be raised.
glenn chin -- seaport global securities -- analyst
ok, very good. also good to hear. and then lastly, just on acquisitions and dispositions, any thoughts, gentlemen, on where those acquisitions will be or the types of stores that you're going to be looking at or looking to build out the network or really just bulking up in markets where you already exist?
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
i'm doing this for 36 years on the retail side, you created a lot of relationships and a lot of friends and a lot of dealers see value in partnering with us. we have the ability through relationships today to go out and purchase another $5 billion if we wanted to today. our goal is not to grow quickly. our goal is to grow thoughtfully and be great capital allocators for our shareholders.
so i think that the timing, cadence and pace is important. i think the states where you've seen us grow in our thought process of balancing the brands with the right states, you won't see us differ from that and acquisitions going forward will be accretive for us. the one thing i don't think our space gets a lot of look at is portfolio management. what do they buy? what do they sell? what did that do from an accretion standpoint? not from a top-line revenue, but what did that really do to them as a whole? and so i think you'll see us really manage the portfolio well.
you'll see more divestitures over time, probably at some point in the future. and you'll certainly see more acquisitions as well. but that's just really maximizing the portfolio to generate the highest returns and create the most stable company for our employees and our shareholders.
glenn chin -- seaport global securities -- analyst
ok. very good. and then lastly, still on acquisition and disposition. can you confirm this bunch of seven stores that you disposed of, is that portfolio management or fine-tuning, david or is it you need to comply with oem framework agreements?
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and in this particular case, without getting too much into the weeds, it had nothing to do with framework. every manufacturer and we're thankful to represent the toyota and lexus brand, and we love them and the relationship and the senior management teams. but when we went into this, it's a timing situation.
we were competing to buy lhm with a group of people. we didn't know who we're competing against and didn't know we were getting the deal. the stevinson deal was in my 20 group in the '90s when i was the gm of a turner store, there was a relationship there that came together quick. we didn't want to pass on that opportunity not knowing if we're going to get the miller organization.
then fast forward, we signed stevinson and then we got the miller one. so we knew we had an issue because the manufacturer has a limit to how many stores you can own and reach in. so we knew that we would have to sell some stores. did we want to sell any of them? of course, not.
but we had to comply and respect the relationship that we do with the manufacturer and we fully aligned quickly with what we needed to do. they were tremendous partners in working with us to divest of those stores. so we think it all happened quickly and timely because of the strong relationship, and we're happy with where we are today with our portfolio.
glenn chin -- seaport global securities -- analyst
ok, terrific. thank you for all the feedback.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

we can now take our next question from rajat gupta of jpmorgan. please go ahead.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for taking the question. the first question was on just the used car, used vehicle unit growth trajectory.
you're currently run rating roughly close to 150,000 annual units. with the acquisition targets in the four-year plan, you probably, that run rate becomes like 200,000, 220,000. and by 2025, we're expecting that to move from that 220,000 to like 340,000, which is roughly like a 15% cagr. how should we get conviction around that, particularly when supply is a bit tight here in the near term? it just seems like a bit of a hockey stick around to be out here.
so maybe if you could help bridge that. and i also like to put that in the context of clicklane, how much conviction you already have that incremental contribution is going to come through? thanks. then i have a followup.
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
yeah. good morning, rajat. this is dan. i'll take the first part of the question and then david can clean it up.
let's look at the big picture from a market level. we talk about 40 million used cars that are sold on an annual basis. 45% to 50% of those transactions happened between private parties. we believe that as the digitization of our industry continues to evolve, and with us having been one of the very few that have a fully transactional tool, as that consumer continues to adopt and accept the digital transaction online, those private party customers are not going to want to transact between private parties because that is not going to be available for them.
so that is going to give us a competitive advantage that we will certainly take and go after. so we see being able to pull from that market share for a lack of a better term that is out there.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
and i'll add to it. and if you look at slide 19, i don't know how well it's showing up, but there's a hockey stick arrow in there. so i like your terminology with that. i would tell you the reduced cars that are out there now, clearly won't be a problem in the future.
when you normalize sar and you get the fleets back up to normal levels and you get those cars coming back to market, that aren't coming back to market now make it much easier. when you go from 91 stores to 225-ish stores, while i understand the cagr comment in there, you got $40 million typically on an average year plus of used sales. so when you talk about incremental growth or market share gain, on the franchise side, you're somewhat restricted because of your pma, but you're unrestricted as it relates to pre-owned. so we looked at our growth from 2019, 2020 average per store where we're at, where we're going.
and again, i'll say it again, i know it's repetitive, but the 5,600 was with 90 legacy stores, none of the acquisitions going forward and with no new car inventory to have on there. and when we originally launched the tool, we're selling more new than used on clicklane. so we've done this exercise by store. we're looking at sar and making our assumptions.
we understand and we'll talk about it next quarter, the number of cars we're acquiring directly from consumers. this isn't an overly aggressive number for us. we feel like this is logical to be it. and i made a comment earlier, the miller organization is phenomenal and a lot of things in wholesale parts is one of them, employee retention, taking care of the guests or others, but a huge opportunity for them is the used to new ratio.
even in the quarter, and it shows between our total and our same store, they are a pretty good distance behind us in used to new ratio. so we'll work with that very talented team over time to dramatically improve that used to new ratio. when you take their size of an organization, they get them up to our used to new ratio. there's a meaningful tailwind there as well.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
got it. got it. that's helpful color. and then maybe just last one on parts and services.
you have mid-single-digit growth down in there for the next few years. it seems a bit conservative, like pre-covid, the average franchise dealer averaged 5%, 6%. and with inflation and with customer pay and with the wage continue to ramp back and just the opportunity to gain share from smaller independent, just curious as to what's governing that mid-single-digit target? is that conservative? or just what's factored into that, that would be helpful to know. thanks.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
it's an excellent question. and quite honestly, one we debated for a while. there's a lot of factors. i'll start with the answer and then dabble for a minute.
the answer is it's extremely conservative. we had a 30% growth rate in the last four years for consumers as far as what they're spending with us per transaction. we see a lot of where it's coming from and why and we see how it's going forward. and as we sit here today and i said this before, every quarter, we track the dollars per repair order on combustible engine, hybrid and fully electric vehicles.
and we didn't talk about it, but this quarter was no different. the dollar values are significantly higher on the fully electric vehicles. the question will be, as cars become -- the average age of the car, we all know how old it is right now. does that start to change in '24 and '25 with the availability of all the cars that are going to be out there in the heavy, what we believe to be federal incentives to buy these cars.
and if there's a lot of car transactions in those years, will that materially change the dollars spent in the service department because maybe the average miles coming to the shop are lower. now there's 270 million-plus cars on the road. again, the average age is much older. approximately the average age of a car that comes to our service department is 70,000 miles.
so we've made a lot of again, this five-year plan is almost like a balance sheet statement. it's a moment in time. as we sit here today, and we plan out through '25, we put together what we believe is a conservative plan, and we've literally looked at it by store, by market and what our potential is to grow. so it's a very fair comment.
it is extremely conservative. there potentially is upside in it. there's just so many factors that come into play. we just didn't feel confident enough to raise it without being able to back it up.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
got it. got it, make sense. it looks like you win either way, either more units or more service. so it shows the resiliency of the model.
great.
operator
and we can now take our next question from stephanie moore of truist. please go ahead.
stephanie moore -- truist securities -- analyst
hi. good morning. i think continuing on the same kind of question toward here on evs. maybe you could talk a little bit about the conversations you're having with the oems right now about the introduction of evs over the next several years.
i think you have a nice perspective just given your breadth of oem brand coverage. so maybe what our expectations from the oems in terms of capital investments on your end, everything from just the stores to charging stations, thoughts about agency models, direct-to-consumer or preorders. i would love to get just general color on ev introduction.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i think we do a good job in running the business day to day, and the manufacturers do a great job at looking ahead and planning for the future, getting us ready for the future and building quality products. we've been installing charging stations for four years at our dealerships and very mature with that at this standpoint. i would tell you, tesla has done extremely well.
they've been a great disruptor, but they haven't had anyone to compete against. no one has really been in that space offering a lot of products and going at them. over the next couple of years, you're going to see that change materially as far as what comes to market. sitting in my seat, i get the opportunity to drive a lot of cars that have either just come out or are coming out for a year or so.
and i would just say from a fit and finish and a quality standpoint, i'm extremely excited with the electric products that are coming out from the manufacturers. and i believe that they're better than the fit and finish and quality of the tesla product. everyone has their own opinion. it's just one person's opinion.
i'm not knocking them. but that again excites me more about the future and what's happening. and like anything else, like our software, and like the battery technology, everything is going to improve over time. the government wants to go down this road, so we believe the incentives are going to be there for a while.
so we think we're really well positioned with this, what i would call a mature supply chain, meaning the brick-and-mortar is out there. you see carvana, you see tesla, you see all these start-up electric companies or direct-to-consumer companies realizing the need for brick-and-mortar. that's already mature. that's already out there.
the investments have already been made. where we're at, and we've been at the last couple of years, just making significant investments in our team, training our folks to sell electric vehicles and training them on the technology, most importantly, training our technicians to work on these very complicated and quite honestly, dangerous cars to work on. so again, extremely optimistic about the space. haven't seen from almost every manufacturer from a quality standpoint, what they're coming out with for electric cars.
i think it's going to be a fun time to see how these legacy oems really stay at all against the disruptors.
stephanie moore -- truist securities -- analyst
great. no, that's really helpful. and then i think switching gears, a topic that's been coming up, i think, more as of late has just been the affordability of vehicles in this environment. obviously, new prices are quite high.
used have also increased pretty meaningfully. now we have rising interest rates. what are you -- what do you view kind of where it stands on just overall affordability and just on the new and used side? and do you think that changed at all during the quarter or in april?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
sure. the reason we quoted that the average down payments, $9,000, i'm rounding numbers. so $9,000 down payment on a new car is significant. we didn't see that pre-pandemic, almost $7,000 on a used car.
what that tells me is the consumer has a lot of cash to spend. and even though inflation is running high, their incomes have gone up dramatically, and they've been sitting on cash and the age of the car is there. so we've had 0 interruption with raising rates as it relates to the consumer side of things or the desired demand to buy vehicles. i can't predict the future.
i don't know what's going to happen in ukraine. it's certainly affecting us on the supply chain issue with some brands. so there's a lot of variables still out there, but we're optimistic where we sit today, how strong and resilient the consumer is, how much cash that they have and their propensity and willingness to want to buy. 90% of our business, a little bit over 90%, is prime business.
so we're a very small player in the subprime business. i'm sure it affects subprime more in folks living paycheck to paycheck, which where the inflation would affect them more. but we're not seeing any issue at this point.
stephanie moore -- truist securities -- analyst
great. appreciate all the color today. thank you.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
and we can now take our next question from bret jordan of jefferies. please go ahead.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. 
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
on the 17% customer pay growth, could you tell us what was price versus traffic?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
yeah. i would say it was 60% price, meaning the consumers were spending more and probably almost 40% traffic as far as...
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
do you feel like for like same skew price, like an inflation number in there? or is it just that obviously, the 60% would include mix shift as well. but is there a feeling for like what pricing on the same job would be?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
yeah. there's no inflation in there at all. we haven't adjusted our prices as it relates to that to align with inflation.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. and then i think investor perception is that battery electric vehicles don't need any service, and you're saying that they have a higher repair bill. is that something you see going forward? or do you think this is just because these are new vehicles with bugs that will be worked out over time? i mean, as you look at the bev population, are they additive to your service business long term or negative?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
yeah. i -- again, one person's opinion, my belief is the propensity or the frequency of them coming to the shop will be less. but the time in dollars will be greater, not just what they spend, but what we end up charging because of sophistication to work at it. and putting electric aside and not talking about autonomous, there are some technology features in cars today, breaking where your car can break with someone in front of you, lane changing, the shifting and learning you.
that's all technology that could have bugs in them. so while the cars really get heavy content with technology, not just the battery piece, it allows for more opportunity for things to go wrong. and when you talk about driving a 5,000-pound vehicle at 60 miles an hour down the road, there's a lot of liability in touching those cars. so you've really got to be thoughtful and think about what you're going to do over the airwaves that are nice to have and what you're going to do that may have a real liability issue in driving the vehicle.
so we see that we're really positioned well. we're not surprised by the additional dollars, to your point, technology will get better over time. it's going to take a while. and then you factor in the roads and the potholes and the weather, they all play a role with the software and technology in these vehicles as far as their performance.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
right. thank you.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
we can now take our final question from david whiston of morningstar equity research. please go ahead.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
thanks. good morning. on clicklane, is the conversion rate so much higher versus traditional digital because of the tool itself being so good, which i think it is. or is it because your customers are already more committed to buying than other customers would be just because they do enter the clicklane portal?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
david, good morning. this is dan. i'll start and then turn it over to david. so if you look at our data from clicklane with the average credit score being over 700, you think about that consumer, that consumer is in the very, they know that we have a fully transactional tool, which gives us a competitive advantage from that perspective.
so that consumer does not want to go through the traditional process and go spend three or four hours in a store and are taking full advantage of the technology that we have out there that makes it a lot more efficient to buy and acquire that inventory where they want to, how they want to, and at the time of the day that best benefits the guest. so we believe that it is -- that the tool is attracting a very good credit score customer. but in addition to that, just the fact that it is one of the very, very few fully transactional tool is giving us the better results as well.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
and i would just say, just to add on top of that, we had prior tools and then what i would call more lead generators to what a lot of the tools are out there now. we saw a lower credit score customer. we saw lower down payments. i think the consumer appreciates their time and to be able to do a transaction in 14 minutes instead of sitting in a show room for two hours is meaningful.
if you have a fully autonomous transactional digital platform, you don't have a need for a call center. if you have a call center, that only frustrates the consumer more. think about if you're trying to buy any kind of product online, you can't finish it, you need to get on with a call center to figure things out, that's not a fun experience. it's frustrating.
so we don't have a call center. we believe that the tool speaks for itself, and it's only going to continue to grow. and that old stupid adage we're all consumers, we'd love to buy things. we don't love to be sold things.
so the ability in your own safe environment to go through a tool, select which one that you want to use, decide what f&i products, if any, you want, be able to sign in your home and pay for it is meaningful. we have this software called invite to pay, which people pay via text and email. in 2018, we did $12 million annually on this invite to pay tool online or via text. we did over $100 million last year because it's convenient.
so we're constantly focused on that north star. it's not about what's best for us to generate the most money, what's best for the manufacturer for them, it's what's best for the consumer. and our logic is if we give them the best tool and be most transparent, logically they want to transact with us more. and again, going back to that concept, people like to buy.
we believe that's why the f&i number is so high. we're not repitching. we're not selling. there's no interruption on that f&i process.
that almost $2,300 per in f&i is the customer self-selecting themselves. so we think that's the power. and no different than the first smartphone or any technology, this is year one. as people become more comfortable with the software, the software improves, later in this quarter, we'll roll out our second iteration of our f&i platform on clicklane.
it's a significant improvement to our card version. so we're constantly working on it, and we will continue to improve the tool as well. but it's just logic-based. convenience, time, transparency is going to win out every time for the consumer.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
yeah. i totally agree with you that i see what you mean by the efficiency and the convenience and it's attracting perhaps a more wealthier or higher credit quality customer. but at the same time, doesn't the digital aspect also attract -- make it easier for some people who have lower credit quality who are afraid to go to the store? it doesn't sound like that's happening with clicklane. i'm just curious, is clicklane quickly maybe crowding out that lower credit quality customer?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
no, that's a great comment, and it's one that we really never talk about. i'm going to -- we all journey through life. we have our ups and downs, and we never judge any one situation in why they might be affected by a low credit score. so this isn't to disparage anyone.
but i would -- and i entered the car business in the mid-'80s. from the mid-80s until today, anyone that is in a position of need as it relates to being assisted with financing, they're the first people to reach out for help, that was pre-websites and them showing up at the store and disclosing their situation. after websites, them reaching out via lead, saying help me. that business has been there for decades.
it will always be there and it doesn't stop with clicklane. we didn't get everyone financed. we got 90% of the people financed, 90% of the people needed assistance, 10% of the people we could not get financed. what i would tell you is most people that have a situation, they want to personally talk about it.
and so that's when more human intervention and understanding and empathy gets involved to understand their situation to best assist them. the software isn't a machine learning tool at this point to where i can identify that and work through subprime customer's issues.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
ok, thanks. that's helpful.
operator
we have no further questions at this time. i would like to now hand the call back to david hult for any additional or closing remarks.

good day, and welcome to the asbury automotive group q1 2022 earnings call. today's conference is being recorded. at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to karen reid. please go ahead.
karen reid -- vice president, corporate financial planning and analysis, and treasurer
thanks, mary, and good morning, everyone. as noted, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay later this afternoon. welcome to asbury automotive group's first quarter 2022 earnings call. the press release detailing asbury's first quarter results was issued earlier this morning and is posted on our website at asburyauto.com.
participating with me today are david hult, our president and chief executive officer; dan clara, our senior vp of operations; and michael welch, our senior vp and chief financial officer. at the conclusion of our remarks, we will open the call up for questions, and i will be available later for any follow-up questions that you may have. before we begin, we must remind you that the discussion during the call today is likely to contain forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements are statements other than those which are historical in nature, which may include financial projections, forecasts and current expectations, each of which are subject to certain uncertainties.

we've also posted an updated investor presentation on our website, asburyauto.com, highlighting our first quarter results. it is now my pleasure to hand the call over to our ceo, david hult. david? 
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, karen, and good morning, everyone. welcome to our first quarter earnings call. our first quarter results were an all-time record for any quarter in asbury's history. we continue to experience strong consumer demand, although our ability to meet this demand was constrained by very low new vehicle inventory.
for the quarter, we grew adjusted ebitda by $195 million to $336 million, and adjusted eps from $4.68 to $9.27, an increase of 98%. we delivered 8.2% adjusted operating margin, up 210 basis points. we increased revenue by $1.7 billion to $3.9 billion and increased gross profit by $409 million to $792 million. we drove f&i gross profit per vehicle to a record 2,481, up $742.
we continues to have a disciplined approach around sg&a, resulting in a decline of 520 basis points from the prior-year's first quarter. this was the first full quarter reflecting all of our 2021 acquisitions under the asbury umbrella and the strategic fit is clear. we are excited about our team and our ability to execute on our '25 plan. we see tremendous opportunity ahead of us as we roll out clicklane to all acquired dealerships and integrate tca into the legacy asbury stores.
due to our record performance and strong cash flow, our balance sheet remains strong. our adjusted operating cash flow for the first quarter was $406 million, an increase of $290 million over the first quarter of 2021. our net leverage ended this quarter at 2.2x. during the quarter, we repurchased $200 million of our stock, which completed our share reauthorization.
as we announced in our earnings release this morning, our board of directors has approved a new $200 million share repurchase authorization. as we announced in our earnings release this morning, our board of directors have approved a new $200 million repurchase authorization. our near-term priority is to continue to integrate our recent acquisitions and use our strong free cash flow to lower our net debt level and return cash to shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases. at the same time, we'll continue to monitor the m&a market as we believe there are potential opportunities that would enhance our already strong dealership portfolio.
due to the strong pace of acquisitions last year, we exceeded our five-year acquisition target in the first year of the plan. today, we'll be providing an update to our strategic growth plan that i will briefly discuss later in the call. we continue to operate in an unusual macro environment, and experienced strong demand across all of our revenue streams. we do not anticipate a meaningful recovery in inventory levels in 2022 and believe these levels are unlikely to fully normalize until 2023.
in these unusual times, our industry has benefited, which is reflected in our first quarter results and demonstrates the value and the resilience of the franchise model. we look forward to continuing to deliver strong results for our shareholders, be outstanding partners with our oems to steward their great brands and offer an environment where our team members can thrive while providing the most guest-centric experience in automotive retail. dan?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
thank you, david, and good morning, everyone. first, thank you to all of our dedicated teammates who work so hard to fulfill our commitment to being the most guest-centric automotive retailer. this quarter was a busy one for asbury, as we continued to integrate acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2021, worked to close on our divestitures and developed a plan to expand clicklane to acquire stores and tca to legacy asbury stores. now, i'll turn to our same-store performance compared to the first quarter of 2021, unless stated otherwise.
starting with new vehicles. in the first quarter, new vehicle inventory remained well below normalized levels and consumer demand continued to outstrip supply. at the end of march, our total new vehicle inventory was $207 million, and our days' supply was at 10 days, down 24 days from the prior-year quarter. given this dynamic, our new vehicle volume declined 20% year over year.
however, we experienced a significant increase in our new average gross profit per vehicle, which increased $2,995 from the first quarter 2021 to a total of $5,750. we anticipate new inventory levels to remain low through 2022, and we are focused on maximizing profitability while also remaining steadfast in our commitment to our guests and our mission to be the most guest-centric automotive retailer. turning to used vehicles. our used vehicle retail volume increased 6%, which contributed to a 32% increase in used vehicle retail revenue.
used gross profit pvr increased by $209 to $2,228 compared to the first quarter of 2021, resulting in a 17% increase in used retail gross profit. our total used vehicle inventory ended the quarter at $378 million, which represents a 28-day supply, up one day from the prior year. our used to new ratio for the quarter was 114%. shifting to f&i.
our strong, consistent and sustainable growth in f&i delivered an increase of $634 to $2,376 per vehicle retailed from the prior-year quarter. i'd like to thank our f&i team for this tremendous result. in addition, in the first quarter, our total front-end yield per vehicle increased $2,096 per vehicle to a record of $6,253. moving to parts and service.
our parts and service revenue increased 14% in the quarter the warranty revenue, which is outside of our control, dropped 12%, our customer pay revenue continued its strong rebound, posting 17% growth, which is triple our normal growth. we achieved over 176,000 online service appointments, a 29% increase over the prior-year quarter. benefits of increasing online service appointments include enhancement to the customer experience, higher customer retention, higher conversion rates and higher dollars generated per repair order, which ultimately provides higher returns to our shareholders. we now have four full quarters with clicklane at all legacy stores, and we couldn't be more pleased at the results we're seeing.
we sold over 5,600 vehicles through clicklane in the first quarter, of which 38% of them were new vehicles and 62% were used. in fact, march was clicklane's best month ever. we believe sales of new vehicles were depressed due to a lack of inventory. 92% of our transactions this quarter were with customers that were incremental to asbury's dealership network.
average transaction time remained roughly in line with prior quarters, as we saw a half minute increase to 8.5 minutes for cash d and about a half minute decrease to 13.6 minutes for finance deals. in q1, clicklane deals had a front-end yield of $3,804 and an f&i per vehicle retail of $2,291, which equates to a $6,095 of total front-end yield. the average clicklane customer credit score continues to be over 700, which is higher than the average credit score at our stores. the average down payment for new vehicles was $8,921 and for used, was $6,869.
81% of consumers seeking financing received instant approval, while an additional 9% require some off-line assistance. 90% of those that applied were approved for financing. 43% of clicklane sales had trade-ins, with 62% of such trades reconditioned and retailed to consumers. and 95% of our clicklane deliveries are within a 50-mile radius of our stores, thus allowing us the opportunity to retain our new customers in our parts and service department.
clicklane customers are converting at nearly double the rate of traditional internet leads, but we won't see the full potential until inventory levels normalize. we are excited about the continued growth of clicklane and the opportunity to accelerate that growth as we roll it out to our newly acquired stores. i will now hand the call over to michael to discuss our financial performance. michael?
michael welch -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, dan. to our investors, analysts, team members and other participants on our call, good morning. i would like to provide some financial highlights, which marked another record quarter for our company. for additional details on our financial performance for the quarter, please see our financial supplement, our press release today and our investor presentation on our website.
as dan mentioned, the first quarter was a busy one, with a number of internal initiatives going on. overall, compared to the first quarter last year, we generated significant adjusted operating cash flow of $406 million, a year-over-year increase of $290 million, which combined with the proceeds from divested stores, allowed us to pay down $374 million of debt and our used vehicle floor plan line, and repurchased $200 million of our shares. adjusted net income increase 134% to $212 million, and adjusted eps increased 98% to $9.27. the net income for the first quarter of 2022 was adjusted for onetime pre-tax gains totaling $34 million or $1.11 per diluted share, primarily related to the sale of four dealerships in the quarter.
net income for the first quarter of 2021 was adjusted for onetime pre-tax gains of $4.6 million or $0.17 per diluted share, primarily related to gain on legal settlements, and pre-tax real estate-related charges of $1.8 million or $0.07 per diluted share. excluding real estate purchases, we spent approximately $21 million on capital expenditures in the first quarter. our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with approximately $805 million of liquidity, comprised of cash, excluding cash at total care auto, floor plan offset accounts, and availability on both our used line and revolving credit facility. also at the end of the quarter, our pro forma adjusted net leverage ratio stood at 2.2 times, down from 2.7 times at year-end.
as david stated, today we announced that our board has approved a new $200 million share repurchase authorization. for 2022, we are planning on capex of approximately $175 million. this amount excludes real estate related purchases and potential lease buyout opportunities that we consider to be financing transactions. one item that has a bit of a change is how we account for tca revenue and expenses, and we've included a breakdown of tca versus dealership operations in our earnings release.
this quarter was our first full quarter of tca. for the quarter, tca made $16 million of pre-tax income, which included $2.7 million of unrealized losses on equity investments. excluding the unrealized losses, tca would have made $19 million for the quarter. we are currently working on the system integration and state licensing requirements for the asbury rollout of tca and plan to start our pilots for rollout in 2q.
in closing, i would also like to thank all of our teammates throughout asbury, who dedicate themselves to building a brighter future for ourselves, our communities, our shareholders and all of our stakeholders. i will now hand the call back over to david to discuss the update to our strategic plan. david?
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, michael. as we mentioned on our last earnings call, today we are providing an update to our strategic plan which can be referenced on slides 12 through 25 of our investor presentation. the acquisitions we made in 2021 almost doubled our annual revenue. today, asbury automotive is a much larger, more productive and financially sound company with more opportunities to drive top-line growth.
one example, with tca, we are able to stay involved in the entire customer life cycle as well as now benefit from the claims side, which was never available to us before. regarding clicklane, given the metrics we spoke about earlier, we see a significant opportunity to leverage the high conversion rate as we roll out to the stores we acquired and provide a common digital platform. our original plan for revenue growth or revenues was to grow from $8 billion to $20 billion by 2025. because of the significant progress we made in 2021, on a pro forma basis, we are now just over $15 billion in revenue.
i will now simply refer to slide 24 and of the presentation deck. our new revenue goal is $32 billion by '25, representing an incremental $12 billion. the $12 billion is comprised of an additional same store growth of $2 billion, an additional $3 billion in clicklane revenue and $7 billion from acquisitions. in terms of earnings per share, we are targeting eps to be greater than $55 per share.
this assumes a one time leverage. if we were to increase our leverage to two times and use those proceeds to purchase additional stores or buy back our stock, our eps could exceed $72 per share. now, referring to slide #25. our free cash flow generated from our business of $3 billion and a modest increase to two times leverage for an incremental $3 billion, we would have over $6 billion in cash to deploy between 2022 to 2025.
so in closing, we believe that we have the right brands in the right states with the right people to execute our strategy to grow and improve our business. we are generating strong cash flow that will continue to lower our net leverage while allowing us the flexibility to balance acquiring additional assets and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases. finally, i would like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of my fellow asbury teammates. it is through your efforts that asbury continues to produce strong results for our shareholders while bringing us closer to our goal of being the most guest-centric automotive retailer.
thank you all very much. this concludes our prepared remarks. we will now turn the call over to the operator and take your questions. operator?
",2022-Q1,ABG
0.9999,,,,":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] the first question today comes from daniel imbro of stephens, inc.
dan imbro -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking the questions. i want to start on the parts and service side. i'm not sure dan or everyone address this, but you've shown continued strong growth, i'd be curious, what are the initiatives that you've implemented that have been driving this double-digit growth, maybe helping you guys gain share? and then curious for any update on the labor backdrop on the technician side? is there any alleviation on that? is the labor market loosened, or how is that developing?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
hey, daniel, good morning. this is dan. so on the growth in our fixed operations. for the last few years, we have been sharing with you our online initiative of making it convenient for the consumers to schedule their appointments online.
we -- last quarter, we saw a 38% increase year over year from consumers taking advantage of that. now you can have that availability all you want out there. but if you don't have the throughput in your shops to get the work in and out, it's almost irrelevant. so the good news is not only are we being convenient for our consumers to schedule online, but we also have the throughput in our stores, and we saw our technician headcount also increase year over year.
was there a second part of the question? oh, i think you asked me about the technicians. listen, it's -- the technician situation is still the same that it has been. i think that you can still hire and recruit technicians, but we're mainly focused not only in hire and recruiting them, but retaining them; a, most importantly; and b, is developing those from within. the moment that you can get an entry-level technician and move them up to a c-level technician, a b-level technician and ultimately, a master tech, you build a tremendous amount of loyalty, tremendous amount of knowledge.
and again, it helps to get that throughput through the shop.
dan imbro -- stephens inc. -- analyst
thank, dan. i wanted to ask a second one on clicklane. penetration is growing and i know the f&i pvr is a bit light of the company average. there were plenty of slides in the slide deck this morning kind of rolling out new functionality.
but i'm curious, do you think there's an opportunity to drive that f&i pvr higher on the clicklane platform and maybe even higher than the chain average? or what your consumer there is opting into that you can help drive that metric higher?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
yeah, i think that it all comes back down to what the guest wants and the convenience of being able to acquire or protect their investment the way that they choose. and what i mean by that is, let's face it, nobody likes to be sold something. with this new iteration of the f&i product, you can see if you look through the deck, that you have the ability to build a la carte for a lack of a better term, or you can also build or select from the different bundles. so we do believe that there is an increase in how consumers are going to protect their investments and excited to see what results we have, but we're excited to release in the second iteration of the f&i of clicklane.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
and i'll just add to that. i haven't paid attention if everyone discusses their f&i numbers on their transactional tools online. but from our perspective, over 2,100 car, really self-selecting by the consumer and no engagement whatsoever from an asbury employee, we think those numbers are pretty strong. that was our first version of the f&i products that we launched.
so technology has gotten better, the visualization to present the products is getting better. so we actually think there is room to improve on it, but we're really quite pleased with the self-selection for the consumer being over 2,000.
dan imbro -- stephens inc. -- analyst
are all of the same products available on a clicklane as in a dealership?
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we focus on the core products. some dealerships have unique circumstances within their markets and their brands where they might sell some additional products. we kind of stay focused on the national mainstay products on the platform.
dan imbro -- stephens inc. -- analyst
great. and last one for me. michael, just on the balance sheet, about two times net leverage here. where do you want to get that down to over the intermediate term before maybe looking at more m&a? and on the buyback, it looks like you bought back 1.1 million shares.
i think that exhausts the existing authorization. so where has that been to your capital priorities? thanks.
michael welch -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so on the share buybacks, that was all done in the first quarter. and so that's all just first quarter share buybacks and nothing in the second quarter. from a leverage perspective, we want to get down the kind of two times before we start looking at acquisitions again. and so we're at the level we want to be at in terms of leverage to be able to be acquisitive on the acquisition front.
so first priority is acquisitions. but of course, with the share price being a little volatile, there's some opportunities for some share buybacks as well.
dan imbro -- stephens inc. -- analyst
great. thanks for all the color. best of luck going forward guys.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
michael welch -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from rajat gupta of j.p.morgan.
rajat gupta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. ford, on their earnings call, made some interesting comments last night. they continue to see the dealers as key to their electric vehicle strategy, but also noted how the profile of the dealership margin structure might change.
they also made some comments around flow plan assistance, which is not new and talked about 1,600 to 1,700 pricing-related compression gpus over time. my sense is that putting these things together now and in the low inventory model, it implies that if all of the above were to actually happen, it would still put gpus comfortably above pre-pandemic levels and also lead to structurally lower sg&a. just curious if i'm missing anything there? if you could just provide your thoughts since investors should all be concerned about dealer bottom-line ebitda margins going back to prepandemic level? thanks, and i have a follow-up.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
rajat, this is david. i'll address it as best i can. without disclosing too many private conversations with our manufacturer partner, we feel really lucky and proud to represent the ford brand, and we're very optimistic about the future with them. i think some of it gets a little bit lost in context when i was talking about the margin, it's not as much of it going away as much as it might be being redistributed in other sections through the ownership piece of it and naturally performance on the guest experience.
i think we're in uncharted territories going forward into this ev market growing the way that it is and everyone coming to market with their products and we still need to find out if the average consumer has the propensity to buy electric vehicles right out of the gate. what i would say is we feel like what we've done with our omnichannel approach, what we've done with our digital tools and where we think the future is going, we think we're really well positioned to be a really good partner. we still feel the same going forward as it relates to sg&a. we think over the next few years we have an opportunity to bring it down over time.
but the age old supply and demand retaining margins. i would say this, i've said it in past quarters, so i'm going to stay consistent with it. even if inventories normalize and we get back to prepandemic inventory levels, you won't see us get back to pre-pandemic margins -- or i shouldn't say margins, gross profits per vehicles. i think we're a different company.
i think it's a different time and space right now. and i think you'll see elevated margins from pre-pandemic levels going forward even as the days supply grows.
rajat gupta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. got it. that's helpful. and maybe just to follow up on some of your comments in your prepared remarks around consumers still financially healthy.
maybe like if you could give us some more, like latest updates in terms of what you're seeing on the ground? any pockets of weakness anywhere in any region with respect to underlying demand in general? because it seems like you're reiterating your long-term targets, which assume $17 million saar environment. is that still your base case assumption based on how you see the macro unfolding here? thanks.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i'll start and then dan can jump in. if i miss something, please come back around. we see next year saar improving on this year. we certainly don't see it at $17 million.
maybe it's in the high 14s, low 15s next year. it's really too difficult to predict now. but i think our model implies, by the end of '24, '25, we're back to a $17 million saar. certainly, we can be wrong on that assumption, but that's what we believe as we sit here today.
did i miss another piece of that? i'm sorry.
rajat gupta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
no, that was -- just in general, like on the ground, what you're seeing today is there any pockets of weakness in terms of demand. i think you mentioned in prepared remarks that the financial conditions still remain pretty healthy for the consumer, but just curious if you have some sort of a read on like how the underlying demand is changing given just the recent inflation trends, gas prices, etc.? thanks.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
i would say parts and service remains strong. the traffic is still great. people are still spending the same dollars in greater dollars quarter over quarter in the service department. so i think that's great.
i think the new car business is solid, but it's really hard to understand how strong it is because you have such a low day supply. generally speaking, we're still preselling half the cars that are coming in. so a lot of these cars aren't getting to hit the ground. it varies a little bit by brand.
but generally, that's where it is overall. i would say the used car market is softening from what it was in the last six months, but greater than it's been in the last few years, it's been bouncing around a little bit the last six to eight weeks as it relates to valuations. and what i would say people were impulsively buying six months ago, they're probably putting a little bit more thought and care into the selection and the pricing right now. so i think we're still trying to find the footing on what the valuations are going to be for the rest of the year.
it's still healthy, it's still strong on the used business. but of all the segments, i would say that's the one where it's trying to find its footing to move forward.
rajat gupta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
understood. make sense. thanks a lot.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] the next question today comes from dave whiston of morningstar.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
thanks, good morning. you talked about 90% of clicklane customers who want a loan can get one. just curious about that 10% that gets rejected. is that purely a credit score issue or are there other variables?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
so it's a combination. you got a -- you have some negative equity concerns or opportunities. so in some cases it might be a credit score. but keep in mind, i stated in the script that the average credit score on clicklane is 700, which is higher than what our stores is.
so we're traditionally and the vast majority of the credit that we see coming through clicklane is a very good credit customer, which allows us to offer the 90% approval rating that i mentioned.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
and dave, just to follow up on that. our previous tool is what we referred to as a super lead generator. it took the sale to a certain point, but you couldn't fully transact online. we saw a lot more so prime in lower credit scores on that tool.
with this fully transactional tool, we've been impressed with the much higher credit scores and the consistency of it. and our belief is because the consumer now understands it's a fully transactional tool, customers with strong credit aren't worried about the financing. they're worried about their time. so that's why we think we're seeing better credit.
but traditionally, digital tools are not, you never get 100% of the people finance. there's always unique circumstances that there are some people you just can't help out. but we have also launched some lenders into our loan marketplace that are considered subprime lenders. so we think 90% is really strong.
we think an average credit score over 700 is great, but there's always room for improvement.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
ok. and on the f&i 2.0 bundle, i looked at the slides, i guess i'm not totally clear. can you still do a la carte if you want to? or is that not even an option? and i guess a subset of that is you've got these bundle packages, but can you customize within one package and say, well, of these five things offered i only want three of them?
dan imbro -- stephens inc. -- analyst
yeah, this is dan again. absolutely. keep in mind, from day 1 when we build this -- when we built clicklane, we did it all based on what is in the best for the consumer. so 100%, you can go in there and you're going to be able to build a la carte.
you can -- when you have a bundle, if you want to delete a product or build it the way that you want it, by all means you can definitely do it. all we're doing is just providing some options. but at the end of the day, the consumer can decide what her she wants from the comfort of their home or their office.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
ok. and just a q3 event, how bad is the st. louis flooding for your stores?
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we -- it's -- we've been lucky. it hasn't caused any physical damage. it's horrible what's going on in the city and certainly people have been harmed.
but our physical locations are fine.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
ok. thanks, guys.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from ryan sigdahl of craig-hallum capital group.
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
good morning. i just want to follow up on the f&i interface change. and so it looks like f&i was down quarter over quarter versus q1. i guess can you talk to that decrease? and then if the interface change had anything to do with that?
michael welch -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
i think when you say f&i was down, you're specifically talking about clicklane f&i?
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
that is correct. it was $21.66 versus $22.91.
michael welch -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. yes, just want to make sure. so the second iteration of f&i is being rolled out as we speak. so it's going to start being -- consumers taking advantage of it, i believe, in a couple of weeks, if i'm not mistaken.
so the second iteration did not have any negative impact on that number at all.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
the other thing i would mention, with the light inventories, generally speaking our f&i dollars are higher on new vehicles than used vehicles, both in product sales and reserve because the cost of the vehicle is higher. so depending upon the balance and what you're selling, the f&i number moves around a little bit. more domestic trucks are going to have higher pvrs than lower import cars. so i think it's really just about what transacts on that line.
i think it will always move around a little bit depending upon the spread of the brand mix and how much of it is newly used. but again -- and i don't know if our peers are quoting any numbers, but to be over 2,100 a car in f&i with the consumer self-selecting compared to 2,400 with us selling the product face-to-face, we think that's really strong.
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
yes. then just one on new vehicles. so unit same-store sales down 31%, obviously challenged inventory situation across everyone. but any idea how you're doing relative to competitors in your specific markets, stock and market share?
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so it's frustrating because you have to look at each brand and each market differently. i mean some of our stores at the end of the month have a zero day supplier cars, and they're still losing a little bit of market share because someone might have a few more vehicles than to sell or timing of when cars get reported. we're selling everything we have.
we got hit hardest on the import. it just is what it is in the quarter as far as deliveries and what's going on with the chip shortage. we got really hard to get hit hard with the domestic trucks as well. so it's really spotty by brand.
but based upon our brand mix, i think the reality of it is that really low number is simply a reflection of what we were allocated. we're turning what we're getting. that 13 day supply, i would tell you was high because we had so many cars delivered at the end of the quarter. we just couldn't report and transact in time to close to account the revenue for the quarter.
so i would say we were several days below that number in actuality.
ryan sigdahl -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
great. thanks. good luck.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question is from bret jordan of jefferies.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
hey, good morning.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
if you look at the correlation of f&i to pvr, are customers spending more because the transaction value is higher or if transaction values decline with supply rebound, would they have more available sort of from a monthly spend standpoint.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i would say -- and i think dan touched on it earlier. we love to buy things. we hate to be sold things. and i think when we're buying new vehicles with all the new technology, people want to make sure that their asset is protected as best as possible.
so they're really searching out for products to make sure that they do that. the used car customer varies slightly, depending upon if it's a used car customer buying a $50,000 preowned luxury car or a $15,000 car. those folks tend to be slightly more conservative, slightly less focused on enhancing the security of the vehicle and buying products. that's been fairly consistent for the last couple of decades regardless of it's an online transaction or an in-store transaction.
i would say, generally speaking, every year the cost of sale keeps going up. i would think based upon that ebb and flow, you'll continue to see f&i numbers grow, not at the staggering rate that we're at now, but i think you'll see it continually grow.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
and a question on used. i guess, obviously, it's been a challenging market to be profitable just given the cost of inventory. are you seeing much change in the market, either contraction of the independent used only dealers or even some of the bigger used only dealers that have entered. do you see this environment sort of driving any attrition? or does everybody sort of get through this in one piece?
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i don't know how much awareness i have to the full market to answer that. but my impression is the independent dealers have a much harder road than the franchise dealer as far as securing inventory to sell. i think they're feeling far more squeezed than we are. and we have the benefit of offering cpo programs and dan talked about all the different sourcing that we have for used vehicles.
again, i think our numbers were pretty good in the quarter. i think we're -- it wasn't about chasing volume as much as it was making sure that we're getting a good return. we look at a used car. if it's a cost of sale of $20,000, we're making a $20,000 investment, what's a fair return on that.
and during the quarter, we had some movement in valuations from the markets shift and go up and down. so that affected our pvr in the quarter as well. so there's always more opportunity to grow. there's always more opportunity for more volume.
but we see, going forward, the used car business should get better for us over time. and when i say that, i don't necessarily mean in q3 or q4. but as you start to get into next year and products become more available and rental car company fleets have to turn cars over, there'll be more access to inventory for us to move.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you. this concludes today's discussion. i'm sorry, go ahead.
operator
no, please go ahead.
david hult -- president and chief executive officer

operator
good day, and welcome to the asbury automotive group's second quarter 2022 earnings call. today's conference is being recorded. at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to karen reid. please go ahead.
karen reid -- vice president of corporate financial planning & analysis and treasurer
thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. as kevin noted, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay later this afternoon. welcome to asbury automotive group's second quarter 2022 earnings call. the press release detailing asbury's second quarter results was issued earlier this morning and is posted on our website at asburyauto.com.
participating with me today are david hult, our president and chief executive officer; dan clara, our senior vice president of operations; and michael welch, our senior vice president and chief financial officer. at the conclusion of our remarks, we will open up the call for questions and will be available later for any follow-up questions. before we begin, we must remind you that the discussion during the call today is likely to contain forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements are statements other than those which are historical in nature, which may include financial projections, forecasts and current expectations, each of which are subject to significant uncertainties.
for information regarding certain of the risks that may cause actual results to differ materially from these statements, please see our filings with the sec from time to time, including our form 10-k for the year ended december 2021, any subsequently filed quarterly reports on form 10-q and our earnings release issued earlier today. we expressly disclaim any responsibility to update forward-looking statements. in addition, certain non-gaap financial measures as defined under sec rules may be discussed on this call. as required by applicable sec rules, we provide reconciliations to any such non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures on our website.
we have also posted an updated investor presentation on our website, asburyauto.com, highlighting our second quarter results. it is now my pleasure to hand the call over to our ceo, david hult. david? 
david hult -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, karen, and good morning, everyone. welcome to our second quarter earnings call. we continue to make strong progress toward our 2025 plan. for the quarter, we grew adjusted ebitda by $126 million to $352 million and adjusted eps from $7.78 to $10.04, an increase of 29%, delivered an 8.5% adjusted operating margin increased revenue by $1.4 billion to $4 billion and increased gross profit by $305 million to $803 million, and drove f&i gross profit per vehicle to $2,390, up $563.
during the second quarter, we executed on our plan of continuing to integrate our acquisitions and reducing our net leverage. in addition, the systems integration for the rollout of clicklane and total care auto was completed. combining our fully transactional tool with tca requires significant work to integrate systematically across all platforms. we will start rolling out clicklane to our acquired dealerships and tca into the legacy asbury stores during this quarter.
in the second quarter, we sold almost 6,600 units through clicklane, growing 17% from the first quarter of 2022 and 55% year over year. clicklane is currently installed at 88 of our 155 dealerships and is on pace to provide approximately $1 billion of revenue in 2022. currently, our unit sales are governed by the lack of new vehicle inventory and our advertising campaign has been on hold until inventory levels improve. once completely rolled out to all 155 stores, we'll be on pace for $2.2 billion in revenue through clicklane by the end of 2023.
tca provides us the opportunity to expand our business horizontally into our f&i business. tca generated $36 million of income year to date on the lhm stores, excluding unrealized losses on investment. once completely rolled out to all 155 stores and with future acquisitions, we expect ebitda from this unique asset to hit $185 million by 2025. we continue to experience solid demand across all of our revenue streams, but we do not anticipate a meaningful recovery in new inventory levels in 2022.
year to date, we have generated $544 million of adjusted operating cash flow. net leverage decreased from 2.7 times at year-end to 2.1 times at the end of the second quarter. our strong cash flow and reduced leverage will allow us to shift our focus to strategic acquisitions and share buybacks. with consumers financially healthy, consumer financing readily available, the car park age to record levels and sizable pent-up demand, combined with our technology to improve efficiency and productivity, we are well positioned to weather the current market conditions.
we look forward to continuing to deliver strong results for our shareholders, be outstanding partners with our oems to steward their great brands and offer an environment where our team members can thrive, while providing the most guest-centric experience in automotive retail. we have the right brands in the right states with the right people to execute our strategy to grow and improve our business. finally, i would like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of all my fellow asbury teammates. it is through your efforts that we continue to produce strong results for our shareholders and be the most guest-centric automotive retailer to serve our guests.
thank you. i will now hand the call over to dan to discuss our operating performance. dan?
dan clara -- senior vice president of operations
thank you, david, and good morning, everyone. first, thank you to all of our dedicated teammates who worked so hard to fulfill our commitment to being the most guest-centric automotive retailer. now, i'll turn to our same-store performance compared to the second quarter of 2021, unless stated otherwise. starting with new vehicles.
in the second quarter, new vehicle inventory continued to remain well below normalized levels and consumer demand continued to outstrip supply. at the end of june, our total new vehicle inventory was $238 million, and our day supply was at 13 days, down four days from the prior-year quarter. due to supply constraints, our new vehicle volume declined 31% year over year. however, we experienced a significant increase in our new average gross profit per vehicle, which increased $1,913 from the prior-year quarter to $5,793.
we anticipate new inventory levels to remain low through 2022, and we are focused on maximizing profitability while also remaining steadfast in our commitment to our guests and our mission to be the most guest-centric automotive retailer. turning to used vehicles. we had a 12% increase in used retail revenue even with a 2% decrease in our used retail volume. used gross profit pvr was $2,213.
our total used vehicle inventory ended the quarter at $425 million, which represents a 34-day supply, down three days from the prior year. one of the many benefits of the franchise model is the different venues to source vehicles such as lease turning, trades, loaner cars and direct purchase from consumers, including our recently launched clicklane cellular car tool. 90% of our used inventory comes from the sources i just mentioned. our used to new ratio for the quarter was 120%, up from 84% in the prior-year quarter, representing 98 used vehicle sales per rooftop.
shifting to f&i. we delivered a strong quarter in f&i with an f&i pvr of $2,409, an increase of $579 compared to the prior-year quarter. thank you to all of our f&i team members for these tremendous results. in the second quarter, our total front-end yield per vehicle increased $1,061 per vehicle to a total of $6,250.
moving to parts and service. our parts and service revenue increased 10% in the quarter. the warranty revenue, which is outside of our control, were up 19%. our customer pay revenue continued its strong rebound, posting 15% growth.
jumping to clicklane. clicklane continues to exceed our expectations in conversion rates, transaction times, new used pvr, f&i pvr and most importantly, the guest experience. we sold almost 6,600 vehicles through clicklane in the second quarter, a 17% increase from the first quarter 2022. in fact, in the second quarter, it was clicklane's best quarter ever with june posting the most clicklane sales since its inception.
in addition, our marketing team continues to drive traffic through their relentless efforts in seo. as a reminder, seo is all content built internally and does not require paid search. we experienced a 16% increase in unique visitors year over year to our websites who want to take advantage of the only ecosystem that allows them to purchase a new used or cpo vehicle fully online. though sales of new vehicles continue to be restrained due to a lack of inventory, we achieved a 55% increase in clicklane sales year over year.
92% of our transactions this quarter were with customers that were incremental to asbury dealership network. average transaction time remained roughly in line with prior quarters, eight minutes for cash deals and 14 minutes for finance deals. total front-end pvr of $3,765 and f&i pvr of $2,162, which equates to $5,927 of total front-end yield. the average clicklane customer credit score continues to be over 700, which is higher than the average credit score at our stores.
the average down payment for vehicles was $8,871. 80% of consumers seeking financing received instant approval, while an additional 10% requires some off-line assistance. 90% of those that applied were approved for financing. 44% of clicklane sales had trade-ins, with 62% of such trades reconditioned and retail to consumers.
and 95% of our clicklane deliveries are within a 50-mile radius of our stores, thus allowing us the opportunity to retain our new customers in our parts and service departments. clicklane customers are converting at nearly double the rate of traditional internet leads, but we won't see the full potential until inventory levels normalize. we are excited to announce clicklane's second iteration of f&i products. please reference our investor presentation, starting on page 19 for related details and visuals.
we have revamped the user experience to include a guided and hybrid approach that allows the consumer to purchase in a manner that is convenient for them. in addition, we are fully integrating tca and e-contracting in the mix. as we roll out clicklane to our recently acquired stores, we expect sales to increase, generating approximately $2.2 billion in revenue by the end of 2023. i will now hand the call over to michael to discuss our financial performance.
