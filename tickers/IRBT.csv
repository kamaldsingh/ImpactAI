at this point, i'll turn the call over to colin angle.
colin angle -- founder, chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, and thank you for joining us. we closed out 2020 on a very strong note with revenue, operating income and eps that surpassed the expectations we shared at the end of october. strong demand combined with outstanding collaboration and execution among our sales, marketing and operations team, and our broader supply chain underpinned an excellent revenue performance. more specifically, fourth-quarter revenue of $545 million grew 28% year-over-year with significant growth in all major regions worldwide. our top-line expansion resulted in an operating income margin of 6% and eps of $0.84.
for the full year, we reported revenue of $1.43 billion, an operating profit margin of 10% and eps of $4.14, all of which surpassed our original targets at the start of 2020. just as important, we believe that the steps we took during 2020 are putting irobot on a very exciting path to drive substantial value creation over the coming years.
with that in mind, i'd like to briefly review the notable progress we've made to execute on our strategy, which at a high level is focused on increasing the customer's engagement with our products, thereby creating a broader range of opportunities for our customers to transact directly with us.
the first component of our strategy is focused on differentiating the cleaning experience and we are proud of our 2020 accomplishments in this area. the pandemic forced us to make tough choices about where and how we would invest, and we prioritized investment in software across our ai, home understanding and machine vision technologies to ensure that roomba and braava robots can be tightly integrated into the customer's lifestyle and deliver unprecedented levels of thoughtfulness, reliability, control and support. these investments are already resulting in new features and capabilities that are delighting customers.
in august, we introduced version 1.0 of our state-of-the-art robot ai platform, irobot genius home intelligence. genius is extensible across our entire portfolio of wifi-connected robots, unlocking a range of new features and functionality that gives users greater control over where, when and how our robots clean.
we expanded our lineup of intelligent, self-emptying robot vacuum cleaners in september of 2020 when we launched the roomba i3 series in the us. we've been very pleased with customer demand for this product, which was introduced in emea last month. during the fourth quarter, we introduced the roomba combo, our first 2-in-1 floor cleaning robot that consolidates vacuuming and mopping functionality. the product is now available in certain markets in europe where this capability appeals to value-seeking customers looking for a convenient solution to help with their everyday floor care needs.
as we move into 2021, our innovation engine shows no sign of slowing. we expect to introduce two new roomba robots this year along with a wide range of exciting new digital features through upgraded versions of our genius platform. we also took steps to aggressively defend our ip as we recently filed a new patent infringement action against sharkninja. our success in differentiating the cleaning experience has enabled us to expand our premium robot sales over the past several years. revenue for premium robots grew by nearly 50% in 2020 and represented 60% of total robot sales while our average gross selling price has continued to trend upward.
just as notable, in a year when overall adoption of robotic vacuum cleaners accelerated, we maintained our global leadership position in the rvc category. for the full year, we finished with eight of the top 10 best-selling rvcs in the us, six of the top 10 in emea and seven of the top 10 in japan. the second element of our risk strategy is focused on building stronger, more enduring relationships with the consumer. we ended 2020 with nearly 10 million connected customers who have opted-in to our digital communications, up more than 80% over 2019.
having a substantial portion of our connected customer base elect to receive in-app notifications and emails speaks volumes about the tangible value provided by our floor cleaning robots. the ever-expanding range of digital features within our genius platform is helping to ensure that customers get great value from our products. for example, we are seeing consistently high levels of utilization by our connected customers each month and robust engagement around new capabilities like directed room cleaning and creating a favorite cleaning routine.
the third strategic pillar is oriented around nurturing the lifetime value of our customer relationships by accelerating the replacement cycle, promoting upsell and cross-sale deals and adding new purchasing options that will ultimately lead to recurring revenue and higher margins. we believe that executing on this strategy will support greater revenue predictability and growth, and improve our profitability.
while it is still early days, we made considerable progress in this area over the past several quarters. we have continued to invest in making our website a desired destination for current and prospective customers. for example, during the fourth quarter, we enjoyed strong sales of an exclusive roomba-braava bundle, added a financing option for our european customers, successfully scaled to support the busiest online shopping days of the holiday season and gained valuable experience in moving with agility and creativity to increase traffic and drive conversion.
as a result, our direct-to-consumer sales more than doubled in the fourth quarter and generated 11% of total 2020 revenue, up from just 6% in 2019. we view our direct-to-consumer channel as a powerful complement to our strong retail partners. we expect that this higher-margin channel will grow to at least 15% of total revenue in 2021 and are optimistic that dtc revenue will exceed 20% of our total revenue by the end of 2023, even as we continue to enjoy growth with our retail partners. as we move forward, we believe that there are a number of attractive opportunities to increase existing customer revenue and amplify the benefits of growing our connected customer base.
during the fourth quarter, we began conducting tests of new services that span extended warranties, a robot-as-a-service membership program, and a premium care and maintenance offering. the results thus far have been promising and we are optimistic that we will begin commercializing these services over the course of 2021. we plan to test other offerings in 2021 that can further increase existing customer revenue and contribute to building a high-margin, recurring revenue stream.
to effectively and efficiently grow existing customer revenue, we plan to accelerate investments that further enhance the buying experience on our digital properties and upgrade our digital marketing capabilities. we have selected our implementation partner and will continue to onboard the marketing and it talent necessary to maximize the power of these tools and platforms.
as we've discussed previously, we believe that these investments are critical for driving traffic, improving conversion rates and increasing transactional velocity. we also believe that these instruments, in combination with our trusted position inside the consumer's home, will enable us to further expand existing customer revenue opportunities.
while 2020 sell-through of rvcs accelerated well above prior year levels, overall household penetration remains relatively low. we believe that the fluid, often frenetic pace of day-to-day life continues to elevate our value proposition and product differentiation. as the benefits of robotic floor care become more widely appreciated and the home remains a central hub for everyday life, we plan to continue capitalizing on the many opportunities arising from the continued growth of our marketplace.
in terms of our 2021 outlook, as outlined in the press release, we anticipate 2021 revenue growth ranging from 14% to 17%. we expect strong revenue growth to start the year, especially since we ended 2020 with retail inventory in a very healthy position. we believe that our success in continuing to drive solid top-line expansion in 2021 will also help us fund investments into key areas of our business and mitigate the impact of higher anticipated incremental costs on our 2021 profitability.
more specifically, we expect that the reinstatement of tariffs will add approximately $41 million to $43 million in incremental costs, while we also absorb higher initial costs as we expand production in malaysia. additionally, our sales and marketing spend will increase by an incremental $20 million plus as we build out our direct-to-consumer infrastructure and bring on the additional headcount needed to operate it. as a result, we are targeting an operating profit margin of approximately 7% with eps in the range of $3.00 to $3.25.
looking ahead, we are increasingly optimistic about our longer-term prospects. we believe that our 2020 progress, combined with executing on our plans in 2021, will set the stage for substantially stronger performance in 2022. we expect that the progress we make in 2021 to execute on our plans will enable us to move into 2022 with a more defensible business that is well positioned to sustain mid to high teens top-line growth. at the same time, we believe that the gross margins headwinds of 2021 will turn into tailwinds in 2022 as we achieve scale in malaysia, minimize our tariff exposure, continue growing higher-margin d2c sales, and increase fulfillment and supply chain efficiency.
as we calibrate our spending to drive further operating leverage, we expect to drive 2022 operating profit margin above 2020 levels, which would in turn yield a substantially stronger eps performance.
at this point, i'll turn the call over to julie. after her remarks, i will return to offer some additional closing thoughts. julie?
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, colin.
as andy mentioned earlier, my review of our financial results and outlook will be done on a non-gaap basis, so unless stated otherwise, each mention of gross margin, operating expense, operating income and operating profit margin, effective tax rate and net income per share will mean the corresponding non-gaap metric. all quarterly comparisons are against the fourth quarter of 2019 and all full-year comparisons are against 2019 unless otherwise noted. we delivered a very strong quarterly performance that again exceeded our plans.
total q4 revenue grew 28% to $545 million due to the stronger-than-expected orders from retailers and outstanding growth in our direct-to-consumer sales. geographically, revenue grew 28% in the us with international revenue up 27% due primarily to 39% growth in japan and a 26% increase in emea. from a product mix perspective, roomba represented 89% of our q4 revenue mix with braava making up the remainder. braava revenue grew by 56% due to robust growth in the m6. roomba braava bundles performed exceptionally well over the holidays.
our gross margin of 40.3% in q4 was essentially unchanged with the prior year. the lack of tariff expense and, to a lesser extent, favorable channel mix was primarily offset by changes in pricing and promotion, and higher warranty expense.
fourth-quarter 2020 operating expenses of $189 million increased by 30% and represented 35% of revenue. the increase primarily reflects higher working media spending and d2c investments, as well as higher personnel costs tied to headcount and short-term incentive compensation. our q4 operating income was $30 million, or 6% of revenue. our q4 2020 effective tax rate was 19%, which was in line with our plans. our net income per share was $0.84.
from a full-year perspective, 2020 revenue grew 18% to $1.43 billion. geographically, we generated 52% of our revenue in the us, which grew by 23%. outside of the us, international revenue grew by 12% with japan having another stellar year of 20% growth while emea increased by 8%. 2020 gross margin of 44.5% was slightly lower than the prior year as the impact of price reductions, promotional activity and higher warranty expense was mostly offset by the benefit of our tariff exclusion, leverage from higher revenue and favorable channel mix shifts.
full-year operating expenses of $488 million grew by 13% driven primarily by the same factors influencing the increase in fourth-quarter spending, namely increased personnel costs, working media and investment in key programs and projects including our d2c initiatives. operating income of 2020 -- in 2020 was $150 million and our operating margin was 10%. our full year 2020 effective tax rate was 19%, essentially unchanged from the prior year. 2020 eps was $4.14 versus $3.62 in 2019. we ended 2020 with $484 million in cash and short-term investments, an increase of $126 million from the end of september. the increase primarily reflects a good quarter of cash flow from operations.
fourth-quarter dsos were 31 days, unchanged against the same period one year ago. q4 ending inventory was $182 million, or 55 days, compared with $157 million, or 56 days, at the same time last year.
let's turn to our outlook for 2021. although visibility is less than optimal, we move into 2021 with good momentum in the category and generally favorable channel inventory positions. at the same time, the global macroeconomic landscape remains uncertain due in large part to the fluidity of the pandemic.
as colin noted, we anticipate 2021 revenue in the range of $1.635 billion to $1.675 billion, which equates to 14% to 17% growth over 2020. in recent years, approximately 60% of our revenue is generated in the second half of the year, although 67% of 2020 revenue came in the second half. we expect our 2021 revenue mix between the first and second halves to move a bit closer to historical norms. with that said, we manage the business on a full-year basis and encourage investors to focus on our annual
targets since the timing of orders is challenging to forecast even under ideal conditions and large orders that shift from one quarter to the next can cause material fluctuations in our quarterly growth rates.
as a reminder, our revenue expectations contemplate yen and euro exchange rates roughly in line with current rates, plus or minus 5%. we anticipate that our 2021 gross margin will decline to the low 40% range. as you know, a 25% tariff on roombas imported from china was reinstated at the start of 2021 and we anticipate that this will add between $41 million to $43 million in incremental full year costs. in addition to anticipated tariff expense, we expect that our 2021 gross margin will also be impacted to a lesser extent by higher initial costs associated with our malaysia manufacturing along with recent and anticipated pricing and promotional activity. we believe those factors will be partially offset by favorable channel mix shifts and certain one-time items in 2020 that are not expected to recur in 2021.
our plan is to substantially increase our production in malaysia over the course of this year. to facilitate this, we plan to qualify additional contract manufacturers and add new lines. by the end of 2021, we estimate that malaysia manufacturing will have sufficient capacity in place to support the vast majority of our 2022 north american volume requirements. this will provide three important benefits. first, it will substantially reduce our tariff expense in 2022. second, it will enable us to bring our malaysian cost structure much closer to parity with china. third, managing a geographically diverse manufacturing footprint at scale is simply prudent from a risk management perspective.
our current gross margins assumptions also reflect current travel restrictions into and within malaysia. should those restrictions tighten further, it may require us to shift more volume into china and incur additional tariff expense. in addition to our malaysia manufacturing initiative, our operations teams continue to diligently grapple with a range of other supply chain challenges from rising freight and raw material costs to tighter availability of key components. our outlook takes these variables into account although any substantial improvement or deterioration in the supply chain may require us to revisit these assumptions.
we are targeting 2021 operating costs in the range of $555 million to $575 million, or approximately 34% of sales. while we anticipate that g&a and r&d will trend a bit below historical levels as a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing is currently expected to be around 19% of total revenue. this primarily reflects incremental spending of over $20 million to support continued growth of our direct-to-consumer channel, as well as higher working media investment. given our top-line guidance and spending plans, we currently expect an operating profit margin of approximately 7%.
in terms of some additional q1 color, we expect a strong start to the year with q1 revenue growth of 35% or more. we currently expect q1 gross margin in line with our annual target with q1 tariff costs in the ballpark of $3 million. we expect operating costs to range from the high 30%'s to 40% of total sales driven largely by the accelerated sales and marketing investment. as a result, we expect operating profitability to range from essentially breakeven at the low end up to a 3% operating profit at the high end. as revenue grows over the course the year, we expect our profitability will improve especially in the second half of the year.
in terms of other notable modeling assumptions for 2021, we anticipate other expense between $3 million to $4 million and an effective tax rate ranging from 18% to 19% due primarily to the jurisdictional mix of profits combined with the effect of lower anticipated worldwide pre-tax income. we anticipate a diluted share count of approximately 29 million shares. as a result, we expect our full-year eps to range from $3.00 to $3.25.
in terms of other 2021 guideposts, our business continues to be minimally capital intensive. overall, we expect that capital spending is expected to be in the low $50 million range, or approximately 3% of anticipated 2021 revenue, which is generally consistent with historical trends. the increase over 2020 levels reflects in part the shifting of certain investments in new tooling to increase production in malaysia from last year into this year, as well as spending to support new product introductions. we anticipate that our cash flow from operations in 2021 will remain healthy even as it declines from 2020 levels given our expected fundamental performance.
we move forward with good fiscal flexibility as it relates to use of capital. our previously authorized $200 million stock repurchase plan remains largely intact as last year's buybacks were limited to repurchasing $25 million of our stock in the first quarter. we will continue to evaluate the merits of deploying cash to repurchase stock, particularly as it relates to neutralizing the dilutive effect of our equity programs. with that said, our 2021 expectations do not assume any repurchase activity.
on the inventory front, we expect that inventory, both in terms of absolute dollars and dii, will increase in the first quarter and remain elevated thereafter until they return to normalized levels at the end of the year. while our profitability and eps are expected to take a step back in 2021, we believe that we are taking the necessary actions to sustain our top-line growth rate in 2022. just as important, we believe that the tailwinds arising from our malaysia manufacturing, higher-margin direct sales growth and other initiatives to increase efficiency and productivity will enable us to deliver a meaningful improvement in our 2022 operating income with an operating profit margin above 2020 levels, all of which will underpin strong eps expansion in 2022.
in summary, our fourth-quarter results were a very satisfying way to end the year. while we know 2021 will bring its fair share of challenges, we are incredibly excited about our prospects to continue expanding our business and drive long-term value creation in the process. that concludes my commentary. i'll now turn the call back to colin for some additional color on the coming year.
colin angle -- founder, chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, julie. i'd like to close by extending my sincere thanks to my colleagues around the globe. the hard work, resilience and commitment of our team helped irobot to deliver record results and exceed the ambitious targets we set for ourselves. it is an exciting time to be at irobot. we created the rvc industry 18 years ago and have led it ever since. but we believe our best days are ahead of us. we have an expansive, growing installed base of nearly 10 million connected customers who want to engage with us.
we're optimistic that the trust that our customers have placed in our products will unlock more opportunity for us going forward, especially as they look directly to us to help them maintain their robots, replace their robots, add new robots and potentially purchase other new services and products from us that complement our current role in helping them keep their homes clean.
on today's call, we've shared not only our outlook for 2021 but the opportunity to convert strong growth into higher profitability and faster eps and free cash flow expansion in 2022. as our businesses grows and evolves, and as our relationship with the consumer deepens, we will remain committed to helping current and prospective analysts and investors better appreciate the opportunities we see, the strategies and initiatives that will help us capitalize on them and the metrics and kpis that will best reflect our success and create value for our business.
that concludes our comments. operator, we will take questions now.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of mark strouse with jpmorgan. your line is now open.
mark strouse -- jp morgan -- analyst
yeah, good morning. thank you very much for taking our questions and congrats on the strong quarter here. i just wanted to dig into the commentary about 2022, maybe reading maybe too much in between the lines here, but kind of what you're saying about the second half of 2021. i'm calculating kind of high single digits to maybe low-double digits revenue growth. can you just give a bit more color into what gives you that expectation that the revenue can accelerate in 2022?
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, mark. i'll start that. as we think about 2021 and our guide for the full year and again, i would point everybody to the fact that we -- we talk about full year growth targets because of how shifts in seasonality of our business can materially impact quarterly growth rates. so we are looking at 2021 as being a very good year of projected growth. and we look forward beyond that into 2022 with the momentum that we see in the market, recognizing that we are still very largely under-penetrated and believe that we have and look forward to continued strong growth in 2022.
colin angle -- founder, chairman and chief executive officer
i'll add some color to that, mark, some of the things that we talked about what was a test in 2020, things like robots-as-a-service, things like the other forms of existing customer revenue and warranty and initial efforts to scale d2c become scaling commercial commitments from the company, but still relatively immaterial in '21, growing more significant materiality as we move into '22. and so you've got a number not just profitability tailwind but you have some revenue growth driving tailwinds that will be accelerating as well.
and so that investments in 2021 leading to growth in '22 is what we're seeing. certainly q1 in 2020 was a weak quarter for us for a number of reasons, and so that the strong performance, we're giving guidance on relative to q1 2021 is against a -- what i would say a pretty easy comp.
mark strouse -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. thank you. and then just looking at the gross margins for 2021 guidance a bit better than what i was expecting, you've quantified the impact from tariffs, julie. the delta is roughly 100 basis points, 125 basis points, something like that. can you kind of dissect that -- the remainder of the year-over-year decline from 2020? is that for example ramp costs associated with malaysia? is it more promotions? just anything you can do to kind of break that down a bit further would be very helpful. thank you.
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, sure. and you're right, tariffs are material part of our move of gross margin from '20 to '21. there are a number of other factors that play both positively and negatively to a lesser extent. so that on the -- on the negative side, there is the scaling of malaysia as we go through the year, as well as expected or anticipated pricing and promotional activity. those things are offset to a certain extent by favorable channel mix shifts as well as non-recurring costs from 2020.
mark strouse -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay, very helpful. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of ben rose with battle road research. your line is now open.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
yes, good morning everybody. a question first for julie, you had alluded to, excuse me, some of the potential supply chain constraints that are out there. could you maybe give us -- could you perhaps elaborate a bit on what you're seeing in terms of the health of your supply chain and your confidence in their ability to de-lever throughout the year.
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. so we are incredibly proud of our supply chain and the work that they've been able to do throughout 2020 to manage through a very changing situation. as we look forward, there are a number of factors, whether we're talking about rising freight costs, i think, globally, there are things like a chip shortage, as well as cost of resins and other raw materials that we look to as things that we are managing carefully as we go through this year.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
okay. and a question for, colin. if you could share with us your vision longer term for the -- for the roomba specifically as you look out over the next couple of years. do you think the primary focus will continue to be on home cleaning exclusively or perhaps could we see some additional functionalities built into the roomba as we see it today.
colin angle -- founder, chairman and chief executive officer
certainly, the company's ambition expand -- extends beyond floorcare and the role that the roomba plays today in the home while limited to right now vacuuming and then mopping with the braava is also serving as a platform for us to gain the type of home understanding necessary to increase the sophistication of what we're able to do in the home.
as we've talked before, growth in ai is important growth in the awareness of what is going on in the home. so that ai can have the context required to succeed is really at the cutting edge of technology and so we are on a long journey to build the robots that we were promised growing up as kids. i think we're at a very exciting place where we're starting to be able to understand the context to extend what we're capable of doing. and the irobot genius home intelligence really is a very ambitious long-term commitment to building a home ai capable of doing very sophisticated work in the home.
so it's a, we're just still at the beginning of the industry. we're still at the beginning of what the smart home will evolve into and irobot is very excited about the role we will play in the home in both delivering physical work but also delivering the context required to have a home that understands the type of things, you want to have happen enabling your home, not just your robot to be a strong partner as you address the challenges of the increasingly complex role the home is being asked to play.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
okay, thanks very much. it's very helpful.
colin angle -- founder, chairman and chief executive officer
you're welcome.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of asiya merchant with citigroup. your line is now open.
asiya merchant -- citigroup -- analyst
great, thank you very much and very, very strong results and congratulations to the team for weathering all the challenges that came with the supply chain. colin, just on this last comment that you talked about if you can just peel it back a little bit more and talk a little bit about unit versus asps. and maybe colin and julie together, how you think about that ramp and as you think about expanding to roomba as a service, warranties that you talked about, is that something that would drive incremental higher asps as you think about from each sale of that unit of roomba that you leased or you sell just so that we can help -- you can help us around the modeling.
and then you mentioned a bunch of one-time costs, julie that are unlikely to occur and as you look into fiscal '22 become a little bit of a tailwind. so if you can talk to us a little bit about that on what things is the $20 million that you already investing in '21 for the d2c channel expansion unlikely to kind of repeat itself and that's why you have that $20 million incremental in the oi. thank you.
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. so asiya maybe i'll start with your question and then i'll let colin jump in on units versus asps. i think that we are excited about the early results that we're seeing in some of our services pilots. i think it's important to also remember that while we are looking optimistically to commercializing those during 2021, it will take a while before those become a material part of our number.
as i think about looking forward asp and unit, we've certainly seen during 2020, a nice increase in what i would call net price with shift in up toward our premium end of our category as well as ex shifts in our channel. we also have seen nice unit growth. and as i look forward into '21 and beyond, i think the -- we will expect that we -- that we'll continue to see good unit growth again pointing to the relatively low penetration that our products have globally. and a small amount of continued pricing strength again related to mix.
colin angle -- founder, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. and i think the only thing i would add asiya which is less about financial model get more about momentum in the success of our strategy around differentiation is the shift that we talked about in the call to the premium is really a shift embracing the increased intelligence of the robot as well as some of the auto evac technologies we introduced and so that i'd like to see it, call it as almost an anti-commoditization that we're seeing where the differentiating features we're bringing on to the marketplace are being embraced by our customers and driving them to spend up to get these exciting and important features.
so again, i think it's all illustrative of a very healthy market where there are continued opportunities to differentiate with new technology and new features, which is great news for us because that's where we're investing. i'll stop there.
asiya merchant -- citigroup -- analyst
okay.
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and then as it relates to you were asking a question around the $20 million of what we've highlighted as incremental d2c investment during 2021. that's across a range of areas, both in terms of building capability and that talent required to run that capability to really focus on making the buying experience on our website and app an easy one, making sure that we've got that marketing insights to understand what customers need and how to build that relationship. and there is a portion of that which is one-time. there is another portion, which will continue as we go forward. however, we would expect that we will get leverage on that as our business scale, we would expect that to grow more slowly.
asiya merchant -- citigroup -- analyst
okay. so as i look into '22, you guys are assuming reramped these margins back up from '21 levels. the opex run rate as a percentage of revenue will drop quite meaningfully to get to 10% in higher opex -- op margin. is that the right way and that's what i was trying to kind of peel a little bit like where are we seeing those benefits from it, is it r&d because you guys were kind of kind of talking about trending that down as a percentage of revenue at -- or g&a as well. and so that incremental marketing and selling in opex initiatives that you're doing in '21 should really be scaling back in '22 and that's what i'm trying to get to opex as a run rate of revenue. okay.
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
right now, so as we've talked, we're thinking about and we tried to provide color on the -- on the entire p&l. we look at our gross margin and believe some of the headwinds that we're facing today in 2020 turn into tailwind as we -- i'm sorry as we are facing today in '21 turn into tailwinds as we move into 2022. that coupled with calibrating our spending and getting operating leverage should allow us to have operating margin in 2022, above 2020 levels.
more specifically, i think we're continuing to diligently work through those longer-range plan and help to provide more, be able to articulate longer-term financial targets more specifically in coming months.
asiya merchant -- citigroup -- analyst
okay, great. thank you.

thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of john babcock with bank of america. your line is now open.
john babcock -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. just quickly tagging along on some of these modeling questions. i was wondering if you could just talk about what you're assuming for unit selling growth versus unit sell through growth in the 2021 guide?
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so, john, as you know we work to balance sell-in and sell-through. it's never a perfect science based on the needs of our retail partners. but we are -- we are looking for continued good unit growth that would equate to good sell-in as well as sell-through momentum.
john babcock -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, thanks. and then next question, you talked a little bit about the robot-as-a-service program. could you share more about how the testing has gone so far with that and what's working well with the challenges are still have to be worked out?
colin angle -- founder, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah this is a constant optimization challenge for us. i think that we've had very encouraging results, and have already been able to optimize the experience. but there is more work to do. you definitely, as i said, will see this move from a test to a commercial program this year and we'll begin to scale up. so something you're going to be hearing more about as i mentioned earlier, i think that the materiality of the robots-as-a-service program will be minimal in '21 but certainly increasing throughout the year.
and also remember we will have to account for that with a significant deferred revenue portion of the of the income which will also create a little bit of a lag on the -- on this showing up in our revenue and profitability numbers but again something we'll be more than happy to talk about as the year unfolds.
john babcock -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, thanks. and then also on the two new products you are launching, i was wondering how you might have us think about that next generation of products and how do you -- how these will fit in with the rest of your portfolio?
colin angle -- founder, chairman and chief executive officer
i think that we're really focused on the intelligence of the robot. we're focused on how we can extend that partnership between the customer and the robot to make sure that the irobot customer feels in control of what the robot is doing and feel like they have an enlightened and trusted partnership between the company of the robot and themselves. and so that as we continue to rollout our products that will be sort of an overall guiding principle in what we are trying to accomplish. without that trust, without that control, both -- we will undershoot the potential of the industry we are leading.
john babcock -- bank of america -- analyst
okay and then just last question before i turn it over. could you just provide us a sense of the timeline for the patent infringement actions irobot is pursuing at the us international trade commission. and then also any color you can provide on how to supplement the prior litigation would be helpful.
colin angle -- founder, chairman and chief executive officer
so the recent action. i mean, i can only say a very limited side of things is through the itc, which is a very aggressive and fast-moving from the legal perspective organization. we expect to be at trial by the end of this year.
john babcock -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. thanks, colin.
colin angle -- founder, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of derek soderberg with colliers. your line is now open.
derek soderberg -- colliers securities -- analyst
yeah, good morning everyone, and thanks for taking my questions. i wanted to start with direct sales. can you elaborate on some of the reasoning behind the success there? what's driving the growth in your confidence longer term and i guess longer term, i'm curious how much of that 20% direct sales goal in 2023 can be services contribution? and what sort of gross margin for services are you targeting?
colin angle -- founder, chairman and chief executive officer
sure, we can answer some of that. i think that the roomba is a considered purchase, the roomba customer tends to do research on what model, why should i believe this robot works and just that there is a very real curiosity, which all drive customers to be -- to be willing to go to a website to learn about the product.
back in '18 and 2019, irobot's ability to really capture that interest and translate that into a transaction was relatively pedestrian or uninspired, it wasn't where we were focusing our go-to-market energies. i think we were good, but we were certainly far from world-class. as we roll out tools to better capture expressions of interest to better nurture the customers along a sales journey, the more effective we will be with direct-to-consumer. the other thing is the skyrocketing engagement of our customers as the features that our customers are asking for and using are these online connected features. this growth of 80% in the -- since the end of 2019 in our connected customers well over 10 million connected customers opting in for to our communications is really a profound growth in interest and a profound growth in our ability to go transact with the customer base.
and so all of these things give confidence and i think that one of the things that is maybe a subtle point in the script that we gave today was i think i used the word, we identified our implementation partner for many of the improvements in our direct-to-consumer, which suggests we're not done. we are making major investments in '21 to improve the tool set and our capabilities and our talent around this, which should pay continued dividends in our effectiveness online. so i think that 2020 showed tremendous progress but what we're working on and continuing to implement in '21 should continue that strong momentum forward.
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and just the last thing i would add is we really view this direct-to-consumer channel as a powerful complement to our very strong retail partners. so we look to this growth as being a way, once you find your way to irobot and you're part of our family, we want to nurture that relationship with you and make sure that when you're ready to buy your next products that you're going to transact directly with us.
colin angle -- founder, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. that's a little.
derek soderberg -- colliers securities -- analyst
got it. yes, it's helpful to think about it like that. and as my follow-up, i'm wondering what level of direct sales can be supported by some of the investments you're making, will be adequate to support that 2023 goal of 20% directs sales?
colin angle -- founder, chairman and chief executive officer
we are implementing best in class tools, which can scale well beyond even our 2023 goal. so that we're definitely making a real bet that this is going to be a long-term important dimension of our business. so that is not a concern that we are somehow undershooting what we're investing in.
derek soderberg -- colliers securities -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
thank you. there are no further questions. i would now like to turn the call back to andrew kramer for closing comments.

operator
good day, everyone, and welcome to the irobot first quarter 2021 financial results conference call. at this time, for opening remarks and introductions.
i would like to turn the call over to andrew kramer of irobot investor relations. please go ahead.
andrew m. kramer -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, tiffany. good morning, everybody. joining me on today's call are irobot's chairman and ceo, colin angle, and executive vice president and cfo, julie zeiler. before i set the agenda for today's call, i would like to note that statements made on today's call that are not based on historical information are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. additional information on these risks and uncertainties can be found in our public filings with the securities and exchange commission. irobot undertakes no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or circumstances.
related to our financial disclosures during this conference call, we will reference certain non-gaap financial measures as defined by sec regulation g, including non-gaap gross margin, non-gaap operating expense, non-gaap operating income, profit and margin, non-gaap effective tax rate, non-gaap net income per share. we believe that our non-gaap financial results help provide additional transparency into irobot's underlying operating performance and potential. our definitions of these non-gaap financial measures and reconciliations of each of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measure are provided at the end of these prepared remarks and in the financial tables at the end of the first quarter 2021 financial results press release we issued last evening, which is available on our website at www.irobot.com.
also, unless otherwise stated, the first quarter 2021 financial metrics, as well as financial metrics provided in our outlook that we reference on today's conference call, will be on a non-gaap basis only and all historical comparisons are with the first quarter of 2020. in terms of the agenda for today's call, colin will briefly review the company's quarterly financial results, discuss major strategic accomplishments and related progress and share his perspective on our outlook into 2021. julie will detail our first quarter financial results and offer insight into our expectations going forward. colin will conclude our commentary with some closing remarks. after that, we'll open the call to questions. at this point, i'll turn the call over to colin angle.
colin m. angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
good morning. thank you for joining us and happy star wars day. 2021 is off to a very good start. our first quarter revenue of $303 million grew 58%, which we converted into operating income of $15 million, an operating profit margin of 5% and eps of $0.41. we believe that our first quarter revenue growth demonstrates that our value proposition continues to resonate with consumers around the world. we generated strong top line growth in each major geographic region as we benefited from stronger-than-expected demand from our distribution partners in emea and vibrant retail orders in north america, including certain orders that were previously anticipated in the second quarter. these dynamics were complemented by another quarter of triple-digit growth in our direct-to-consumer channel. based on our strong q1 performance and favorable consumer demand tailwinds, we see continued growth ahead, and we have raised our full year revenue outlook. we also reaffirmed our 2021 profitability and eps expectations as we have adjusted our spending plans to offset expected gross margin pressure from transitory supply chain challenges.
as we move forward, we are optimistic about our potential to deliver upside to our updated 2021 targets. i'll discuss our outlook in more detail shortly. but first, i'd like to highlight our progress in executing each element of our strategy. as a reminder, our strategy remains focused on driving greater customer engagement in ways that lead to more customers transacting directly with us more often. the first element of our strategy is to differentiate the irobot experience for our customers. this means continued investment in ai, home understanding and machine vision technologies so that our floor cleaning robots can be tightly integrated into the customers' lifestyle and clean with unprecedented levels of thoughtfulness, reliability, control and support. we are pleased with our current progress on these fronts.
during the first quarter of 2021, we upgraded our irobot genius home intelligence platforms, adding several compelling new features, including estimated clean time, which helps customers know when a cleaning job may be finished, and clean while i'm away, which uses a smartphone's location services to tell the robot to start cleaning once you leave the house. unique functionality of our genius platform is helping drive sales of our mid-tier and premium robots by pushing innovation across more of our product line and making certain price adjustments. we are reinvigorating the mid-tier of our portfolio and generated strong first quarter revenue growth from these robots.
we believe that solid execution on this element of our strategy played an important role in enabling roomba to occupy seven of the top 10 best-selling rbc models in the u.s., emea and japan in the first quarter.
the second element of our strategy is to build stronger, more enduring consumer relationships. our connected customer base grew by 74% over 2020's first quarter to 10.7 million customers who have opted in to our digital communications. it has also been gratifying to see how the high-value features and functionality within the genius platform are delighting our customers. as irobot's customer community expands, we are enhancing all points of the consumer's journey with us on the moment they purchase a product from us and then unbox it, to when they complete their first cleaning mission and at various points over the months and years that follow.
the third strategic pillar is nurturing the lifetime value of the customer relationships to expand existing customer revenue. this involves accelerating the replacement cycle, upselling and cross selling, helping customers properly maintain their robots, and offering complementary products and developing new services, including new purchasing options to drive recurring revenue and higher gross margins. since the start of the year, we have accomplished several important milestones. in early april, we introduced our new irobot h1 handheld vacuum as a complement to roomba and braava robots. many of you heard me say that the future of vacuuming is a roomba and a cordless vacuum for areas that robots can't easily clean. now our customers can get both products directly from us.
we also made tangible progress with new services that provide customers with greater purchase protection and flexibility. consumers who purchase their robots directly from us can also add extended warranty, and we've been very pleased with the attachment rates thus far. in addition, customer feedback on our irobot select robot as a service membership program has been very positive as these pilots have progressed. moving forward, we plan to optimize the value proposition for irobot select and prepare to further scale this program as well as advanced testing of a premium care as a service offering. overall, our direct-to-consumer sales grew by 146% in the first quarter and generated 12% of q1 revenue. accessories represent another opportunity to drive existing customer revenue growth through our d2c channel.
we generated very healthy q1 growth in accessory sales, which includes filters, rollers, batteries, bags, mopping pads and mopping solution. we expect to build on this momentum over coming quarters as we further upgrade the buying experience in irobot.com and our home app and implement world-class digital marketing systems, tools and campaigns that will enable us to present our customers with the right offers for the right products at the right time.
with a strong q1 behind us, we move forward with solid category momentum, a compelling value proposition of fast-growing and rapidly maturing d2c channel, excellent retailer relationships and healthy channel inventory positions. our year-to-date sell-through growth through week 15 is not surprisingly substantially better than the same period a year ago, which was dramatically impacted by the early days of the pandemic. nevertheless, we recognize that it is still early in the year. the pandemic continues to weigh on the macroeconomic landscape and limit our visibility. additionally, our business is not immune to the semiconductor chip shortage that is disrupting a wide range of industries. to that end, certain component suppliers recently notified us of potential volume limitations. we have already made good progress in our efforts to mitigate these constraints, although additional work lies ahead on this front.
taking all of these dynamics into consideration, we have raised our full year revenue expectations to the range of $1.67 billion to $1.71 billion. from a profitability perspective, the semiconductor chip shortage is resulting in higher costs for these components. at the same time, we are now grappling with rising costs for raw materials, airfreight and transportation. while these transitory costs are likely to remain elevated for the next few quarters, we expect that over time, they will revert to more normalized levels as market forces adjust. nevertheless, to offset the near-term impact on our anticipated 2021 gross margin, we have recalibrated our spending over the coming quarters. as a result, we are able to reaffirm our 2021 operating income, operating income margin and eps targets.
with 2/3 of the year still ahead of us, we are optimistic about our potential for further upside, especially if current demand trends remain healthy, and we successfully expand access to the semiconductor componentry which will enable us to increase production beyond what's embedded in our current expectations. that concludes my initial commentary. i will now turn the call over to julie.
julie zeiler -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thank you, colin. as andy mentioned earlier, my review of our financial results and outlook will be done on a non-gaap basis. so unless stated otherwise, each mention of gross margin, operating expense, operating income and operating profit margin, effective tax rate and net income per share will mean the corresponding non-gaap metric. all quarterly comparisons are against the first quarter of 2020, unless otherwise noted.
as colin noted, our q1 performance represents a strong start to 2021. total q1 revenue grew 58% to $303 million and exceeded our original targets due primarily to stronger-than-expected orders from distributors in emea and u.s. retailers, including over $5 million in orders that were originally expected in the second quarter. geographically, revenue grew 40% in the u.s., with international revenue up 70%, due primarily to 74% growth in emea and a 53% increase in japan. from a product mix perspective, roomba robots and accessories represented 89% of our q1 revenue mix with braava making up the remainder. since the start of the pandemic over a year ago, more consumers are buying our products online. we estimate that approximately 56% of total first quarter revenue came from e-commerce, which comprises our own website and app-dedicated e-commerce websites and the online arms of traditional brick-and-mortar retailers.
our gross margin of 40.7% in q1 was largely unchanged from the prior year's first quarter. changes in pricing and promotions, higher air freight fees and higher cost to procure certain components were essentially offset by leverage from higher sales, lower tariff costs, favorable channel mix and the timing of one-time write-offs associated with pausing certain activities in the first quarter of 2020 that did not reoccur in the first quarter. tariffs on rbcs imported into the u.s. from china were reinstated on january 1, 2021. taking advantage of the non-tariffed inventory that was in place at the end of 2020 helped us limit our first quarter tariff costs to just $3.4 million. our gross and operating profit margin would have been 1.1 percentage points higher without tariffs.
first quarter 2021 operating expenses of $109 million increased by 17% and represented 36% of revenue. the increase primarily reflects higher personnel cost expenses and increased working media spending to drive sales growth. our q1 2021 operating income was $15 million or 5% of revenue. our q1 2021 effective tax rate was 19.2%, which was in line with our plans. our net income per share was $0.41.
we ended q1 with $501 million in cash and short-term investments, an increase of $17 million from year-end. the increase primarily reflects the company's fundamental operating performance plus favorable changes in working capital. it should also be noted that the reduction in short-term investments since the end of 2020 primarily reflects the sale of our teladoc stock early in the quarter once the restriction on selling those shares lapsed. first quarter dsos were 20 days, a 2-day increase against the same period one year ago. q1 ending inventory was $233 million or 118 days compared with $147 million or 118 days at the same time last year.
with the quarterly review complete, let's move on to our 2021 outlook. as colin outlined, we now expect 2021 revenue in the range of $1.67 billion to $1.71 billion. our updated outlook assumes very strong sequential growth, which implies a split between the first and second halves of 2021 that approaches our historical 40/60 split. as a reminder, our revenue expectations contemplate yen and euro exchange rates roughly in line with the current rates, plus or minus 5%. colin outlined several recent developments involving our supply chain that are resulting in higher-than-expected costs, including constrained availability of semiconductor componentry, rising raw material costs and increased freight, airfreight and transportation fees. in addition, we expect slightly higher 2021 tariff costs in the range of $43 million to $45 million. as a result, we now expect a full year 2021 gross margin of approximately 39%. we anticipate a q2 gross margin that is in line with our full year target, which reflects the timing of promotional activities as well as incrementally higher supply chain costs.
many of the other factors shaping our 2021 gross margin are unchanged. since the pandemic began, our operations organization has been outstanding in keeping key initiatives on course while moving with urgency and decisiveness to address unanticipated supply chain challenges. our plan to substantially increase our production in malaysia over the course of this year is progressing well, even with a tight labor market. we are also fortunate to have a strong balance sheet that will help us secure longer lead time and increasingly scarce componentry. in terms of our 2021 operating costs, we have adjusted our full year spending plans to offset the anticipated gross margin pressure. we are now targeting full year operating costs in the range of $535 million to $555 million or approximately 32% of sales. as a result, we still expect operating profit margin of 7%, with anticipated operating income between $110 million and $120 million. while we expect relatively nominal increases in our q2 r&d and g&a spending versus first quarter 2021 level, we plan to significantly ramp up our q2 sales and marketing activity as we continue to invest in scaling our d2c operations and activate our working media programs to support major holiday and other seasonal events. although we expect our q2 operating profit margin will decline from the first quarter, we anticipate that the substantially higher second half revenue will support a meaningful improvement in our profitability in the second half of the year.
in terms of other major modeling assumptions for 2021, we now expect other expense to be between $2 million and $3 million, and we still anticipate an effective tax rate ranging from 18% to 19%. we still expect our full year eps to range from $3.00 to $3.25 with an anticipated diluted share count of approximately 29 million shares. we continue to expect our 2021 capital spending to be in the low $50 million range. on the use of capital front, our previously authorized $200 million stock repurchase plan had $175 million available entering the second quarter. earlier this month, we disclosed our intention to repurchase up to $50 million of our common stock under a 10b5-1 plan that began on april 12 and is expected to end on or before september 5. as a reminder, our 2021 expectations do not assume any repurchase activity.
on the inventory front, we expect that inventory, both in terms of absolute dollars and dii may fluctuate meaningfully from quarter-to-quarter over the remainder of the year as we navigate a challenging and fluid supply chain environment. in summary, q1 was a good way to begin the year. we move forward focused on executing against our plans as we look to capitalize on the exciting opportunities we see and overcome the challenges that lie ahead. that concludes my commentary. i'll now turn the call back to colin for some closing thoughts.
colin m. angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
thank you, julie. we are at the midway point of a multiyear strategic plan to transform irobot into a more defensible, more profitable business, capable of sustaining solid growth with scale, channels and offerings to address the evolving needs of an expansive and expanding global customer base. our recent accomplishments and progress from driving innovation in robotics floor care and introducing complementary cleaning products, to offer extended warranties, advance promising new high-value services, and selling more accessories all illustrate the importance of our investment to build out our e-commerce and digital marketing capabilities. they also highlight our potential to grow existing customer revenue and further improve the profitability of our enterprise in the process. we expect more progress on these and other related fronts over the coming quarters.
on our q4 call in february, we shared our preliminary thoughts on what our business may look like in 2022. that view remains unchanged regardless of the short-term supply chain turbulence we've recently encountered. over the past several quarters, we've made good progress in refining our long-term strategic plan. as we finalize this activity, we have started our planning process for a virtual investor day event that we plan to hold later this year. we believe this will be an important opportunity for analysts and investors to fully appreciate why we are so enthusiastic about our prospects. we expect to finalize the timing for this event soon, and we'll share those details with you accordingly.
that concludes our comments. operator, we will take questions now.

operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of asiya merchant with citigroup.
asiya merchant -- citigroup -- analyst
great. thank you, everyone. that was a very strong demand environment that you guys outlined, that you guys delivered and are outlining for the year. i had a few clarification questions. first, on the u.s. side. based on the results and the data that you've provided, it seems like u.s., if i look at it not just last year because of the pandemic, but further out, kind of flattish relative to what it was in march 19. are there any like inventory or channel dynamics here to consider? and then as we look ahead into a more normalized environment in fiscal 21 as it relates to prime day and spring activities and promotional activities, how should we think about 2q this year versus sort of last year when there was -- when prime day was kind of shifted later into the year? if you can talk a little bit about the demand dynamic there. and then lastly, i know emea was very strong. i've heard some of my other companies also talk about the strength in emea. if you can talk to us about sell-in versus sell-through in emea and japan, that would be helpful. thank you.
colin m. angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
sure. let me start. relative to your inventory question, what we said is that we're in a very good position. which would mean superior from where we were a year ago when the pandemic was starting. last year, we saw retailers drive their inventory to extremely low levels and then generally slowly build toward the back part of the year back to a more normalized position. we had a very strong q4 last year which allowed us to enter into q1 of this year in a superior position than we did in 2020 and we've been able to, based on the strength of the sell-through that we described, keep those inventory levels at healthy positions. so on the question of is there any inventory fill or oversupply dynamics to consider for the balance of the year, i would say at this time, we don't see that. we don't see that we have an exposure either in -- with any of our retailers from an inventory position. and i think that we also see with retail doing, having weathered 2020, we don't see any unusual risks with channel viability. so i would say the answer to your first question is nothing out of the ordinary. we're very healthy in those dynamics. relative to your comments around prime day, it is a choice of amazon every year to either include or not include us in prime day, and we've been fortunate enough to have a strong history with prime day. but we have not announced what our situation is with amazon and prime day at this point. it is, julie, what do we know about the timing on prime day? i think it's -- it would happen in, at a more normal time, but is the expectation. so that would mean were it happening, selling would happen in q2. of course, last year, we did have some sell-in for prime day in q2 as well.
julie zeiler -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
and then, asiya, as you know, i think that we always work hard to make sure that we find balance over time between sell-in and sell-through. as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, through week 15, we're seeing very solid global sell-through, particularly driven by the u.s. and overall, as we look forward to q2, we expect strong sequential growth. we have to remember, as we go through 2021, we're going to be comping an unusual 2020. and so as we look to make sure that we're continuing to build on the customer demands that we're seeing, a lot of that is going to normalize as we go through 2021 and 2022 will have a more typical comp.
asiya merchant -- citigroup -- analyst
okay. and if i may, one more on the accessories side, how should we think about contribution from accessories into kind of what you're expecting, your high teens, 20% kind of growth. what should we kind of think about accessories more in 2021 and as then you ramp up into outer years?
colin m. angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
i think at this point, we'll just give some high-level color on that answer. but as our direct-to-consumer business grows, the opportunity to drive more accessory sales is almost outpacing the growth in d2c. and so it is a definite tailwind on revenue and revenue growth and financial performance. so that as we look forward, we see the increase in d2c definitely accelerating the contribution of accessories to our performance.
asiya merchant -- citigroup -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of john babcock with bank of america.
john babcock -- bank of america -- analyst
morning, thanks for taking my question. starting out, you talked a little bit about component shortages as well as inflation in raw materials, freight and transportation. on that point, i was wondering if you could talk about your relationship with the contract manufacturers and also provide some color on how your contracts with them are structured just so we can get some sense on how this might roll through results?
colin m. angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
so we've got long-term relationships with our contract manufacturers and definitely a strong partnership to work through these challenges. i think that what made the current situation unusual was component suppliers decommitting components that we had expected and having to go into the open market and do spot buys, which we did effectively, although that was a driver of additional costs. so that the -- and the impact, the financial impact of that is included in the guidance that we have given. this gets better as we are able to go and secure longer-term commitments and take more, a slightly higher inventory position on some of the components that have been impacted and will lead to a normalization of cost as we roll the clock forward. it's why our expectations around the color for 2022 remain unchanged. and the guidance that we gave for 2021, we are confident in raising our revenue guidance and covering the incremental costs of raw materials and transportation within our previously given operating income guidance.
john babcock -- bank of america -- analyst
got you. and might you be able to talk about some of the raw materials where you're seeing the most inflation?
colin m. angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
just resins are up 50% in some situations. it is a -- there's definitely a disruption to supply chain that is temporal. it will take some time to work through, but we do expect it to normalize back to traditional levels at this point. so that's one significant example.
john babcock -- bank of america -- analyst
that's great. and then also, going back to kind of the last set of questions, i was just wondering if you might be able to talk about some of the key trends that are driving that strong growth in emea?
colin m. angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
i think that robot vacuuming continues to grow as the method of floor care for the future. this is something that we've seen happening and continues, it's roomba and a hand vac is increasingly how people think about cleaning their floors. and so we still have relatively low household penetration. there's still strong opportunity for continued growth, and we are at a phase of consumer adoption where the majority of consumers are now realizing that this is not a fad, this is the new normal. and i think that realization was accelerated last year through spending more time at home and the work from home changes in consumer behavior. so i think that this is a vibrant industry at an exciting time in its growth.
john babcock -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and then i just want to squeeze in two other quick ones here. first, there have been some proposals in the u.s. about changes in the corporate tax rate as well as the global minimum tax. and i was wondering if you might be able to just quickly talk about how that might impact irobot? and then also, i think on the last call, you mentioned expecting 2022 earnings to be above 2020 levels. and i just wanted to see if that is still the case.
julie zeiler -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. so i'll take that one, john. obviously, some of the -- what's being written now about potential changes in the corporate tax rate are things that we are watching closely. i have nothing new to add to that. and as that evolves, we'll continue to look at that and its implications. when we look forward into 2022, the color that we've provided is that we, underpinned by our expected continued healthy market growth and the fact that irobot will benefit appropriately from that continued growth, we expect that we'll see a number of things start to turn in our favor. gross margin headwinds turning into tailwinds, continued calibration of our spending and driving operating leverage. and so that we expect our oi to be above 2020 levels and a substantially stronger eps performance. those things all, which we talked about during our q4 call, are all things that we continue to feel confident in today.
john babcock -- bank of america -- analyst
thanks.
operator
your next question comes from the line of mike latimore with northland capital markets.
mike latimore -- northland capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks a lot. really strong growth in the quarter there. in terms of the supply shortage, did that influence your revenue guidance much? or is it more just on the margin side?
colin m. angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
it certainly influenced both, and we alluded to there being some additional juice that may be in our financial performance, assuming we can unlock it through continued strong demand and continued ability to grow our supply. in a constrained or an unfavorable supply situation, companies are less able to meet growth demand because of lead time, componentry lead time, which have been substantially growing over the past few months. and so that assuming that we can find the supply, we believe the demand is there. and the growth in revenue guidance we're signaling today represents the best view we have at this moment in time, where we're admitting that there is some uncertainty around availability of incremental products that hampers our ability to lean even further forward. so this is where we think we are today. but again, the demand is there. we're very excited with our position and how customers are responding to our product. and it's a bit of a -- it's also early in the year for us to be touching our guidance at all. so i think that there's a strong message in the fact that irobot just increased revenue guidance in the q1 call, which is not something we have done frequently in our history.
mike latimore -- northland capital markets -- analyst
great. makes sense. and then on emea, was the strength there largely related to launching the i3 in the region. or this combo product? or just more channel activity? i mean, a little more color there would be great.
colin m. angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
it was largely demand up and down our product lines. the i3 definitely was a contributor to it. but i think that europe is in just a very healthy -- is a very healthy market from a demand perspective and is catching up with north america and japan. which is sort of where robots caught on a little bit earlier.
mike latimore -- northland capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then just last on the i think it's 10.7 million consumers that have opted in, what percent of those are actually buying something? not a roomba or braava, but like an accessory or warranty, that sort of thing?
colin m. angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
it's a great question and something we look forward to giving more color on in the future. we're sort of -- as we are rolling out our direct program, we wanted to start releasing new statistics to our analysts and investor community, the first being what is the size of the connected pool. we'll be talking about existing customer revenue and some other key metrics in the future as we continue to implement the tools required to accurately measure and communicate those. but great question, stay tuned.
mike latimore -- northland capital markets -- analyst
okay. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of ben rose with battle road research.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
morning. question for colin with regard to the roomba combo. i was curious to know if you could give some additional color in terms of its performance in the quarter. and in general, your thoughts about combination robots at this point?
colin m. angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
the roomba combo is an entry-level robot that combines mopping and vacuuming capabilities and is available in very, very limited markets where we think that tactically it makes sense. irobot is very committed to the fact that the premium and the best way to clean your floor is to separate vacuuming and mopping functionality. just the physics of both the cleaning process and getting the pad into, up to the edges and into the corners where the most dirt is, benefit substantially from a 2-robot solution. and as evidenced by strong braava performance, our customers are agreeing with our strategy. so it's a tactical play. there are some markets where particularly at the lower price points, we find ourselves competing against products that have that two in one where people are willing to accept a lower level of clean, willing to accept more involvement in deciding before every mission whether you're going to mop or vacuum and what parts of your home are you going to do this. again, it's a little anathema from our vision of how robots should care for your home, but it is a useful tactical play.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
okay. and just a follow-up, i'm intrigued by the progress in the genius home platform. and i wanted to know i guess strategically, whether you have thoughts about perhaps opening that up to other companies' products to participate in the benefits of the platform.
colin m. angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
so we already integrate with other companies' products. and so you're starting to see that happen already. i think that it's very exciting. the growth and the utilization of things like clean while i'm away, particularly with work from home, just finding a good time to clean is a real challenge for many of our customers. and so the idea of the cellphone has left the building, time to go clean, is a compelling proposition. and we've integrated with other devices in the home. so we're very open to it. we think that as we move forward, you're going to see irobot driving more thoughtfully and automatically configured opportunities for the home to do more in service of the customer. and the examples that we have rolled out and are beginning to see adopted are emblematic of that direction. so this is -- i guess that's a long way of saying yes.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
okay thanks very much. that is helpful.
operator
your next question comes from the line of jim ricchiuti with needham.
tyler daily -- needham -- analyst
this is tyler daily, i'm filling in for jim. thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong demand this quarter. just wondering, you kind of mentioned various headwinds in supply chain, transportation, freight, and obviously, the component shortages. just wondering if you might be able to opine, kind of parse out the impact of each on margins.
julie zeiler -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. so tyler, this is julie. i'll try to answer your question. and we -- as we've looked at a number of these things, we're giving our best aggregated view of what we think those incremental costs look like. and certainly, any one individually perhaps you'd have a way through, but when you start to look at them all together, it's a headwind for us as we look to the rest of the year. you named the big one. so as i look at as a percent of our total, the increased raw material costs are significant, as are roughly the same the increased transportation, which we would expect over time to normalize. then i'd point to the scarcity of some of the componentry and our need to do spot buys out in the market. and then finally, the fourth piece would be air freight. those four things make up the lion's share of the impact.
tyler daily -- needham -- analyst
that's helpful. i appreciate that. and just, i guess, a follow-up, you obviously mentioned recalibrating some of your expenditures to adjust for some of those costs. just wondering, are we going to see i guess a typical ramp-up in quarter 2? or should we, i guess, more line thinking of later half, q3, q4 for those adjustments in spending?
julie zeiler -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. so one of the things that we talked about in our prepared remarks is we do -- well, if you look at our spending, q1 to q2, we would expect fairly nominal growth across both r&d and g&a. sales and marketing does have substantial sequential growth planned as it normally does, associated with our promotional environment, the holidays that happen in the second quarter.
tyler daily -- needham -- analyst
okay. thank you. and then just one last question. interested to hear a little bit more about the launch of the handheld. curious, obviously it's an extension toward sort of your existing customer base and sort of filling a need there. but do you see from a strategic standpoint, eating into any of the market share in the current handheld vacuum market?
colin m. angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
so launching the handheld was strategic for a few reasons. the first, it was the first example of using a new capability with our direct-to-consumer engine so that's selling an additional product directly to our customers. and so we were testing out the plumbing. it's something that we've talked about doing as a way of enhancing our existing customer revenue. it's also something that is a very logical adjacency, given that the future floor care is a roomba and hand vac. it's a very high-quality premium hand vac. certainly, not the flagship of irobot artificial intelligence technology, but it's a strong performer for what it does. and i think that you should expect that over time, the learnings from launching this hand vac will pave the path for other types of product offerings and developing direct as an additional channel for new product introductions. we think that the product we're offering is very competitive and that we definitely hope that it can grow and be a legitimate performer in the hand vac market against its competitors. so it's certainly not an anecdotal product that we just threw out there. we think it's strong and we can build on that category as a logical adjacency if that helps.
tyler daily -- needham -- analyst
that is great. appreciate it thanks colin and julie.
julie zeiler -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
you are welcome.
operator
[operator instructions] we do have a follow-up question from the line of asiya merchant with citigroup.
asiya merchant -- citigroup -- analyst
great, thank you, again. given the component shortages that are not just specific to irobot, but across the industry, some of the companies have talked about a more benign pricing environment, less promo pricing. and just given your strong balance sheet and ability to get components, etc. perhaps better than some of your peers, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on a market share? should we expect at the retail level to see irobot gain share because of these dynamics? and how should we think about the limited promotional pricing on your gross margin guide for this year?
colin m. angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
so i think it's difficult to predict the behavior of our competitors. in all markets, our major competitors are china-based manufacturers, and they have and are using slightly different chips than we have. and so that -- and then in 2019, when tariffs came in, we observed our competitors were content to continue some of their promotional pricing and leave their prices where they were and operate under a different margin structure. so we built our year assuming that our competitors would remain aggressive and we would go and react as we have traditionally done, leading to the optimistic look that we have communicated today. so i think that we're planning for competition to find ways of weathering the storm, and we don't view it today as a strategic advantage in the marketplace. time will tell, but i think that's the safe way of viewing it.
julie zeiler -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
and i guess the other thing to underscore is, we continue to believe that we have a very compelling value proposition as we look at our products and their ability to fit seamlessly into the lifestyle of our consumers. and so we will continue to focus our energy and effort on improving that overall user experience and ensuring in our promotional activities that we're explaining that effectively out to our customer base. we think that's the way to win long term.
asiya merchant -- citigroup -- analyst
okay. thank you.
julie zeiler -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
you are welcome.

and we do have a follow-up question from the line of john babcock with bank of america.
john babcock -- bank of america -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my follow up question. just quickly, i was wondering if you might just be able to remind us how you're thinking about new product launches for this year. obviously, you have the handheld vacuum, but i thought you also were talking about watching some other products. so if you can maybe help provide some rough color, recognizing you can't be too specific, just around kind of where that innovation might occur.
colin m. angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
sure. so we have communicated that there are two new robots to come this year, and we haven't specified any details about what those products are. i would tell you anecdotally, i'm very excited to see what's coming, but i will have to leave it at that. but i guess i can say they're on track and not affected by the supply chain challenges that we have talked about, so we've been able to mitigate the impact on these product launches. so it's all as per plan.
john babcock -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and then next question, i was just wondering if you might be able to talk about what you're hearing from traditional retailers about the reopening here and how they're kind of thinking about it? and then also how you are thinking about how consumers might adjust spending as we get more people vaccinated and hopefully at some point beyond the pandemic?
colin m. angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
well, we -- definitely, we saw a huge shift to online and e-commerce in 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021. we talked about 56% of our revenue coming from e-commerce channels. that's significantly up from something closer to 40% in 2019 when we had a 60/40 split. i think that the -- we could see retail, brick-and-mortar come back a bit. but certainly, we would not expect a retreat to 2019 levels, more of a single-digit move over time as people get back to retail. we're pretty agnostic as to whether we're selling online or retail, with the exception that we're very, very excited about the continued strong growth in our direct-to-consumer dimension of our business, which we're investing substantially in and enjoying improved gross margin and access to consumers via that channel.
john babcock -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and then just my last question for the day, i suspect it may not be much here, but i was just wondering if there are any updates on the litigation with shark.

operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the second quarter 2021 irobot corporation earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to your host today, mr. andrew kramer. thank you. sir, please begin.
andrew kramer -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, howard, and good morning, everybody. joining me on today's call are irobot chairman & ceo, colin angle; and executive vice president and cfo, julie zeiler.
before i set the agenda for today's call, i would like to note that statements made on today's call, that are not based on historical information, are forward-looking statements, made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. additional information on these risks and uncertainties can be found in our public filings with the securities and exchange commission. irobot undertakes no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or circumstances.
related to our financial disclosures during this conference call, we will reference certain non-gaap financial measures as defined by sec regulation g, including non-gaap gross margin, non-gaap operating expense, non-gaap operating income, profit and profit margin, non-gaap effective tax rate and non-gaap net income per share. we believe that our non-gaap financial results help provide additional transparency into irobot's underlying operating performance and potential.
our definition of these non-gaap financial measures and reconciliations of each of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measure are provided at the end of these prepared remarks and in the financial tables at the end of the second quarter 2021 financial results press release we issued last evening, which is available on our website at www.irobot.com. also, unless stated otherwise, the second quarter 2021 financial metrics as well as financial metrics provided in our outlook that we reference on today's call, will be on a non-gaap basis only and all historical comparisons are with the second quarter of 2020.
for today's call, our will be as follows. colin will briefly cover the company's quarterly financial results and then share his perspective on the primary issues shaping our revised outlook for 2021. julie will review our second quarter financial results and offer additional insight into our expectations going forward. colin will conclude our commentary with some closing remarks. after that, we'll open the call for questions.
at this point, i'll turn the call over to colin angle.
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
good morning, and thank you for joining us. we delivered solid second quarter results that were generally in line with the targets that we outlined for you in early may as we navigated an increasingly challenging supply chain environment. we generated second quarter revenue of $366 million, an increase of 31% over the prior year. our revenue growth was primarily driven by healthy demand from retailers in north america and from our retail and distribution partners in emea. we were pleased with this performance, considering a covid-related disruption to shipping activities in southern china left us unable to fulfill $17 million in order at the end of the quarter. we converted our top-line performance into an operating income of $9 million, an operating profit margin of 2% and eps of $0.27.
our first half performance tells a very positive story, particularly as it relates to strong consumer demand for our products as well as increased customer engagement. roomba robots occupied eight of the top 10 best-selling rvc models in the united states, six of the top 10 in emea and nine of the top 10 in japan. for the seventh straight year, we participated in amazon's prime day event. once again, amazon cited roomba as one of its best-selling items.
we generated solid 42% growth from the mid and premium tiers of our portfolio, which we believe demonstrates the appeal of our floor-cleaning robots that provide their owners with personalized control over where, when and how the robot cleans. we also continued to expand our direct-to-consumer sales as reopening activities in the u.s. and rising online advertising costs moderated this growth.
overall, we saw solid growth in the number of robots shipped and asps in our second quarter versus the same period last year. we finished q2 with over 11.6 million connected customers, an increase of 67% from the same period last year. customers are increasingly using our newest features like directed room cleaning. they are also increasingly using our ai-powered recommendations to clean by objects and adopting our new clean-while-i'm-away capability using geolocation services on their smartphones.
as we moved through the second quarter, our commercial teams, retailers and distribution partners were increasingly bullish about the second half of the year, especially given our plans to introduce two new roomba robots and deliver another major upgrade to our genius home intelligence platform. our new e-commerce and martech systems will soon start moving into production, giving us the capabilities to expand existing customer revenue effectively and efficiently. even after raising our top-line outlook in early may, we saw opportunity to exceed these targets.
unfortunately, the reality of the current supply chain environment is forcing us to tell a different story for the second half of the year. quite simply, the supply side of our business is not currently able to keep pace with demand for our products. since our call in may, we have seen further deterioration in our ability to source the requisite volume of semiconductor chips used to manufacture our floor cleaning robots. we are not alone in feeling the pain of the semiconductor chip shortage as it impacts a range of industries from automobiles and medical devices to tvs, smartphones and many other consumer electronics.
our robots rely on a wide range of integrated circuits from lower cost commodity-like devices to very sophisticated powerful processors. while there is tightness across the board, we have recently fielded calls from multiple chip suppliers who are now unlikely to fulfill their commitments to us, either in volume, timing or both. these decommitments and push-outs will constrain our ability to fulfill all of the orders we anticipated during the second half of this year. accordingly, based primarily on the assumption of lower unit volumes, we have reduced our 2021 revenue target to $1.55 billion to $1.62 billion, which still represents 8% to 13% growth over the prior year. this range is wider than usual, reflecting limited short-term visibility into the availability of certain semiconductor componentry.
the impact of lower revenue on our anticipated profitability is compounded by having to increasingly source more semiconductor componentry in the aftermarket at a much higher price as well as grapple with rising raw material and transportation costs. against this backdrop, we are working diligently to carefully manage channel and product mix, adjust promotional activities, qualify new alternative suppliers and optimize inventory levels. more specifically, with limited supply, we are working collaboratively with our strategic retailers in countries where our brand is strongest to support them while we also take steps to optimize our second half promotional activities and direct-to-consumer sales.
additionally, we are evaluating potential price increases. we know consumers are excited about the way we continue to innovate. and with that in mind, we intend to defend our leadership position in the premium segment, while also investing in the marketing activities to help us bring our next generation of roomba robots to market later this year. we will also remain disciplined with our second half spending plans by recalibrating hiring activities and other discretionary programs.
at the same time, we move forward committed to advancing our strategy by continuing to fund the initiatives we believe are necessary to emerge from this short-term turbulence as an even stronger category leader. as we balance cost austerity with investing in our future as a technology and category leader, we expect that our second half profitability will be aided by tariff relief. between recently passed legislation in the u.s. senate and bipartisan urging from representatives about the reinstatement of the tariff exclusion process, we now believe that it is more likely than not that irobot will receive a tariff exemption. and as a result, we've incorporated this likely development into our updated 2021 outlook.
with that said, it is inherently difficult to forecast precisely when or even if the ustr would reinstate exclusions to the china section 301 tariffs and establish a new process for importers to apply for exclusions since those activities are likely to be linked to the biden administration's ongoing reassessment of its overall policy toward china. based on our ongoing dialogue with policymakers and elected officials, we anticipate that an exclusion, if reinstated, would cover all of '21 at a minimum and could extend through the end of 2022. julie will share more details on the specific financial impact of tariff relief in a moment.
regardless of this potential positive development, diversifying our manufacturing footprint into malaysia remains strategically important, and we are making good progress on this front. we are now producing nearly half of our u.s. bound product out of malaysia and remain on track to have malaysia manufacturing at scale by the end of this year. taking all of these factors into account, we have also revised our operating income and eps expectations. we now expect our 2021 operating income to range from $80 million to $110 million or 5% to 7% of revenue with an eps range of $2.25 to $3.15, which also factors in our recent and planned stock repurchase activities.
while the changes to our full year outlook are nonetheless disappointing, it is important to again emphasize that we believe these supply chain constraints and cost headwinds are temporary. our operations teams are working diligently to preserve our supply chain resiliency. as a high priority, strategic customer to many of our long-standing chip suppliers, we continue to put longer term supply agreements in place that not only support our revised near-term volume requirements, but also position us to be at the front of the line when our partners begin increasing their output, which we expect will happen during the first half of next year.
just as important, although qualifying new suppliers is time consuming, we expect that these ongoing efforts will also help further increase our supply during this period. although visibility is limited right now, we believe these activities will help lead to improved availability of components starting in the beginning of next year and steadily strengthen as we move into the second half of 2022. while our performance in 2021 is now expected to fall short of our ambitious targets, we remain optimistic about our revenue and eps growth potential for next year.
i'll share some additional thoughts on how we see 2022 evolving in just a few minutes, but at this point, i'd like to turn over to julie for her financial review.
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, colin. as andy mentioned earlier, my review of our financial results and outlook will be done on a non-gaap basis. so unless stated otherwise, each mention of gross margin, operating expense, operating income and operating profit margin, effective tax rate and net income per share will mean the corresponding non-gaap metric. all quarterly comparisons are against the second quarter of 2020, unless otherwise noted.
we reported a solid q2 performance. total second quarter revenue grew 31% to $366 million, due primarily to strong retail and distributor orders in the u.s. and emea. a covid-related shutdown of the shipping ports in southern china in late june prevented us from fulfilling $17 million in orders. most of those orders have since shipped, and we expect to complete this activity over the next couple of weeks.
geographically, revenue grew 40% in the u.s., 29% growth in emea and 7% increase in japan. from a product mix perspective, roomba robots and accessories represented 88% of our q2 revenue mix with braava making up the remainder. we estimate that approximately two-thirds of total second quarter revenue came from e-commerce, which comprises our own website and app, dedicated e-commerce websites and the online arms of traditional brick and mortar retailers.
our dtc revenue grew 36% to $45 million or 12% of total revenue. although we saw very strong dtc growth in emea and japan, sales in the u.s. moderated due to the more limited traffic arising from higher advertising fees and reopening events that diverted consumer spending into other categories. given these dynamics along with our supply constraints, we now expect dtc sales to represent approximately 13% of total full year revenue in 2021.
our gross margin of 38% in q2 was slightly below plan as favorable changes in promotional activity were more than offset by higher warranty costs and timing shifts associated with the purchase of certain componentry. tariffs were the single biggest factor for the 12 point decline in gross margin from the second quarter of 2020. as you may recall, we received our tariff exclusion in the second quarter of 2020, which not only eliminated any quarterly tariff expense, but also resulted in a reversal of tariff costs of approximately $7 million from q1 '20.
in this year's second quarter, we paid tariffs of approximately $12 million. the net impact from tariffs from both periods was approximately $18 million, which represents about nearly half of the decline. the remainder of the decline was split relatively evenly between pricing and promotional activity, supply chain headwinds, higher warranty expense and unfavorable channel and product mix shifts. i would also note that the company's second quarter 2020 gaap gross profit reflected the reversal of the full $47 million in tariffs that had been paid since they went into effect.
second quarter 2021 operating costs of $131 million increased by 32% and represented 36% of revenue. the increase reflected higher working media to drive sales growth, increased personnel-related expenses primarily tied to headcount and higher r&d spending. our q2 2021 operating income was $9 million or 2% of revenue. the impact of the delayed shipping of $17 million in orders to our operating income was approximately $7 million.
our q2 2021 effective tax rate was approximately 12%, which reflects changes in our full year tax rate assumptions primarily associated with lower expected full year operating income. our net income per share was $0.27. we ended the second quarter with $416 million in cash and short-term investments, a decline of $85 million from the end of q1. the decrease primarily reflects share repurchases totaling $50 million and $27 million in operating cash outflows mostly driven by changes in our inventory.
second quarter dsos were 19 days, a 23 day decrease against the same period one year ago. the decrease reflects the timing of orders that were more weighted to the first half of the quarter versus last year when the pandemic resulted in most orders being shifted into the last half of that same quarter. q2 ending inventory was $277 million or 112 days compared with $133 million or 86 days at the same time last year. the increase in inventory reflects the combination of our efforts to support our second half volume requirements as well as the impact of tariffs and the units that were stuck at port at the end of the quarter.
with the quarterly review complete, let's move on to our 2021 outlook. as colin detailed, the semiconductor chip shortage will significantly reduce the number of robots we had expected to ship in 2021. we now expect 2021 revenue in the range of $1.55 billion to $1.62 billion, which implies 57% to 59% of our anticipated revenue coming in the second half of the year and a 1% to 8% decline in our second half revenue versus the same period last year. while it is very challenging to forecast the timing of holiday orders between the third and fourth quarters, we currently expect low-single-digit revenue growth in the third quarter. as a reminder, our revenue expectations contemplate yen and euro exchange rates roughly in line with current rates, plus or minus 5%.
in terms of our gross profit margin, earlier on the call, colin shared our rationale for why we expect an exclusion from section 301 tariffs for 2021. we have factored this anticipated development into our updated outlook and removed $35 million to $37 million from our anticipated full year cost of goods sold. without the burden of tariffs, we expect a full year gross margin range of 39% to 40%. if a tariff exclusion is not granted, our full year 2021 gross margin will be 2 percentage points lower.
assuming the exclusion is granted in the fourth quarter, we anticipate a third quarter gross margin of approximately 35% that will reflect anticipated tariff costs of $11 million to $13 million as well as many of the same factors that also affected our q2 gross margin in a more prominent way. this implies an expected tariff-free fourth quarter gross margin of around 44%, which would include a reversal of all tariffs paid from the prior three quarters.
in terms of our 2021 operating costs, we expect full year operating costs in the range of $532 million and $535 million or 33% to $34% of sales. with that spend, we anticipate that our sales and marketing will range between 18% and 19% of total revenue as we begin moving our new e-commerce and digital marketing systems and tools into production and we direct our working marketing toward supporting our new product launches and strong sell-through during the holiday season. as a result, we expect an operating profit margin between 5% and 7% with anticipated operating income between $80 million and $110 million. as we adjust our spending plans, we expect third quarter operating costs to be 28% to 29% of total revenue with sales and marketing costs moderating from q2 levels. we expect q3 operating income margin in the mid-single-digits.
in terms of other major modeling assumptions for 2021, we still expect other expense to be between $2 million and $3 million. we are now anticipating an effective tax rate between 16% and 17%. as a result, we anticipate a full year eps range from $2.25 to $3.15 with an anticipated diluted share count of approximately 28.5 million shares. we estimate that the tariff exclusion will contribute approximately $1.05 to our 2021 eps on an after-tax basis. we anticipate third quarter eps in the range of $0.70 to $0.90. we continue to expect our 2021 capital spending to be in the low $50 million range.
on the use of capital front, as detailed in our earnings press release, we plan to execute an accelerated share repurchase agreement to repurchase an aggregate of $100 million of irobot common stock, subject to the terms of the asr agreement. we expect to fund the asr from cash on hand. we will share additional details via an 8-k when the asr is executed. our eps outlook incorporates the effect of the upcoming asr. we still expect that inventory both in terms of absolute dollars and dii, will fluctuate meaningfully from quarter-to-quarter as we continue navigating a challenging and fluid supply chain environment.
in summary, despite solid results over the past two quarters, our full year outlook has eroded as the shortage in semiconductor chips will leave us unable to completely fulfill anticipated second half demand. despite this disappointing development, it does not diminish the tangible progress we are making to advance our strategy and position our business for substantially better performance next year as those constraints ease. our upcoming share repurchase activity further demonstrates our confidence in our ability to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead.
with that said, i will turn the call back to colin.
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
thank you, julie. on our most recent quarterly conference calls, we've detailed our strategy to build a more defensible, profitable enterprise with a compelling value proposition that resonates across a growing, global base of loyal connected customers. by innovating to differentiate the irobot experience, we plan to continue winning more customers and keep them delighted at every turn to the point that they will buy more products and services directly from us over the lifetime of their ownership. we are optimistic that executing on our plans will drive substantial value creation over the long-term.
we've also shared our preliminary view that further progress on this path in 2021 would support continued top-line expansion that we can convert into substantially improved operating profitability and eps expansion in 2022. although the impact of constrained supply will make it more challenging to achieve our preliminary 2022 target of returning the business to our 2020 operating profit margin levels, we are confident that we can make considerable progress next year.
in terms of our 2022 top-line assumptions, we anticipate more modest revenue growth in the first half of the year as we take proactive steps to increase our access to semiconductor componentry amid fundamentally healthy demand signals from retailers and consumers. assuming our chip suppliers steadily ramp their production, as expected, we will look forward to accelerating revenue during the second half of 2022, anchored by substantial restocking orders from retailers who will carry very lean inventory over the next several quarters.
in addition to executing on our product roadmaps and leveraging our unique home understanding, we are also excited about the potential of our irobot select service, which we expect will begin to scale later this year as a growing recurring revenue stream. we also look forward to seeing the impact of our dtc infrastructure investments on growing existing customer revenue as we further personalize the online buying experience on our website and home app and focus on delivering the right promotions to the right customers at the right time.
as we plan for next year, we anticipate that other transitory costs that have spiked in 2021, namely raw materials, oceanic transport and air freight, should eventually revert back to more normalized levels at some point in 2022. these potential tailwinds combined with expected tariff relief, malaysia manufacturing at scale and our ongoing efforts to optimize our production and fulfillment costs, will leave us well positioned to drive gross margin improvement next year. by remaining very disciplined with our spending, we believe that we will convert our top-line expansion into strong operating profit gains and significant eps growth next year.
as we move forward, we believe there is a lot of opportunity in front of us. household penetration remains low, we have an expansive and growing global connected customer base and there are exciting new growth initiatives now underway or in planning stages. as a result, we believe that our exit trajectory for the second half of 2022 in combination with continued strategic progress will set the stage for sustaining solid annual top-line expansion that can be converted into improving double-digit operating profit margins, substantial eps growth and robust operating cash flow generation.
our confidence in our strategic direction and our ability to achieve our ambitions over the next several years is underscored by our upcoming plans to execute a $100 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. we will share greater insight into our business later this year when we host a virtual investor day event. in addition to highlighting our vision and strategy, our leadership team plans to share greater insight into the many exciting initiatives that will underpin an updated set of long-term financial targets. stay tuned for more details on this event.
that concludes our comments. operator, we will take questions now.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question or comment comes from the line of ben rose from battle road research. your line is open.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
good morning. first question for colin. i know that you -- excuse me, reiterated your plans to introduce two new roomba models later on this year. can you talk about how you plan to do that in the light of the chip shortage that you mentioned? is it a question of simply prioritizing the chips that are available or are there other factors at play that give you this confidence?
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
it's really about prioritizing the chips for these exciting new products. so that there is a lot of shared componentry across robots and making sure that we are able to execute aggressively on these new product launches is something that we have taken on. so that we have great confidence that the chips shortage will not impact those plan.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
okay. and with regard to the sales and marketing expenditures in q2, i understand that that is a very strong quarter in terms of seasonal promotion. but were there any additional one-time charge costs in there? and how do -- i know that, julie, you provided some commentary on the expectation for sales and marketing, but could you maybe give a little bit more color on the extent to which those can decline as a percentage of sales over the course of the rest of the year?
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. as we think and as we've gone through this year, ben, you know, we've been talking about the investments that we're making in our direct-to-consumer capability, both in terms of systems and then in the talent to enable those systems. what you've seen this year are those thoughtful investments that we have been doing. and again, in q2, we made some of those investments. what we've also been saying and continues to be true as we look forward, a lot of those are foundational elements that will not scale as revenue scales.
and so as we head into the back half of the year, there are two things at work here. one is the normal fluctuation in our working marketing aligned with promotional period. and then the other is those investments starting to become fully in place, and we're excited about the results that we should see there.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
okay. thanks very much. i appreciate it.
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure.
operator
thank you. our next question or comment comes from the line of asiya merchant from citigroup. your line is open.
asiya merchant -- citi global markets -- analyst
great. thank you for the opportunity. a couple of quick questions. can you guys give us any commentary on sell-through versus sell-in into the quarter across your different regions? and then just given the dynamics with chip shortages and promo activity, etc., if you have any color on competitive dynamics? were you experiencing any share loss because of the unfulfilled orders? were the unfulfilled orders largely domestic or were they international or was that more a global phenomena? and then lastly on inventory. obviously, you guys have the chip shortage situation, but the inventory spike was pretty significant. is that all components or planning ahead of the new roombas that you plan to introduce here in the second half? thank you.
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
okay. so the three questions. the first question was on share. sorry, on sell-through and inventory levels. so we definitely have been seeing a impact that in q2 that will -- that is increasing as we go through the rest of the year where demand from our retailers exceeds our ability to supply. that will drive down the retailer inventory levels. there is some impact in q2, and that impact should be seen as growing significantly in q3 in q4. so as we exit the year, the inventory levels with our retailers will be unusually low relative to normal.
the second question you asked was do these chip shortages impact our competition equally, and what is the impact on share. our competition tends to use a greater percentage of chinese local componentry which has slightly different availability dynamics, but it only takes one comment -- one component to stop you from building a robot. and even our competitive -- our competitors' designs are require componentry which will be hard to come by. so it's difficult for us to truly model what -- the extent to which they are going to be impacted beyond. we know they will be impacted to some degree.
so there is a little bit of a wait and see as it relates to what a transitory impact in q4 around share will be if they're impacted similarly to we are. we don't expect share to change from where it is significantly. if they have some additional availability, they might pick up a bit of share until we can reassert our in-stock capabilities. so there's a little bit of a tbd and transitory impact to share numbers that we'll have to work through in q4 and then move into next year as things start to normalize.
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and then your final question, asiya, was around the irobot inventory, which we ended with our own inventory at $277 million at the end of q2, and we tried to lay out some of the factors year-on-year as we looked at that increase. second half -- our efforts to support our second half volume requirements, that inventory is tariff as compared to a year ago. and then also those units that we were -- those orders that we were unable to ship through the end of the quarter remained in our inventory. as we look forward, we expect our inventory will fluctuate as we go through the rest of this year as we navigate through these rather challenging environments.
asiya merchant -- citi global markets -- analyst
okay. thank you.
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
yeah.
operator
thank you. our next question or comment comes from the line of john babcock from bank of america. your line is open.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. i guess, the first one, i was just wondering if you could talk about the irobot select service, how that's progressing so far? and also, what you've learned from the first few months since this has been available?
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
sure. i'm happy to. so we are in the preliminary stage of rolling out that service. i would say that we're very optimistic with both the net promoter of the customer, favorability of the service as we've rolled it out. we've seen very favorable low levels of churn. and that has led us to gain the confidence required to begin real scaling of irobot select, which we talked in the call about being increasingly visible through the balance of the year and exiting the year at a rate that we believe in 2022 it's going to be a material contributor that we will be able to talk about and starts to build our recurring revenue backlog. so all things, all systems green, irobot select thus far. and it's definitely one of the exciting tests that we began last year and now we're at a point of scaling.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got you. that's helpful. and then next question, are there any signs that the semiconductor chip shortage is getting better lately? i mean, obviously it sounds like it's perhaps more challenging now than 1q. but i mean, has that at least so far in 3q shown any signs of lessening or does it seem like we're still kind of on the downward slope here?
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
i think that it is certainly more well understood at this moment in time by both the suppliers themselves and the manufacturers who rely on the componentry. so we went from a situation of not really understanding how bad it was going to be to, ok, we think we understand it now. and many of the suppliers are working to try to make sure that the components they are able to produce are going efficiently to the manufacturers that they are choosing to support. and so that's kind of a intermediate step well investments are being made to bring more production capacity online as the suppliers recognize the bump in demand is not transitory and capital investments in increased manufacturing capability are good business decisions for them. so i won't say we're out of the woods, but we're at a period of fewer surprises and concrete action to improve.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. and then you also talked about considering price increases. obviously, you considered this back in 2019 and did take price increases on some of your products back then. do you believe the market is sufficiently different now versus back then with price increases might be better received?
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
i think that price increases we mentioned it because it is one of the tools that we are considering. i think we learned a lot from last time we did it. and should we decide to execute and take action with the tool, it will be done in a way that captures those learnings. so it might be more tactical and strategic or certainly being done in a way that we have more confidence in its success. so -- but it is only one of the tools we have in our cadre to ensure continued financial performance. and i would iterate that the backdrop against applying these different tools is a conviction that the supply chain and raw material costs disruptions we're currently facing are transitory.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. and then just last question before i turn it over. i was just wondering if you might be able to provide some more detail on the different factors impacting gross margins relative to the 2020 levels? ideally, i mean, it would be nice if you could provide some color on how much is from raw materials? how much of our guidance is from raw materials, transportation, tariffs and price mix? i recognize you might not want to get too specific, any color you could provide will be useful?
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. and i will be speaking both in 2020 and in 2021 in an assumption of a tariff free comparison. and so if you're looking in 2020, we were at approximately 45% gross margin. and our outlook for 2021 assuming tariffs exemption is 39% to 40%. certainly, the headwinds, and you've named a number of them, are significant in terms of increasing costs for ocean transportation, sourcing materials on the open market, increased raw material costs as well as increased air freight to make sure that we can get our products to our customers when they need them. that's a significant factor along with year-on-year pricing and promotional reductions, which we've been talking about, that's then are partially offset by the good work that our supply chain teams continue to do to take product cost out of our products. and so it's the net of all of that that gives you the walk between last year and this year.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. that's great. thanks. i'll pass it over.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question or comment comes from the line of derek soderberg from colliers securities. your line is open.
derek soderberg -- colliers securities -- analyst
hi, everyone. thanks for taking my question. just want to get a bit more color on your view around tariffs, colin. i guess, i'm wondering what's changed in the biden administration on trade policy? my understanding is that the u.s. trade representative, katherine tai, is more or less enforcing existing trade policy. has the office under biden picked up the pace of exemptions i guess since january or is this the first time they're considering them? i just want to get bit more color on what you're hearing and what's informing your view? thanks.
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
so what's informing our view is the fact that the senate passed legislation that called for the reinstatement of exemptions for companies that had previously received exemptions for all of '22 and all of '21. that bill is being taken up by the house and there is strong support for exemption language in the house as well. we just can't guarantee when that legislation is going to be taken up. and the ustr is -- could also up to act unilaterally independent of this legislation. and so that, in general, there is broad-based support, though the timing is uncertain. so we're kind of in a little bit of a wait and see, but we felt like it behooved us to include an assumption of an exemption based on our analysis that it was more likely than not. and that would convey the most accurate view on our financial performance.
derek soderberg -- colliers securities -- analyst
got it. and then is the exemption -- is that part of a larger bill with other stuff that could potentially muddy the waters in terms of bipartisan support or is that more of a stand-alone bill?
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
yes. so it would be part of a larger legislative package which would contain other things. that's correct.
derek soderberg -- colliers securities -- analyst
okay. got it. thanks.
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
you bet.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we have a follow-up question from mr. john babcock from bank of america. your line is open.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys. [indecipherable] any other questions, i guess. just first of all, what are the higher warranty expense in the quarter?
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so our warranty expense is a look at the trended amounts that we're paying as we see those costs come back. some of the issues that we've been talking about in terms of higher costs and logistics costs are things that would impact our warranty expense. so it's a number of factors.
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
just to give you a little bit of a feeling for pain, there are some situations where we previously could affected repair with a -- by sending the parts. and because of supply chain challenges, we actually have to send a robot. so it's a multi-factorial -- factor issue. but again, something we feel good about driving back to more historical level.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got you. and then just relative to back when you reported 1q earnings, has inflation situation changed there positively or negatively for raw materials and transportation?
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
raw materials have grown dramatically in costs, particularly resins. and we expect those raw material prices to maintain elevated for the balance of the year and we expect them to normalize at some point next year. but definitely, that's a headwind.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. and transportation, no big changes there, i guess?
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
and transportation as well, very similar.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got you. and...
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
it's all -- yeah, go ahead.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
sorry, didn't mean to interrupt. yeah. and then i guess, just my last question. i mean, it sounds like demand from retailers is going to exceed your ability to supply them in the back half of the year. are you able to charge more to help offset that? so in other words, while not raising the price of the robots, perhaps increase that spread with the retailers to help deal with that demand? i don't know if that's an option or not, but just kind of curious on that front.
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
we did mention price as one of the levers that we're looking at as we try to optimize the back half of the year, if there may be some situations where that could work. but we have -- so we are predicting very -- 8% to 13% growth. there is still a tremendous amount of robots to move, and it's a complex year. but that's one of the reasons why we wanted to mention price as being on the table as something we would consider.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. so it sounds like sort of price will be driven by the end market price that the consumer is paying instead of a change in the price that the retailers might pay?
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
certainly something we are considering and we'll try to thoughtfully use along with other levers to ensure that we're extracting as much profit out of the robots that we sell.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. really appreciate it. thanks again for all the details.
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
you bet.
operator
thank you. our next question or comment comes from the line of jim ricchiuti from needham. your line is open.
tyler bailey -- needham & company -- analyst
hey, everyone. this is tyler bailey filling in for james today.
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, tyler.
tyler bailey -- needham & company -- analyst
hey. thanks again for taking the questions. one question, i guess, just looking at the store close. did you see, i guess, relatively similar bump from prime days as in past quarters?
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
the prime day, it's a difficult question to precisely answer because last year prime day happened much later in the year. and year previously when prime day was similarly timed two years ago and the market has -- and the size of our prime day has grown substantially from there. so i would say that we had a very successful prime day. and we're called out as one of the top performers on prime day. but there is no normal or at least normal is changing every year. so i'm not sure how to give you a good answer there.
tyler bailey -- needham & company -- analyst
yeah. i appreciate the insight though. and then another question for me. i'm just wondering how i guess maybe just provide some additional color on your irobot as a service model? i know you talked about that last quarter a little bit. just wondering if you can provide any additional color, customer feedback. it seemed like have been going well. just wanted to get an update there.
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
sure. what we can say today is that the tests that we have run have been very successful and we are going to be significantly scaling our select program in the back half of this year and believe it to be an important part of next year. so we're not quantifying the numbers yet. something that -- again as it grows, we will be providing more color there. but as it's systems go, and we are actively scaling the numbers of customers that we're targeting it with our select program. so customer satisfaction is good, churn is low and well within our target ranges, this is a good thing.
tyler bailey -- needham & company -- analyst
i appreciate that. thanks. that's all for me. thanks for taking the questions, guys.
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
you bet.
operator
thank you. our next question or comment comes from the line of ben rose from battle road research. your line is open.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
i just wanted to ask one follow-up question for colin. a number of the competitors over the last number of months have been introducing vacuum robots with some new capabilities including remote monitoring. and curious to get your thoughts on just at a high level whether you think features like that are sort of something of a swiss army knife approach or whether they make sense to incorporate into a vacuum robot?
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
it's a great question with a long answer, because it all has to do with whether or not the features that are being added can be effectively used by the customer, whether the customer would value that feature and/or whether it's just more unusable complexity. people have put security cameras on robots before with no success. is it a bad idea? i think we can say it was a bad idea executed as it was executed when it was tried before.
so i think people are wondering what is -- what can they do, how can they go and further differentiate the robots, and our competitors like to just add stuff. our strategy is really around how do we make the experience of owning the robot one where you feel like you're more in control and you're able to get the robot to do what you want it to do, when you wanted to do it and have it operate the way you wanted to do it intuitively and effectively. so you feel like the robot is your partner in cleaning your home.
i would tell you, blindly adding stuff to the robot is going to have a negative impact in people's interest in the robots. so you'd really have to do it thoughtfully as part of a larger strategy that would bring customers along with you in order to succeed. so again, not a simple answer, but there's a lot of bad ways of just adding stuff to your product.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. thank you.
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
okay.
operator
thank you. i'm showing no additional questions in the queue at this time. i'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
thank you, howard. that concludes our second quarter 2021 financial results conference call. we appreciate everybody's support, your participation today. we certainly look forward to talking with you over the coming weeks and months. thank you, again.

operator
thank you for standing by, and welcome to the third quarter 2021 irobot corporation earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, mr. andrew kramer, vice president of investor relations. thank you. please go ahead, sir.
andrew kramer -- vice president, investor relations
thank you very much, operator. good morning, everybody. joining me on today's call are irobot's chairman and ceo, colin angle; and executive vice president and cfo, julie zeiler.
before i set the agenda for today's call, i would like to note that statements made on today's call that are not based on historical information are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. additional information on these risks and uncertainties can be found in our public filings with the securities and exchange commission. irobot undertakes no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or circumstances.
related to our financial disclosures during this conference call, we will reference certain non-gaap financial measures as defined by sec regulation g, including non-gaap gross margin, non-gaap operating expense, non-gaap operating income, profit and profit margin, non-gaap effective tax rate and non-gaap net income per share. we believe that our non-gaap financial results help provide additional transparency into irobot's underlying operating performance and potential. our definitions of these non-gaap financial measures and reconciliations of each of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measure are provided at the end of these prepared remarks and in the financial tables at the end of the third quarter 2021 financial results press release we issued yesterday, which is available on our website at irobot.com. also unless stated otherwise, the third quarter 2021 financial metrics as well as financial metrics provided in our outlook that we referenced on today's call will be on a non-gaap basis only and all historical comparisons are with the third quarter of 2020.
for today's call, our agenda will be as follows. colin will briefly cover the company's quarterly financial results, review important strategic milestones and outline our expectations for the remainder of 2021. julie will review our third quarter results in detail and offer additional insight into our 2021 guidance. colin will conclude our commentary with some closing remarks. after that, we'll open the call for questions.
at this point, i'll turn the call over to colin angle.
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
good morning, and thank you for joining us. we enjoyed a strong third quarter performance while executing on our plans and navigating a stressed and fragile supply chain environment. we generated third quarter revenue of $441 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year and ahead of our plans entering the quarter. our revenue performance benefited from the timing of orders that shifted from q4 into q3. the combination of higher than anticipated revenue, modestly better gross margins and prudent spending enabled us to deliver third quarter operating profitability of $48 million and eps of $1.67.
we've been pleased to see that demand for roomba has remained healthy. revenue grew in each of our major geographies, led by 15% expansion in emea, 5% in the u.s. and 2% in japan. roomba robots occupied eight of the top 10 best-selling rvc models in the u.s., six of the top 10 in emea and seven of the top 10 in japan. the excellent reception from retailers and consumers of our newest robots underpinned solid 14% growth from the mid and premium tiers of our portfolio.
direct-to-consumer revenue grew 13%. we are seeing existing customer -- existing connected customer revenue trend very favorably, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of our total revenue. overall, gross robot asps grew 3% versus the same period last year, while units shipped were relatively unchanged. we finished q3 with over 12.5 million connected customers, an increase of 60% from the same period last year.
over the past several months, we made important progress on executing our strategy to drive innovation and differentiate our products, build stronger relationships with our customers around the world and nurture value with them. in september, we introduced the latest upgrade to our genius home intelligence platform along with the roomba j7+, our first robot designed with genius from the inception. i'll spend more time on this milestone in a moment.
in october, we expanded our irobot select subscription service to include the roomba j7+. irobot select is now scaling quickly in the u.s., while its counterpart in japan, the irobot smart plan, is also enjoying strong growth. overall, we ended q3 with nearly 50,000 global subscribers with approximately 40% of these customers in the u.s. since launching irobot select a year ago, we have accelerated the pace of adding new subscribers from dozens per week to hundreds per week to over 1,000 customers per week.
last week, we announced a new partnership with bona to sell their hardwood and hard surface floor cleaning solutions alongside our braava jet m6 robot mop. this relationship underscores our ongoing commitment to provide our customers with high value accessories and highlights the opportunity to further expand overall accessory sales, which are up 33% for the first nine months of the year.
we also continued to make good progress in moving our new crm and related digital marketing tools and technology into production. with the implementation of new systems for our customer care teams, we are increasing call center productivity and effectiveness, which in turn is enabling us to optimize costs and raise overall customer satisfaction. looking ahead, our long-term success will be anchored around our ability to elevate our value proposition to consumers around the globe and further differentiate our robots in a competitive marketplace.
accordingly, i would like to spend a moment outlining why the innovation within genius 3.0 and the j7+ is so critical. we see consumer robotics following a similar path to personal computers and cellphones, in which the software that powers these products ultimately becomes the primary driver of consumer buying behavior. genius is critical to our ability to extend our technology leadership and ensure that roomba and braava remain the top floor cleaning robots with consumers worldwide.
with the newest version of our genius platform, we have taken a major leap forward in how we apply ai, machine learning and home understanding. powered by genius, the roomba j7+ takes the time to understand your cleaning preferences, learn your cleaning rules, ask for and respond to feedback and remember how to react in the future. it even recognizes and avoids cords and pet waste. we believed so strongly in our precision vision navigation technology to identify and avoid solid pet waste that we will replace any roomba j7+ that fails to live up to our pet owners official promise.
it is exciting to see that the superior intelligence of our robots is starting to emerge as a key differentiator in the marketplace. as we move forward, we plan to continue enhancing genius in ways that are aimed at enabling our customers to precisely direct where, when and how our floor care robots clean, while seamlessly integrating our products into their lifestyles.
many of the newest features and functionality within genius are unique in the marketplace, thereby enabling us to deliver a very satisfying cleaning experience that we believe will increase the likelihood that our customers will remain loyal to irobot over the long-term. and genius is more than a robot intelligence system, it is a home intelligence platform. we explicitly refer to it that way because our vision for irobot extends beyond robotic floor care. over time, we expect that genius will support our ability to build out a larger ecosystem by entering new adjacent robotic and smart home categories.
before we discuss our outlook for 2021, it is important to remember the wide range of challenges we have been navigating and the impact they've collectively had on our anticipated financial performance. more specifically, at the time of our q2 call, we called out the following developments. semiconductor chip shortage left us unable to fulfill a significant level of anticipated orders in the second half of 2021, and we adjusted our top-line outlook accordingly. in addition to scaling back our top-line ambitions, we also began implementing a range of cost austerity actions to mitigate approximately $55 million in higher than expected costs associated with sourcing raw materials, procuring the integrated circuit componentry necessary to produce our robots and shipping our products.
since our q2 call at the end of july, we have continued to manage through component inavailability challenges. we also are contending with longer shipping timeframes, delays in shipping and other related logistical issues that further threaten our ability to expeditiously fulfill anticipated q4 orders. given these dynamics, we have refined our fy '21 revenue outlook range to be from $1.555 billion to $1.59 billion.
our fy '21 expectations for operating income and eps have changed meaningfully since our q2 call in late july. beginning in early august and continuing through september, oceanic transport and air freight costs have escalated beyond what we had contemplated in july for the second half of the year by approximately $13 million. we are taking steps to limit the impact of these higher costs by further optimizing our second half channel activities, thoughtfully adjusting our hiring plans and refining our working media and limiting other discretionary spending.
in addition to incrementally higher shipping costs, our updated 2021 outlook factors in recent developments on the tariff front. up until earlier this month, we were optimistic that we would be granted section 301 tariff relief at some point during the second half of this year. this view was based on bipartisan activities to restore the tariff exclusion process, including legislation that was passed by the u.s. senate in june to reinstate tariff exclusions and extend a retroactive refund for any tariffs paid this year. while we were pleased that the u.s. trade representative recently restarted a targeted tariff exclusion process for section 301 duties, the current process is unlikely to be finalized and implemented before the end of this calendar year. additionally, while we believe we have a compelling case to have our exclusion reinstated, any exclusion granted under the current rule-making would only refund tariffs paid since october 12, 2021, rather than from the start of 2021. we remain actively engaged with key stakeholders in washington to advance our position.
with a tariff exclusion no longer likely for the year, our full year outlook adds $42 million to $43 million back into our cost structure. as a result, we now expect 2021 operating income in the range of $36 million to $55 million with eps ranging from $1.15 to $1.74. had the tariff exclusion been granted for this year retroactive to january 1, our eps performance would have been $1.24 to $1.27 higher and within the expectations we set at the end of july. although this development further depresses our 2021 earnings performance, we believe that taking any additional material cost reduction activities would substantially impair our ability to execute on our strategy over the coming quarters and derail our ambitions to drive long-term value creation. we move forward focused on successfully closing out 2021, while also advancing our plans for 2022 and beyond.
we are very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, and i will share some additional perspective on 2022 in just a few minutes. but at this point, i will turn the call over to julie for her financial review. julie?
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, colin. as andy mentioned earlier, my review of our financial results and outlook will be done on a non-gaap basis. so unless stated otherwise, each mention of gross margin, operating expense, operating income and operating profit margin, effective tax rate and net income per share will mean the corresponding non-gaap metric. all quarterly comparisons are against the third quarter of 2020 unless otherwise noted.
we reported q3 results that were generally better than we had expected at the start of the quarter. total third quarter revenue grew 7% to $441 million with the strong performance against our plans due largely to the timing of orders. geographically, revenue grew 5% in the u.s. and 8% internationally as emea and japan increased 15% and 2% respectively. from a product mix perspective, roomba robots and accessory revenue represented 90% of our q3 revenue with the remainder being braava robot and accessory sales.
we estimate that approximately 60% of total third quarter revenue came from e-commerce, which comprises our own website and app, dedicated e-commerce websites and the online arms of traditional brick and mortar retailers. our dtc revenue grew 13% to $40 million or 9% of total revenue. strong dtc growth in emea and japan more than offset a modest decline in the u.s. we expect full year dtc sales will represent 12% to 13% of total full year revenue in 2021.
our gross margin of 37% in q3 was better than expected by approximately 200 basis points, due primarily to favorable changes in promotional activity, timing of certain air freight costs that will now impact q4, leverage on our fixed costs and lower return rates. compared with last year's third quarter, our gross margin declined by 11 percentage points. more than 60% of the decrease was due to tariff costs of $14 million and supply chain headwinds. the remainder was split between pricing and promotional activity, higher warranty expense and unfavorable channel and product mix shifts.
third quarter 2021 operating costs of $115 million increased 8% and represented 26% of revenue. while we continued to fund key initiatives, we remained disciplined with our spending as we moderated working media, adjusted the timing of new hires and other personnel-related actions and carefully managed discretionary spending. our q3 2021 operating income was $48 million or 11% of revenue. our third quarter tax rate was approximately 2%, which reflects changes in our full year tax rate assumptions primarily associated with lower expected full year operating income. our net income per share was $1.67.
we ended the third quarter with $248 million in cash and short-term investments, a decline of $168 million from the end of q2. the sequential decrease primarily reflects the $100 million accelerated share repurchase program and cash outflows associated with changes in working capital, most notably accounts receivable and inventory. it is worth noting that our cash and short-term investments include a $30 million position in matterport, which became a publicly traded company this summer. this event resulted in a $27 million gain on our matterport investment and is reflected in other income in our third quarter gaap income statement. our matterport shares were classified as a short-term investment and they remain subject to a lock up provision until early next year. the value of those shares will be marked to market each month until the investment is sold.
third quarter dsos were 50 days, a 10-day increase against the same period one year ago, but slightly less than the third quarter of 2019. the increase reflects shifts in the timing of orders toward the back half of the quarter and a mix shift among our retail partners. q3 ending inventory was $354 million or 116 days compared with $218 million or 93 days at the same time last year. as expected, inventory remained elevated in the third quarter, which primarily reflects higher in-transit inventory as global supply chain issues extend shipping times across all primary modes of transportation. we expect inventory and dii will revert back to more normalized historical levels in the fourth quarter.
with the quarterly review complete, let's move on to our fourth quarter and full year 2021 outlook. as colin noted, we have been managing through a range of issues that have impacted our revenue and profitability expectations. in terms of our top-line, we have refined our 2021 revenue outlook within the prior range due to the combination of component availability and shipping-related issues. we now expect 2021 revenue in the range of $1.555 billion to $1.59 billion, which would result in annual growth of 9% to 11%. our updated full year revenue outlook implies fourth quarter revenue in the range of $445 million to $480 million. as a reminder, our revenue expectations contemplate yen and euro exchange rates roughly in line with current rates, plus or minus 5%.
in terms of our gross profit margin, earlier on the call, colin outlined the incremental transportation and tariff headwinds that will further pressure gross margin. for the full year, we now expect gross margin of approximately 36%. this updated view reflects anticipated 2021 tariff costs between $42 million and $43 million. had the tariff exclusion been granted this year and applied retroactively to january 1, our full year '21 gross margin would have been approximately 39%.
we expect a q4 gross margin between 30% and 32%, which includes anticipated tariff costs of around $13 million to $14 million. approximately half of the decline in our anticipated q4 '21 gross margin versus the fourth quarter of 2020 will be driven by higher supply chain costs followed by tariffs, changes in pricing between this year and last and shifts in product and channel mix.
in terms of our fourth quarter and full year operating costs, we expect a meaningful sequential increase in our sales and marketing costs as we invest in working media to drive holiday season purchasing. based on planned q4 spending of the high $160 million range, we are targeting full year 2021 operating costs of approximately $523 million or 33% to $34% of total revenue.
within our full year 2021 spend, we still anticipate that our sales and marketing costs will range between 18% and 19% of total revenue with research and development expense targeted at around 10% and general and administrative costs of approximately 5%. as a result, we expect a 2021 operating profit between $36 million and $55 million, which implies an operating profit margin between 2% and 3%. these expectations imply a q4 operating loss in the range of $17 million to $36 million.
in terms of other major modeling assumptions for 2021, we expect other expense of around $2 million. we are now anticipating an effective tax rate between 5% and 7%, which primarily reflects lower operating income. as a result, we anticipate a full year eps range from $1.15 to $1.74 with an anticipated diluted share count of approximately 28 million shares. had a tariff exclusion been granted in the fourth quarter retroactively to january 1, we estimate that our 2021 eps would have been between $1.24 and $1.27 higher on an after-tax basis using a higher tax rate of 17% on the assumption of higher operating income. we anticipate a fourth quarter net loss per share in the range of negative $0.63 to negative $1.24. we continue to expect 2021 capital spending in the low $50 million range. and we anticipate a strong quarter of cash generation in q4, which will enable us to begin rebuilding our cash position.
in summary, to echo some of colin's earlier comments, 2021 presented us with a number of unexpected challenges. while we will fall short of achieving our targets this year, we would frame 2021 as another year of solid revenue growth, outstanding collaboration across the organization to limit the impact of rising costs and component supply constraints and excellent execution to advance our strategy and position us for long-term prosperity.
i'd like to turn the call back to colin for some final thoughts.
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
thank you, julie. we are understandably very excited about our strategic direction and the potential we see to create substantially greater shareholder value. by advancing innovation to differentiate the irobot experience, we expect continued success in expanding our connected customer base. we intend to delight those customers from the moment they purchase our products and begin using them. we believe that a happy irobot customer will increasingly buy more products and services directly from us over the lifetime of their ownership. our highest priority r&d, commercial, marketing and operations initiatives are geared around supporting this simple, overarching strategy.
we are confident that continued execution will enable us to expand our business and create significant value over the long-term. as we work to refine our planning for 2022, we currently expect that our actions to improve supply chain resiliency will help us move beyond our product supply constraints in the second half of next year. we expect a higher revenue growth rate in '22 than 2021 as we anticipate improved supply will translate into a much stronger top-line performance in the second half of next year.
we are pleased with the trajectory of existing connected customer revenue this year and look forward to moving into production with a range of new crm capabilities over the next quarter or two. we believe that these new tools will play an important role in our efforts to further accelerate the growth of our existing customer revenue. we are bullish about the potential of our irobot select service and other similar subscription offerings outside of the united states. these offerings represent new ways for us to increase existing customer revenue, while also appealing to price-sensitive customers who might otherwise opt for a less expensive robot from the competition.
as we continue addressing -- as we continue adding thousands of new subscribers each quarter, we expect to exit '22 with a growing base of annualized recurring revenue. a major cost headwind next year will be higher transportation costs, which we expect will remain elevated through the first three quarters of next year. tariffs remain a wildcard. while we believe an exclusion is likely, it remains to be seen how quickly it can be granted. if tariffs remain in place next year, we expect that our '22 tariff costs will decline meaningfully from 2021 levels. our initiative to achieve scale with our production in malaysia by the end of this year remains on schedule, although there is more work for us to do as we finalize our product roadmaps and production plans for next year.
we believe that 2022 will represent a major turning point in our efforts to transform irobot into a more defensible, profitable enterprise with a compelling value proposition that resonates across a growing, global base of loyal connected customers. as we execute on our plans to expand our base and grow the lifetime value of each irobot customer, we plan to remain disciplined with our spending. as a result, our assumptions for next year include an expectation that our second half revenue, operating profit and eps performance will be meaningfully better than the first half. we are excited about what's in store for our company and our shareholders. we look forward to offering a deeper dive into key areas of our business and reintroducing our long-term financial model when we hold our investor day on thursday, december 9, 2021.
that concludes our comments. operator, we will take questions now.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of asiya merchant from citigroup. your line is open. please ask your question.
asiya merchant -- citi global markets -- analyst
good morning. thank you for the opportunity to ask a question. clearly, the challenges are unprecedented, and we've heard that from several of the companies that we track. if i may, i'm just trying to parse through all these comments on revenue growth being higher in '22, which makes sense given you have a bunch of unfulfilled orders still. if you could help guiding vectors and analysts, are we looking at a very back-end loaded -- i mean, even more back-end loaded than is normal for '22?
and then i have a question on margins as well. clearly, tariffs get some mitigation from malaysia into '22, but then you have these elevated transportation costs that you're highlighting. is it reasonable to assume that margins will be up significantly in 2022 or will they be down relative to '21? i'm just trying to parse through the comments to see if tariffs can offset or the mitigation of tariff to malaysia can help to offset -- can be offset with some of the other costs or transportation costs that you're talking about? thank you.
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
so i'll jump on the revenue question. so we see in the first half of next year, there's a few things that are impacting. but the challenge is getting all of the chips that we need to build all of the robots that the market would absorb will still be something we're working through in the first half of the year. and it only takes one chip to stop us from building a robot in certain circumstances. and so that when we think about first half, second half, working through those supply chain parts availability challenges will cause the first half to be lower in revenue than it would be otherwise. and that will have the impact of creating a larger back-end loading effect because we think that we'll have put those parts availability challenges largely behind us by the end of the first half.
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and then, asiya, if i add on to that with thinking about gross margins, and i would start with, as we talk through a number of these challenges that we're facing this year, we continue to believe that they will normalize over time. and so as we look forward -- and we have limited visibility in how that will play out, and we're still working through our targets for 2022. but if you think about some of the factors that we've been talking about, certainly, tariffs whether or not an exclusion is granted and the complementary move and scaling of our products in malaysia will be a benefit as we think through the going forward.
if you think about the headwinds stabilizing and then normalizing as we go through the year, and then of course, the work that we will continue to do in optimizing our channel strategy, all of those things will come together in our targets for '22 and will be part of building out a long-term financial model, which we expect to share with additional color at our investor day on december 9.
asiya merchant -- citi global markets -- analyst
okay. but if i may, i mean, i think the overarching question is, will margins see improvement into '22? just given all these things that you've put together, i understand all the -- there was an expectation that margins would improve...
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
that margins will be improved in '22. the headwinds are moderating in '22. the energy and the changes we're making to our business model are tailwinds to margins. and the -- and certainly, we will see an improving environment to execute as next year rolls on. so absolutely, yes.
asiya merchant -- citi global markets -- analyst
okay, ok. great. thank you for the clarification.
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
yeah.
operator
your next question comes from the line of mr. john babcock from bank of america. your line is open. please ask your question.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. i guess, just quickly to tag along on that last comment there. just when you mentioned that margins will be improved, is that relative to 3q, 4q margin levels or the full year 2021 levels?
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think you need to think about it in full year terms.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. and that will be gross margins or that would be operating margins?
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
both.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. thank you. and then just kind of back -- with regards to the irobot select service, could you talk about the investments that you've made to build out this program? and also what further investments will be needed as it scales up? and then adding to that, what competitive barriers exist that might make it challenging for your peers to build out a similar subscription service?
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
so the investments that we've had to rollout a subscription service, there's a lot of back-end investment to be able to service a customer, turn on turn off the robots, handle payments, make sure that churn -- involuntary churn is managed. and the irobot select service is definitely much more than just a rental program. there is services that are uniquely offered to robot-as-a-service to irobot select customers around getting accessories automatically sent to them, having dedicated resource if they have any questions with their robot. it's giving a real white glove experience, which has resulted in very high customer satisfaction with the service and very favorable churn rates that we've been able to see thus far. so we think this is an amazing way to sell a product. and i think that resonates well with consumers are frankly used to paying as they go for cleaning services in a home. so it's a very easy and familiar way of paying for this type of end benefit.
did i cover your question? i'm happy to act poetic about the awesomeness of description.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. no, i mean, i guess, maybe you probably answered it. but i guess, part of that question was also just around kind of the competitive barriers.
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
yeah, competitive barriers. so irobot's competitive strategy really centers around this growing differentiation in the intelligence of our robot. their ability to avoid getting stuck, their ability to offer users control over where and when the robots operate. irobot is unique in the marketplace with its ability to clean around an object in a room. it's unique in the marketplace with the ability to allow a user to schedule when a particular room could be clean much less a particular object in the room. and we've rolled out things where you can even have that schedule be automatically activated by simply leaving the house.
so this idea that the robot works around your schedule, and with the new precision vision navigation, be able to recognize objects on the floors that if they're there permanently, the robot can automatically add a, we call it a keep out zone, so that the robot doesn't go back there or if it's something you just forgot to clean up, it can actually tell you to go clean it up and then you can send it back to finish the cleaning job.
so this growing knowledge about your habits, about your home and with every mission having the robot be able to do a better personalized job, creates a stickiness with that customer, because if you ever left irobot, all of that knowledge around your habits and your -- the challenging areas of your home to clean and how to go about doing it would be lost. and so that we have this personalized intelligence-based differentiation strategy which dovetail very well with a subscription style sale process. and at the same time, with the subscription, we're lowering the barrier to invest in a robot that has this type of intelligence and capability. so it's an integrated strategy marrying intelligence with subscription to give a dramatically larger lifetime value on a customer-by-customer basis than a single anonymous purchase of a robot at a retail outlet.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. thanks for that color. and then, i guess, like next question i had, last quarter you mentioned that you were evaluating potential price increases. are there any updates on your thinking around that, particularly in light of the rising cost environment and your expected margin levels?
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
yeah. i mean, it's -- it continues to be dynamic. we definitely have adjusted how promotional we will be. we've adjusted how much we're investing in demand generation. the changes in discounting and promotion results in a material increase in asps. and then very, very tactically, we made some price adjustments. so we haven't done anything wholesale at this moment in time, but we definitely effectively increased asps through our commercial strategy.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got you. that's helpful. and then the last question before i turn it over. can you just talk about your work with the manufacturing partners? what opportunities might exist there to reduce your production costs, i mean, at least kind of looking at where some of your peers might be? i mean, it seems they might have more favorable terms. and so just want to kind of get a sense for how you're kind of working with that relationship and what opportunities are out there?
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
we take this very, very seriously and have established aggressive year-over-year targets for cogs efficiencies on existing products. we're very confident that if you look at like-for-like bills of materials that are robots are not more expensive to build. our robots do include componentry that our competition chooses not to invest in and that may include silicon parts with different commitments to security or reliability.
we put a lot of investment into sensing on the robot to ensure that the robot less frequently get stuck and can do a better job cleaning. so it's -- this is not a every robot is created equal. it's a situation where we make targeted investments in customer experience as we select what goes into one of our products. but to your question about manufacturing costs, we have very explicit opportunities every year for substantial improvements in cogs on our existing products.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, great. thanks for the help.
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
yeah.
operator
your next question comes from the line of ben rose from battle road research. your line is open. please ask your question.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
yes, good morning. to dive a little deeper into the status of manufacturing in malaysia, looking out to the first quarter of this next year, can you -- i guess, first question would be, could you speak to roughly what percentage of u.s. bound roombas do you anticipate will be produced in malaysia?
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
yeah, sure. as i mentioned in the call, we are on track to achieve the level of manufacturing in malaysia that we had targeted at the beginning of the year. that will be in 2022 about 80% of the product that is destined for north america. we're constantly looking at our product plans and how much of older product are we going to bring into market versus new product. and so that number fluctuates a bit. but at this point, we're 80% there.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
okay, great. and in terms of looking at the manufacturing costs, notwithstanding all the variables around supply chain componentry and transportation that you outlined in the call, is it your anticipation that perhaps by mid-year the manufacturing costs for roombas in malaysia will be somewhat similar to what you've had in china?
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
i think somewhat similar is the fair. there will be a slight premium, but it's going to be in the single-digits.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
just a single-digit difference?
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
correct. so there will be a single-digit premium for malaysia which is something that we think we can manage quite nicely.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
okay, great. and then if i may, a final question. colin, in your remarks in terms of the differentiation of irobot's product line vis-a-vis the competition given the anticipated advertising in q4, do you think some of your messaging might be around highlighting some of the differences and perhaps some of the shortcomings of the competitors relative to their inability to navigate around some of the objects in the home or not really fulfilling the promise of what a consumer robot should accomplish?
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
you will definitely see irobot starting to speak more explicitly about the differentiation based on the superior intelligence of our robots. we've been investing for a number of years in making sure that our robots are by far the smartest in the marketplace. and with the launch of the j7+, with its front-facing imaging technology, we're really able to demonstrate that increasingly obviously and talk about the customer benefits in incredibly clear way. so that's going to be a growing part of the irobot story.
and the growth and the power of genius i should note is not just for the j7+, all of our robots that are connected benefit in varying degrees from our technology. i mentioned earlier that our robots have the capability for example cleaning while you're away. that's a benefit that even our entry-level connected robots can benefit for. so i kind of tease that there is a moment in time when we start buying our pcs based on the hardware and started buying it based on what operating system that personal computer ran. i think that we're getting toward the point in the robot industry where the intelligence is such a differentiating and important factor that we can -- that customers will say, well, what software does that robot run and have that be an incredibly important part of the decision making process.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
okay, thanks. that's very helpful insight. thank you.
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
yeah.
operator
your next question comes from the line of mike latimore from northland. your line is open. please ask your question.
aditya dagaonkar -- northland capital markets -- analyst
hi. this is aditya on behalf of mike latimore. could you give some color on how the inventory levels are with your channel partners? are the inventory levels at an all-time low or does your channel partners have enough inventories with them? so any color on the inventory levels that could be helpful.
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. as we stand in q3, we believe that retail inventory levels declined sequentially from q2. overall, we think that as we look forward through the rest of the year, we will end the year with relatively lean inventory at our retail partners.
aditya dagaonkar -- northland capital markets -- analyst
all right. and regarding the revenue performance, i see the timing of the orders have benefited, a lot of revenue have moved from q4 to q3. could you give some color on what caused that?
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
one of the reasons why we give full year guidance is the perpetual challenge of following the line between q3, q4 when we have a tremendous amount of inventory in the ports, exiting factories, being unloaded, and because it's a period of high demand and simply the availability of ships or depending on how revenue is recognized, waiting to see which retailers except and pickup inventory when just creates a lot of challenge.
so that we have a -- it's not unusual for there to be some adjustments between that q3, q4. there's really nothing particularly interesting or material about a shift from q3 to q4. it's just our ability to call with precision how much is going to hit where. and this time we thought a little bit more would get into q3 and got pushed, which is -- sorry, got pulled forward. so probably the only time this year where we were overly pessimistic about the timing of shipping.
operator
your next question comes from the line of derek soderberg from colliers securities. your line is open. please ask your question.
derek soderberg -- colliers securities -- analyst
good morning, everyone. thanks for taking my questions, and really looking forward to hearing the updated long-term model at the coming investor day. colin, i wanted to start with you. i just wanted to get your thoughts on the industry growth rate for robot vacuums. how sustainable is some of this pandemic-driven demand as you sort of look into 2022 and beyond? and then as it relates to you guys versus the industry, i imagine, your competitors are having some similar challenges. but just curious if you think you guys are growing faster than the industry as a whole, either maintaining or growing market share across all price points or maybe just the high-end price points? and sort of in the past you've been pretty aggressive in prioritized growth and market share a bit, has that strategy changed at all in this tough environment?
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
sure. so we'll start with just reiterating that the robot vacuum cleaning market is underpenetrated, household penetrations are quite low from the 13%-ish of households in the u.s., which would be the most dense or most fully penetrated arena to emea and japan where those numbers are significantly lower. so the opportunity remains extremely large. we think that the opportunities is into the 20s and 30s as before we see any saturation effects in the marketplace.
irobot commands a very large share in all of these markets. so when you talk about, do you think we can grow share versus what do we think we'll do to maintain share, it's a difficult question. i would say that at the -- we've always focused first on winning and ensuring we maintain true leadership at the premium side. we make the smartest robots in the world, delivered in beautiful high performance hardware, our customers value that, and that's a winning strategy consistently in the mid-price points. with the launch of the i3 robot, we've really made a statement that we continue to be very aggressive in the mid-tier with our investments.
and then as we get into the lower price tiers, where competition has focused, it is reasonable to imagine some continued, albeit, slow loss of share down at the bottom so that our approach to defending our market share is not linear across all price points. but i would point out that our irobot select strategy, which we talked about earlier in the call, is an exciting way for us to be more competitive at the lower price points with our higher end products, such that we can deliver robots with these full implementations of superior intelligence and really get across the fact people -- the experience that, honestly they came to robot vacuuming expecting, that this robot could be set loose in their home and complete every mission and give the customers control over where and when they want the robot to act.
derek soderberg -- colliers securities -- analyst
got it. got it. i appreciate the detail. and then i just wanted to clarify one thing on the tariff exclusion. none of that is baked into any sort of guidance or commentary on 2022. and then more specifically is the thought that once we exit this calendar year, it's pretty highly unlikely that you're going to get an exemption for the period before october 12. and sort of if this new version of legislation is passed, would that likely exempt you guys from tariffs for the full calendar year 2022?
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
so let me try to answer as much of that question as i can. the current registry language around the exemption process is currently open for comments. so that means that it is not final as to what the exclusion process or what an exclusion will mean, that has not been finalized. the proposed language, if it stays as currently written, would grant companies which received an exclusion relief only back to october 12 of this year. and so that tariffs paid prior to october 12, would be lost or would not be refunded.
the exclusion language is currently silent on how long an exclusion would be for if it was granted. so i can't comment meaningfully on that. so we had a specific language in the senate bill which said all sorts of things we liked earlier in the year, but that language was not reflected in the most recent language presented by the ustr. so we're kind of in a holding pattern. we think the -- our case for being excluded remains very strong and we're optimistic. but i think that's all i can comment on at this point.
derek soderberg -- colliers securities -- analyst
yeah, that's fair. thanks, guys.
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
you bet.

your last question comes from the line of chris grenga from needham. your line is open. please ask your question.
chris grenga -- needham & company -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone. thanks for taking the question. this is chris grenga filling in for jim. on the direct consumer front, 12% to 13% of sales for [technical issue] anticipate that trending and what is driving growth there?
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
so the irobot continues to rollout more competent and effective tools for targeting. we continue to invest in growing our direct relationships with our customers, and increasingly, we're able to go back and retarget customers who previously bought robots. and of course, targeting someone who already owns a robot to get an upgrade or a second robot or accessories has significantly favorable economics than going and finding and bringing a new customer into the franchise.
so this is an area that we've been investing in. this is an area that we think will be a gross margin and gross profit tailwind, as we scale it. and is one of the very exciting dimensions of our new and growing strategy where we're able to deliver a product with this intelligence we've talked about before, create a long-term relationship based on the fact the robots luring their home. at the right time, go back to them for upgrades and be able to transact with them very, very efficiently because of the relationship we have with them and improve our profitability and lifetime value per customer. so this is something that we're very excited to see continue to grow. and you should expect it to remain a focus of irobot investment and strategy on a go-forward basis.
chris grenga -- needham & company -- analyst
great. thank you very much for that detail. and sorry, just one more for me. on promotional activity in q4, do you expect that to be in line with prior normal years or any departure there? thank you very much.
colin angle -- chairman, chief executive officer and founder
we're trying to size our investment in keeping with the amounts of product that we need to move, and so that using our investment dollars very strategically. that said, there is -- we have very significant ambitions for driving the amount of demand for robots. you will still certainly see plenty of irobot ads on television and on your social and digital platforms.

good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the q4 and full-year 2021 irobot corp. earnings conference call. at this time, all participants on a listen-only mode after the speakers' presentation, there will be a question and answer session.
[operator instructions] i would now like to have conference over to your speaker today, mr. andrew kramer. mr. kramer, the floor is yours.
andrew kramer -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, chris. and good morning, everybody. joining me on today's call are irobot's chairman and ceo, colin angle; executive vice president and cfo julie zeiler. before i set the agenda for today's call, i would like to note that statements made on today's call that are not based on historical information are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. additional information on these risks and uncertainties can be found in our public filings with the securities and exchange commission. irobot undertakes no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or circumstances. related to our financial disclosures during this conference call, we will reference certain non-gaap financial measures as defined by sec regulation g, including non-gaap gross margin, non-gaap operating expense, non-gaap operating income and loss, non-gaap operating profit and loss margin, non-gaap effective tax rate and non-gaap net income and loss per share.
we believe that our non-gaap financial results help provide additional transparency into irobot's underlying operating performance and potential. our definitions of these non-gaap financial measures and reconciliations of each of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measure are provided at the end of these prepared remarks, and in the financial tables at the end of the fourth quarter, 2021 financial results press release issued last evening, which is available on our website at www.irobot.com. also, unless stated otherwise, the fourth quarter and full-year 2021 financial metrics, as well as the financial metrics provide an outlook, that we reference on today's conference call will be on a non-gaap basis only, and all historical comparisons with the fourth quarter of 2020 and the full-year 2020. for today's call, our agenda will be as follows.
colin, will briefly cover the company's quarterly and annual financial results, review important strategic milestones, and outline our expectations for 2022. julie will review our financial results in detail and offer additional insight into our 2022 guidance. colin, will conclude our commentary with some closing remarks about our bright prospects over the longer term. after that, we'll open the call for questions.
at this point, i'll turn the call over to colin angle. 
colin angle -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, and thank you for joining us. despite a myriad of supply chain challenges, we delivered fourth quarter financial results within the parameters we outlined in october. we generated fourth quarter revenue of $455 million, even as shipping delays prevented us from fulfilling over $35 million in fourth quarter orders. although our gross margins were lower than expected, we manage our costs carefully to report an operating loss of $34 million and a net loss per share of $5.
for the full year, we grew revenue by 9% to $1.565 billion, with an operating profit of 2% of eps of $34. our 2021 performance can be best described as a tale of two halves, with outstanding first-half revenue growth and profitability, followed by a second-half that was shaped by ongoing supply chain challenges that impacted our top and bottom lines. more specifically, semiconductor chip shortages constrained our ability to keep pace with demand, especially for some of our most popular premium roomba models. in addition, our top-line performance was also hampered by shipping delays.
our 2021 profitability reflected the combination of lower revenue and higher component costs, increase transportation costs, raw material inflation, and tariffs. we made considerable progress during 2021 to execute our innovate get keep growth strategy, which we detailed during our recent investor day. i'd like to recap our 2021 accomplishments and review key 2022 goals against the backdrop of this strategy. on the innovation front, consumer robotics is following pcs, cellphones, and other sectors with software, not hardware is the primary factor for consuming consumer purchasing decisions.
irobot's product strategy is to win with consumers by delivering high-performance, beautifully designed products that are differentiated by the superior software intelligence of our genius home intelligence platform. genius took center stage as a sustainable competitive advantage for our floor care robots during 2021. on september,  updated genius help make the roomba j7 series our most successful new roomba launch in recent years. with only four months of sales, the j7 became a top-five selling us rbc in the us for all of 2021.
the primary difference between the j7 and its predecessor, robot, the i7, is its software. the product strategy is paying off. genius highest value capabilities are showcased in our premium and mid-tier room, and braava robot. sale of these robots grew 15% in 2021 and represent approximately 83% of our 2021 robot revenue.
with genius as a key differentiator, roomba has remained the categories technology and cheerleader globally and in each primary geographic region. i'm excited for what's in store for 2022. we plan to deliver two major genius updates this year, aimed at bringing greater intelligence, thoughtfulness, and personalization to our robots, and more insights to our customers. to fortify our mid-tier leadership, we plan to cascade certain premium digital features down into our portfolio.
in terms of new robots, we plan to introduce one new roomba model in 2022 and complete the global rollout so the j7 series in i1 series that began last year. we are also excited about our plans for the aeris air purifier products we acquired this past november. we anticipate rebranding the aeris portfolio in the second half of 2022, followed by the introduction of at least one new air purifier, along with initial integration of certain genius related capabilities across this product line. even as the rbc categories continue to grow, overall household penetration is still relatively low.
as a result, bringing new customers into our franchise, the [inaudible] of our strategy remains central to our success. during 2021, we continue to expand our base of connected customers who've opted into our digital communications by 44% to $14 million. retail continues to be a proven scaled and profitable channel for new customer acquisition. retailer and distributor revenue grew 18% in 2021.
we move into 2022 with a great opportunity to continue bringing new connected customers into our franchise at all price points. genius is fundamental to capitalizing on this opportunity because it enables feature and functionality that are unique to our products. since launch, the j7 has identified and avoided millions of cord socks and shoes, thousands of pet accidents, by sharing images with the owner, the j7 gets smarter after every mission. and as a result, the j7 mission completion rates are the highest in our fleets.
with our november, genius update, owners can copy their existing maps to new robots, 70% of users took advantage of this feature when prompted. we believe that this will help retain more users when they opt to replace the robot, or add a new one into the house, like when smartphone users transferred data and apps to a new phone. we expect that the global rollout of the roomba i1 series during 2022 will enable us to strengthen our position in the entry-level segment. having closed last year with about 74,000 subscribers worldwide, a key initiative for us in 2022 will be to continue scaling our robot as a service subscription operates globally.
after a customer buys her floor care robot, her goal is to make sure that they love it and use it all. that was the case in 2021, and we expect it to continue this year. quarterly utilization was consistent with 2021 at just over 90%. we expect to maintain consistently high utilization levels and strong nps scores in 22.
as we cascade certain premium genius features further down into our robot family, we believe that will further increase our stickiness with these orders. a major driver behind our long-term growth ambitions lies in our conviction that happy irobot customers purchase more products and services directly from us over the course of their ownership. and we made tangible progress on this front in 2021. we saw excellent growth in sales to our existing customers, we estimate make-up nearly one-third of our revenue.
in particular, we estimate that connected customer revenue grew 10% in 21 and represents 21% of total revenue. direct to consumer revenue increased 24% in 2021 and represented 12% of total revenue. our target 22 is to accelerate dtc sales into the mid to high teens as a percentage of our total annual revenue, as we drive more transactional activity from more connected customers. accessory sales grew 24% in 2021 and represented approximately 4% of total revenue.
we expect continued growth on this front in 2022, especially as we roll out new insights from genius that help orders properly maintain the robots. in 2021, we made good progress with the implementation of new marketing technology systems and tools. moving into 22, one of our highest priority growth initiatives is to move our entire marketing technology stack into production. this investment is designed to enhance the online buying experience on our website and app, and enable personalized digital marketing at scale to deliver the right promotions, the right customers, at the right times.
product diversification is intrinsically important to our efforts to further fuel existing customer revenue growth. our november 2021 acquisition of aeris expands our total addressable market and supports our ability to provide consumers with premium products that will keep their homes both cleaner and healthier.aeris contributed just under $3 million to our fourth quarter revenue. the integration of errors into our organization is progressing. overall, we expect air purification products to generate more than $40 million to 22.
looking ahead, we expect that our anticipated 2022 performance will resemble 2021 as a tale of two halves with top-line strength in the second half of the year. our 2022 revenue guidance ranges from $1.75 billion to $1.85 billion, which represents 12% to 18% growth over 21. we currently expect that approximately 65% of full-year revenue will be generated in the second half. and we are optimistic about our potential to achieve these targets for a couple of very important reasons.
first, irobot's 2022 annual revenue targets are based on maintaining our leadership in a growth-oriented category with a bright future, thanks to low double-digit growth in the mid and premium-priced tier. the rbc category grew 7% in 21, despite lapping a very strong 2020. the category average 17% growth over the past two years, which is in line with the category since 2017. just as important, there's considerable upside for further household penetration of these products around the world.
looking closer into our targets, we are assuming high single-digit to mid-teens organic expansion, augmented by several points of inorganic growth from air purifier sales. our organic revenue growth outlook at the midpoint is in line with irobot's revenue [inaudible] over the past two years. second, we are increasingly confident that our access to semiconductor componentry will improve over the coming quarters. our improved visibility reflects an ongoing dialog with our largest and most strategic chip suppliers, and meaningful progress in qualifying new components from both existing, and new suppliers.
in terms of our 2022 profitability targets, we expect modest non-gaap gross margin improvement this year, and full-year 2022 operating income between $44 and $60 million. based on these dynamics, by 2022, non-gaap eps targets range from $1.50 to $2, which would represent 12% to 49% growth over 2021. overall, we are extremely excited about our strategic direction. we believe that the second half of the year will represent a major turning point in our performance that will provide us with significant momentum going forward.
i like to spend a few minutes on our long-term financial targets, but before i do, i'd like to turn the call over to julie, for her review of our 21 results, and greater insight into our 2022 guidance. julie
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, colin. as andrew mentioned earlier, my review of our financial results and outlook will be done on a non-gaap basis. so unless stated otherwise, each mention of gross margin, operating expense, operating income and loss, operating profit margin, effective tax rate, and net income and loss per share will mean the corresponding non-gaap metric. our quarterly comparisons are against the fourth quarter of 2020, and our full-year comparisons are against 2020 unless otherwise noted.
irobot's fourth quarter 2021 financial results were within the ranges we outlined on the q3 call in october. total q4 revenue of $455 million declined 16%. in addition to semiconductor chip constraints that impacted second half 2021 production levels, we were unable to recognize more than $35 million in fourth quarter orders due to shipping delays. these delays resulted primarily from a combination of port congestion, labor shortages at warehouses, and a major snowstorm in the pacific northwest during the last week of the quarter.
the delays caused many of these orders to miss key promotional windows, although some were fulfilled in the first quarter of 2022. our commercial teams are working closely with retailers to sell that inventory over the coming quarters as they refine their 2022 promotional activities. geographically strong, 19% growth in japan in the fourth quarter was offset by a 29% decrease in the us and a 2% decrease in emea. from a product mix perspective, roomba represented 90% of our q4 revenue mix, with braava making up the remainder.
our first fourth quarter dtc sales decline slightly as strong growth in emea and japan was offset by lower sales in the americas as we left an exceptionally strong quarter a year ago. our gross margin of 27.8% percent in q4 declined 13 percentage points from the prior year and was below our target. the year-over-year decrease primarily reflected 5 percentage points associated with higher air and oceanic transportation. 4 percentage points associated with tariffs, with the bulk of the remainder split between changes in pricing and promotion, higher component costs, and favorable product mix, and sub-optimal absorption of fixed operational costs.
the lower than anticipated quarterly gross margin performance was largely due to higher than forecasted tariff expense, arising from the combination of higher component costs and changes in geographic production, as well as certain pricing and promotional activities. fourth quarter 2021 operating expenses of $160 million declined by 15% and represented 35% of revenue. the decrease primarily reflected disciplined spending during the quarter across the board, with the biggest drivers being adjustments to our working media, and to a much lesser extent lower program spend on certain r&d projects in the fourth quarter of 2020. our q4 operating loss was $34 million.
we had a tax benefit in the fourth quarter from adjustments to our full-year tax rate driven by lower operating income combined with favorable fdii, foreign-derived intangible income deduction, our fourth quarter net loss per share was $1.5. from a full-year perspective, 2021 revenue grew 9% to $1.565 billion. geographically, we generated 48% of our revenue in the us, which grew by 1%. international revenue grew by 18%, highlighted by emea's 22% growth, and japan's 15% growth.
2021 gross margin of 35.3%, declined 9 percentage points from 2020. two-thirds of the decline was split relatively evenly between tariffs and higher air and ocean transportation costs. the remainder was primarily attributable to product mix associated with shifts toward new products that have not yet achieved sufficient scale, higher component cost, increased warranty expense, and pricing and promotion. full-year operating expenses of $514 million grew by 6% due to the combination of higher personnel expenses associated with headcount, increased consulting to support certain r&d initiatives and the investments associated with our dtc and marketing technology initiatives.
operating income in 2021 was $38 million, and our operating margin was 2%. our full-year 2021 effective tax rate benefit was 0.4%. we reported 2021 eps of $1.34 we ended 2021 with $235 in cash and short-term investments, a decline of $13 million from the end of q3. the decrease primarily reflects our acquisition of aeris netted against our cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter.
fourth quarter dsos' were thirty-two days, an increase of one day from the same period one year ago. our year-end inventory balance was $333 million, or ninety-two days. in 2020, the year end inventory was $182 million, or fifty-five days. i'd like to spend a moment on this topic because the inventory balance is higher than historical norms.
as i mentioned earlier, q4 was particularly difficult due to both extended shipping time-frames, and supply constraints. our year-end 2021 inventory balance and dii increase was primarily driven by a meaningful increase in in-transit inventory, which added 22 days to our dii. we also put our balance sheets to work as we carried higher inventory balances, to maximize q4 capacity utilization at our contract manufacturers, and support end-of-life programs for certain products. work is underway to optimize our inventory, although we expect inventory measured in dollars and days will stay elevated over the next couple of quarters.
we believe improvement on this front in 2022, will be somewhat limited due primarily to elongated shipping time-frames. as a result, we are targeting year-end 2022 dii levels in the low seventy day range. with that said, let's take a deeper dive into our 2022 outlook. as colin noted, we anticipate 2022 revenue will grow in the range of 12% to 18% to $1.75 billion to $1.85 billion.
we anticipate approximately 65% of our full-year revenue coming in the second-half, with an expected first-half revenue decline of 3% to 8%,  and then anticipated second half growth of 26% to 34%. as we compare against a very unusual 2021, we expect 2022's first half second-half mix will resemble the way 2020 came together, when 67% of our revenue was generated in the second half. overall, 2022 revenue outlook assumes higher unit volume for robots, complemented by higher gross robot asps', along with $40+ million from our newly acquired air purification products. we expect that between 70% and 75% of our air purifier revenue will come in the second half of the year following the completion of our rebranding work.
as a reminder, and we say this every year, we manage our business on a full-year basis and encourage investors to focus on our annual targets. since the timing of orders is challenging to forecast, even under ideal conditions, and large orders that shift from one quarter to the next can cause material fluctuations in our quarterly growth rates. additionally, our revenue expectations contemplate yen and euro exchange rates roughly in line with current rates plus or minus 5%. we anticipate that our 2022 gross margin will improve modestly to between 36% and 37%.
there are a lot of moving parts, but at a high level, we expect that the combination of cogs productivity initiatives decreased airfreight, and reductions in warranty expense will be partially offset by higher pricing, and promotional activity, and increased ocean transport costs. in terms of tariffs, we currently anticipate $42 to $44 million in full-year 2020 to tariff costs. this is higher than our expectations in early december, and it reflects our overarching focus on optimizing total landed costs, across labor, materials, components, and tariffs. as we finalized our 2022 commercial plans, product roadmaps, and negotiations with our contract manufacturers in both china, and malaysia.
we now expect that up to 75% of all roomba robots produced for north america in 2022 will be made in malaysia. as we expand the range of robots produced in malaysia, and increase overall volume in the second half of the year, we expect our tariff costs will decline as we exit 22, and deliver meaningful savings in 2023. we are targeting 2022 operating costs in the range of $578 to $621 million, or approximately 33% to 34% of sales. the anticipated increase over 2021 primarily reflects higher personnel costs associated with plans, new hires this year and returning incentive compensation to historical norms, increased working marketing, and incremental spend on new r&d programs.
while g&a and r&d are expected to trend near 2021 levels as a percentage of revenue, we anticipate sales and marketing will be slightly higher than 2021 as a percentage of revenue. this reflects working marketing, returning to more historical levels to support our anticipated top-line growth. the build-out of our martech stack and adding the talent necessary to operate it. given our top-line guidance and spending plans, we currently expect an operating profit margin of approximately 3%.
in terms of other notable modeling assumptions for 2022, we anticipate other expense of around $2 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 3%. at these profitability levels, relatively small-dollar changes in pre-tax income along with the jurisdictional mix of those profits can cause meaningful changes in the effective tax rate. we anticipate a diluted share count of approximately $28 million shares. as a result, we expect our full-year eps to range from $1.50 to $2.
one quick note on our gaap eps assumptions, we recently sold our stock in matterport at the end of the lockup period. due to the decline in the value of this investment since the end of 2021, we will recognize an approximately $17 million loss in our first quarter 2022 gaap results, as other income slash loss. overall, our strategic investment in matterport delivered an outstanding return with a significant gain in our gaap results over our initial investment. in terms of other 2022 financial guideposts, our business remains minimally capital intensive.
overall, we expect 2022 capital spending to be in the low to mid $30 million range or approximately 2% of anticipated 2022 revenue. we anticipate that our cash flow from operations in 2022 will improve modestly from 2021 levels given our expected fundamental performance. in terms of some quick additional to one color, we currently anticipate q1 revenue of between $293 and $313 million, which would range from a 3% decline to 3%  growth. we currently anticipate a q1 margin in the low 30% range and tariff costs of approximately $8 million.
we expect operating costs to range in the mid 40% range. as a result, we expect our operating loss will range from $37 million to $44 million. our net loss per share for q1 is anticipated to be between $1.35 and $1.60. in summary, we managed through a very challenging second half of 2021, as component shortages hamstrung our ability to meet demand and made it difficult to absorb a range of higher than expected supply chain costs.
nevertheless, we delivered q4 within our prior expectations and made important strategic progress during 2021 that we believe will help us further expand our business, drive profit improvement, and fuel eps growth in 2022 and beyond. that concludes my commentary. i'll now turn the call back to colin for some additional color on the coming year.
colin angle -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, julie. as we've outlined, achieving our 2022 outlook is primarily based on improving our access to critical semiconductor devices, and accelerating production in the second half of the year, to fulfill the demand that we've been unable to satisfy. we believe that our second half 22 performance will serve as a springboard to achieve the long-term financial model that we unveiled at our investor day two months ago. more specifically, by 2024, we expect to grow revenue between $2.4 to $2.6 billion, increase gross margins into the low to mid 40% range, and deliver operating profit margin between 12% and 13%, expanding our eps between $759.25.
the underlying assumptions behind this long-term financial model are fundamentally sound and relatively easy to understand. we expect to more than double the size of our connected customer base over the next three years, and more consumers increasingly choose roomba and braava, largely because of the way genius delivers a new level of performance, and collaboration between our robots, and the people who own them. we anticipate reasonable growth at retail, with much faster growth in our dtc channel as an expansive, growing base of loyal irobot customers spends more money directly with us. we believe that our existing customers will buy more robots, accessories and other products like air purifiers directly.
we expect significant growth in our air purifier sales over the next few years, and candidly, we'd be disappointed if this is not a $150+ million  product category for us by the end of 24. we're committed to significant gross margin improvement. we anticipate that our tariff costs will shrink meaningfully in 2023 as we anticipate that the vast majority of our north america volume will be produced in malaysia. we also expect our gross margin will further benefit from the easing of supply chain cost headwinds, ongoing dtc expansion, and a relentless effort to achieve greater scale and efficiency across our operations.
in terms of our operating costs, as we exit out of 22, we plan to carefully calibrate our spending ways that will enable us to fund our most promising growth initiatives, while generating a point or more operating leverage each year. so dynamic will underpin our expectation for material improvement in our operating profitability and accelerated eps performance. we believe that our targets are both compelling and achievable. i know the entire team at irobot has worked incredibly hard over the past year to help move our company forward.
all of us are motivated by the opportunity that lies ahead as we build the future. it's exciting to see how our products are intelligently partnering with our owners to help make their lives better. we believe that our success in achieving the long-term financial targets that we've outlined will create substantial value for our shareholders, our employees, and our customers. that concludes our remarks.
operator, we are ready to take questions now.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from asiya merchant of citi. your line is open.
asiya merchant -- citi -- analyst
great, thank you for the opportunity. i have a quick question on the expectations, obviously for the year. colin, you talked about the semiconductor challenges. what's kind of baked in? what semiconductors specifically are you talking about that would ease in the second half that that supports your inflection and growth in the second half? and then i have a follow-up on the asp assumptions, i think if i didn't [inaudible] julie, you talked about asp also increasing in fiscal 22.
is that a function of mix shift going here? as you guys benefited a lot already in fiscal 21, from the shift to premium and mid-tier robots? thank you.
colin angle -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. so i'll start off you asked about the semiconductor chip shortages. this is something we've been aggressively working since the middle of last year, where we're putting in place much longer commitments with our semi providers to ensure a continuity of supply. some of the critical components include some of the microcontrollers, lower level microcontrollers that operates on the lower level functions on the robot, some integrated logic chips, which are frankly quite lower tech.
but because they use older manufacturing processes, the production of those components was more optimized and thus had less room to surge of demand was disrupted last year. and so that, this is a digging out of the whole of last year on semi, as required a lot of commitment to forward-looking demand plans in a way that we hadn't done in the past when we're optimizing for supply chain efficiency. and so what we're talking about is the plan for outcome of a commitment to supply chain continuity that we adopted last year, and so that the expectation that we will see the supply to meet the demand anticipated by our guidance is not wishful thinking. it is carefully architected on the backs of agreements we have with our suppliers.
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
great. and then, asiya, i'll jump in on your question on asps'. if i think about our aggregate revenue guide for the year, which is 12% to 18% growth, i think it's important to break it down into organic and inorganic growth expectations. so as we said in our prepared remarks, we expect in our guide high single-digit to mid-teen organic growth, coupled with several points of inorganic growth associated with our acquisition of aeris.
if you look then at that organic growth expectation, it is primarily driven by an assumption of increased units. but there is also an expectation that we will see some complement associated with a continued asp expansion, particularly as we look at the ongoing growth in the market that we've seen in the mid and premium tiers. as well, of course, with our mix of dtc.
asiya merchant -- citi -- analyst
ok. that's what i was getting to, if the dtc with a component of the higher asp. ok. thank you.
colin angle -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, yeah.
operator
thank you. our question comes from john babcock of bank of america. your line is open.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey. good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. i guess actually just a quick follow-up on that last question, just on the asp side of things. have you looked at the opportunity to potentially get some pricing on the margin to offset some of these cost headwinds that you're seeing? i mean, it seems like a lot of different categories across a broad range of products have been able to achieve pricing, and i recognize that your category is clearly competitive.
but i was wondering if even if you might be able to get like low single digit percentage increase that might not impact demand. just wondering the extent to which you could look at that and how you're thinking about that overall for 2022.
colin angle -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure, i'll take that. this is something we're continuously looking at testing in different ways. i think there's an assumption in some markets for some models in 2022, there is an opportunity in other areas that are more competitive, you can see things going the other way. one of the drivers that we have going for us in 22 is the global rollout of the j7, which is our most differentiated premium product in 2021.
that was in limited distribution and we were unable to manufacture. it was one of the robots that we were certainly chronically short of and needed to scale back our launch plans, because of shortages of that will be fully rolled out. as we think about category growth in general, the mid to premium tier products or segments of the marketplace actually demonstrated very, very robust growth last year. well, the entry-level saw actually some consolidation, and so that, this favors us as the premium player.
and also underpins our optimism around asps'.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. thanks for that color. and then as far as the guidance overall, could you just talk about what's changed in your thinking for 2022 since the investor day recognizing, obviously that those were preliminary targets.
colin angle -- chairman and chief executive officer
you know, i don't think anything has changed from the investor day. i think, to the full-year numbers are consistent with what we conveyed on investor day. i think that the additional color that we're giving today is this tale of two cities, or tale of two halves that we did our best to foreshadow on investor day. and now we are quantifying just the impact of the tail end of the supply shortages significantly impacting the first half, and then the acceleration we're excited to enjoy in the second half.
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and then, john, i agree with what colin said. i'll just add on there. certainly, and we talked about this in our prepared remarks. overall, tariff assumptions changed from december, but i think it's important to note that as we looked to balance a number of factors, our expectation around gross margins is still in line with what we talked about.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. great. and then just last question before i turn it over. as far as revenue from existing customers, when customers come back, are they tending to buy replacement robots? or are they upgrading to more premium robots or buying accessories? any color you can provide on that would be helpful.
colin angle -- chairman and chief executive officer
you know, i can't quantify it with a exact percentages, we don't disclose that, but in general, repeat customers are more likely to buy more premium robots. this is part of the journey that customers take. as you have more experience with your robot, your desire to have that robot have superior mission completion, superior abilities to avoid obstacles, and have more precision control because you simply understand the benefits of those features more fully is a driver of this repeat purchase laddering up of a premium to man.
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and then just to add on to that, i would say that if you take one thing away, it's the opportunity that exists, and that we've been highlighting in the last number of quarters with our existing customer base, even taking something like accessories where, as we said in 21, we enjoyed good growth, 24%, but it still represented a very small piece of our overall revenue base. so as we move those new marketing technologies into production, as we are able to more seamlessly interact with those connected customers, there's opportunity for us across a number of fronts.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. and next, we have [inaudible] of needham and company. your line is open.
unknown speaker
hi, good morning, thanks for taking my question. could you talk a bit about the factors that contributed to the headwind in e-commerce? is that primarily supply chain? and then on specifically on dtc, do you expect to see sequential growth following the nice gains in connected customers in the q1, q2? thank you.
colin angle -- chairman and chief executive officer
we do expect gains in dtc. it's based on just the math underlying the continued growth in our connected base. i mentioned it's up 44% 21 over 2020, and we continue to see strong additions to that base. then multiplied by as we bring our new marketing tools online, improvements in conversion rate, and then further augmented by the addition of the errors product line as an opportunity to increase basket size.
so the dtc performance of the company will grow throughout 2022, and we're expecting pretty significant improvements in the dtcs' contribution to our overall revenue. 2020 q4 was a really hard comp for 2021, just because of the dynamics of that year, and certainly, supply did not help either. so, we're coming off to very, very unusual years in 2020 and 2021. but we were proud and excited about the performance in q4 to dtc, and look forward to unleashing the power of the investments we've made against the growing customer base this year.
unknown speaker
great, thank you. and recognizing that it's still early days for the subscription service effort, but any update or any color that you can provide that over the quarter. that'd be great. thank you.
colin angle -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. i think that we remain very excited about subscriptions. we continue to scale at a modest rate, the availability, and marketing dollars behind driving subscriptions as we gain more confidence in the underlying financial kpis' that will ultimately allow us to speak very specifically about expectations. so no update explicitly on this earnings call.
i think you should expect to hear more from us later in the year around subscriptions as we have a bit more data. but i can say we remain excited and optimistic about the role subscriptions will play going forward.
unknown speaker
great, thank you very much.
operator
thank you. and next we have, ben rose of battle road research. your line is open.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
thank you, and good morning. question for julie, with respect to transportation and logistics costs, since we're almost halfway through q1, is there any indication that some of those costs are easing up, particularly working back relative to q4, when there may have been a big rush to get lots of products in before the holiday season?
julie zeiler -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, it's a great question, and it's one we look at closely. i would say as we look at ocean transportation, we have seen small examples of goodness. but overall, i would say the pricing that's out there, and what we're seeing in terms of expectations is consistent with what we've provided as guidance. it remains a very challenging environment.
colin angle -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, it's something that if these bright spots continue to grow, we could talk about that. but at this point, they're only anecdotal and well, north america looks to be vectoring positively. there's some negative signs in shipping costs to emea. so we're comfortable with our current expectations.
our fingers are crossed that we'll see some systemic and model-level improvements over this year.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
ok. thank you for that clarification. and with regard, colin, to the 2024 guidance with respect to revenue. just want to be clear, is that based on products and categories that you're in right now? or does it assume some incremental contribution from new product categories or any other acquisitions?
colin angle -- chairman and chief executive officer
it does not include new categories or new acquisitions beyond the progress of rolling out the aeris air purifier business, as we describe. so we're hoping to get that over $40 million this year. it will benefit from the branding, from the genius corporation, and from the growth in our capabilities, and connected customer base, which will continue all throughout this year.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
ok. great. and if i may just one more question with regard to the current case that's being examined by the itc, is there any update that you might provide with respect to your expected timeline of it concluding?
colin angle -- chairman and chief executive officer
we expect to have a indications of a verdict at the end of april. so that we should have more to say at that point in time until then, it's an ongoing activity and i have no further update.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
