daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, juris. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 results. while 2020 has been categorized, by many, as unprecedented and challenging. for the shyft group, it was historic and transformational.
as we strategically align our product portfolio toward more profitable growth markets. starting with the sale of our er business. the shyft team showed immense resilience. i cannot be more proud of their hard work and tremendous effort as we executed on our strategy and delivered a remarkable year.
we invested in innovation with the launch of velocity, our purpose-built walk in van delivery band vehicle and is supporting our customers' growing interest in transitioning to ev technology. we continued with our m&a initiatives, completing our key acquisition in 2020 that expanded our product offerings in the service truck body market. we strengthened our leadership team and added key positions throughout the organization to support our growth as well as adding several highly qualified directors to our board. as we continue to evolve, we are optimistic as we enter 2021 and are more prepared than ever to proactively address opportunities, prioritizing the needs of all of our stakeholders in a way that reflects our goal to be nimble, aggressive and positioned to win.
we have emerged from 2020 in a stronger position and are well equipped to drive growth across our businesses for years to come. please turn to slide 4, where i'll discuss the current environment. consumers continue to embrace e-commerce at accelerated rates, driving increased demand in parcel delivery and establishing a new normal or delivery capacity. this demand has required our customers to increase their delivery vehicle fleet size, which has reflected in our backlog as we ended 2020 with nearly $500 million, up 40%, which provides us with good visibility as we head into 2021.
to help our customers meet this growing demand, during the fourth quarter, we began taking orders for the velocity f2, a purpose-built walk in van design for the ford transit class 2 chassis. this innovative new vehicle is an ideal solution for parcel delivery fleet operators that want to expand their fleet and delivery capacity quickly and complements the velocity f3 and m3 vehicles, providing our customers alternative solutions to meet their needs. and in january, we announced velocity f2 orders totaling 3,000 units from several customers for delivery this year. we are scheduled to begin delivering on these orders later this month from our newly upgraded flexible manufacturing facility located in charlotte, michigan.
the adoption of this vehicle is a great example of our work-driven design methodology, where we listen to our customers' needs, design, engineer and implement a solution. in this instance, our engineers hit it out of the park as we fulfilled our customers' demand for a more versatile and efficient delivery vehicle. we continue to make investments in support of our flexible manufacturing strategy which allows us to expand product offerings geographically and to rebalance our infrastructure to support higher levels of growth over the long run. we are introducing truck body manufacturing in kansas city, and service body capabilities at our florida and michigan locations, which includes the addition of a new chassis pool.
we continue to expand our ev capabilities and continue to invest in this area to proactively address our customers' mandate to advance adoption of green vehicles in the last mile delivery segment. to that end, we are excited about the progress the oems have made, in particular, the ford transit bev coming out later this year. i would take a moment to address what we are seeing with respect to the availability of semiconductor chips used in vehicle manufacturing, which has been heavily publicized recently. to date, we have seen very little impact on our operations.
however, it may be a bit too early to assess the full impact of these shortages, and we will continue to monitor and keep you apprised of changes. our luxury motor coach business continues to perform well, benefiting from the resurgence of the rv industry, as did our service body business resulting from the royal truck body and duramag acquisitions, ramping up nicely since the peak of the pandemic. the team at duramag, which we acquired last october, hit the ground running, and our integration efforts are well under way. we quickly partnered with their management team to make improvements in production flow that has resulted in additional output and cost reductions.
together with royal truck body, we continue to be excited about the value creation opportunities these companies provide. with that, let me take a moment to summarize our full-year results on slide 5. for 2020. we posted solid results despite the significant impact of the pandemic.
once again, our results demonstrate the success and effectiveness of our business transformation strategy, which encompasses growth in higher-margin product offerings within our core markets, increasing market share, within our expanding geographic footprint and ongoing productivity improvements within our operations. revenues for 2020 increased $10.9 million or 2% to $676 million, excluding the ups order. adjusted ebitda for the year increased $12.3 million or 19% to $76 million on our adjusted ebitda margin -- sorry, and our adjusted ebit margin improved 280 basis points to a record 11.3%, clearly reflecting the power of our business transformation efforts. with that, i'll turn the call over to jon to discuss shyft's financial results for the fourth quarter in more detail as well as provide our 2020 outlook, beginning on slide 6.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
thank you, daryl, and good morning, everyone. please turn to slide 7, and i'll provide an overview of our financial results for the fourth quarter. as daryl indicated, 2020 was a fantastic year for the shyft group. while our fourth-quarter financials declined year over year, our performance exceeded our expectations.
we generated significant cash flow from operations and saw an increase in orders that resulted in a sizable year-over-year backlog increase, positioning us well as we enter 2021. revenue for the fourth quarter was $171.6 million, down slightly from the year ago quarter. income from continuing operations was $8.3 million compared to $14.3 million a year ago. earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.22 per share compared to $0.40 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019.
turning to slide 8. q4 adjusted ebitda from continuing operations decreased to $16 million from $23.6 million, while as a percentage of sales, adjusted ebitda from continuing operations declined to 9.3% of sales compared to 13.1% of sales in the same period last year. for the fourth quarter, adjusted net income from continuing operations was $10.1 million, a $6.4 million decrease from $16.5 million a year ago. and adjusted eps from continuing operations was $0.27 per share compared to $0.47 per share at this time last year.
next, we'll jump into results by operating segment. let's begin with fleet vehicles and services on slide 9. our fes business posted solid results for the quarter and full year, while working closely with customers in a dynamic environment that ultimately resulted in significant order activity. fes generated total revenue of $112.4 million compared to $132.5 million a year ago.
the decline was primarily due to lower cargo van upfit volume. truck body revenue was also down versus a year ago, but improved sequentially as expected, following pandemic headwinds in the second and third quarters. in addition, it's important to note that fourth-quarter revenues were also impacted by the acceleration of vehicles into q3 as we supported our customer demand, which we discussed in the prior call. fes adjusted ebitda declined to $16.6 million from $21.1 million a year ago.
on a percentage basis, adjusted ebitda margin decreased 110 basis points to 14.8% of sales, driven by lower volumes and product mix as well as investments required to support the increase in volume expected in 2021. our backlog position was incredibly strong as we closed out the year. the pickup in order activity that we noted on our q3 earnings call continued throughout the quarter, resulting in a record backlog of $427 million, which was up 40% first prior year. please turn to slide 10 for the specialty vehicle segment overview.
specialty vehicles had a good finish to the year as well, with the second consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth in motorhome, and the completion of the duramag acquisition. similar to our fes business, we saw favorable commercial demand that positions us well entering 2021. sales of $59.2 million, an increase of $11.8 million or 25% was primarily driven by a 30% increase in luxury motor coach chassis volume as well as the addition of revenue from the duramag acquisition, partially offset by lower contract manufacturing volume and lower royal truck body revenue due to the impact of covid. organically, the business grew 8% in the quarter.
adjusted ebitda was $6.9 million or 11.6% of sales compared to $6.9 million or $13.9 million -- or 13.9% of sales in the same period last year. as cost productivity was offset by the unfavorable mix impact of higher motor coach volume, integration-related expenses and lower efficiencies due to covid. sv backlog was up 67% to $51 million, which included strong growth in motorhome chassis backlog as well as the backlog from our service body acquisitions. please turn to the liquidity and outlook.
update on slide 11. throughout the year, the team did a fantastic job managing cash flow and investing in our future. we generated $66 million of cash from operating activities, ending the year with $21 million of cash on hand and $147 million in total liquidity. we paid down $65 million on our revolving credit facility.
our current leverage ratio stands at 0.4 times adjusted ebitda, which positions us well to fund our operations and to continue to invest in our growth strategy. we also returned $11 million in cash to our shareholders in 2020 in the form of our regular dividend and the repurchase of 300,000 shares. we have subsequently purchased an additional 100,000 shares in q1, taking our total purchases to 400,000 shares over the last four months at an average price of $27 per share. we are extremely proud of our overall performance, given the significant challenges we faced this year.
as we enter 2021, our backlog is solid, and we are increasingly optimistic regarding the underlying strength of our end markets. given these factors, we are excited to introduce our 2021 guidance. we expect to see significant growth with both revenue and profits up approximately 30% year over year, with revenue in the range of $850 million to $900 million, adjusted ebitda of $95 million to $105 million and adjusted eps of $1.65 to $1.85 per share. to support this growth and our future production needs, we expect capex for 2021 to be in the range of $20 million to $25 million as we plan to make additional investments for velocity vehicle production and to support other growth initiatives.
now i'll turn the call back to daryl for closing remarks.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, jon. despite the many varied challenges 2020 brought, we had an incredibly successful year. i want to reemphasize how proud i am of the hard work, dedication and commitment to excellence demonstrated by our team throughout this unusual year. when we faced an adverse economy within an environment characterized by fear and uncertainty, our team rose to the occasion.
this week, in recognition of their hard work and relentless commitment to the business and our customers, we awarded all of our employees a special $500 bonus. as we move into 2021, we are excited by the power and earnings potential of our newly transformed and evolving company. we will continue to invest in new products and markets with increased focus on ev in response to our customers' request in the last mile delivery space, and we will make prudent choices on m&a opportunities that will deliver shareholder value for years to come. with that, operator, we are ready to take the q&a portion of the call.

[operator instructions] the first question comes from mike shlisky of colliers securities. please go ahead.
mike shlisky -- colliers securities -- analyst
ok. good morning, guys. so i just want to get a little color on the very near-term outlook here in the first quarter largely on the margin side. actually, on both, the revenue and the margin side.
are there any concerns we should be thinking about as far as the price of steel in the near-term availability of chassis from any of the oems in the kind of near term? or do you think this will be somewhat normal seasonality for you this year?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
yes. i think -- this is jon. i think as we start off the year, i would expect normal seasonality. i think the q1 will look somewhat similar to q1 of last year.
in terms of aluminum and steel pricing and commodity pricing in general, we certainly are monitoring this on a regular basis. we have, i think, discussed in the past, talked about inflation on labor side of things as well, which will be a bit of a headwind for us this year. but on aluminum -- and in particular, we feel like we're in good shape here, certainly through the first half of the year and out into the second half of the year. i think from a chassis perspective, we've seen little impact, i think, as daryl noted, we'll continue to stay close to it with our customers, but we don't see any short-term impact here in the first quarter, probably in the first half.
mike shlisky -- colliers securities -- analyst
great. thanks for that. can we switch over to the -- some commentary on the ev market. i'm just kind of curious, at this point, you're offering both in certain models, at least.
i'm kind of curious, what are some customers telling you about their desire to adopt evs in 2021 in general? and do you think that we're at any kind of tipping point or change over point over the next couple of quarters?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yes. mike. this is daryl. i'll take this.
i think we're going to stay consistent with what we've talked about in the past. we believe ev is coming. i think there's been some recent changes by some of the oems on how they will allow conversion of their ice vehicles to ev that i think is going to have a little bit of a problem for some of the ev start-ups. but we're still in a good position.
we continue to have requests from our customers right? and they continue to get stronger for us to play a bigger role in ev on their vehicles because they're not seeing -- they're not having anyone meet their needs in the market today. so i think over the next probably three quarters or so, maybe by the end of the year, we're going to continue to work with our customers and understand their needs more closely. and understand what they're not seeing. and we have a good idea, but we're looking for some type of a partnership with them if they want to get serious about it with us.
other than that, we're still offering all the products we have. we're excited about the ford transit bev. and i think it's playing out as we expected.
mike shlisky -- colliers securities -- analyst
ok. and then just switching on to the velocity f2. i just want to get a feel for if -- you've got some orders for it now. are there orders that you're not getting on a different product? or is this more of a white space for you? and i'm just kind of curious, also what's the capacity of that vehicle compared to the f3 or other categories that you currently offer? could it pull from your primary cargo van business with that for transit?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think, mike, the -- we're excited about the orders. we're excited about -- continue to be excited about conversations we're having. the vehicle is not cannibalizing any other volume we have that we've seen.
and i think you can see that in our backlog, right? it's additive in all respects. and the capacity in that facility, we have another shift we can add on if needed. and then if it continues to accelerate from there, whether it's the velocity, whether it's our walk in van or it's the upfit we do. i think the team has proven the last three years that we are flexible.
we can adjust with our customers' needs. and we can do that better than anybody in our space. and we've proven it, so we will -- if we need an additional volume, we have locations. we talked about some of the things we're doing, moving service body down into florida and then moving truck body into kansas city, right, which is all based on our backlog and the increase we're seeing.
so our move, years ago, probably three, four years ago, to start building flexible manufacturing facilities is starting to reap its benefits right now.
mike shlisky -- colliers securities -- analyst
great. thanks so much. i'll pass along.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, mike.
operator
the next question comes from steve dyer with craig-hallum. please go ahead.
steve dyer -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
thanks. good morning, guys. fvs backlog was up pretty significantly sequentially. is there any sort of large customer or overwhelmingly large order in there? or is it fairly well spread out?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
yes. i think the -- probably won't get specifically into customers. but i think a big driver of that was a velocity order, which was in the backlog at the end of the year. and to daryl's point, we saw the incremental volume from that.
and it's reflected in that number.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yes, steve, i'd also say that i think you're -- we talk about it, there's a lot of questions due to covid in q2 and q3. and i think some of our investors were frustrated by us saying, hey, we're meeting with them. they're going to come. and i think the backlog is showing what we were talking about, it's coming.
and i think there's -- as this -- they continue to understand the market and how people are going to continue to buy online. i don't know about you, but i saw more rental vehicles being used by our fedex, ups, amazon and others, to deliver vehicles this year than ever before, and we've heard that from them as well. so the order -- the backlog is dispersed. i think we're seeing it from at least two of the bigger delivery customers.
and we have some talks with the third on some things for this year.
steve dyer -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
got it. and then any update, i know you've, i think, been piloting some things around food delivery with a refrigeration unit on them, etc. anything sort of new to report on the food delivery piece of things?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
now we continue to refine our product based on customer feedback, working with different companies to try to give them the most economical and efficient refrigeration unit they can get it to their specs. and i think, as i talked before, this is a new space. it's just going to take a little bit longer to understand exactly how they're going to use the vehicles. so we're continuing to have dialogue and supply different rev levels of vehicles as a test.
steve dyer -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. and you touched on the flexible manufacturing. just kind of curious, as you look at your capacity, both in terms of raw amount of capacity and what you have and where in the country you have. are you still looking to sort of add there? i know you've kind of put a ring around the country in the last two, three years.
but where are you as it relates to additional capacity geographically?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
i think if you go back and look, we've added capacity in florida. it's another facility. we've added capacity in kansas city. we made an acquisition up in maine with f3.
we move some things around in charlotte to give us some space velocity. so i think it's a very good question, because right now, i think we are pretty much out of space. so the next move would have to be some type of additional facility. and that's some of the capital that we're expecting to have this year as volume continues to grow.
steve dyer -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
and then just lastly for me, and i'll hand it over. as it relates to acquisitions, you still sort of have your eye out for the right strategic fit? or any color there would be helpful as to sort of your appetite?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we -- i think everybody understands last year was a little slow. and this year, we're starting to see more activity. we're still looking for the third leg, if you will, larger acquisition, but there are a number of ones that were actually were close to one and then decided that, that wasn't the right fit right now.
so we moved away, but there's plenty on the table that we're looking at and look forward to some more activity before the end of the year.
steve dyer -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
got it. congratulations, guys. thanks.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
the next question comes from felix boeschen of raymond james. please go ahead.
felix boeschen -- raymond james -- analyst
hey. good morning, everybody. i was just hoping to start with a quick point of clarification. the backlog number on fleet vehicles was obviously very, very strong.
just to clarify, was the full 3,000 velocity order included in that backlog number as of 4q '20?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
that's correct.
felix boeschen -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. ok. and then maybe just one last question on the velocity, daryl. i mean from a bigger picture standpoint, can you just talk to us a little bit about the shift toward lower vehicle sizes, specifically in the parcel market.
i think it's been happening for a while, but it seems like that should be a big tailwind for the velocity. just curious if you could update us on how customer conversations have tracked kind of over the first three months of the year here?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and good question, felix, it actually started, right, after we rolled this out, helping them understand the benefits. we've talked before that the fuel efficiency is double the typical class 4 walk-in van. and the payload is very similar in size.
so it's a really nice fit in the class 3 space that class 2 space versus a cargo van that has a limited space capacity for payload and cargo volume. and that was the feedback we received from our customers. early on, we were developing this, which the engineers -- honestly, they did hit it out of the park with this great, great deal. and the vehicle is flexible.
we've actually had some requests to lower the height of the vehicle inside and it's a simple change for us. lower the roof a little bit to get some more aerodynamics and maybe move into some vehicle tightness that they might have in an area of the country. and it was a quick change for us. so it's -- again, the engineers did a really nice job designing this.
it is, maybe i should say, flexible, where it's adjustable where needed to be. so it's an exciting new vehicle for us.
felix boeschen -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then maybe switching to the margin side a little bit. as we think about the '21 outlook, i know there's quite a few moving pieces in the p&l.
you talked about very little impact on the chip side so far. but jon, curious if you're baking in any sort of supply chain drags into the guide? and then if you could maybe help us out a little bit on temporary cost cuts, how much you kind of anticipate rolling back into the p&l this year as maybe we see t&e and travel come back online?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
yes. so as we -- i mean, as we look at sort of year-over-year headwinds from that perspective, we did take out about $2.5 million of short-term countermeasures in the second quarter. as you think about how that flows into 2021, that's really offset by some of the restructuring benefits that we did. i think on top of that, we saw our healthcare expenses decline in 2020.
and so there will be -- we're estimating about $4 million of headwind related to healthcare expenses. we've also got increase through the wage inflation and the increases in the hourly labor rate, particularly as we're trying to ramp pretty significantly in a number of our facilities, as you probably have seen from some of the press releases and social media activity that we've had. and so those are headwinds as well as getting essentially a business off the ground with velocity. we started investing in that in q4, and we will continue to invest in that here in the first part of the year to be able to hit the volume levels that we anticipate going forward.
and so as you look at those items, we are -- if you look at the midpoint of the guidance, we're showing some slight margin expansion there year over year. but there certainly are cost headwinds from that perspective as well.
felix boeschen -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. that was super helpful. and then just my last one. you briefly touched on it.
but in your presentation, you guys talked about a little bit of expanding the network from a facility footprint. could you talk about the other point of the site of capacity, specifically on labor? how has that sort of tracked? and has there been a constraint to production, i guess, is my bigger question.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yes, this is daryl, felix. it has not been a constraint to production. the hr teams at locations that are hiring are still pushing job there and having good attendance to them. so right now, we don't see it hindering us at all.
as we move through the ramp, and the volume increases will continue to monitor. right now, we're -- the hr teams are doing a great job, along with the ops teams, interviewing training and getting new people on the floor.
felix boeschen -- raymond james -- analyst
that i appreciate. i'll leave it there. thank you.
operator
the next question comes from steve o'hara of sidoti & company. please go ahead.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking the question. just maybe on the capex. i mean, it seems like a pretty big increase for 2021.
but i'm just kind of curious how you think about it maybe going forward. i mean, is this something kind of where you're building out facilities that can be used longer-term and then capex drops back? or is capex kind of a step function change?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
no. i think it's -- i'd say it's a year of investment to meet the 30% increase in top line here. certainly, the velocity is the largest piece of that. and we're, as daryl talked about, basically launching a new facility designed specifically for that line to accommodate the volume levels.
we're also -- we talked about kansas city expansion into the truck body markets until there will be some investment associated with that. and so there's, i'd say, two or three larger investments that we need this year in order to support the volume increase, and we should see the benefits of that capacity as we move forward into '22 and beyond.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
steve, i'll add a little bit more internally, we're adding or buying lasers at a number of facilities, along with some fabrication equipment in order to continue to optimize the purchase parts to make buy. the teams are doing a really nice job with getting these launch, and we're seeing the payback in less than a year. so that's some of the additional capital that besides the facilities part that jon was talking about.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then i guess if you think about the fleets that are on the road today, it seems like utilization was very high in 2020 i mean is that -- does that shorten the life span? does that quicken the pace of the replacement cycle? how do you think that plays out? or -- and maybe ev takes part of that and gets factored in. but can you talk about maybe the replacement cycle down the road, if there's been -- do you think there's been any change there in terms of where utilization was in 2020?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yes. absolutely, 100%. we're seeing and having dialogue with customers that, for instance, the typical class 4 walk-in vans in the past has been labeled as a 15-year life. we're seeing that through conversations and some of the dialogue.
it's coming in somewhere maybe around 12-or-so. then we're seeing the cargo vans, a lot of the class 2s, expectations from the customers were seven years, and they're coming in, some at 4 and 5 and some maybe a little bit less depending on the routes. but -- so to your point, utilization, the amount of volume that's going through all the vehicles is going to shorten the life. and we're having that dialogue now.
so we actually believe that, that will start probably a little bit maybe next year and then continue '23 and beyond and doing some of that replacement cycle that's coming quicker.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
ok. and then maybe just switching to ev. i mean, i think in the past, you guys have talked about staying agnostic on that side. i guess, gm kind of launched their platform.
and i'm just kind of curious, is that kind of the -- do you expect it -- do you want to stay agnostic and continue to deal with everybody? and then maybe what you think how ev starts to build in terms of the next few years in terms of penetration? i mean, do you see it as 20% of deliveries five years from now, 50%? i'm just kind of curious how you see that playing out maybe.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think if i could be accurate on that estimate, we know exactly what we're doing on ev and so with everyone else. so it's a bit of a -- i don't want to say a load of question, but it's a difficult question. so what we do see, we actually go to different outside sources.
and i think we had it in our analyst earnings deck where by 2030, some of the larger -- i think it was bloomberg actually who said they think by 2030, it might be 25%. i would have loved to have seen what they predicted for 2020 or 2021 and see how accurate they were. but -- so we don't try to predict ourselves. we use outside sources.
and that's what everybody, i think, is looking at. but it is coming. it's going to get -- i think there's going to be some lower volume first. but to your point of us being agnostic.
i think i mentioned it a couple of times in the script today, we are getting a lot of pressure from our customers because they're actually not seen or receiving any vehicles that meet their needs. and i think their needs are evolving. so that's some of what might be changing our view on it, but it's going to take some more analysis and some more review. but right now, our position is the same.
we are -- we did say we're going to bridge the gap and we wait for the oems to come out. and ford's coming out with theirs later this year. and mercedes will have theirs. we believe next year is still on track.
we understand that fca/atlantis is working on one. so eventually, right, they will be there. i did mention that one of the oems stopped, letting people convert their ice engines or vehicles over to ev and maintain the warranty. so if you do that anymore, the warranties are voided.
so it's going to -- that's new news, so that's going to create some havoc here, i think, in the ev space in the next probably quarter or two.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
ok. and then just maybe within the fvs, maybe you mentioned it, but the backlog and the growth there. i mean, is that primarily kind of on the parcel delivery. and i mean, it seemed like truck body was kind of ramping up.
but i mean, maybe how you see that playing out? is it kind of first kind of meet the acute demand on the parcel delivery side. and then they have to deal with the truck body when they've kind of gotten their fleets in shape. again, is that how you see it playing out?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
i would say we've actually seen pretty strong orders across all the product offerings, truck body not excluded. so truck bodies upfit in walk-in van have seen strength through the end of the year. velocity was, obviously, a big piece of that as we talked about. and as we look here in q1, we continue to see sort of strong order patterns, and we continue to have good discussions with our customers about their needs.
and it gets back to the point there made in the script about we're operating essentially at a new normal level with extremely high rental utilization in q4, and that's got to normalize itself through the market. and so our customer base is really building out for that situation.
steve ohara
ok. all right. thanks. thanks for the time.
operator
the next question comes from matt koranda of roth capital. please go ahead.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. i just wanted to start off by maybe zooming out and discussing the guidance at a higher level. so could you just help us understand the basic assumptions around the split between fes and specialty vehicle that's in the outlook? and then how much are you assuming in terms of inorganic contribution from duramag?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
yes. so when we look at the guidance, we actually see we see strong year-over-year growth in both of the segments. both of them are actually growing pretty much right on that target at above 30%. and there's two different dynamics there.
you've got -- on the sv side of the business, you've got strong tailwinds coming out of the motorhome business where we also saw some, call it, a softer first half. and so there's some covid recovery in there as well as the inorganic piece to duramag, as you talked about. on the fleet side of the business, it's really the expansion of products and the continued growth in the parcel delivery side of the business, but we see both strong going forward. i would say, from an organic perspective, there's probably, call it, three points of that growth, that's inorganic or acquisition related.
and...
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. sorry. go ahead.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
no. i was just saying, not a significant contributor year over year given the $200 million increase in revenue.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
yes. gotcha. that makes sense. and then i wondered if you could just talk a little bit about the order environment currently as we're heading into the spring.
because i know that fes, typically, the seasonal order pattern generally picks up kind of heading into the spring. and just wanted to get a sense for, did we get pull forward in order activity with that larger velocity order that you guys have referenced or is that just additive to the normal seasonality that we should expect heading forward? just talk a little bit about the current order environment, especially for fes?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i think it's tough to describe anything as normal, given the current environment we're operating in. i think the velocity piece was certainly incremental. i think the dynamics last year where we saw a very slow ordering happening through the second -- late second and third quarter, there was a bit of an acceleration in pickup that's probably not aligned with historic seasonality. but to my comment earlier, i think we continue to see strong order patterns here as we are into q1.
and their customers are getting smarter about sort of fleet sizing and capacity requirements and those types of things, and we continue to stay close to them. and we're seeing order interest on all of our products, right, across the board, motorhome and service bodies.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
great. and then lastly, just on fes. i wondered if you guys could help us maybe just characterize capacity to produce, because at some point, it seems like you've got a high-quality problem on your end, which is the backlog is so large that maybe it deters order flow. but wanted to get a sense for how quickly can we ramp up capacity there? and then i know you've referenced a lot of different sort of puts and takes around what could constrain you there.
but can you just put a finer point on what are the maybe one or two kind of gating items in terms of your ability to ramp up production in fes?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'm going to attempt to answer this one, matt. so i mentioned some of the laser equipment we're buying and some of the press brakes. those were down in bristol, along with some other facilities.
so that is helping some of the supply constraints that we were seeing and obviously getting some nice payback, too. we -- as i mentioned before, right, we typically run on a shift, shift and a half. so we still have fill out the second shift. and if we need to, we can go to third.
but the team is really doing an amazing job with their kaizen events and putting in some automation and in the plant to help with the throughput. we are in the middle of right now moving, what we call our, ssv vehicles. i will show the heavy, heavy upfit, maybe like for the electrical companies or the power companies and super companies, right, for the cities. we are moving that to a different facility in bristol, right? moving out of the main plant to give it more room to operate with some of the orders we're getting.
the only real constraint we have is -- will be paint, right? but we have a backup for paint if the orders continue to flow and get to that level. but we're a number of units away from reaching that level right now on a daily basis, that is.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. got it. very helpful there. thank you.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer

operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the shyft group's first-quarter 2021 earnings results. [operator instructions] at this time, it is my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, juris pagrabs. sir, the floor is yours.
juris pagrabs -- group treasurer and director of investor relations
thank you, dagma, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the shyft group's first-quarter 2021 earnings call. joining me on the call today are daryl adams, our president and chief executive officer; and jon douyard, our chief financial officer. for today's call, we have included a presentation deck, which has been filed with the sec that is also available on our website at theshyftgroup.com. you may download the deck from the investor relations section of our website to follow along with our presentation during the call.
before we start today's call, please turn to slide 2 of the presentation for our safe harbor statement. you should be aware that certain statements made during today's conference call, which may include management's current outlook, viewpoint, predictions, and projections regarding the shyft group and its operations may be considered forward-looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. i caution you that as with any prediction or projection, there are a number of factors that could cause the shyft group's actual results to differ materially from projections. all known risks that management believes could materially affect the results are identified on forms 10-k and 10-q filed with the sec.
however, there may be other risks that we cannot anticipate. on the call today, we will provide a segment update before moving on to a more detailed review of the results and our outlook for the remainder of 2021. we will then open the line for q&a. i would also like to remind everyone that with the divestiture of the emergency response business last year on february 1, the revenues and expenses associated with the er business, as well as the assets and liabilities have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
with this reclassification, the results discussed today will refer to continuing operations unless otherwise noted. at this time, i'm pleased to turn the call over to daryl for his comments beginning on slide 3. 
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, juris. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first-quarter 2021 results. our performance in the first quarter continues to demonstrate the success of our business strategy, which encompasses growth in higher-margin product offerings within our core markets, increasing market share within our expanding geographic footprint, and ongoing productivity improvements within our operations. as you see on slide 4, the strategy, coupled with our commitment to invest in innovation -- sorry, innovative products, design to meet customer needs resulted in our backlog increasing over 90% to a record $667 million for the quarter.
we are excited with this level of our backlog and our strong start to the year as we achieved first-quarter revenues of $198 million and adjusted ebitda of $19.2 million. please turn to slide 5, where i'll provide a segment update. i'd like to start by sharing what we are experiencing with respect to the supply chain uncertainty and chassis availability due to the semiconductor shortage. during the first quarter, we saw little impact on our operations.
however, based on our feedback from oems and suppliers, chassis deliveries will be impacted at some level for the next several quarters. we will continue to monitor the situation and adapt and manage accordingly. although with the higher-than-expected backlog, we remain confident that we will deliver on our original guidance for 2021. starting with fleet vehicles and services.
we continue to make progress in a variety of areas. from an operations perspective, our ongoing focus and investment in manufacturing capability continues to have an impact as we set a new record in production at the bristol facility. the velocity launch is progressing well. we are slightly ahead of our ramp curve and have started hiring our second shift to accomplish the next phase of the ramp curve.
we are extremely happy with the quality of the product at this early stage of the launch and look forward to seeing the velocity product down the road. underscoring our flexible manufacturing strategy, we successfully completed the initial build of 500 truck bodies at our kansas city facility. on developing and introducing purpose-built vehicles to meet our customers' wide-ranging needs continues to boost our backlog. we have talked in the past about the velocity m3, and i'm happy to report that we secured an initial order for more than 350 units.
we continue to make progress on the velocity r2 product and are preparing a demo vehicle for testing with a major customer this month. moving to our specialty vehicles segment. we generated significant growth in sales and adjusted ebitda as our efforts continue to produce positive results. our motor market share during the quarter increased to 30.5%.
that's up over 4 points since 2018 and reflects the strength of our product offerings and our brand among motor homebuyers. as part of this effort to drive sales and market share growth, we are introducing nine new technologies on our upcoming '22 and '23 model year chassis. across our service body business, we have had several project developments in the quarter that exemplify our strategy and ability to create value from acquisitions. our royal truck body team achieved record revenue in march, while also doubling its backlog year over year.
our recently expanded service body upfit center in charlotte, michigan was granted gm shift through status, which will benefit both royal and duramag as we move forward. as it relates to innovation, royal has expanded its service body offering to include an e-coded steel body that meets or exceeds our competitors' corrosion-resistant levels, now enabling broader market use in northern states where harsher weather conditions exist. and at duramag, we continue to make manufacturing improvements and are on track to deliver on our integration plan. with that, i'll turn the call over to jon to discuss shyft's financial results for the first quarter in more detail, as well as provide an update on our 2021 outlook, beginning on slide 6.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
thank you, daryl, and good morning, everyone. please turn to slide 7, and i'll provide an overview of our financial results for the first quarter. as daryl indicated, the shift group had a solid start to the year, achieving double-digit revenue growth and seeing significant order volume that has taken our backlog to a record high. this start positions us well despite the current uncertainty in the broader supply chain.
revenue for the first quarter was $197.9 million, up 11.8% from the year-ago quarter. income from continuing operations was $11.5 million, compared to $11.7 million a year ago. note that prior-year results included a $2.6 million favorable tax item related to the cares act, which was partially offset by restructuring costs. taking these prior-year adjustments into consideration, adjusted net income increased 12% to $12.8 million from $11.4 million in the prior year.
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.32 per share compared to $0.33 per share in the first quarter of 2020. adjusted eps increased 13% to $0.36 per share from $0.32 per share a year ago. first-quarter 2021 adjusted ebitda from continuing operations increased $19.2 million -- increased to $19.2 million from $18.4 million, while as a percent of sales, adjusted ebitda from continuing operations declined to 9.7% compared to 10.4% of sales in the same period last year. let me now take you through the results by operating segment, beginning with fleet vehicles and services on slide 8.
on our fvs business saw a solid first quarter, working diligently to prepare for the anticipated production ramp in the coming months while securing significant orders. the business delivered revenue of $131.7 million compared to $131.7 million a year ago. the decline was primarily due to lower cargo van upfit and field services volume, which was partially offset by increased walk-in van sales year over year. fvs adjusted ebitda was $18.2 million versus $21.7 million a year ago.
adjusted ebitda margin was 13.8% of sales, which includes the impact of preproduction costs related to the velocity launch, lower sales volumes, and product mix, which collectively more than offset productivity gains. led by our innovative new product offerings, including the velocity m3, we saw significant order growth that resulted in fvs backlog of $589.6 million, a record high. fvs backlog was up 38% sequentially and up a remarkable 95% compared to prior year. while last-mile delivery remains strong and contributes to a significant portion of the backlog, we are encouraged to see increased order activity from other vocations, such as laundry and linen, which were slower through most of 2020.
please turn to slide 9 for the specialty vehicles segment overview. the momentum that specialty vehicles had in the second half of last year carried over to 2021 as the business delivered strong revenue growth in motorhome and service bodies. sales were $66.2 million, an increase of $24.9 million or 60.5% driven by a 56% increase in luxury motor coach chassis volume and 109% increase in service body revenue, which is inclusive of the duramag acquisition. on an organic basis, sv grew 41% in the quarter.
adjusted ebitda was $7 million or 10.6% of sales compared to $3.7 million or 9% of sales in the same period last year, which was primarily driven by higher sales volumes and productivity gains, partially offset by mix. this was the third consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted ebitda, reflecting the benefits of our manufacturing initiatives and our acquisition strategy. sv backlog was up 81% to $76.9 million, which included 39% growth in motorhome chassis backlog and a $20.6 million increase in our service body backlog, again demonstrating our ability to create value and execute on commercial synergies and our acquisitions. please turn to the liquidity and outlook update on slide 10.
we saw significant year-over-year improvement in our working capital management in the quarter, picking up where our team left off in 2020. while seasonally negative, cash flow from operating activities increased 92% year over year. at the end of q1, we had total liquidity of $136 million, including $10 million of cash on hand and $126 million in borrowing availability. our current leverage ratio stands at 0.6 times adjusted ebitda, which provides us with ample liquidity to fund our operations and to continue to invest in our growth strategy.
we also returned $4.2 million to shareholders in the quarter in the form of the regular dividend and the repurchase of 100,000 shares at an average price of $33.45 per share. capex for the quarter was approximately $6 million and included investment in velocity production equipment and fabrication equipment at a number of facilities, which we are using to drive throughput and operational efficiencies across our company. as noted in our prior earnings call, we expect capex for the full year to be in the range of $20 million to $25 million. overall, we are pleased with the start to the year and the continued strength of our operations.
as widely noted across the industry, there is a high level of uncertainty in the supply chain currently, and we will continue to closely monitor the chassis constraints and other supply dynamics. that said, given the continued strong demand and the high volume of q1 orders now in backlog, we believe we are well-positioned for the year and are confident in our ability to offset the anticipated chassis shortfall and ultimately deliver on our initial guidance. based on this current view, we are pleased to reaffirm our 2021 guidance as follows: revenue in the range of $850 million to $900 million, adjusted ebitda of $95 million to $105 million, and adjusted eps of $1.65 to $1.85 per share. now, i'll turn the call back to daryl for closing remarks.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, jon. please turn to slide 11, where i'll provide closing remarks for the shift group. our results for the first quarter demonstrate the success of our business strategy, the strength of our end markets, and the tremendous efforts of the entire shyft team. we plan to continue investing in our future growth, both organically and through acquisitions.
these investments will be centered on new products and technologies to meet customer demand with a particular focus on new platforms, including ev. at the shyft group, we understand and appreciate the need for greener tomorrow. as we gather customer insights, listen to their needs and the requests of us and also evaluate the broad set of market offerings, we feel that we are capable to be a major contributor in this transition. leveraging our decades of chassis development and build experience, we have begun investing in the development of a purpose-built chassis solution that will efficiently aid in the customers' transition to an ev future.
we will provide further details on this endeavor in the coming months. in summary, we are off to a strong start in 2021 with all business units performing well and positioned to support the anticipated ramp-up in our business for the remainder of the year. with that, operator, we are now ready for the q&a portion of the call.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from steve dyer with craig-hallum. please state your question.
steve dyer -- craig-hallum capital group llc -- analyst
thanks. good morning, guys. you talked a little bit about supply chain. is it primarily chassis or is it more widespread than that? and i guess, along those lines, just looking at your backlog, i think my takeaway is there was probably fairly significant upside to your guidance as the year goes along, if you can get all those as you'd like.
is that fair to say?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yes, steve, it is. i mean, with today's vehicles, semiconductors seem to be practically in every electronic product that's out there. it's mainly in the chassis, but we're managing through the supply base, but we just want to identify it. but to your point, with the build in backlog and if we can get chassis, we have a heck of an opportunity to beat the guidance.
steve dyer -- craig-hallum capital group llc -- analyst
is it similar to a couple of years ago? i mean, it seems like we've been talking about chassis for a couple of years now as you guys probably are tired of talking about it. i mean, is it like a couple of years ago where it's literally you get a bunch of them and you crank up the plant for a quarter and then you don't get any for a month. and i mean, is it kind of hand-to-mouth like that?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
not right now, but we assume that it will get to that point. and yes, back in '18, when we had the chassis issue, as you remember, that's why we developed the velocity. so we developed the velocity on three other oem platforms and now the chip issue is affecting those as well. so we continue to chase it.
and i think that's -- i don't think it's going to stop, right? i mean, as we get into the ev piece of this, it's going to continue to take additional semiconductors and other electronic items. so i think it's just for the -- the industry needs to catch up to the demand. and once they do that, i think they will be fine.
steve dyer -- craig-hallum capital group llc -- analyst
do you have a good enough sense as to whether it's -- where the bulk of the impact is going to be? i mean, should we be sort of bracing for a tougher q2, and then things ease as the year goes on? or is it just too unknown right now?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
i mean, i think if you listen to what the oems have been saying, i think 2q from a production standpoint is the trough for them. i would say, as we get through april and really into maybe later in the second quarter, we have a supply of chassis on hand and inflow to support q2. and so it will really be maybe more of a second-half dynamic for us. but i think that said, we're still in a position here to ramp significantly in the second quarter with the work done by the team from a perspective.
and so i think there's certainly some impact and frankly, a ton of uncertainty as you look in the back of the year, but we feel very comfortable with where we are from a guidance perspective and how it will play out.
steve dyer -- craig-hallum capital group llc -- analyst
ok. last one for me, and i'll turn it over. wondering what you're seeing on the labor front hearing a lot about not only shortages of bodies, but also price pressures. how are you guys managing in your locations?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yes. steve, i think the two biggest locations are bristol and charlotte. we mentioned on the previous call that we made some adjustments to the pay and retention items in bristol, we continue to monitor that. but right now, we're not seeing it.
we're seeing a good flow. and in charlotte, we are ramping up and due to the chassis shortage, we're not going to accelerate this fast, but we were finding employees there as well. so i think bristol will continue to have struggles due to the motorhome growth but in charlotte -- and we're managing through it. and in charlotte, we feel comfortable about hitting the number of people we need for the ramp-up on velocity once the chassis continue to flow.
steve dyer -- craig-hallum capital group llc -- analyst
got it. thanks, guys.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from matt koranda with roth capital. please state your questions.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks. just wanted to talk fvs and the order environment that we're seeing, obviously running at a very high plateau. it looks like implied in your numbers versus the fourth quarter.
but i wanted to see if you could maybe just touch on sort of the mix of the order book in q1 that was velocity versus legacy products. and then just for the rest of the year, is there going to be seasonality to the bookings cadence for the rest of the year? any slowdown expected relative to these very high levels? or are we just sort of running all out still on the bookings front?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i think, matt, as we look at it, again, really strong volume in the first quarter, and that's continued into april as well, previously announced in terms of a 3,000 unit order. our backlog levels are approximately double that at this point. and so in the market and the need that it fits from a customer perspective.
i think that said, we continue to see all aspects of the business from walk-in van truck body. i noted the fact that we're starting to see some laundry and linen, as well as some, i'll call it, more retail-type customers pick up from an ordering perspective as well fourth quarter but still pretty positive for us. and i think maybe to your question on the seasonality piece, i would expect at some point, particularly given our -- the customer ordering patterns historically that this will see a slowdown here in q3 more as they prepare for their 2022 purchases, given the fact that we're essentially sold out on the fvs side of the business, plus or minus, given the semiconductor issue plays out.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. great. and then i wanted to ask more specifically on the chassis supply issue. obviously, velocity was sort of started up in the wake of some of the old legacy chassis issues that you had several years ago.
just wanted to see if you could break down or maybe qualitatively talk about the flow of chassis on the legacy product versus velocity and how we should be thinking about your ability to fulfill velocity versus legacy product as we move through the year here?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think, matt, most of the -- so the velocity f products, which is built on the transit is where we're having some issues. we still continue to run the r2, which we're -- the vehicle is getting sent out for a double unit. but that plant right down in saltillo is still operating.
so we're still doing upfit there. unfortunately, in kansas city, where the transit is, we have the velocity chassis out of there and then our upfit in kansas city. it's having some chassis issues. but we are in -- as well as detroit custom chassis, but we are seeing chassis flow from freightliner.
and they -- so we're a little curious to why freightliner and stellantis can still continue to build and port and gm are struggling. so i think it's a timing issue with these guys and maybe some of their plants, some of them came out of that texas issue with the frost when they had a shutdown, they're trying to catch up. so i do think it will work itself out. but yes, we thought we had the answer when we had chassis issues in '18 with these three new products.
and mercedes is still shipping too. m3 is coming onboard, which is positive. so maybe longer term, having the five or six chassis will level us out if anybody has a problem. right now, they're trying to build up the velocity on the transit and they're struggling to get us chassis.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. fair enough. and then last one for me. sorry, go ahead.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
and i think, matt -- it's all right, sorry, matt. that's just not an issue with us, right? that's an industry issue, which is affecting anybody that's trying to get chassis. so it's nothing particular to us. it's across the board with all the upfitters and builders today.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
right. yeah, fair enough. and then just last one on fvs backlog. i guess did i hear you correctly in saying that you're probably sold out on fvs slots through the end of the year? just wanted to see how quickly we think we can deliver on that backlog.
and obviously, it's a high-quality problem to have, having a really high backlog. but at what point does that high backlog start to deter orders? is there any concern around sort of how that plays out?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
yeah. i would say at this point, it has not deterred orders. i think it kind of gets to steve's question earlier. i think our backlog puts us in a position to certainly be at the high end or potentially above guidance.
and so it's really a question of flow, but it's been nice to see sort of continued demand here. we've seen little to no cancellations from customers given the fact that they haven't been able to get chassis. and so we're viewing this more as a timing -- from a timing perspective but feel very comfortable with where we are from a 2021 standpoint.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok, great. thanks. that's all i had.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from mike shlisky with colliers securities. please state your question.
mike shlisky -- colliers securities -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. i just wanted to confirm, in the first quarter here, the backlog that you have is all demand-based backlog. you didn't have any or very few issues with getting chassis and shipping during the first quarter itself. so all the backlog is a positive business, not negative shortages-related, correct?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
that's correct, mike. and even through april, we've -- to daryl's point, we've seen limited impact to our operations.
mike shlisky -- colliers securities -- analyst
great. and just a follow-up on matt's question, do you have enough orders on the chassis from your stellantis' or your daimlers if you still have issues with ford and gm in the back half of the year? is that how you plan to kind of navigate if and when things do get a little bit tight for you on certain brands, just build whatever you can get? and there's enough in the backlog to meet that full-year guidance, right, at the current time?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yes, mike, it'd be nice if our customers would let us do that, but they order the brand of vehicles they want. so they're willing to wait for the chassis. so if the people that did order the stellantis vehicles, we'll be getting them mercedes, we get them -- i'm sure ford when they start back up later this month or even if it moves in early june, they're going to ramp up pretty quick and get the supply flowing again. so no, we can't just switch over, the customers wouldn't appreciate that.
so we just have to stick with the orders and the specs that they put in the po.
mike shlisky -- colliers securities -- analyst
i guess the entire question was, what can you just shift around and what gets built, knowing that's the right -- they're not going to change their brand, but they -- but you can pull forward and pull back dates as you get the chassis? or are you set on certain dates with certain customers?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
i guess i don't totally understand your question. so if we were -- the plant in saltillo, we can't really receive more chassis because we do have the orders that we put in with stellantis to give us the quantity we have. right now, the supply is so tight, they wouldn't be able to increase that volume. if that's what you're asking, so we can move it to another plant and build ahead that would not be able to happen.
mike shlisky -- colliers securities -- analyst
i'll follow up with that question separately. let me just move on quickly to some of your expansion plans or if there are any. i did see that you did get a local or state subsidy in pennsylvania, for example, to build a new facility there. i wasn't sure how hot you're running in pennsylvania right now, were there any other states that would be candidates to give you some kind of tax break or subsidy to build some more capacity going forward?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, i think in terms of pennsylvania, we've been operating there for a number of years now. certainly, the east coast and the northeast market is essential for us from a truck body perspective. yes, as you look out what we're trying to do there in our search continues for a facility, but really trying to develop the model plant where we can build the velocity and do upfit, mount service bodies do car upfit as well.
and so we're really looking to expand the operations there in -- across the product portfolio. i would say, as you look at 2021, i think you'll see limited impact from that potentially some investment later in the year, but that's kind of where we are.
mike shlisky -- colliers securities -- analyst
ok. and my last topic here is on your ev strategy. interesting to hear your -- you've got some kind of a platform in development. is your plan to kind of develop one ev platform for classes 2 through 6 that has kind of your module capabilities as far as battery or length or stuff like that? and/or is it going to be an outsourced platform where someone is going to be giving you kind of like with motive, they'll be sending you the skateboard and you'll be doing your usual body build work on top of it? just want some sense as to kind of what you're planning there as far as having your own evs.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
you almost had me, michael, going to give you the answers, but we're going to hold off on that until probably our analyst day to share some more details.
mike shlisky -- colliers securities -- analyst
all right. i'll pass along. thanks so much.
operator
our next question comes from felix boeschen with raymond james. please state your question.
felix boeschen -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
hey, felix.
felix boeschen -- raymond james -- analyst
hey. i was hoping we could touch on ebitda margins real quick. and specifically in the fleet vehicles segment, i think, obviously down slightly year over year. but you did mention that the velocity preproduction costs were weighing on that in the quarter.
is there any way that you could quantify how much of a drag that was to margins?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
yes. it was about -- if you look at the fvs business, it was about 2 points.
felix boeschen -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. ok. that's super helpful. and then i'm really trying to think through some of the bigger picture margin puts and takes within that segment.
obviously, preproduction ramp, it sounds like chassis supply wasn't as much of an issue in 1q, but i imagine premium freight and other supply chain headwinds were maybe in there anyway. i guess bigger-picture question, jon. i'm just trying to parse through some of the puts and takes and how you think about the margin profile of that segment longer term?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think historically, we've talked about that business being in the 15% to 17% range from an ebitda perspective. i think we're certainly comfortable with that. i think as you look at the quarter, we had the preproduction costs, which i think is understandable given the ramp here, and we expect in the second quarter, some of the inflation dynamics that daryl alluded to, really on the labor side of things and some rate changes we did to secure labor and employment there is also a headwind in the quarter.
and then we were also impacted by year over year by some of the mix dynamics, particularly with upfit, as well as our field -- we had a large field services order last year that did not repeat this year. and so those are two of our higher-margin product lines or product offerings. and so we had some natural mix headwinds this year. and so i think that 15% to 17% range is still a good number for us.
felix boeschen -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. very helpful. and then just my last one. i'm curious if we could touch on the m3 a little bit.
i know you mentioned, i think, 350 orders already in 1q. can you maybe broadly talk about how that product has been received in the market? and then just on the production ramp there, it sounds like chassis is not as much of an issue right now. but if you could just touch on how you think how quickly you can ramp through the year on that product, specifically.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. felix, this is daryl. i'll take it. so we have -- not every customer likes the mercedes m3 just as a chassis.
i think there is a cost to it, right? it's a little bit more costly than, let's say, a dodge ram promaster even in transit. so customers that like it in order to fulfill their need, right, we need to build on all of them, just like we do on the freightliner a forward custom chassis today. so in particular, there's only a couple that like it. so we like the 350 order.
it's a nice order for the year, and we expect to be hearing back from them. i think probably later this year for 2022. but the beautiful thing is with the velocity, the -- whatever chassis it is go down the exact same line that we have in charlotte. so it just goes back to the success of our design, the talent of the engineers, and our flexible manufacturing process, where we want to be able to build multiple products in the same facility.
so we don't get -- we can level out the order flow or the build orders and not shut the plant down. so we're happy with that order. and obviously, that vehicle just came out. the ford was first, f was first, and then mercedes and ours coming.
so we're happy with what we see.
felix boeschen -- raymond james -- analyst
very helpful. appreciate the time. thank you.

operator
good morning, and welcome to the shyft group's second-quarter 2021 earnings results conference call. all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [operator instructions] please note, this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to juris pagrabs, group treasurer and head of investor relations. please go ahead.
juris pagrabs -- treasurer and head of investor relations
thank you, kate, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the shyft group's second-quarter 2021 earnings call. joining me on the call today are daryl adams, our president and chief executive officer; and jon douyard, our chief financial officer. for today's call, we have included a presentation deck, which will be filed with the sec and is also available on our website at theshyftgroup.com. you may download the deck from the investor relations section of our website to follow along with our presentation during the call. before we start, please turn to slide 2 of the presentation for our safe harbor statement.
you should be aware that certain statements made during today's conference call, which may include management's current outlook, viewpoint, predictions, and projections regarding the shyft group and its operations may be considered forward-looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. i caution you that, as with any prediction or projection, there are a number of factors that could cause the shyft group's actual results to differ materially from projections. all known risks that management believes could materially affect the results are identified in our forms 10-k and 10-q filed with the sec. however, there may be other risks that we cannot anticipate.
on the call today, we will provide a business update before moving on to a more detailed review of the results and our outlook for the remainder of 2021. we will then open the line for q&a. i would also like to remind everyone that with the divestiture of the emergency response business last year in february, the revenues and expenses associated with the er business, as well as the assets and liabilities, have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. with this reclassification, the results discussed today will refer to continuing operations unless otherwise noted. at this time, i'm pleased to turn the call over to daryl for his comments beginning on slide 3. 
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, juris. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second-quarter 2021 results. we are very excited and pleased to share with you our second-quarter performance that exceeded our expectations as our sales nearly doubled and our adjusted ebitda tripled over the prior year. as you see on slide 4, this momentum driven by the strength and quality, innovation, and customer-focused product development combined with rising demand in our markets led to a significant order intake across all segments. with backlog more than doubling to a record of $751 million, providing visibility through 2021 and into 2022.
the benefits of our strategy continue to be clear as we delivered our highest quarterly sales on record with revenues of $244 million, resulting in income from continuing operations of $17 million and $0.44 per share. please turn to slide 5, and i'll provide our business update. let me start with an update on what we are experiencing with respect to the supply chain as i'm sure this is top of mind for many of you. during the back half of the second quarter, we experienced industrywide supply constraints including chassis and other components, which caused production challenges.
however, as our results show, we effectively manage through these challenges. thanks to the hard work and determination of our entire team. based on feedback from our oem and suppliers, we expect these challenges to continue at some level and we will continue to add rigor to our internal processes to ensure we are able to minimize any potential impact. jon will have more -- sorry, jon will have additional comments later in the presentation. turning to the business segments.
in fleet vehicles and services, strong order flow continues as we have positioned ourselves with the right products that meet the needs of our customers and the industry. in q2, we achieved a steady ramp in production of the new velocity vehicle with our daily output increasing significantly despite chassis and component constraints. we expect to see continued acceleration as we enter the second half. giving the positive feedback we are receiving on the velocity, we are now working with other locations and channels, and we are now seeing interest from the dealer market. other highlights in the quarter include continued strong truck body order flow, and we continue to make headway in our efforts to provide grocery customers with both upfit and delivery refrigeration solutions and walking vans, truck bodies, and cargo vans. moving to specialty vehicle segment.
the strength of our innovative products and underlying markets has resulted in significant growth in sales and profitability even as our team has managed to pandemic-related supply constraints. our motor home market share during the quarter increased to 31%, reflecting the demand of our product offerings in our brand among the motor homebuyers. we are even more optimistic about the upcoming 22 motor launch, which is happening this month. we believe we'll reflect strong consumer demand amid low dealer inventory levels. our service body business continues to execute on our strategy of geographically expanding our product offerings to drive additional growth in volume and new products.
our service body team achieved record revenue in the second quarter, which includes the impact of the duramag acquisition. we continue to leverage our flexible manufacturing capabilities by expanding in california and add in equipment upfit in mountains in charlotte, michigan, and west palm beach, florida. additionally, our service body operations have been improved or shipped through by general motors in charlotte michigan, which allows us to deliver mounted services -- sorry, mountain service bodies to any dealer in the general motors distribution network across the united states. let me provide an update and some additional context on shyft innovations, which we announced in the second quarter. shyft innovations is a dedicated mobility research and development team reporting directly to me, which is initially focused on the introduction of the shyft electric vehicle chassis. we're very excited by this opportunity to leverage our near half-century of expertise in building chassis to a new product with great potential.
we have a strong track record of building alternative propulsion vehicles for more than 17 years, which will bring to bear on this new effort. we know the demand is there and many of our biggest customers in last month's delivery are searching for innovative and efficient ways to meet their commitments to stakeholders to improve efficiency and to reduce carbon emissions within their operations. we continue to make good progress on the existing new initiative. but let me outline some of how we will differentiate our offering from the growing competitor base.
the first phase of the project will focus on class three electric vehicle chassis. our electric vehicle chassis will initially be available in two-wheel bases -- two-wheelbase options with a 5,000-pound payload offering a range of up to 175 miles. we are very excited with the extremely talented team we are assembling to support our electric vehicle chassis development. we have made considerable progress on electric vehicle chassis design and have finalized key design objectives and performance requirements on electric vehicle chassis. proof of concept chassis sign has been completed and we start the assembly of the first electric vehicle chassis this month. we assign lois with a number of key suppliers and we have also secured additional component suppliers to support prototypes and production.
we look forward to updating you on our continued progress. with that, i'll turn the call over to jon to discuss shyft's financial results for the second quarter in more detail, as well as provide an update on our 2021 outlook beginning at slide 6. thank you darryl and good morning everyone. please turn to slide 7, and i'll provide an overview of our financial results for the second quarter. the shyft group continued to perform at a high level in the second quarter despite ongoing challenges in the broader supply chain.
we saw robust growth across all segments of the business. and while the second quarter of 2020 was depressed due to the impacts of covid, the underlying strength in demand for our products was clear in our results. revenue for the second quarter was $244 million, up 96.8% from the year-ago quarter. income from continuing operations with $17 million, compared to a loss of $1.1 million. diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.44 per share, compared to a loss of $0.03 per share in the second quarter of 2020. on an adjusted basis, ebitda from continuing operations more than tripled rising 206% to $28.6 million from $9.4 million last year.
as a percent of sales, adjusted ebitda increased 420 basis points to 11.7% of sales from 7.5% of sales last year. adjusted net income rose 316% to $19 million, or $0.53 per share from $4.6 million, or $0.13 per share in the prior year. let me now take you through the results by operating segment beginning with fleet vehicles and services on slide 8. our fvs business posted an impressive quarter, effectively managing through the supply chain and labor challenges to get vehicles in the hands of our customers while also seeing continued order strength. the business delivered revenue of $168.3 million, up 73%, compared to $97.2 million a year ago.
the increase was broad-based with strong double-digit percentage growth across all product categories, as well as a significant contribution from initial sales of the velocity product line. fvs adjusted ebitda was up 107% to $28.3 million versus $13.7 million a year ago. adjusted ebitda margin was 16.8% of sales, compared to 14% in the second quarter of 2020. we continue to see the benefits of both our factory lean initiatives, as well as our investment in automation, which has helped us expand our output and partially offset supply chain challenges. with impressive growth and new products led by velocity, we saw significant order growth that resulted in an fvs backlog of $660.9 million, the third consecutive quarter of record highs.
fvs backlog was up 12% sequentially, and up a remarkable 130% compared to the prior year. please turn to slide 9 for the specialty vehicle segment overview. specialty vehicles' momentum continued in the second quarter as the business delivered strong revenue growth across all categories with impressive growth in motor home chassis in particular. sales were $75.7 million, an increase of $49 million, or 183% versus the prior year. or luxury motor coach chassis business drew 191% year over year. and while the prior-year comp includes the impact of covid, the increase in motor coach chassis sales was up over 40% when compared to the same quarter of 2019, clearly demonstrating the strength of our products in the market.
on an organic basis, specialty vehicles grew 144% in the quarter. as you can see on the left side of this chart, fvs continued to see consistent sequential growth in sales since q2 of last year, including 14% growth over the first quarter. adjusted ebitda was $8.6 million or 11.4% of sales, compared to $1.2 million or 4.6% of sales in the same period last year, primarily driven by higher sales volumes. as the backlog was up 79% to $90.5 million, which included a 46% growth in motor home chassis backlog and a 191% increase in our service body backlog. please turn to the liquidity and outlook update on slide 10. we remain focused on working capital and managing our overall liquidity.
but we typically see seasonally lower cash flow in the first half of the year. we saw significant improvement this year as year-to-date cash flow from operating activities increased $15 million versus 2020. at the end of q2, we had total liquidity of $120 million, including $4 million of cash on hand and $116 million in borrowing availability under our credit -- current credit agreements. our leverage ratio stands at point four times adjusted ebitda, and our strong balance sheet enables us to access capital as needed to fund our operations and to continue to invest in our growth strategy. capex for the quarter was approximately $6 million and included investment in velocity production, as well as fabrication equipment at a number of facilities, which we are using to meet increased demand and drive margin expansion across the company. year to date, capex with $12 million, tracking in line with our expected full-year range of $20 to $25 million as previously disclosed. overall, we are pleased with our results and our team's ability to execute at a high level through the first half.
as we look forward, we are optimistic about the demand for our products and are well-positioned to have a strong year. that said, we are not immune to the ongoing challenges in the supply chain and labor markets and expect supply constraints and inflation to have some impact on us through at least the balance of the year. we have taken several actions to mitigate these risks including instituting price increases across the business, expanding the supply base to manage both material inflation, as well as component shortages, flexing production as needed, and continuing to be innovative in our hiring process to address the labor shortages. with our current visibility, we are confident that our performance through the first half of the year, as well as the strength of our backlog, puts us in a position to exceed our previous guidance. with this backdrop, we are excited to raise our 2021 estimates as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $900 million to $950 million, adjusted ebitda of $100 million to $110 million, and adjusted eps of $1.75 to $1.95 per share.
now, i'll turn the call back to daryl for closing remarks.
thank you, jon. please turn to slide 11. our results for the second quarter highlight the successful execution of our strategy and the amazing efforts of the entire shyft team. our commitment to quality execution, innovation, and investment in operating efficiencies are generating improved profitability.
the shyft innovations team and their efforts in developing our new electric vehicle chassis is a great example of our innovation dna, unleashed to tackle a critical issue facing fleet operators around the nation. bringing a new solution to the market that will limit carbon emission while enhancing the productivity and efficiency of fleets is a game-changer. in summary, our momentum continued in the second quarter with each of our businesses performing well and positioned to support our full growth and profitability for the remainder of the year, and probably this great team and can -- that continues to perform for our shareholders. with that, operator, we're now ready for the q&a portion of the call.

we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] the first question today is from steve dyer of craig-hallum. please go ahead.
steve dyer -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
thanks. good morning, guys.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, steve. 
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
good morning, steve. 
steve dyer -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
you talked about price increases. there are others in the industry that have talked about sort of the guidance -- raising guidance for the remainder of the year on the revenue side driven largely by price increases. is that play into your guidance, you know, the revenue bump much?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
i think, steve, when you look at it, you know, our -- i think, there's certainly an element of price in there but i think we really think about it as our comfort with the backlogs. you know, we've seen significant order growth here over the last three quarters that has put us in a good position and really in a position where we need. we just need to execute. i think the, you know, as we look at chassis component availability as we've worked through the second quarter, i think, at this point, we feel comfortable with the portion of that backlog that we're able to execute. and so, that's really where the increase is coming from.
i think the price will certainly play an element in that, but more on the demand side.
steve dyer -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
and so, your ability to raise them for the back half of the year, i mean, do you feel like the supply chain pinch the worst is behind you, or do you think it will impact you more in q3 than q2. 
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
i think there's -- i think, you know, it's tough to pinpoint that. i think if you look at the oems in the chassis situation, particularly in the second quarter, there were certainly shutdowns throughout q2, which will have implications on us in q3. gm announced some of their pickup truck plants will be idled here in the third quarter. and so, there will be continued to be sort of ongoing issues from a chassis perspective. you've got the freight issues coming out of china, you've got just component challenges across the board.
but, i think, where we find comfort is that the visibility that we have both from an order perspective, and really just our ability to execute on that.
steve dyer -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. got it. and, you know, you talk about the backlog. you're out more than three quarters of revenue without taking any more orders.
do you have mechanisms in place to sort of protect margin then, just kind of given the duration of that backlog and all of the uncertainty around supply chain, commodities, and things like that? in the year 2022, do you the mechanism started to protect pricing, protect margin there?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think the -- there's a couple of things i would point to. i think daryl talked about adding rigor to some of our processes. we've certainly done that in respect of the raw material changes. and so, we've instituted that in quotes and new order activity.
i think when you look at our backlog, in general, particularly on the fleet side of the business, we do have mechanisms in our standard terms and conditions where we're able to work with our customers if there are certain inflationary elements where we can go back for pricing as well.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
and, steve, i'd add, back in 2018 when the terrorist came in we've put in our raw material purchasing strategy. that is still in place. and as we continue to move backlog out, we are continuing to ensure we have an adequate supply of material and we understand the pricing to put into the pricing of the quotes that are out that far. so, we've moved it forward. we were running, i think, it was six months at the time that we've moved that out, so we're locking them further.
and that, you know, sometimes can be challenging with the suppliers. but once we get comfortable with them and they get comfortable with us, it's a good discussion and we're both comfortable with the pricing we lock in at.
steve dyer -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
yeah, that's what drove that question. thanks for the color guys.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, steve.
operator
[operator instructions] the next question is from matt koranda of roth capital. please go ahead.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hey, guys, thanks. just wanted to see if you could just start out by talking about the bookings environment in fleet vehicles. it looks like the implied order flow is still very strong, maybe ticked down just a touch quarter by quarter. but, maybe you could just talk about seasonality and bookings in fleet vehicles and then just traction with velocity and then sort of maybe mix of new orders that were velocity.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i'll take a little bit of that, matt. good morning, by the way, and then i'll let jon finish. you know, i think it shows the strength of our strategy and the strength of our operational team where -- as we continue to set records in revenue, we are also continuing to take on the additional backlog.
so, it's not like a delay in the production, which i think is important to mention, right? we're accelerating on all fronts on production and the backlog is expected to grow. so, as i mentioned this is based on us having the right products at the time, our customers need them, and the design and innovation that you're looking for. and if we continue to look at fvs the typical walking ramp plant is setting daily records on volume -- monthly records on volume. same with velocity as it ramps up, and we continue to get backlog. so, when, you know, we typically would say the delivery customers want their products, right, in october for halloween, due to the delay in some of the chassis supply during q2, they are asking for them all the way up through q4.
and right through the holiday. so, that's a little unique for this year and that's helping us with the typical q4 seasonality. so, we're excited about that. and, jon, do you have anything you want to add?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
i think the only thing i'd add is, we saw really -- the last three quarters of significant order strength in the fvs business really puts us through now into early 2022. and so, we expect that to continue from an order flow perspective. it probably will slow down here in the second half of the year just as our customers really prepare for 2022. but, you know, we feel pretty confident with the pipeline that we have for next year, as well as where we are from the current backlog perspective. 
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
and i think, matt, i'll just come back and add one more. i think, you know, if you remember about a year ago there was some concern about how much of this online ordering e-commerce was going to stick. and, i think, if you look at our backlog and you continue to look at, you know, the overall macro and micro items in the last mile delivery, the growth is still there for this year and next year. and we're, you know, i think, it's out for probably three to five years that we're looking at. so, we're excited about where this business is going to go, and we're putting in capital and team members to make sure that we can handle the growth as it continues over the next few years.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
great color. thanks for that. and then if i heard you right, i guess, fleet vehicles, you know, typically, seasonally, you see is kind of a weaker quarter in q4 as the fleet customers kind of hold off on deliveries during their busier periods. but it sounds like, you know, the fleet vehicles revenues should sort of build from q2 and then hold flattish in the q4.
is that the way to kind of think about the cadence of the revenue for fleet vehicles for the rest of the year and what's embedded in guidance?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
yeah. well, i think if you look at our guidance overall, you know, it's probably tough to parse out exactly. we certainly didn't guide on q3 in particular. but if you look at the sort of the q2 run rate through the balance of the year, it's really our midpoint guidance.
and so, between q3 and q4, there may be some pluses and minuses depending on, you know, component flow and chassis availability, those types of things. but we feel, you know, feel pretty comfortable essentially delivering q2 for the balance of the year.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. got you. and then, you did mention that the supply chain got a little bit tougher in the back half of the second quarter and it sounds like probably more chassis than anything but wanted to give you the opportunity to kind of discuss anything else that got crimped in the quarter and how are you addressing some of that stuff?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think, matt, it's -- i just tell you it's up and down the supply chain. it's not just chassis. i think, you know, we're not unique to have some labor issues.
i think when you look around, talk to different people, i think, it's everybody's having it, just do the expansion. but we've, you know, as we mentioned we're taking, you know, and jon mentioned, it would take some alternative actions and having great new ideas on how to hire people to keep some limited turnover. and the other thing is we mentioned that we're adding additional suppliers to ensure that we can have the capacity as we need it because we can see the backlog. so, we're looking at it and understanding the current supply constraints and adding on additional suppliers for the commodities that we need. whether it's fasteners or fiberglass parts or plastic parts.
so, the team is really doing a nice job to keep out in front of that, and it's pretty neat to watch.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
all right. appreciate it, guys. i'll go back in the queue. thank you. 
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer

the next question is from mike shlisky of d.a. davidson. please go ahead.
mike shlisky -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. thanks for taking my question. 
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, mike.
mike shlisky -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
thanks. i want to start off by asking about some other big news of the weekend in ev, and that is the new commercial in ev that was announced by gm the other day. i'm not sure of the sizing of it and it didn't get much as far as the details. but is your impression of that vehicle -- is that anywhere in the same size range as the class 3 that you're going to be putting out, and to your knowledge, will that be the same kind of vehicle as other vans out there that will need enough space from an outside provider such as, you know, such as shyft group?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
mike, good question. i think when we reclassified a whole lot of details, our assumption is probably in the higher classes and more of a maybe even a dry van box. so, it could be the higher classes, but we're trying to understand it as you are. but, again, i think you know i have confidence in our team and what we're doing in class 3, which is is a niche space as we mentioned. that's why we went into a cause we didn't want to compete against other oems in the class 2 space, or even though the people up in that class, you know, five and six.
mike shlisky -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
ok. got it. i also want to ask just a question about market share maybe so far this year. you've done a great job executing it up in your way and you get a sense that some of the smaller players and cargo events just aren't getting it done.
have you found a way to gain some share that others couldn't really fulfill? 
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
i think it's is probably more of, you know, as i mentioned the star quality, ability to execute, find labor, and get the products in the customer's hands. we've seen -- backlog has seen a nice order flow from customers that we haven't built for typically. some are from the grocery side, some are on the delivery side, so it's broad-based, and it's exciting to see, right, that what we've been talking to teams about is being able to get the products out the door at high quality and customer service is paying off. and it's -- the conquest businesses is very nice for us in the backlog, as well as our new technology new products like the velocity in other products.
mike shlisky -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. thanks so much, daryl. i'll leave it there. 
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer

good morning, and welcome to the shyft group third quarter 2021 earnings results conference call. [operator instructions] please note this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to juris pagrabs, group treasurer and head of ir. please go ahead.
juris pagrabs -- group treasurer and head of investor relations
thank you, kate, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the shyft group's third quarter 2021 earnings call. joining me on the call today are daryl adams, our president and chief executive officer; and jon douyard, our chief financial officer. for today's call, we've included a presentation deck that has been filed with the sec and is also available on our website at the shyftgroup.com. you may download the debt from the ir section of the website to follow along with our presentation during the call.
before we start, please turn to slide 2 of the presentation for our safe harbor statement. you should be aware that certain statements made during today's conference call, which may include management's current outlook, viewpoint, predictions, and projections regarding the shyft group and its operations, may be considered forward-looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. i caution you that, as with any prediction or projection, there are a number of factors that could cause the shyft group's actual results to differ materially from projections. all known risks that management believes could materially affect the results are identified in forms 10-k and 10-q filed with the sec.
however, there may be other risks that we cannot anticipate. on the call today, we will provide a business update before moving on to a more detailed review of the results and our outlook for the remainder of 2021. we will then open the line for q&a. i would like to remind everyone that, with the divestiture of the emergency response business on february 1st, 2020, the revenues and expenses associated with the er business as well as the assets and liabilities have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
with this reclassification, the results discussed today will refer to continuing operations, unless otherwise noted. at this time, i'm pleased to turn the call over to daryl for his comments beginning on slide 3. 
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, juris. good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter 2021 results. we are delighted and pleased to share with you another quarter of strong financial performance, which continues our trend since the beginning of the year.
our team continues to execute on our operational plans despite industrywide supply challenges, enabling our growth momentum to endure while positioning us for a record year. fittingly, this week, we were honored to have been named in the 2021 fortune 100 fastest-growing companies list. this distinction would not have been possible without the team's incredible hard work, dedication to the business, and, most notably, for the resilience in the face of adversity over the last couple of years. as you can see on slide 4, our team did a tremendous job navigating the macroeconomic headwinds to generate year-over-year revenue growth of 34% to a record 273 million and record income from continuing operations of 21 million or $0.58 per share, which represents 8% year-over-year growth in income from continuing operations.
throughout the quarter, actually, since the beginning of the year, we worked hard to minimize supply constraints, labor shortages, and inflationary pressures to ensure customer deliveries while meeting our financial targets. i'm extremely proud of the team's continued resourcefulness and relentless focus on execution that drove these results. please turn to slide 5, where i'll provide a business update. i am pleased that the demand for all of our fleet vehicles & services products continue unabated, particularly for our parcel delivery vehicles.
we recently announced an add-on usps order of 47 -- sorry, 447 truck bodies, representing 53 million in revenues. production on this order is expected to begin in q2 of next year, with completion slated for 2023. as discussed in prior calls, a critical component of our fvs strategy is to identify and evaluate ways we can expand into new locations. in august, we announced orders for more than 500 refrigerated delivery vehicles from several grocery chains.
to fulfill these orders, we expanded our production capabilities in our existing kansas city facility, leveraging our flexible manufacturing strategy. we are encouraged by these orders as grocers continue to evaluate delivery solutions while consumer expectations are shifting toward home delivery. we continue to work with grocers as they develop solutions needed to optimize their home delivery strategies. moving to our specialty vehicles segment.
the strength of our innovative products and underlying markets resulted in strong revenues and orders during the quarter. we continue to execute on our service body growth strategy by expanding production into our existing north charleston facility. this provides critical capacity as we grow and expand this business, again, leveraging our flexible manufacturing strategy. in our motorhome business, demand for our luxury motor coach chassis continues unabated as our market share increased to 31% during the quarter, while reaching a high of 37% in august, reflecting the strength of our product offerings and brand among luxury motor coach customers.
and on our builtmore contract manufacturing business, we are excited to work closely with our partner isuzu on the launch of their latest f-series vehicle. we are optimistic in this vehicle's prospect and look forward to continuing to ramp volume into next year. let me provide an update on shyft innovations, our dedicated mobility research, and development team, which is currently focused on developing shyft's electric vehicle chassis, and our new walk-in van body design. during the quarter, we opened an r&d facility, which is the new home of shyft innovations and our two proof-of-concept electric vehicles.
our innovation team continues to impress me with their progress on the development and build status of our two proof-of-concept electric vehicles. this product is not immune to the supply challenges, but we are currently on track to the project time line we introduced in june, and we look forward to unveiling this product -- this proof-of-concept vehicle in the first quarter of 2022. with that, i'll turn the call over to jon to discuss shyft's financial results for the third quarter in more detail as well as provide an update on our 2021 outlook, beginning on slide 6.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
thank you, daryl, and good morning, everyone. please turn to slide 7, and i'll provide an overview of our financial results for the third quarter. in q3, we delivered record sales and profit. we saw strong revenue growth in both segments and delivered another quarter of sequential margin improvements despite higher inflation and increased supply chain delays.
revenue for the third quarter was a record $272.6 million, up 34% from the year-ago quarter. income from continuing operations was $21 million, compared to net income of $19.4 million a year ago. diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.58 per share, compared to $0.54 per share in the third quarter of 2020. our gross margin for the quarter was 20.6%, consistent with our year-to-date margin levels despite operating in a more challenging period.
prior year gross margin was 24.9%, the highest in company history, as we benefited from favorable product mix driven by increased fleet volume and reduced truck body sales. as expected, our mix returned to a more normalized level in 2021. we also saw favorable pricing and productivity in the quarter, which helped us offset the impact of higher inflation and supply disruptions. on an adjusted basis, ebitda from continuing operations increased to $33.7 million, up from $32.6 million last year.
as a percent of sales, adjusted ebitda was 12.4% versus 16% last year. it's important to note that we saw sequential improvement in adjusted ebitda, up 70 basis points from 11.7% in the second quarter, while managing through a tougher supply environment and investing an additional $2 million in our ev chassis and body initiative. let me now walk through our results by operating segment, beginning with fleet vehicles & services on slide 8. our fvs business continued to perform at a high level, posting another quarter of impressive sales growth, profit, and order intake, while the team remained diligent on pricing and management of the supply base.
the business achieved revenue of $198.5 million, up 36.7%, compared to $145.2 million a year ago. the increase was driven by robust end-market parcel delivery demand, including a continued ramp in velocity while truck body sales more than doubled after a covid-impacted third quarter last year. fvs adjusted ebitda was $36.8 million versus $33.2 million a year ago. adjusted ebitda margin was 18.5% of sales, which is the second highest in fvs history, behind the third quarter of last year.
fvs backlog was up 15% sequentially and up a remarkable 231% compared to prior year. the year-over-year increase was driven by parcel delivery vehicles, particularly walk-in vans and velocity, in addition to the usps add-on order of $53 million. please turn to slide 9 for the specialty vehicle segment overview. specialty vehicle sales momentum continued in the third quarter.
sales for the quarter were $74.1 million, an increase of $15.8 million or 27.1% versus prior year and up 9% organically, with consistent growth across product lines. adjusted ebitda was $5.8 million, up -- or 7.9% of sales, compared to $7.2 million or 12.3% of sales in the same period last year, with the decrease primarily driven by raw material and labor inflation as well as supply constraints impacting production, both of which accelerated in the third quarter. these factors collectively outpaced the pricing actions that we took earlier in the year. we will see incremental price benefits starting in october, and we expect to fully recover the inflation impact in the coming quarters.
sv backlog was up 82% to $94 million, which included significant growth in both motorhome and service bodies. please turn to the liquidity and outlook update on slide 10. we remain focused on managing our overall liquidity and cash flow to fund our operations and growth initiatives. through the first 9 months of 2021, we generated $42 million in cash from operations, enabling us to pay off our debt entirely, leaving zero borrowings at the end of the quarter.
at the end of september, we had total liquidity of $184 million, including $15 million of cash on hand and $169 million in borrowing availability under our current credit agreement. capex for the quarter was approximately $6 million. year to date, we have spent $18 million on capital, and we expect the full year to be approximately $25 million, in line with the upper end of our previously disclosed range. overall, our team has executed at a high-level year to date.
and despite dealing with a highly dynamic supply chain and labor market, we are pleased with our overall results. as we look forward, we are optimistic about the underlying demand for our products and our ability to sustain growth. we expect inflation and supply constraints to continue into next year, and we are taking the appropriate actions to mitigate the impact. given our performance to date and solid backlog position, we are pleased to raise our 2021 midpoint guidance as follows: revenue of $950 million, up from $925 million; adjusted ebitda of $109 million, up from $105 million; and adjusted eps of $1.99 per share, up from $1.85 per share.
with that, i'll turn the call back to daryl for closing remarks.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, jon. please turn to slide 11. our record third quarter results reflect the success of our long-term growth strategy and the efforts of our incredible team. our commitment to quality execution, innovation, and operational excellence is generating improved revenue and profitability.
i'm proud of the dedication and collaboration of our team as they manage through the current macroeconomic issues to ensure we deliver for our customers and our shareholders. we remain nimble and creative in our approach managing our suppliers and labor into 2022 while continuing to invest in our team and new products, our operations, and technologies that will drive our future growth. with that, operator, we are now ready to take questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] the first question is from matt koranda of roth capital. please go ahead.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. thanks for taking my question.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
good morning, matt.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
on the margin front, it just seems like you're not getting the pull-through from the pretty exciting revenue growth that you've generated in 3q. i just wanted to see if you could maybe put a finer point in each segment may be on sort of what the headwinds were related to product cost inflation, labor inflation. and it sounded like there's recovery coming from price action, especially in scv, but wanted to see if you could maybe speak to pricing in both scv and fleet vehicles to kind of recover some of the headwinds that you've been experiencing on the inflation front.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
sure, matt. this is jon. i think when we look at the overall performance, we're certainly pleased with the result from an ebitda percentage perspective. but as we said in the prepared remarks, there's certainly some headwinds that we faced in the quarter.
i think when you look at it across the board, we've seen the impact of inflation, just like others, on commodities, labor, etc. i think our team has done a really nice job being able to manage through that as well as the supply constraints and have been able to offset that, i think, more so on the fvs side, at least in the quarter than on the sv side. we've taken multiple price increases on and really across the business. i think if you look at pieces of the business, we've taken three or four price increases throughout the year.
and so we've seen that pricing sort of trickle in, and we felt the impact of that in q3 and expect to see more of that in q4. and so we'll continue to be conscious of the environment and the markets. we continue to execute and look for opportunities to lock material and pricing consistent with the strategy that we've talked about previously and really just focusing on execution of getting products in the hands of our customers. i think that there were some inefficiencies that occurred in the quarter, really just driven by part shortages.
and so the team had to be nimble throughout the quarter, which certainly impacted productivity, but we did see productivity across the business in the quarter as well. and so i think as we look at all those pieces and look at how we performed year to date, i mentioned the gross margin is consistent for the first three quarters of the year. i think we're really, really pleased with the way the team has performed.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
great. very helpful, jon. thank you. and then just one more for me, just on the fleet vehicles side.
backlog still looks extremely healthy. just wanted to see if you could clarify. is the usps order, the $53 million order in backlog -- in the backlog figure that you provided for fvs. and then just wondered maybe, daryl, if you could speak to sort of trends in order flow that you've seen as of late.
it looks pretty healthy here, but maybe you could just parse out sort of strength in velocity platform, what the mix looks like in terms of backlog, and any other trends that are notable in the fleet vehicles backlog.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
i can answer both of those. first one is easy. yes, it's in our backlog. your second question, we are seeing the velocity increase in backlog, but we're also seeing a number of fedex ground contractors and dealers ordering both velocity and traditional walk-in vans.
so -- and as jon mentioned, truck body is up significantly over q3 last year. so we're seeing it on all the products. i don't think i could pick one in particular, but we're excited about how it is across all the products and not just in one. and it's a diverse customer base, too, not just one.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
that's great. and i lied. one more question just around the usps contract, more of a modeling-oriented question. but i recall last go around with this, there was quite a bit of pass-through revenue associated with the cabin chassis on that truck body contract that you had.
is it dissimilar? is it going to be recognized in a similar way this go around? or is that $53 million all just sort of truck body revenue to you guys? just if you could clarify that for us in terms of modeling this, that would be helpful.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
yes. no, the order is consistent with what we had last time. so we'll be procuring chassis and building truck bodies. and so that is the $53 million inclusive of both.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. very helpful. also, thank you, guys. thank you.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
thanks, matt.
operator
the next question is from steve dyer of craig-hallum. please go ahead.
steve dyer -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
thanks, guys. great quarter. as it relates to the supply chain, i guess, the subject de jour, does it feel like things are getting incrementally a little bit better with supply chain? or is it still a slog? i mean, i guess, any color as to when you feel like things will loosen up a bit.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
i'll start with that, steve. thank you for your quarter comment. the team appreciates it. it's interesting because we've -- it's constantly on our mind.
we're talking about it. some days, we think the chassis supply is breaking loose with the chips. and then a few days later, we'll hear that there's a short shutdown at one of the chassis suppliers. and we think we got supply on some fiberglass, which i think we mentioned last quarter, where we went to nine different suppliers trying to get the aerocaps.
and then they'll have some issue procuring supply, and then it moves into the labor piece. so i would tell you it's about the same. it's been the same all year. i mean, it's been a constant battle, but the team -- and i can't say enough about how resourceful they have been.
and actually looking through the backlog and understanding the volume and making sure they had enough product procured, they didn't -- they'd find other suppliers. and that's -- look, that's frankly what allowed us to have the successful quarter that we had. and as we look into q4, i think we're in pretty good shape. and in the beginning of q2 -- 2022, things could change.
but right now, it has been the same, and we see it continuing at least through the first half of 2022, for sure.
steve dyer -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
got it. and then just with respect to, i guess, to capital spending or capital allocation, i guess, bigger picture, you guys generate a lot of cash, have very, very little debt at this point. and the strategy has sort of historically been to find accretive tuck-in acquisitions, things that are sort of make sense to your business. is that sort of still a strategy? i guess, any color you could give on the acquisition pipeline, sort of how you sort of see things playing out going forward.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. again, i'll lead with that, steve. and maybe you have a financial question, we can move over to jon. but we do still have our pipeline as we continue to have that every friday morning.
i think with the supply constraints and all the disruption that people are dealing with, there's only been a couple of assets that we felt were something we could look at. we've looked at them, haven't executed on any of them for various reasons. but it is tight. i think people are waiting to see what's going to happen because they -- when you try to value a company that has had supply constraints all year and revenues are down on most companies and profits are down, the owner is looking for something different.
we're still searching and are in some discussions. but right now, nothing actionable. but we'll continue to do that. our preference, right, we've done four recently, which have been smaller tuck-ins, like you said.
we'd rather do something larger, but we continue to look at both the smaller one and something that might be a third leg or a larger acquisition, but nothing right now that we see in the horizon is actionable.
steve dyer -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
got it. ok. last one for me. and no offense to jon, but it's not financial.
your manufacturing capacity, you've added a bunch. you've kind of rejiggered capabilities geographically the last few years. sort of how do you feel like you're set up there? i don't expect you to give me a utilization number. but i guess, just big picture, do you feel like you're starting to rub up against needing more or different or different locations? or do you feel like you're set up pretty well there for the next couple of years?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. good question, steve. i'm glad you're starting to understand how our flexible manufacturing strategy that we put in place is working, right? due to the lumpiness of the orders, to us, it doesn't matter what name is on the front of the plant, right? whether it's an sv or fvs plant, if it's got capacity, we're going to try to fill it because we continue to grow. there's -- we're looking at expanding currently in pennsylvania.
last -- maybe it was in '18, we did that usps order in a smaller plant in pennsylvania. we like where we're seeing the truck body order, so we're looking to expand that facility and probably would more than double it, i believe, with some of the buildings we're looking at. we continue to add in capacity in kansas city. and as we see the orders and the growth, we do have some -- with the pennsylvania comes to -- if you get that finalized, that will give us an extra 100-and-some thousand square feet, which will last for a while.
but right now, nothing else besides that. but i do feel right. there is capacity available because currently, we're still running mainly on one shift in a lot of locations, but it's just -- we've tried to go to two shifts when needed, and it's a struggle just due to the labor challenges that we're seeing today in the market. but i think the team has done a really good job over the last five, six years managing our footprint, and we'll continue to do that.
i think we continue to add it into the script, and we talk about our long-term growth strategy. but we -- as a reminder, we do have a five-year rolling strategy that we continue to look at. and part of that discussion is capacity. so we're usually ahead of the game, and we'll continue to run that same process forward.
steve dyer -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
got it. that's very helpful. thanks, daryl, and congrats again.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
the next question is from felix boeschen of raymond james. please go ahead.
felix boeschen -- raymond james -- analyst
hey. good morning, daryl, jon, juris.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
steve dyer -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
good morning.
juris pagrabs -- group treasurer and head of investor relations
morning.
felix boeschen -- raymond james -- analyst
i was hoping to start on the grocery comments. you mentioned expanding the kc facility there for refrigerated units. i'm just curious, from your conversations with customers, is that where you think the market is going, refrigeration versus maybe more dry van bodies with insulation? just curious if you could maybe talk to the grocery opportunity in general and how you're approaching it.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. look, any new product, new location -- i mean, i can go back, felix, to what we did with amazon, right, when we were able to solidify that order. we gave them 10 trucks, all different shapes, and sizes and different options. and that's where we're actually at with the grocery guys.
it was nice to receive the order, but that's -- by receiving that order, no means do i feel or believe that that's going to be the only solution in the market, right? this is something they're trying. they like the product. and it's not a big truck body. so it's not a real large space to if you will, cool or freeze.
but even in there, right, they're going to have to have some compartmentalization inside the truck. so they're still trying to figure out, and we're right beside them like we have been with all of our customers to make sure we give them different solutions and different ideas to help them be more efficient at what they're doing. i mean i'm not sure if you saw it, but there was some stuff on cnbc this morning by what kroger -- the strategy kroger is doing. i think we alluded to that on a couple of calls ago, last call that they're going to try to do without brick-and-mortar stores and do it more from a dc center.
so it's starting to, in my opinion, gain some traction, maybe not as fast as last-mile delivery did, but it will still be something there. and we feel confident we'll be in the mix when the vehicles are finally -- and again, i don't think there'll be one solution for all of them. so there could be different strategies by different customers and different grocers. so we'll continue to monitor and offer ideas.
felix boeschen -- raymond james -- analyst
right. ok. that's helpful. and then just maybe switching gears a little bit, but i'm curious if you could touch on the velocity product lineup.
and curious if you could specifically comment on the progress of the mercedes and ram chassis launch sort of the timeline there and expectations.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yes. for sure, i do know the ram. so we are done with our testing. vehicle passed.
it's ready to go. and some of our customers are in discussions with stellantis to understand how many vehicles they're going to get for 2022. so it is ready, and we believe we'll see some orders. i'm not sure we'll get them in q4, but there should be some in early '22 on that vehicle.
it did -- the customers liked it when they do. and we also, like i said, passed all the durability testing. so we're ready to go. we're just waiting for the orders, which is the typical process.
and i'm going to defer to jon if he has any updates on mercedes. i've not heard of anything lately.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean we do have three orders in the backlog, and those will be in production. if not december, it will be early next year.
felix boeschen -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. ok. and then -- and i was hoping, jon, to just follow up quickly on the specialty vehicles margins and the commentary around recovering the full cost inflation with price over time. i was wondering, just looking at the backlog in that segment, it seems like that could happen pretty swiftly into early 2022, assuming we run through pricing actions in 4q.
curious if you would agree to disagree with that statement or how we should think about that sequential ramp there.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
yeah. no, i think you're right in that. i mean we will see -- we've taken additional pricing in q4. we will see benefits from pricing that we've already taken earlier in the year incrementally in q4.
and then as we work through that backlog, we will -- early next year, we should be in that recovery piece. i think it's important to note as we look at where the business is today, the q4 will look more like the first half of the year for sv than it did in q3. and so we expect incremental sequential improvement there going into next year.
felix boeschen -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. very helpful stuff there. i appreciate it.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
thanks, felix.
operator
the next question is from mike shlisky of d.a. davidson. please go ahead.
michael shlisky -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
morning.
michael shlisky -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
can i -- i want to maybe touch on fvs performance in the quarter first. i think it's clear you've had probably fewer challenges than most in securing chassis and securing the parts you need. i mean it's not easy, but you've got -- you've done better than most of what it seems like at this point. do you -- can you maybe share with us whether you've seen better performance from the larger fleets, the big parcel delivery companies, to get these chassis as opposed to the smaller folks? are they paying up for chassis to make sure they have what they need for the holidays or for next year and certain smaller customers just not getting to same treatment from the fords or the gms of the world?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
i mean -- i think when you look at it, i wouldn't necessarily say they're paying off. i think we're -- the discussions that we were having even if you go back to last year was not necessarily on chassis availability, though we did anticipate some issues on that front earlier in the year, but it was more around just the overall demand profile for parcel and last-mile delivery in general. and so given the demand that we were seeing at the time are expected, we worked closely with our customers as well as with our own pool in terms of securing chassis early in the year. and so that's benefited us, i think, through certainly year to date.
and we continue to work closely with customers as we look at 2022 as well, even though there's some uncertainty in terms of volumes there. and so i think our ability to identify early in the year, you can even go back to q4 last year, in terms of securing chassis ourselves as well as supporting our customers in that. i think it's a big dynamic and potentially a differentiator.
michael shlisky -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. i also want to maybe get a little more granularity on some of your comments on ev. it's probably a bit more depth there. so one of your main competitors have been announcing publicly some new agreements with various ev platform providers like isuzu and atlas to develop the next generation of ev vehicles.
must have four or five, if not more than that, out there at this point. and then it clearly had your own platform coming as well, but that's going to be probably just one class of vehicle. can you update us as to what you're doing beyond the basic class 3 to address the ev sector? are you signing up more customers for touch of manufacturing or for platform development without announcing them? or is it just still all to come here?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
mike, i hope i remembered all your questions, but if i didn't, just please ask. yes, one big one. so first, i want to clarify, our ev strategy isn't only class 3. i believe in our analyst day we mentioned we're starting with class 3, and we're moving down to class 2 and up through class 5, right? so we will have, as we typically do, a one-stop-shop for any customer looking for ev product.
and it will be all on our chassis and our operating system, so we're not going to be buying any of that, but we will procure, as we typically do with our motorhome chassis, axles, springs, and things. we're not going to vertically integrate except in the software for the operating system. and that's shyft innovations. so we'll have the ability to build our own product or sell the chassis to others.
and then if we look at fvs, they are currently doing some ev builds for other customers, as we would expect, and possibly even doing some uplift for them, which we've talked about in the past. so they're having some good discussions. so as we talked at the analyst day, we wanted to make sure that we didn't mix it with fvs and utilimaster. you want to keep it as a separate group, which, so far, we feel was the right decision.
but we will have, in addition to just the chassis, we'll have some other products, i think, to talk to people about in the future.
michael shlisky -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
ok. just to kind of clarify there, oftentimes, when a company has partnered with your big competitor in some of these bodies, it's really not their decision, right? the customer can choose to specify utilimaster or the other guy, correct?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
absolutely, absolutely.
michael shlisky -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
so it doesn't mean that they're going to give business. got it.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
i think mike if you -- sorry to interrupt. if you look at -- there was a report out yesterday by morgan stanley that said, when it comes to evs, it's not demand that's the problem. it's the supply, right? so when people wonder if there's enough appetite out there, the answer from morgan stanley anyway is yes. and when they ask, is there enough business for more than a couple of suppliers? i think they also answer that by saying it's a demand problem.
so we're very comfortable with where we're at on the ev project, the timing. and as i mentioned, if i could share with you guys what i'm seeing and the progress the team is making, it's really rewarding that we made that decision back and announced the decision back in june.
michael shlisky -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. if i can just squeeze in one more here, can you update us on the royal business and if you've gotten any good integration benefits? or has that been put on pause given some of the supply chain issues?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
sorry. ask that question again.
michael shlisky -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
i just want to know how things are going with royal and magnum and if you have any additional benefits from trying to get the two prior lines across their footprints and whether you had to pause that because of the supply chain.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
are you talking more from the strategy standpoint?
michael shlisky -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
yeah, exactly.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
i'll -- i thought it was more toward the financial. but yes, on the strategy side, for sure, we are currently mounting duramag bodies in the california locations. we're doing -- mounting duramag bodies in florida as well as doing some of our royal bodies out of our existing facilities in florida as well. and i think i mentioned we are building some other bodies in our south carolina facility to increase capacity for the duramag.
so we're excited about how that progress and the integration between the two are going. and if i can mention again, i mean, tom ninneman, our coo, was just out at in maine the last few days. and i talked to him this morning, and he's really excited with the throughput that they're getting due to our lean activities. and we're hoping we'll see the same progress there that we saw in royal over the last probably a year or so when we really focused on improving operations to improve capacity.
and it was good to hear the report when it came back.
michael shlisky -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
it sounds like all systems go. thank you so much. have a good day.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer

good day, and welcome to the shyft group's fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings results conference call. [operator instructions] this event is being recorded. at this time, i'd like to turn the conference over to juris pagrabs, group treasurer and head of investor relations. please go ahead.
juris pagrabs -- group treasurer and head of investor relations
thank you, allison, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the shyft group's fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. joining me on the call today are daryl adams, our president and chief executive officer; and jon douyard, our chief financial officer. for today's call, we've included a presentation deck that has been filed with the sec and is also available on our website at the shyftgroup.com. you may download the deck from the investor relations section of our website to follow along with our presentation during the call.
before we start, please turn to slide 2 of the presentation for our safe harbor statement. you should be aware that certain statements made during today's conference call, which may include management's current outlook, viewpoint, predictions and projections regarding the shyft group and its operations may be considered forward-looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. i caution you that as with any prediction or projection, there are a number of factors that could cause the shyft group's actual results to differ materially from projections. all known risks that management believes could materially affect the results are identified in our forms 10-k and 10-q filed with the sec.
however, there may be other risks that we cannot anticipate. on the call today, we will provide a business update, including an overview of business trends before moving on to a more detailed review of the results and our outlook for 2022. we will then open the line for q&a. i'd like to also remind everyone that with the divestiture of the emergency response business in february 2020, the revenues and expenses associated with the ar business as well as the assets and liabilities have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
with this reclassification, the results discussed today will refer to continuing operations unless otherwise noted. in the fourth quarter of 2021, the company made a change in its segments and moved montebello and strobes-r-us from the fvs segment to the sv segment, consistent with the change in organizational reporting. at this time, i'm pleased to turn the call over to daryl for his comments beginning on slide 3. 
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, juris. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. the past year was challenging in many ways, but the power of our strategy has again been highlighted in our record results. they've often said on these calls, we always try to be agile, nimble, flexible, proactive and solution-based in everything we do.
last year, we saw the benefits of this approach and what is truly possible with the right strategy and the right team. our team proactively managed through the many challenges with resourcefulness and relentless focus on execution for our customers. 2021 was a year of record financial operational performance built on the incredible efforts of our entire team. our perseverance as we navigated against industrywide challenges is what made the difference in our performance and positions us for greater success in the coming years.
our efforts have been rewarded in continued strong customer demand of our products as illustrated by our backlog, which is now over $1 billion. turning to slide 4 for our financial summary. our team did a tremendous job executing on our growth plans and navigating supply and labor challenges to generate year-over-year revenue growth of 47% to a record $992 million. with our industry-leading products, we continue to see a very strong demand result in increased order intake and record backlogs.
for the first time in the company's history, adjusted ebitda was over $100 million, ending at $108 million, up 42% year-over-year. adjusted income was a record of $75 million, while adjusted eps increased 56% to $2.08 from -- per share from $1.34 per share. we continue to see positive business opportunities in the market and believe it is imperative that we continue to invest in ourselves. in 2021, we invested $6.5 million in ev development, which impacted our margins by approximately 66 basis points for the full year.
we plan to continue these investments in 2022, which jon will outline later, as we believe they will put us in a leading position for the transition to electric vehicles throughout our core markets. please turn to slide 5, where i'll provide a business update. our fleet vehicle service business continues its pattern of strong growth driven by our two industry-leading parcel delivery vehicles, our traditional walk-in van and our velocity platform. you will recall the velocity platform was a customer-driven solution focused innovation, where we created an entirely new category of purpose-built class 2 and 3 walk-in vans.
we saw tremendous success in '21 as the f2 debuted on the road. also in 2021, we introduced and secured additional customer order of approximately 400 units for our velocity m3 parcel delivery vehicle. as a leading manufacturer of last mile delivery vehicles, we are excited by the potential this unique category has to offer. in fact, building on the success of our velocity platform, utilimaster is now taking orders on the new velocity r2 and under 10,000 pound gvwr walk-in van built on a ram promaster chassis, which will be debuted at the ntea truck show next month in indianapolis.
as a testament to the product's capability we recently received an order for 2,500 units from a leading parcel delivery customer. additionally, we recently announced that utilimaster work with ford pro to produce two pilot vehicles on the all-electric ford e transit chassis. these vehicles are currently being tested and are fit with our velocity body creating a route delivery vehicle conveyable to the velocity f-series gas-powered vehicle. moving to our specialty vehicles segment.
demand for our products continued and resulted in strong revenue growth in orders during the quarter. in our motorhome business, demand for our luxury motor coach chassis continues unabated as our market share increased to 31.2% for the quarter, reflecting the strength of our product offerings and brand among luxury motor coach consumers. to date, we continue to experience strong demand for motorhomes, and we expect this demand to continue through 2022. our market share growth continues to be driven by our introduction of new technologies into the market.
last month, we launched the red diamond leveling system at the tampa rv show. in our service body business, we are seeing indications of improved component and chassis supply beginning in the second quarter. we continue to expand our service body distribution channels geographically, and we recently secured a national distributor of specialty truck products to aid in the expansion of our magnum products. with strong backlogs, we are well positioned for another year of strong performance in sv.
on slide 6, i will update you on our development efforts to design a commercial-grade ev chassis delivery vehicle and supporting portable charger for a full ecosystem approach. as i've mentioned many times in the past, we looked for a viable ev chassis option, and we're unable to find one that met our needs. so we decided to build our own. we developed our proof-of-concept ev chassis an all new electric delivery vehicle by leveraging nearly 50 years of experience in custom chassis and last-mile delivery body manufacturing.
i'm excited to share with you that we are on schedule to our original time line and plan to have prototype vehicles in our customers' hands for testing and validation in the second half of this year. i'm incredibly excited by the progress the team has made in the development of this vehicle. in two weeks, we plan to reveal our all-new electric vehicle on our proprietary purpose-built class iii ev chassis with a portable charging solution at the ntea truck show in indianapolis. with a new look and a new lightweight body that has a high degree of configurability, this all-new vehicle is ideal for last mile delivery, work trucks, mass transit, recreational vehicles and other emerging ev markets.
we expect to begin taking orders next month and build electric delivery vehicles in 2023 with production launching in our plymouth location and ultimately transitioning to a flexible production facility in the southeast with annual capacity up to 2,500 vehicles per year, directly impacting the current supply gap in the commercial ev segment. with that, i'll turn the call over to jon to discuss shyft's financial results for the fourth quarter and full year in more detail, as well as provide our 2022 outlook beginning on slide 7.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
thank you, daryl, and good morning, everyone. please turn to slide 8, and i'll provide an overview of our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. overall, we are pleased with our team's performance and excited to report record results for the year, which we delivered despite the inflation pressures, supply chain delays, chassis availability and labor challenges that are broadly impacting our industry as well as many others. these macro headwinds accelerated in the fourth quarter and continue to remain dynamic through today.
that said, we were still able to deliver a solid quarter that included margin expansion year over year. revenue for the fourth quarter was a record $277.3 million, up 62% from a year ago quarter. income from continuing operations was $20.5 million compared to net income of $8.3 million a year ago. diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.56 per share, up 155% from $0.22 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020.
our gross margin for the quarter was 18.5% compared to 20.5% in the prior year. on an adjusted basis, ebitda from continuing operations for the fourth quarter increased to $26.6 million, up from $16 million last year. as a percent of sales, adjusted ebitda was 9.6% for the quarter. this compares favorably to the 9.3% of sales in the fourth quarter of last year.
adjusted net income for q4 was $20.2 million or $0.56 per share compared to $10.1 million or $0.27 per share. fourth quarter net income from continuing operations was $20.5 million. these results were favorably impacted by a tax benefit of $4.4 million or $0.12 per share, which the company earned by amending prior-year tax returns to include additional credits. our efforts in this area resulted in an effective tax rate of 17.2% for the full year.
i'll now walk through our results by operating segment, beginning with fleet vehicles and services on slide 10. our fvs business continued to perform well in q4, closing another year of impressive growth in sales, profit and order intake, while the team effectively managed through a dynamic market and supply chain environment. the business achieved revenue of $182.6 million, up 72.4% compared to $105.9 million a year ago. the increase was primarily driven by strong demand in deliveries of the velocity f2 walk-in van.
fvs adjusted ebitda for the quarter was $26.2 million versus $15.8 million a year ago. adjusted ebitda margin was 14.4% of sales compared to 14.9% in the fourth quarter last year, due in part to higher material and labor costs and unfavorable mix. fvs backlog was up 14.6% sequentially and up a remarkable 104% compared to prior year. the year-over-year increase was driven by strong demand in parcel delivery vehicles as well as the united states postal service add-on order of $53 million, which was announced in the fourth quarter.
given the size and length of the backlog, we continue to be proactive and look for ways to mitigate higher input costs and the team was effective in increasing price on new orders as well as repricing a significant portion of prior orders during the quarter. please turn to slide 11 for the specialty vehicle segment overview. as we talked about in the q3 call, we expected improved performance from sv in q4, and they delivered. fourth quarter sales were $94.7 million, an increase of $29 million or 44.1% versus prior year.
sales were driven by the continued strength of our product offerings and luxury motorhome chassis and service bodies as well as the new f-series class vii launched by isuzu. adjusted ebitda was $10.3 million or 10.8% of sales compared to $7.7 million or 11.7% of sales in the same period last year, reflecting higher material costs, inefficiencies from tight labor markets and unfavorable mix, which was partially offset by pricing actions. sv backlog was up an impressive 82.3% compared to the prior year, driven by continued order strength across product lines. please turn to the liquidity and capital allocation update on slide 12.
we remain focused on managing our overall liquidity and cash flow to fund our operations and growth initiatives as well as providing return to our shareholders. through diligent management of working capital throughout the year, we generated $74 million in cash from operations, enabling us to pay off our debt during the year. in the fourth quarter, we proactively amended our lending agreement to take advantage of favorable market conditions. the amendment provides a line of credit of $400 million, which is expandable to $600 million under certain circumstances through an accordion feature.
we believe this expanded credit line will provide ample liquidity and flexibility to fund the next phase of our growth initiatives. at the end of december, we had total liquidity of $414 million, including $37 million of cash on hand and zero revolver debt. capex for the quarter was approximately $4.8 million, while for the full year, we invested $23 million. key projects for the year included investments in velocity production, in-sourcing fabrication, establishing our new r&d facility as well as an initial investment in our new pennsylvania truck body facility.
we remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. in january, we repurchased 409,000 shares of company stock for $18.9 million, exhausting our most recent authorization. earlier this month, we announced the doubling of our quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share. and just this week, we announced that our board approved a new authorization to repurchase up to $250 million of company stock, providing us additional capital allocation flexibility moving forward.
before i close out my comments on 2021, i would also like to highlight that from an accounting and controls perspective, we continue to make significant progress. i'm incredibly pleased to report that our team has fully remediated the remaining material weakness in our internal controls. this result is reflective of the strong efforts of our finance, accounting and operating teams across the organization to which i'm extremely proud. please turn to slide 13.
as we look forward to 2022, we are optimistic about the long-term underlying demand for our products and feel our company is well positioned to meet our customers' growing needs. in the short term, we expect the ongoing impact of supply constraints, chassis availability and inflation to continue. and as we manage in this environment, we look to balance short-term cost management with the investment in our future and our ability to deliver future growth. as the market conditions continue to evolve, we expect financial performance to be softer for the first half of the year while seeing a more acute impact in the first quarter.
first quarter margins are expected to be approximately breakeven, followed by acceleration in q2 and a much stronger second half as we see the environment stabilizing. notwithstanding further supply chain-related deterioration, we are pleased to provide our 2020 guidance as follows. we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.25 billion, representing 16% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. adjusted ebitda of $90 million to $110 million, inclusive of approximately $30 million for ev development, which we have accelerated given the progress made to date on the program and the optimism we are hearing from our customers.
excluding this ev investment, our guidance implies a 13% growth rate at the midpoint for the core business, which is expected to achieve between $120 million and $140 million. adjusted eps of $1.57 per share to $1.99 per share, which includes $63 million per share of ev development costs. we expect capital expenditures in the year of approximately $35 million, including $10 million to $15 million of investments in ev as we look to start production heading into 2023. looking back on 2021, it was an exceptional year for the shyft group, driven by the resiliency of our team, the nimble approach we took to address industry challenges and the expression of innovation that is core to our dna.
and while we enjoy the success of the past year, we cannot afford to stand still. we will continue to innovate and expand our leadership across the industries we serve, energized for another year of strong financial performance. now, i'll turn the call back to daryl for closing remarks.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, jon. please turn to slide 11. our record results in 2021 reflect the success of our long-term growth strategy and the efforts of our amazing team. our long-standing commitment to quality, execution, innovation and operational excellence is generating improved sales and order growth.
our new products, including the velocity and our exciting new ev solution combined with our strong customer relationships enable us to achieve our strategic vision. i'm proud of the way the team came together to manage the broader inflationary and supply chain challenges in '21 and ensure that we will deliver for our customers and shareholders. while we enjoy the success of the past year, we remain driven to grow not just in our core business, but also in the electric vehicle space as well. looking ahead to 2022, our backlog is evidence that market demand remains very strong for all of our products.
we'll continue to take a nimble and creative approach to maintain our flexibility in managing our supply chain and production processes while investing in our people, our new products and technology and in operational excellence that will drive our future growth by providing customer-centric chassis and truck body solutions for the customers. before turning the call back to the operator, i'll pass it back to jon for a quick announcement.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
thanks, daryl. i'd like to quickly take the opportunity to acknowledge juris' contributions to the company over the past six years. he has been a great partner to me and to darly and to the entire leadership team here at shyft, and we wish him all the best as he transitions into a well-deserved retirement in the coming months. during his tenure, juris was a key leader in the transformation of the company, and he navigated through all the change admirably.
you will certainly be missed. congratulations juris and best of luck, and we look forward to announcing his replacement shortly. with that, operator, we're now ready for the q&a portion of the call.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question today will come from steve dyer with craig-hallum capital group. please go ahead.
unknown speaker -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
good morning, guys. ryan on for steve. 
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, ryan.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
good morning, ryan. 
unknown speaker -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
and congrats, juris, as well. first question, i think i caught it in the commentary on q1 guidance, but did you say breakeven for q1? and if so, can you give some more detail there on what's going into it?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
yeah. no, you certainly heard that correctly. and i would point to a couple of things. the biggest piece being around chassis availability and what we've seen in terms of planned as well as unplanned shutdowns from an oem perspective.
which really provides us with -- we still have volume flowing through our plants, but it limits the mix of vehicles that we're able to build on. a couple of examples of this, the stellantis factory down in saltillo, mexico has been down for a month -- planned shut down for a month and a half as they retooled that plant impacting upfit and velocity timing. but we're also seeing it in our service body business, which daryl made the comment in his remarks, but we are starting to see improvement here in march and into q2 from that perspective as well. and so there's some challenges there.
i think there are some discrete items that we would also point to that we can say will improve as the year progresses. one being our pennsylvania facility, which has been down for the first quarter, just given some delays from contractors and permitting and those types of things, which is now operating. and so we will continue to see that, and we have record backlog in the truck body business today. also, just from a velocity perspective, some of the timing of the orders and the chassis deliveries on that, be a bit softer in q1.
and so there's some specific items we would point to where we've certainly got the backlog, and our teams are ready to execute when chassis present themselves.
unknown speaker -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
and just to clarify, is that an eps or an ebitda comment?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
it was an ebitda comment.
unknown speaker -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. moving on to the ev investments of $30 million this year. i appreciate the breakout there. it's helpful.
how should we think about that over the next several years? is that an upfront investment this year and probably into next year before the commercial launch and then it scales back or is that kind of steady run rate and then you just get better leverage through it as you start getting the volumes and the revenue coming in?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
yeah, i'll start. maybe, daryl, you can jump in here. but i think as we look at the overall framework for the investment that we laid out, we're still in line with what our expectations were. we have accelerated investment, as i mentioned, just given some of the excitement that we've seen around the product as well as the progress the team has been able to make in an incredibly short period of time.
so we will see what we had initially thought would be more balanced between '22 and '23. we plan to have more upfront investment there to get that vehicle really production ready by the end of the year and in customers' hands starting in 2023, which at that point, you would have the revenue and profit supporting the business.
unknown speaker -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
last one for us, just kind of following up on the ev opportunity. what are you hearing from customers? i realize you're not taking orders yet. but what's kind of the early indication from either wanting to beta test or potentially even wanting to put in orders, but you guys are not accepting them yet?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yes. ryan, this is daryl. i'll take this one. so i've been in a number of customer meetings with dealers.
and these are dealers that, as you can imagine, are trying to get their hands on any ev they can. so we've had them out. they looked at the vehicle. they've seen the chassis.
they're excited. they're all going to be done at the ntea truck show in early march, two weeks from now. and we're hearing from our traditional last-mile delivery parcel customers. they're hearing the buzz as well.
and i think you've seen we're not putting out in front any of the orders or anything that we're taking. we want to wait until we get to the truck show. we want to show the product and let everybody see it before we start taking any orders in or even talking about it. but it has gotten out and the -- all the customers are excited.
we actually have them calling us asking for the -- when can they get the product. and we've not gone to them yet because we want to unveil it first. so we're seeing a lot of excitement. the waves are starting to pick up, and we're excited to meet with everybody at the truck show in two weeks.
unknown speaker -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
if i can sneak one more in quick here. just kind of on the other side. do you think when the competitive ev chassis comes to market, you think that impacts your supply from ford and others as you look to get e-transits and do work for them. thanks, and good luck guys.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
no. ryan, we -- yeah, thank you. no, that's -- we thought long and hard about that at the beginning, and that's why we went into the class iii space, right, because most of their vehicles will be in the class ii because we didn't want to disrupt any of that current relationship that we had with them. and there right now, none of them play in the class iii space.
so we believe we're -- i don't want to say isolated, but we feel we still have a great relationship with them in the class ii space. ok, next caller.
operator
thank you. our next question today will come from felix boeschen of raymond james. please go ahead.
felix boeschen -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody. and juris, congratulations.
juris pagrabs -- group treasurer and head of investor relations
felix, thank you.
felix boeschen -- raymond james -- analyst
congratulations. i wanted to follow up on the ev here and specifically around the $30 million into next year. i think originally, the entire cost of project, you'll have pegged in $50 million to $75 million at all. and i was under the impression the split was going to be roughly 50-50 between r&d and capex.
has that split changed at all or that all in, call it, $75 million number. what i'm really trying to figure out is, it sounds like you guys did $6 million in '21 and then another $30 million. so that kind of gets you already to 50% of the $75 million just on r&d costs alone. just kind of trying to think through that, jon.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
yes. yeah, i think the framework is close. i think we said 50-50 potentially closer to 60-40 from an expense standpoint. so as you think about that, we are planning to have a developed vehicle here at the end of the year.
and so from an expense standpoint, our expectation is that a majority of the cost will be more upfront than potentially the level loading that we had indicated previously.
felix boeschen -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. so put another way, i'm not asking for exact guidance into '23, but it sounds like that $30 million into 2023 should be materially lower as you guys start producing the actual vehicles?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
i think that's fair specifically for the class iii vehicle. and i think you'll start to see some of the capital expenditures pick up here in late '22 and into '23, as we get into production.
felix boeschen -- raymond james -- analyst
and then i also wanted to touch a little bit on the announcement earlier in the week on the share buyback authorization. curious, if you guys could talk a bit about capital allocation in general. and maybe, daryl, as part of that, how you're thinking about the m&a pipeline at this point? or frankly, if you think buying back stock, is just a better use of capital right now.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
daryl, you want to go first?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, i think -- i'll start on the m&a piece as well. i mean, i think m&a continues to be the number one priority for us. we've been active in a number of -- with the number of target companies here over the last couple of months.
but at the same time, we're not going to reach or particularly for returns that don't make sense to our business. and so in the absence of that, we really wanted some flexibility from a capital allocation standpoint, particularly as we sit here, debt-free at the end of the year. and so it was nice to see that our board was supportive of that flexibility. but again, we'd like to invest in ourselves as well as continue down the m&a path as well.
and felix, i would only add a little bit on the m&a piece to what jon talked about is we continue to be active in the market. in our space, there's not a lot out there, but we are spending a lot of time on outreach. we're also looking maybe, if you will, to bringing in some more fab, so maybe an acquisition in a larger fab facility as we continue to grow, we're seeing benefit of in-sourcing that. and if we get a fab facility it'll let us to move some of our current equipment out of our plants, get more production out of them and have a separate plant to do the fab.
so we're looking at a number of alternatives. and i think, as jon said, we're active and we're hoping this year we can close one.
felix boeschen -- raymond james -- analyst
so it's got to be right... 
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
we're not going to reach and it's going to be something where we think we get the right synergies out of to make it accretive to the company instead of impacting it negatively.
felix boeschen -- raymond james -- analyst
ok, that's helpful. and then, jon, just quickly following up on the share repo. is any of that embedded in the eps guidance for 2022?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
not beyond what we did in january.
felix boeschen -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. and then just my last one. just kind of curious if you could talk about just the ebitda cadence through the year, jon, what kind of gives you confidence in the 2h ramp going from, say, breakeven in 1q? and does that breakeven assumption assume that sales would be down year-over-year, presumably on chassis constraints?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
we'll see. when you look at the first quarter, we'll see -- we'll likely see units down will be offset by some of the pricing actions that we took in the year. but i think we see clarity to grow up into the second quarter and the second half. i touched on some of those with our truck body facility in pennsylvania, which will be in production was not in production here in -- up until this week really.
and we're sitting on a record backlog from that perspective. velocity, just the timing of the orders as well as how the oems have laid out chassis timing. part of that was due to the stellantis shutdown, but we'll start to see those chassis flow here shortly, which gives us confidence in a q2 ramp as well. and so i think if you look at -- you look at the year from a profitability perspective, it's certainly back-end loaded.
you're probably in the 30% to 40% range in the first half and then it will -- it ramps in the second half.
felix boeschen -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. very helpful. i'll stop there.
operator
our next question today will come from mike shlisky of d.a. davidson. please go ahead.
mike shlisky -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
yes. hey, guys. good morning. i want to wish all the best to you, juris.
thanks for everything. all the best to all of you. i really appreciate it. 
juris pagrabs -- group treasurer and head of investor relations
thanks, mike.
mike shlisky -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
yeah. and i wanted to start on some of your non-parcel and non-final mile vehicles, your royal truck body, your magnum, stuff like that. can you give me just some sense as to how those are going. i'd be curious if you could share with us if there are any particular locations that are standing out besides obviously the final mile piece.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
maybe i'll start, mike, on the product side and let jon talk about the sales side. from a product standpoint in our strategy, we're seeing progress, as i mentioned, geographically between the duramag product coming from the northeast and transitioning that into both florida and kansas city area and into the california area. nice progress. we're also seeing it come back the other way with the royal product moving across the country.
we were just down at our board meeting down and took a tour of the strobes plant. and we saw the service bodies there. they're already mounting them with some of the landscape body. so from a strategic standpoint, our strategy is working.
we're seeing growth in both of the two product lines and look forward to continuing to move that -- this new dealer that we -- distributor that we picked up for the magnum headache racks is going to be, we think, exciting. we get more distribution across the country with that as well. i don't know, jon, do you want to talk about the performance of those two.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think when you look at it from a top-line standpoint, the businesses have performed incredibly well and potentially moving faster than our expectations when we acquired them. and i think that's the testament to the things that daryl talk about in terms of our ability to execute on the value creation strategies of geographic expansion, continued product launches. we've got the shift through with gm picking up here in q1, which will be a nice add.
so really picking that brand nationally. i think in terms of locations, i think those businesses are relatively broad. we speak to it more in the infrastructure space, although we have seen some benefit from higher oil prices down in our texas branches as well, but it's a pretty broad-based customer base.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
and i think...
mike shlisky -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
mike, we look at the fvs side, right? we're seeing much more customer, let me say, diversity, right, when we're seeing their growth, too. it's not all in parcel, which is nice, right? we have some food and beverage. we have some laundry and linen. we actually have some food coming into there, some grocery and there is synergy.
so we're seeing a nice maybe broad type of expansion on the fvs backlog as well.
mike shlisky -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
so if something happen, it does sound pretty strong across the board.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
yes, for sure. 
mike shlisky -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great. great. 
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
i think the point there, right, is that our underlying strength of our products is strong. we've seen the backlog. customers want it and they're willing to wait. we're just -- right now, we got some chassis supply issues that the industry has to work through.
mike shlisky -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
and speaking of supply, i want to touch on another topic, a tough day to be on earnings on a day like this, but a lot of the global aluminum supply does come out of eastern europe, russia, ukraine area. have you seen any issues or changes with some of the quoting of that commodity? are you prepared or looking to find ways to make sure that you can work through any issues that any kind of armed conflict might cause here?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
dan, you want to walk through the strategy that fvs has put in place on that.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
talk to a couple of things. i mean, obviously, we'll see how this plays out, but the expectation of continued inflation, both from an aluminum commodity and fuel standpoint, i think is likely. i think our team continues to do a nice job of being able to lock in material, and we are locked for a significant portion of our volumes for the year for both sheet and extrusion. and so we'll continue to do that, but the environment does remain dynamic that our teams are staying really close to it.
mike shlisky -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
ok. ok. i'll leave it there guys. thanks so much for the help.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, mike.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
thanks, mike.

our next question today will come from matt koranda with roth capital. please go ahead.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hey, guys and i'll add my congrats to juris as well. thanks for everything.
juris pagrabs -- group treasurer and head of investor relations
hey, matt. 
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
on the fleet vehicles order flow, i'm just curious, is this sort of high $200 million sort of implied order flow that we're running at sort of a comfortable range to be in for the next several quarters, do you think there is room for that to sort of tick up with some of the diversity of demand that you've mentioned in truck body and other elements of fleet vehicles beyond velocity. and then maybe i also was curious if you could speak to price. you said a couple of interesting things in the prepared remarks around taking price, but also going back and renegotiating some of the price that's in the backlog, and just wondered if you could speak to sort of the stickiness of that order flow or those embedded orders that you go out and take price on that, that were already in the backlog and sort of how that's impacting the movements in backlog. that's my first question.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
sure. yeah, i mean i think when you look at really the last five quarters, i think you would see fbs order flow in that mid to high $20 million range. daryl alluded to it as well. we continue to see really strong orders here through the first quarter -- first two months of the first quarter.
and so, the trend continues. and i think this is clearly not a demand issue that we're staring at here. i think we do continue to diversify the backlog, to your point, i think truck body continues to be really strong for us. we feel like we're well positioned there to be taking share and then the underlying parcel piece as well.
when you look at the repricing that we did from a backlog perspective, it was actually, i think, pretty well received and understood. i think it's no secret what's happening from an external environment standpoint. so when you think about the stickiness of it, we have very little fallout single-digit millions of fallout from that exercise. and so we've got to stay on top of it and continue to be proactive there as the environment continues to evolve.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok, got it. and then when we think about the outlook for the year and sort of the back half weighted year here, it does look like just looking at the fvs backlog and the guidance that you provided that you'll be probably delivering on a good portion of the existing backlog that you've got at the moment. so i was curious about sort of capacity to deliver on that backlog as we kind of move into the back half of the year, just given that you guys are sort of suggesting a pretty big uptick in production rates in the back half. what are some of the gating items that we should be thinking about? i mean, obviously, chassis is always top of mind for folks.
but are there any other gating items that we should be thinking about as it pertains to your ability to deliver on the fvs backlog, maybe labor or other kind of production constraints?
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
maybe i'll take it, jon, the beginning and let you jump in on the end. so matt, from a facility standpoint, we don't -- right now, we don't see any road blocks, right? we're planning for it. we're making some changes. we actually have some very timely automation that's getting put in.
it's a little delayed. it was supposed to be in last year, but late last year, delayed due to components and supplier issues. so those are, i believe, being set up right now, which will help with our expansion, right? we've seen the backlog grow. a few years ago, we were looking at maybe four to six months, right? now it's out to about a year.
so we've seen it coming, and we've made plans from a manufacturing standpoint. now some of the -- you mentioned one of them, right, other than chassis, you mentioned labor. so it is something that continues to be challenging. but as we did in '21 and '20, right, we're able to find enough labor to help us build the products.
we believe we have a good formula and the team is right now making efforts to get people on board to take that ramp. and it's -- over the last number of years, we've had that muscle memory of really building hard q2 and 3 and then q1 and 4 are a little bit less. so we continue to try to get our customers to level load that, but they continue to stay with their typical patterns. so we've gained some muscle memory and the team is ready to hire.
so we believe we'll have success there. jon, i don't know if you have anything else to add.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
no. i think you got it.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. great. and then just wondered, maybe, jon, if you could help put a finer point on sort of the ebitda margin bridge that you sort of embedded into guidance for '22? it looks like the chart was helpful where you stripped out the ev development costs, and it doesn't like you expect the underlying ebitda margin in the business to expand slightly relative to '21. can you just talk about some of the puts and takes around sort of mix and price cost and the underlying movements there so we can understand a little bit more about sort of what you're assuming for the year in '22 ebitda.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
sure. i think from a mix perspective, a couple of things. i think as our truck body business grows, it has historically been a mix negative for us. the other thing i would point to there is we've got the usps truck body or the pass-through from a chassis perspective in there as well, which is 20 to 30 basis point headwind for us.
from a pricing and inflation standpoint, we were actually -- in q4, we were basically neutral from a price cost standpoint, so good progress by the team. we expect that to improve as we get into '22. but we're not going to get necessarily the margin uplift there given just the dynamics of how the calculations work. and so those more or less offset each other from a rate perspective, but certainly covered from a dollar standpoint.
we continue to push productivity and those types of things. but certainly, the ev investment is a headwind when you include that. and so overall, i think relatively flat from a guidance standpoint with some of the mix pressures that we talked about.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. very helpful. and then last one for me. maybe i'll just ask the m&a pipeline question in a slightly different way, which is this.
have there been any resets and expectations from some of the targets you've looked at in terms of valuation, just given some of the public market volatility we've seen? obviously, that takes a little bit of time, i think, to sort of filter into the private markets and other stuff that you might be looking at that's smaller, but any opportunities that may shake loose or that may be sort of coming faster than the pipeline now that we've got a bit more public market volatility here.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
i think we i think when you look at the deals we've been involved in the -- they've been -- they continue to be very highly competitive. so there is -- the markets are flush with cash, ready to deploy, which has made them competitive and as we've sort of alluded to, some of the multiples that we've seen are at levels that we're not willing to extend ourselves to. and so we continue to go out and do our own cultivation and research and identifying companies and looking for those right opportunities for us. and we feel like there are actionable deals at reasonable multiples out there.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. very helpful, guys. i'll jump back in queue. thank you.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
thaks, matt.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
thaks, matt.

[operator instructions] our next question today will come from chris mcginnis of sidoti & company. please go ahead.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking my questions. congrats, juris, thanks for the help that you have given me. i just had one question just around the chassis issues in q1 you expect.
and just given the backlog, is there any risk of losing out on any of the sales given the disruption you expect in q1?
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
and maybe...
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
we don't think it -- go ahead, jon. go ahead.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
i was going to say, we don't view it necessarily as lost sales. i think it's really, really timing. unfortunately, it is industrywide. i think what -- where we benefit is our ability, particularly, with the velocity platform to expand and build on multiple chassis and deliver walk-in vans on multiple chassis.
and so as we free that up, it does give us some flexibility as we get into q2 and later in the year. but it's really -- i would think of it as a delay from a backlog perspective versus loss.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
and the only thing i would add, chris, is we were watching very closely when we took our pricing up based on inflationary items in '21. and as jon mentioned, we lost only single digit in the millions of sales. so i think if they were going to back away, they would have done it then. the market, right, as we continue to talk about, the demand is still there.
there's growth, right, all the e-commerce and other growth going on in infrastructure. so they -- what they don't want to do is get out of line because then they go to the back of the line. so they're going to -- our view is they're going to stick in it and wait for the chassis to come. so it's -- to me, it's all about the timing.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
great. i appreciate the color. good luck in q1.
jon douyard -- chief financial officer
thanks, chris.
daryl adams -- president and chief executive officer
