[operator instructions] and we'll go to the line of toni kaplan with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you. i wanted to talk about the levers that you mentioned, the transitioning from a holding company to an operating company and from a content provider to content-driven technology company. i guess do you see this as a significant change in culture at the company? or do you think that just with the 500, $600 million investment and new direction, that you can get there? just trying to understand what it means for turnover and for hiring. just anything on sort of that aspect.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yeah. toni, it's steve. i'll start. look, i think we have a very strong existing culture.
it's been built up over decades, and it's built around integrity and trust. and if you speak with our customers, they'll reflect that. they trust what we say and what we do. and so, we want to continue that, and i think that's an important sort of foundation stone for our activities going forward and for the change program.
we have real strengths in content. our content is -- in many cases, if not most cases, where we're providing solutions for customers, our content is unique. but to that, we need to add more ai and machine-learning capabilities, more software capabilities, more cloud expertise and more saas expertise. we've started to do that, and we've made some really good progress with westlaw edge and checkpoint edge.
and we've made some really good progress in terms of the hires that have come onboard, including kirsty roth, david wong, sunil pandita and pat wilburn, all of whom have those kinds of expertise in the space. so from a culture standpoint, i think it's much more of an evolution than it is a revolution. and i think in terms of the formulation of our teams, you'll see us continue to build the skills within the associates who've been here for long periods of time but also supplement those skills where we need to.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. and just for follow-up, you talked about bringing capex down to 6 to 6.5% of revenue. i guess if you're becoming more of a technology-driven company, is that -- why is that the right level? i understand the main motivation is free cash flow, and i appreciate that. just wanted to understand if maybe the capex level needs to be higher than that just on a sustainable basis.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yeah. toni, mike here. we've had a lot of debate and discussion internally. one data point that i would share with you that we have worked on a lot with kirsty roth, david wong and others is currently about 33% of our capital is spent on keep the lights on, more of the legacy.
we think over time, which we'll discuss more at the investor day, we can decrease that to -- in the 15% range. what that actually means is that we can decrease our absolute level of spend, toni, but actually spend more on our product development. so ultimately, that's where our focus is, is deploying our capital to the growth initiatives. right now, we're spending an exorbitant amount on the ktlo portion of our business.
so that's where we see it. certainly, as opportunities arise going forward, whether it be organically or inorganically, we won't be shy if we think there's a customer need to meet there. but that's how we modulated that 6 to 6.5%, toni, is really that driver on keep the lights on and the legacy.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks so much.
operator
thank you. and we'll go to the line of drew mcreynolds with rbc. please go ahead.
drew mcreynolds -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yeah. thanks very much. good morning. just to broaden toni's question out a little bit, maybe for you, steve.
your 2023 outlook is well above, i think, forecast out there, certainly above what thomson has done historically. what gives you confidence that you can kind of pull this kind of lift up in the business? and the follow-up for mike. you've architected a lot of restructurings and carve outs at thomson over the years. can you just size this one up in terms of complexity and achievability?
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, drew. with regard to the confidence point, i'm glad you picked that up because we're -- i think as a team, we are confident. and that confidence is built through the sort of design and early stages of execution of the change program, and it comes from three places.
i think the first is the sort of resilience of our core franchises. 2020 was a tough year for our customers and therefore, a tough year for us. and yet, we posted pretty solid organic growth within the big 3. so we look at that resilience and say we're starting from a position of strength.
secondarily, we've spent a lot of time in the covid environment deeply connected with our customers. we really doubled down with a bit of a mantra when the pandemic hit of when in doubt, call a customer. and when in doubt, provide just more and more support and more and more help for customers. and what we've seen across the segments, across all of the professionals that we serve is a change in their behavior and an appetite to make increased and smart investments in information and technology.
so if we get it right, we're going to have a really powerful tailwind there, which gives us confidence. and then thirdly, we have put together a team of folks who are very experienced here at thomson reuters and have driven change before and added some highly talented folks from the outside. and both the team and that change program are purpose built to create an operating company and to create a content-driven technology company. so it's sort of a combination of where we started from, what we're seeing in the external markets and the team and program that we've constructed.
and all of those things together, i think, just give us a great deal of confidence. and that's not to say we'll get every aspect right. i mean, i think we've built in enough room to move to be able to experiment and make some mistakes along the way. but we do, as you said, start from a position of significant confidence.
mike?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
drew, i'll compare the '21 to '23 change program to what we did in 2018 and 2019. back in 2018 to 2019, we had three primary vectors or goals. one was to eliminate the stranded costs. pre-refinitiv or pre-blackstone, we had 280 million of corporate costs, and we're down to roughly 130 million in 2020.
so we accomplished that. our second goal back in 2018 was to separate from refinitiv. and thanks to a hell of a lot of work from stewart beaumont, john lyons, robin smith, and many, many others, tom kim, we are largely complete with the separation. so i think you put two checkmarks there.
the third element of the 2018 initiative was really to advance our efforts in regards to digital and then also our lead to cash, really consolidating multiple systems internally to improve the customer experience. we still have more work to do on that third one. what makes the current change program different for me, drew, is the really, really intense focus on improving the end-to-end customer experience, which i believe will improve our nps. currently, our net promoter score is significantly below the industry, the b2b industry average.
but our goal is not to get to the industry average, it's to far exceed that. and as we improve the nps and the customer experience, i'm quite optimistic we'll be able to accelerate our revenue. and to steve's point earlier and to toni's question, the pivot to the operating company, i think, will yield some efficiencies for us along the way. last point i would make, drew, is in regards to confidence level.
i think i and the full team, the thomson reuters team learned a hell of a lot in the last 12 months with covid, especially in regards to what's possible. that might sound very basic. but a lot of things that we accomplished in the last 12 months, i'm not confident we would have, unfortunately, without covid because it really eliminated some of the myth busters within our company and, i'm sure, in the economy overall. so my confidence and conviction is quite high, drew.
and i think on march 16, you'll hear from 10 additional colleagues who will go deeper into the story.
drew mcreynolds -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. we'll go to the line of vince valentini with td securities. please go ahead.
vince valentini -- td securities -- analyst
thanks very much. just looking at the dividend. if you take the new dividend over $1.62 in the midpoint of the 2021 free cash flow guidance, that's obviously a bit of an elevated payout ratio at 77%. but if we just assume that 7% is now the new normal and you increased it 7% in each of the subsequent two years, you'd be back to just under 50% by my math on your 2023 guidance.
so i just want to make sure you can level set us on that. is 7% some sort of one-off catch-up dividend increase? or should we take this as a signal of what you think the dividend growth potential is for the next couple of years as you go through this cycle?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yeah. several points there, vince. your math is correct. our payout ratio for '21 and '22 will be above our target of 50 to 60%.
we had discussions with our board regarding 2021, and we set our dividend increases in january of each year with board approval. so to your first point, your math is correct. as we go into 2023, based on our target, vince, we will be below that 50 to 60%. the 7% is not a fixed target as we go forward.
we'll assess that on an annual basis going forward as we did in 2021. but based on the current targets, vince, for 2023, we would certainly have some optionality there.
vince valentini -- td securities -- analyst
ok. and just to clarify on taxes. the money you're talking about, 90 million soon and then another 600 to 700 million in the u.k., is that a separate amount from the 700 million on the lse transaction?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yeah. vince, good question. let me break it down. it's two separate categories of payments.
first, in regards to the london stock exchange, the $700 million is due on the closing of the transaction. that's the portion that's not tax deferrable that was related to the tradeweb piece. so that's the first piece. the second piece relates to some disputes we have with the u.k.
hmrc. and the majority of that actually, vince, relates to our divestiture of the intellectual property and science business and also the f&r business. but it's 2 separate items. the first piece, vince, in regards to the lseg transaction would not be refunded.
we believe, on the second piece, we'll have to advance it just due to the u.k. tax regulation. but in our viewpoint, we will be refunded the majority of that because we think we have a very strong position. we have multiple external advisors, and they have the same strong view as us.
vince valentini -- td securities -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. we'll go to the line of gary bisbee with bofa securities. please go ahead.
gary bisbee -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning, and congratulations on announcing the program. i guess -- i'm sure there'll be more detail at the investor day, but i'd love some more detail on two areas. first, where does the 600 million of cost saves come from? can you bucket some of the key buckets, like, numbers? and then what are the key things to drive the revenue acceleration? i see focusing on the seven product categories.
you mentioned smb several times. but can you break down some of the key factors? thank you.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yeah. gary, there are multiple pieces there. i'll start and ask steve to supplement. you didn't ask the first part that i'm going to mention, gary, but it might be helpful for the overall audience.
the 500 to 600 million investment, we break that down into three tranches, gary. first is in regards to the omnichannel, digital, smb. that's the first third. the second third relates to what we call modernized technology and operations.
some of you will be familiar that at the end of 2020, we had completed the majority of our cloud migration with the exception of our data center in eagan, minnesota outside minneapolis. and then, we have a few small leased data centers around. so that will be a big objective for us as we work through with andy martens, paul fischer and the legal group, along with kirsty and david. and then, the third tranche is organization and location.
so a third, a third, a third in regards to the actual investments. in regards to your question on savings, multiple categories there as we work through it, gary. certainly, attrition will be a portion of that as we work through it. as we pivot to the operating company, we think there's a lot of opportunity within product, technology, editorial because we have a lot of legacy acquisitions that we still have not fully integrated, and we think we will be able to be more efficient with those parts of the business.
and then lastly, i would mention sourcing and procurement as a category and then real estate. if you go back six or seven years, we had over 500 office locations. we're down to 100 now. mary-alice vuicic, our chief people officer, has done a wonderful job in the last 12 months evolving our workplace of the future and really the workplace of today.
so a lot of key learnings there that will help us continue to optimize our footprint as we move forward. let me pause to see if steve wants to add anything to that before i go to the revenue piece, gary.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
well said, mike. i think, gary, we've been -- i think we've looked comprehensively across our activities and most importantly, focused on the customer experience. and the investments that we're making are in and around the omnichannel/digital, they're in and around the underlying operations and technology that support our customer experience and they're in and around both the people and real estate footprint that serves that. and that then flows through into the cost base.
we think if -- when we get this right, we're going to have a significantly lower cost to serve and to mike's earlier point, a higher net promoter score from our customers. so that's the sort of equation that we work against here. but mike, back to you on the revenue.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yeah. gary, i'll start on the revenue piece. i'm sure steve will want to supplement. the first word i'm going to use, gary, is focus.
and that might sound incredibly basic, but around july 1 of this year, -- or 2020, we had elizabeth beastrom -- elizabeth is our president of the global print business, but we asked her to double hat and lead our practical law business, which is a product used by our legal professional customers and also our corporate customers. and i think with the focus that elizabeth has put on this in the last eight months -- not just elizabeth, but elizabeth and the team, we have also now began to apply that to our indirect tax with sunil pandita, our new president of the corporates business. so focus i'll mention first. let me get a little bit more tactical, gary.
nps -- our retention is already 90%, but we're quite optimistic that we can continue to improve our retention as we move forward. as you know, each percentage point on retention is roughly 50 to 60 million for us. and then, pricing. i think as we improve our customer experience, we can maintain the pricing that we currently experience.
it's about 3% overall, which varies by segment for us. david wong with product innovation, i think we're just scratching the surface with our product innovation. charlie claxton recently joined david's team as head of design. and we'll continue to add more talent within our product area.
and then i think upsell and cross-sell. the cross-sell, you've been hearing us discuss that for a while now. i think as kirsty roth and others help us with our internal systems, which we're making progress on, that will make it easier for brian peccarelli's sales organizations, michael friedenberg within reuters to really cross-sell and support our customers. so those are some of the areas, not to mention smb.
as you know, gary, about a third of our business today comes from small firms, but we think we have the opportunity to drive further reach within smb. i'll pass to steve.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yeah. just one other comment on this, gary. we'll talk a lot more about this at investor day. and i hope at investor day, you get a sense for at least two things: one is this set of elevated growth expectations, pretty broadly diversified across these growth initiatives.
so we're not overly reliant on sort of one big bet or a hail mary or anything like that. and the second is there's lots of upside here in terms of attracting new customers and maybe most importantly, our ability to shift to new products. i think we've had a pretty modest cadence in terms of product -- organic product innovation. and i hope that you'll get a sense at investor day certainly from many of the team but specifically from david wong and shawn malhotra who's our head of engineering that we have very high expectations of our ability to innovate in and around the marketplaces that we operate today.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yeah. gary, if i could just add one additional point. i know you were focused rightly on the organic side, but we'll -- as i mentioned in my remarks, we have the ability and desire to deploy capital when the opportunity is right for our customers and for our shareholders there. as you know, we have about 700 million of the 2 billion reinvestment fund that we set aside a couple of years ago with the blackstone transaction.
so we'll continue to look here for opportunities to supplement the organic items that steve and i mentioned with inorganic opportunities.
gary bisbee -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you.
operator
we'll go to the line of kevin mcveigh with credit suisse. please go ahead.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great, thanks so much, and congratulations. steve or mike -- this might be better suited for mike, but i think one of the underappreciated parts of this initiative is how much better positioned you are internally from an operational perspective. and maybe just compare and contrast the transition away from refinitiv back in '18 because i feel a key part of it is just management's ability to execute just given a much more streamlined business. if there's anything you'd call out there just as you put this plan together because i think that's a more subtle point that really increases the probability of success as you engage these next couple of years.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yeah. kevin, i'll start. so mike has obviously been here for longer and seen -- can give you more -- a better historical perspective than i can. but here's sort of, in my mind, the key difference, right? and that is that we don't have f&r in the portfolio anymore, right? and that was, as you know, a very different business.
and it is a very complex business by nature of sort of the markets in which it operates and the customers that it serves. and so, we don't have that on the agenda. instead, we've got the big 3 segments, print and reuters. and we feel that is a manageable portfolio, and there are some real similarities across the customer needs and the customer experience we need to provide.
and to that, we've added, i think, an extraordinary amount of expertise to an already strong associate base here at thomson reuters, people like kirsty roth who've done this before at significantly larger scale in very similar, if not tighter, time frames under -- shifting sands from an external point of view. and so, those are the two things that i think differentiate it in my mind at least from where we might have been. but i'll turn it over to mike.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yeah. kevin, i'll just add one small item. in addition to f&r is now with lseg, the amount of time all the colleagues that i mentioned had to spend on the separation is more time that we can really focus on building our products now. we tried to kind of ring-fence that group as much as possible, but we can now deploy those funds and resources to building and accelerating new products and capabilities.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
super helpful. and then, just with retention at 90%, kind of where do we think we can get that to? and then if this is a third, i respect it if you can't answer. but that new product innovation, the 200 million, is that in the organic target? or would that be something in addition if you execute on that?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
let me break it down first. in regards to retention, kevin, i think we'll get a better feel with the investor day. certainly, we feel like we can get 1 percentage point as we move forward. we have a lot of customer pain points that we are addressing.
we're very straightforward with our customers in that regard. and then, as we continue to add more and more capabilities, you're very familiar with all the work that andy martens and mike dahn have done on westlaw edge just illustratively, and charlotte rushton in tax and accounting professionals is now working on the other initiatives that she'll discuss. so i wouldn't be surprised, kevin, if we can get another 1% lift. but we'll closely monitor that and keep you up to date as we move forward.
and then, kevin, in regards to the revenue lift from the change program, that is reflected in the targets that we've provided today.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you so much. great job.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
thank you, kevin.
operator
thank you. we'll go to the line of aravinda with canaccord. please go ahead.
aravinda galappatthige -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question. my first question is on -- and i have a follow-up after that. my first question is on the software and services component.
i think mike, in the past, you've been kind enough to kind of give us a breakdown as to what that component was in some of the key divisions, including legal, and also on a consolidated basis. as you look to sort of your 2022 and '23 targets, is there a number or a percentage you have in mind as to where that would transition to? and as my follow-up, with respect to the 600 to $700 million in tax on the disputed item, i know you talked about 90 million in q1. is there any sort of color as to how that would -- how the remainder would sort of phase out? and i apologize if i missed the commentary on that. thank you.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yeah. aravinda, let me take the second question first. the 90 million we estimate would be paid in q1 of this year. and then, the 600 to 700 million estimates that i referenced, if we're still contending that, if paid, it would be q3 of 2021.
while we're on the topic of tax, the tax associated with the lseg transaction, aravinda, those would be made quarterly: april 15, june 15, 9/15, 12/15 there, just from a timing perspective. all of these items are factored into our liquidity forecast for the full year. let me just provide some grounding on the software and content, and i'll ask steve to share his thoughts, respectively. today, if you look at the legal business, about 30% estimated is software.
within corporates, it's about 6%. and in tax, about 75% so for total tr, looking at about 40% software. so i'll ask steve to share his thoughts, respectively.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yeah. look, i think part of this transition, aravinda, to a content-driven technology company is to explicitly increase that software portion. i think if you look at -- we're at sort of 35 to 40% of software today. there's quite a bit of upside there.
but one of the things we'll do, i think, is that we will blur that, right? and i think our customers are demanding we do that. they basically say to me when i speak with them, look, we love your content, but we need it delivered in different, more innovative, more customer-friendly ways and more usable ways. and so, i think you'll see more and more of this blend of unique content, world-class ai and machine learning and best-of-breed software that will really blend the solution. and as long as we're solving the customer problem better than anyone else, i'm confident that that will translate into these healthy growth rates.
aravinda galappatthige -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
and we'll go to the line of george tong with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. thanks. good morning. you mentioned that your 500 to 600 million in investment breaks out into three tranches: the omnichannel, smb; modernization of tech and operations; and the broader organization.
can you talk a little bit more about these initiatives within the tranches and how this compares with where your seven strategic investment priorities fall?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
sure. i'll start and then ask steve to supplement. first category, i'm going to call it more of the go to market, which includes smaller customers, more digital self-serve in smb and the omnichannel. at the heart of that, george, is addressing our internal systems.
we, as you know, have had many acquisitions over the years. so we're looking to consolidate the many disparate systems that we have today into as few as possible. what that does is improves our operational efficiency, but more importantly, it improves the sales go-to-market team's efficiency. because they're dealing with fewer systems day to day, they get the full view across total tr in regards to the cross-sell that we mentioned earlier.
also within this is smb. we're building the capabilities. we mentioned kirsty earlier and david. karen stroup, our chief digital officer, is working on this.
we have about 500,000 customers today. that number has been fairly constant over the last few years. we think these smb capabilities will allow us to attract and retain additional new customers as we move forward. the second tranche in regards to modernizing our technology and operations, kirsty, shawn malhotra and david wong will discuss more at our investor day.
i mentioned earlier the cloud migration. but we have some more older underlying editorial-type technology that we're in the process of investing in, in the next two years that will accelerate our time to market. and then lastly, on organization and location, in different parts of our organization now, we might have like, for example, call centers or in finance, different areas that are kind of repeated multiple times. as we pivot to the operating company, we'll be able to have leverage there.
and i mentioned the locations a few minutes ago. steve?
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think very explicitly, if you look at those three buckets, right, so digital and omnichannel customer experience, modernizing ops and tech and the organization and location footprint, they feed into the seven. so products like practical law, highq, westlaw, pondera and onvio, the cloud audit suite and indirect tax, all of these we believe will be significantly enhanced by those three investments. so there's a very explicit link between the investment we're making and the upgrade and innovation around those products.
and that's what we'll dive into on the 16th of march.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
very helpful. and then, just as a follow-up, you mentioned that organic revenue growth should reach 6 to 7% in the big 3 by 2023. can you break out what that growth might look like within legal, tax and accounting and corporates, just assumptions in there that's included in that target?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
george, we'll go deeper on that with the march 16 investor day. paul fischer will cover legal; charlotte rushton, tax; and brian and aaron will cover the corporates. but we'll share more on that then, george.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
and we'll go to the line of manav patnaik with barclays. please go ahead.
manav patnaik -- barclays -- analyst
thank you. good morning. just to follow up slightly there. on a high level, that 6 to 7% growth rate, like how much of that is market growth that you're assuming? because you compared the transition or the evolution to f&r before, and one of the problems, i think, was the market at f&r.
and our impression has always been legal is a tough market as well. so just curious how you guys have factored what the market growth looks like, or is this all innovation-driven?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
sure, manav. once again, we're going to hear more about this from the segment presidents on march 16. we've certainly updated our total addressable market data, and as we kind of triangulate, what we see from a market growth perspective to our internal estimates is fairly consistent. once again, we'll share both the tam estimates by subsegment along with our estimates of the big 3 that george just asked about on march 16.
but from our viewpoint, there's pretty good symmetry in regards to the tam estimates that we see and then our -- also the internal. there are some deviations if you look at a westlaw product that has really, really strong presence in the market. and then, some of our earlier projects that -- products that are in the earlier stages may not be a huge growth contributor today, but we see a lot of upside going forward. but we think we have good symmetry between our internal estimates, manav, and then also the tam estimates.
manav patnaik -- barclays -- analyst
ok. fair enough. i'll wait for that in the investor day. and then the other question i had was -- this obviously seems like a pretty big organic lift, but i think along the way, you mentioned a few times that you still want to do deals.
and i was just curious what the capacity there is. i'm guessing these are all small deals. or is there capacity to integrate a large deal amid all this change going on?
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yeah. i'll talk about it from sort of an organizational capacity. and then, michael, remind us of the financial capacity. we're very focused on meeting and exceeding our customer needs and the change program.
that is our laser-focus for 2021 and 2022. so in terms of our capacity for inorganic activity, we're going to be open to acquisitions that are reinforcing of the change program and reinforcing our ability to meet and exceed customer needs today within the big 3. and so, ideally, we would do a number of tuck-in acquisitions this year and next that meet that criteria, but we're going to be pretty hard-edged about making sure that our focus stays on the change program and that the acquisitions indeed meet that criteria.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
manav, i was going to a similar reference. i'll say execute the change program like hell. i mean, that's our first, second, third priority. and then, we have the capacity to make an acquisition -- small or midsized acquisitions if it is the right time and also meets our customer needs is the way i view it.
but the 700 million that i referenced earlier that remains from the 2 billion original investment fund, obviously, our capacity far exceeds the 700 million, but we don't have an urgency to put it to work. we will put it to work at the right time for our customers and shareholders.
frank golden -- head of investor relations
i think we have time for one more question, operator.
operator
thank you. our final question will come from doug arthur with huber research. please go ahead.
doug arthur -- huber research -- analyst
yeah. thank you. steve, in terms of the addressable market that this transformation is targeting, is this kind of a dual track? do you think your large -- for instance, legal companies are going to -- the covid issue has dramatically changed the way they will work going forward, so this is meant to address that. but it seems, on the same vein, that this is all about expanding the market into smbs and really growing that customer base.
i'm just trying to get a sense of priority.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think certainly, this year and into next, the priority is to meet and exceed the needs of our existing customers. and so, you refer to the large law firms. i've spent a lot of time over the last 12 months with the managing partners, the chairs of the large law firms.
and as i've mentioned before, in this environment, every single one of them in their own words, has said a version of, we need to spend less on real estate, more on information technology. and our focus is on making sure that we're part of that, we're part of that solution set. and so, we do think there's upside. despite our very high share with the large law firms, we think there's real upside as they change the ways of working and move their budgets around appropriately to serve that.
the smb opportunity for us is, we think, a big one, but it's a slightly longer-term one. we're going to -- we're building those capabilities today. that process is going well. we'll get it online as soon as we can.
but the focus is very much on that first category with a clear eye toward the second.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the thomson reuters' fourth-quarter and full year earnings conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to our host, frank golden, head of investor relations. please go ahead.
frank golden -- head of investor relations
good morning and thank you for joining us today for our fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 earnings call. this morning, i'm joined by our ceo, steve hasker; and our cfo, mike eastwood, each of whom will report our results and will take your questions following our presentation. they will also discuss the change program we announced this morning and our outlook for 2021 through 2023. [operator instructions] throughout today's presentation, when we compare performance period on period, we discuss revenue growth rates before currency, as well as on an organic basis as we believe this provides the best basis to measure the underlying performance of the business.
today's presentation does contain forward-looking statements. actual results may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties related to the covid-19 pandemic and other risks discussed in reports and filings that we provide from time to time to regulatory agencies. you may access these documents on our website or by contacting our investor relations department. now, i'll pass it over to steve hasker.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
thank you, frank, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. i'll begin by stating that we're very pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and the full year. our results met or exceeded our guidance targets for revenue growth, adjusted ebitda margin and free cash flow. despite the enormous challenges in 2020 related to the pandemic, our performance reaffirm the resilience of our markets and businesses.
we adapted and supported our customers in their evolving ways of working, and i'm very proud and appreciative of how our people performed during this period. now, to our results. for the fourth quarter, revenues were up 2% and adjusted ebitda increased 33% to $525 million, reflecting a margin of 32.5%. for the full-year, adjusted ebitda margin was 33% and includes having spent about $70 million in the fourth quarter on initiatives to better position us for 2021 and beyond.
this strong performance resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 compared to $0.37 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. turning to the segments. the big 3 businesses achieved organic revenue growth of 5% for the quarter and 4% for the full year, a very good performance particularly given the global economic environment. legal had another good quarter and built on the third quarter's results, with revenues up 5% before currency and organic revenues up 4%.
legal also recorded double-digit recurring sales in the quarter and full year. legal's recurring revenues, which are 93% of its total revenues, increased 5% organically, up from 4% in q3. westlaw edge continues to drive strong sales growth and ended the quarter at a 52% acv penetration. we expect to achieve a penetration rate of between 60% and 65% by year-end 2021.
edge has now been adopted by all u.s. federal government courts and 42 u.s. state court systems. practical law ended the year nearing $400 million in revenue and grew nearly 10%.
our government business, which is managed within our legal segment, continues to see good momentum and grew 10% organically in the fourth quarter and nearly 10% for the full year. we forecast a strong performance again for 2021. turning to the corporates business. organic revenues grew 3% for the fourth quarter, lower than expected due to an 11% decline in transaction revenues driven by lower software implementation services.
encouragingly, organic recurring revenues, which are 87% of corporates' total revenues, grew 6%. for 2021, we expect stronger revenue growth as recurring revenue is expected to remain healthy and transaction revenues are expected to strengthen as implementations return. for the full year, corporates total revenues grew 5.5% before currency and organic revenues grew 4.5%. tax and accounting's q4 organic revenues ended strongly, posting growth of 8%.
in q4, we accelerated the release of some of our ultratax state tax software from january to december to more closely align with the traditional december release of our u.s. federal software. reuters news organic revenues were down 3% in q4, a better than expected performance, and global print organic revenues declined 10%, in line with our guidance. we expect both reuters and print to improve their revenue performance in 2021.
for the full year, reported and organic revenues were both up 1% and revenues at constant currency were up 2%. adjusted ebitda increased 32% to nearly $2 billion, reflecting a margin of 33% for the year. the combination of organic revenue growth for the big 3 of 4%, coupled with the effective cost savings measures instituted in the first quarter and not having incurred onetime costs as occurred in 2019, contributed to strong ebitda margin improvement. this strong performance resulted in full-year adjusted earnings per share of $1.85 versus $1.29 per share in 2019, and we are particularly pleased to report that free cash flow per share was $2.67, exceeding the target of $2.40 per share provided at our december 2018 investor day.
let me finish up on the financials by pointing out that we met or exceeded each of the financial guidance metrics we provided for 2020, which reflects the resilience of the business and visibility we have into our businesses and markets. with that, let me now turn to the change program we announced this morning. as i said last quarter, there's no doubt we have strong market positions. our customers love our content, and we're in a solid operating position as evidenced by our 2020 results, but it's imperative that we elevate our value proposition, enhance the customer experience we provide and maximize our performance let me explain.
first, some context. it's important to emphasize that we're implementing our change program from a position of strength. the first point i'd make is that we operate in robust and growing legal, tax and risk, fraud and compliance markets. our businesses are rock solid, and we are no.
1 or no. 2 in our core legal, tax and accounting, corporates and risk, fraud and compliance franchises, supported by a trusted brand and a highly engaged group of associates. point no. 2, prevailing tailwinds in our markets play to our strengths and will contribute to our growth.
those tailwinds are blowing in our favor, and they play to our strengths and will help drive our growth. covid has changed how, when and where people work, which is an opportunity for us. additionally, our markets are healthy and growing. we operate in stable competitive environments, and our markets are integral to the proper functioning of professional services ecosystems globally.
more on this on the next slide. point no. 3, we have two powerful levers to drive both growth and efficiencies. lever no.
1 is transitioning to an operating company to take full advantage of our scale in the customer experience we provide, the technologies we operate and the products we build. and lever no. 2 is building a content-driven technology company, extending our unique content with ai and software to create significantly expanded use cases and increase value for our customers. these two levers will expand our customer relationships and will enable us to provide a far better customer experience at a lower cost to serve.
they will also enable us to expand our market size. point no. 4, this is an organic growth plan, and we have a seasoned team in place. and we believe we can achieve our targets with the momentum we have in our current markets and businesses; bolt-on acquisitions would be additive.
and we've developed a well-defined plan and we've begun executing. we've been hiring high-caliber, highly qualified, experienced talent to help lead this transition and who successfully undertook similar programs in their prior organizations. these leaders complement the very experienced thomson reuters teams that successfully executed large-scale projects in the past, including the separation from refinitiv. and point no.
5, our lseg position provides substantial optionality as we will have significant capital to deploy beginning in 2023. i mentioned we are also benefiting from prevailing tailwinds which favor business information services, markets and providers. let me give you three examples. first, over the course of the past 12 months, we've all learned to work in ways we could never imagine prior to the pandemic.
fundamental shifts are taking place, and these changes are requiring our customers to rethink their strategies, their ways of working, where they allocate employees and how they allocate budgets. the playbook is being written in real time. we do know that trusted, always-on, actionable content combined with unique data, ai and software is a must-have and companies that provide it will win. second, these accelerated changes are enabling us to better serve customers and are opening new markets for companies like ours.
it's allowing us to deliver our quality content to anyone, anywhere. digital technologies and software are democratizing ways of working. an attorney or accountant in missoula, montana has the same access to high-quality legal and tax solutions as his or her counterpart in chicago. our self-serve omnichannel offerings will enable us to reach smaller customer groups and smb firms, which we believe will contribute to higher growth.
and third, we have an advantaged position with exposure to high-growth verticals within our core markets. demand for solutions in areas such as direct and indirect tax, audit, legal how-to and broader workflow software tools for risk, fraud and compliance solutions are all growing in markets, and we are well positioned to serve these customers. these tailwinds are accelerating the pace for change and driving our customers to extract more value from our information, benefiting them commercially and competitively, which will enhance our relationships, competitive position and growth. now to the change program.
lever no. 1 of the change program is the transition to an operating company. on the left side of this slide was our holding company structure, and on the right is the operating company structure to which we are transitioning. our business segments will focus on go to market and will be supported by pan-pr functions that will manage customer service and support, technology and product development.
this will significantly enhance our customer experience and will improve efficiencies by building once and deploying many times. our overall cost to serve will decrease, which will free up investment to pursue new growth opportunities. our objectives are to make it easier for our customers to do business with us, to significantly modernize and simplify our product portfolio and product development groups and to reduce complexity in our operations and technology organization. and from a talent standpoint, we will continue to simplify our organization, break down silos and shift to a more innovative culture.
lever no. 2 of the change program is transitioning from a content provider to a content-driven technology company. our content is a significant competitive advantage. it differentiates us and builds our brand.
our new structure positions us to achieve greater success by leveraging that valuable content, enriching it with world-class ai and best-of-breed software and delivering it in the cloud. we have started this journey with westlaw edge and checkpoint edge, and we're expanding the playbook to our other solutions. this will provide a better, more modern customer experience that will enable us to reach a wider number of clients, particularly in the smb markets where we can drive higher revenue growth. let me now discuss specifics regarding how we will better serve our customers and access new customer groups.
we're confident this program will drive deep long-lasting transformation. it's designed to simultaneously drive revenue growth and improve efficiencies as we transition to a simpler, more integrated and fast company. the work streams for the four focus areas on this slide are under way and let me describe the changes for each area. firstly, reimagining the customer experience.
we're creating fast, frictionless, connected, transparent and personalized customer experiences. this includes upgrading and scaling digital marketing and driving enhanced sales and service from data and analytics. the end result in 2023 will be significant portions of the customer experience enhanced through digitization and automation. secondly, we're optimizing our products and portfolio.
we're shifting our focus to a smaller number of higher-growth product categories where synergies exist and where we can build and maintain our leadership positions. this will be supported by a conservative push to world-class product proposition and strategy, development, pricing, delivery and management. the end result in 2023 will be a more focused and integrated set of products that drive valuable outcomes for customers. thirdly, we're simplifying operations and leveraging technology.
we're scaling up machine learning, reengineering underlying processes and creating shared technology platforms that support agile product development and significantly enhance customer experience. the end results in 2023, we have a modernized, simplified technology architecture and operations footprint. and finally, we're building and strengthening an inclusive culture of world-class talent. we're implementing new talent management processes, supported by external hires and increased investment in training and development.
the end result in 2023 will be a self-replenishing pipeline of world-class internal talent. in parallel with the change program and executing against these focus areas, we're also investing in seven strategic growth priorities within the big 3 segments. these investments are expected to accelerate organic growth and contribute to achieving our growth target of 5 to 6% in 2023. we've already begun shifting our focus and investment to these seven priorities, and we're expected to grow upper single digit over the next several years.
we also continue to see opportunities for tuck-in m&a to accelerate our position across these three product -- these product categories, and we have an active pipeline of potential acquisitions across the big 3 business segments, which we regularly review and assess. we continue to believe that there are attractive opportunities in which to invest inorganically in our current markets. we plan to provide a deep dive on each of these product categories at our investor day on march 16. now, to the financial targets.
the change program is expected to take 24 months to largely complete, and we've begun executing with urgency. it will require an investment of between 500 and $600 million in 2021 and 2022. this investment is forecast to deliver additional annual revenues of 100 million in 2023, annual operating expense savings of 600 million, 200 million of which will be reinvested in growth initiatives for a net savings of 400 million, and a reduction in capital spending as a percent of revenue between 6% and 6.5%. i'll also note that targets embedded in the change program have been fully incorporated into our annual incentive plans.
i will now discuss our three-year outlook resulting from the change program. in 2023, we forecast total company organic revenue growth between 5 and 6%. and for the big 3, between 6 and 7%. adjusted ebitda margin in 2023 is expected to range between 38 and 40%.
and with adjusted ebitda margin in that range and lower capital expenditures, we forecast free cash flow per share to range between $3.60 and $4 in 2023, substantially higher than 2020's $2.67 per share. given the resilience of our businesses, the health of our markets and the team we've assembled, i'm confident we'll achieve our goals. the net result of the change program will be faster revenue growth, significantly higher margins, higher free cash flow and record free cash flow per share. i'll conclude by saying we're excited and energized with the rollout of our change program.
it's truly a transformative program for the company. and beyond the operational and structural changes we will make, which are essential, the change program will lead to thomson reuters being acknowledged as a leading content-driven technology company and recognized as a leader in the markets in which we operate, powering professionals in the legal, tax, risk, fraud and compliance and news markets. we also want to be acknowledged by our customers as an innovator and builder of products that delight them. this will afford us the opportunity to expand our customer relationships from delivering accurate content to powering customers' businesses.
and by 2023, we expect to have essentially redesigned our customer experience to match our customers' expectations by delivering a seamless experience and enabling access to new customer groups, including smbs. and finally, our ownership interest in lseg provides substantial optionality to further strengthen our position. we forecast we could have financial capacity of as much as 15 billion by 2025, which will allow us to assess options to further drive growth and shareholder value. that said, we understand that we must successfully execute our change program and earn the right to deploy that capital if opportunities were to present themselves.
let me now turn it over to mike.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
thank you, steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. as a reminder, i will talk to revenue growth before currency and on an organic basis. let me start by discussing the revenue performance of our big 3 segments. organic revenues and revenues at constant currency were both up about 5% for the quarter.
legal professionals' revenues increased 5% and organic revenues were up 4%. recurring organic revenue growth of 5% was partially offset by a 6% decline in transaction revenues, primarily related to our elite business. westlaw edge continues to drive over 100 basis points to legal's organic growth while continuing to maintain a healthy premium. our government business, which is reported within legal, had another strong quarter with total revenue growth of 14% and organic growth of 10%.
in our corporates segment, total revenues increased 4% and organic revenues were up 3%. recurring organic revenues were up a healthy 6%, but transaction revenues declined 11% primarily due to lower implementation revenues. and finally, tax and accounting's total revenues grew 6% with organic revenues up 8%. the difference between total growth and organic growth was mainly related to the sale of our government tax business in november 2019.
also, we accelerated the release of some of our ultratax state software from january to december to align with the traditional december release of our u.s. federal software. excluding this timing benefit, organic revenues were still up a healthy 5.5%. moving to reuters news.
revenues declined 1% with organic revenues down 3% mainly due to lower news agency revenues and the cancellation of in-person conferences at reuters events due to covid-19. this performance was slightly better than we had anticipated due to the conversion of several in-person conferences to virtual events. and global print revenues declined 10% in the quarter with organic revenues also down 10% as expected. we expect an improvement in print's 2021 full-year performance but we still forecast revenues to decline between 4 and 7%.
on a consolidated basis, fourth-quarter revenues each increased 2%. before turning to profitability, let's look closer at recurring and transaction revenue results for the fourth quarter. starting on the left side. total company organic revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was up 2% compared to 4% growth in the fourth quarter of 2019.
but if you look at the q4 2020 performance for the big 3, you will see organic revenue increased 5%, a strong performance and only slightly below the 6% performance in q4 2019. and as you can see at the top right of this slide, the recurring revenue growth continues to be very encouraging. total company recurring organic revenue grew 5% in q4, only 30 basis points below q4 2019. and the big 3 recurring organic revenues grew 6%, in line with last year's fourth quarter.
turning to the graph in the bottom right of the slide. transaction revenues were down over 900 basis points year over year, impacted by covid-19, which affected our implementation services and the reuters events businesses. so despite the covid-19-related disruptions, we continue to remain encouraged by the momentum we carried into 2021, especially for recurring revenues, giving us confidence in the trajectory of the business. turning to our profitability performance in the fourth quarter.
adjusted ebitda for the big 3 segments was $495 million, up 11% from the prior-year period, and the related margin was up 230 basis points. this strong performance for the big 3 reflected four key items. first, strong revenue growth across all three segments. second, legal professionals adjusted ebitda margin in the fourth quarter grew 300 basis points to 37.5% compared to the prior-year period driven by higher revenue growth.
third, corporates adjusted ebitda margin was up 110 basis points to 31.1% due to higher revenues. and fourth, tax and accounting's adjusted ebitda margin increased 240 basis points to 51.1% due to solid revenue growth, which included the accelerated release of some of our ultratax state software mentioned earlier. moving to reuters news. adjusted ebitda was 6 million, 4 million less than the prior-year period primarily due to several nonrecurring costs in the quarter.
global print's adjusted ebitda margin for the quarter declined about 480 basis points due to the decline in revenue. so total company adjusted ebitda was 525 million, a 33% increase versus q4 2019. this next slide provides more color on the various factors impacting our full-year 2020 adjusted ebitda margin. as you can see, our reported 2020 full-year adjusted ebitda margin was 33%.
there were several factors in 2020 that drove the significant increase over the prior-year period. first, m&a activity had a 40-basis-point positive impact on margin. second, lower revenues related to covid-19 had a 220-basis point negative impact on margin. however, the savings from the 100 million cost savings initiative we announced in the first quarter more than offset the dilution from covid-19 impact.
and we exceeded our 100 million cost savings target and reinvested a portion of the savings in the fourth quarter. the net cost savings improved the margin by 180 basis points. on an underlying basis, excluding stranded and onetime costs in the prior year, the adjusted ebitda margin expanded 150 basis points, which was primarily related to the cost savings measures as a response to covid-19. we continue to expect these savings will be permanent.
overall, we believe the investments made in the fourth quarter and the visibility into the levers at our disposal provide us with a solid position as we enter 2021 and began to execute on the change program. now, let me turn to our earnings per share and free cash flow performance. i will also update you on our capital structure. starting with earnings per share, adjusted eps increased by $0.17 to $0.54 per share in the fourth quarter.
the increase was mainly driven by higher adjusted ebitda, partially offset by higher income taxes. currency had a $0.01 positive impact on adjusted eps in the quarter. let me now turn to our free cash flow performance for the year. we finished the year on a very strong footing and significantly exceeded our forecast, thanks to strong collections in q4.
this strong performance also reflects the resiliency of our customers and their ability to successfully manage their businesses and practices despite covid-19 impacts. reported free cash flow was 1.3 billion or $2.67 per share and was better than the $2.40 per share we had forecast at our december 2018 investor day, a great achievement. the 1.3 billion in 2020 compares to 159 million in the prior-year period, an improvement of nearly 1.2 billion. consistent with previous quarters, this slide removes the distorting factors impacting free cash flow performance.
working from the bottom of the page upwards, the refinitiv-related component of our free cash flow was better by 147 million from the prior-year period. 2019 included residual payments for employee cost and tax expenditures related to the operations of our former f&r business. and in 2020, we made $95 million of payments for separation costs incurred in 2019 related to our transformation program. and in the prior-year period, we made a pension contribution and other payments totaling 746 million, primarily related to the refinitiv transaction.
so if you adjust for these items, comparable free cash flow from continuing operations was 1.3 billion, approximately 230 million better than the prior-year period, primarily due to higher ebitda and lower income taxes. a quick update on our capital structure and liquidity. as you can see, our capital structure and liquidity position remained strong as we exited 2020. we generated 1.3 billion of free cash flow last year.
we had 1.8 billion of cash on hand at december 31. we have an undrawn 1.8 billion revolving credit facility, and we also have a 1.8 billion commercial paper program. from a liquidity and capital structure standpoint, we enter 2021 in a very strong position, and we would like to put that capital to work. we have a pipeline of potential acquisitions within our core markets.
but as we all know, a transaction requires a willing buyer and seller, and we will see where the discussions lead. we do have the ability and desire to move quickly if an opportunity presents itself this year. let me also note we have completed the repurchase of 200 million common shares under the normal course issuer bid which began in january. we do not currently intend to repurchase additional shares in 2021 as we have set a target to maintain approximately 500 million common shares outstanding.
and lastly, we recently received notice we will have to pay the u.k. tax authorities 90 million in march related to an ongoing tax dispute. we expect to receive additional notices in 2021 to pay as much as an additional 600 million to 700 million. while we believe we will prevail on these issues and be refunded substantially all of the payments, we are required to pay the disputed amounts upfront while contesting them.
the largest portion of these issues relate to our f&r business, which was divested in 2018. any payment made by us would not reflect our view on the merits of the case because we believe our position is supported by the weight of law. we expect our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund any required payments. as a final note, the majority of these potential payments will be recorded in discontinued operations and will not impact our free cash flow.
and finally, i am pleased to report today we announced a $0.10 or 7% annualized dividend increase to $1.62 per share, the largest increase since 2008. this marks the 28th consecutive year of annual dividend increases for the company. the increase will be effective with our q1 dividend payable next month. these annual dividend increases speak to the solidity of our business and consistent and growing free cash flow generation even during unprecedented times like 2020.
now, an update on our investment in refinitiv. the agreement to sell refinitiv to the london stock exchange group closed on january 29, and we are confident refinitiv has found a good home with lseg. we look forward to a mutually beneficial relationship as a shareholder and a board member. the pre-tax value of our 82.5 million shares is currently 11.2 billion or $23 per share in tr stock price, up from 6.7 billion or $13 per tr share at the time we announced the transaction in july 2019.
we plan to sell shares equivalent to 1 billion, and we'll use the net proceeds of 750 million to pay 700 million in taxes related to the transaction in 2021. our future equity interest in lseg will represent a store of value which can be monetized over time and will provide us a significant level of financial flexibility. we expect to receive annual dividends from lseg of about 75 million per year based on lseg's current annual dividend payout. lastly, regarding the accounting treatment for our ownership interest, we will account for our indirect interest in lseg at fair value each reporting period based on the price of lseg stock.
we will remove the impact from non-ifrs measures. because we own the investment indirectly through a joint entity with blackstone, the impact will be reported through the single line item share of post-tax income and equity method investments. we will include dividends from the investment as part of our free cash flow. now, let me turn to our outlook for 2021 through 2023.
as we look to 2021, i will first speak to our total company organic revenue growth forecast. we expect organic revenue growth for 2021 to range between 3% and 4%, returning to pre-covid-19 organic growth rates. we believe we can build upon 2021's growth with organic growth of 4 to 5% in 2022 and 5% to 6% in 2023. we forecast the big 3 organic revenues to grow between 4.5% and 5.5% in 2021.
let me provide some additional color on how we expect each segment to drive the overall acceleration. we will share more at our upcoming investor day on march 16. starting with legal, we finished the year with strong sales momentum which should lead to an acceleration in organic revenue growth in 2021. our confidence stems from several items.
first, the continued success of westlaw edge as we ended 2020 with 52% acv penetration and expect this to increase to between 60% to 65% in 2021 while continuing to command an attractive premium. second, our government business is in a strong position in a rapidly growing market, evidenced by its nearly double-digit organic growth in 2020. we expect a similar performance in 2021. and third, products and workflow tools such as highq and practical law continue to see increased demand given their productivity, collaboration and efficiency benefits with legal professionals.
in summary, we are confident we will see continuing improvement in legal's organic revenue growth rate in 2021. the corporates segment is expected to build on its 2020 growth rate of 5% as transaction revenues improve over 2020. and finally, we forecast tax and accounting will again achieve solid organic revenue growth, fueled by continued growth in our ultratax, audit and latin american businesses. finally, we expect reuters news to grow low single digit driven by improvement in our reuters professional business, which provides news, analysis and events for decision-makers.
and we expect global print revenues to decline between 4% and 7%. we have not traditionally provided quarterly guidance but did so last year due to covid. we are also providing guidance for the first quarter since the impact of covid is still with us. we want to provide greater clarity regarding expectations.
we believe our first quarter revenue growth will be the low point for the year. starting with the total tr chart on the top left. we estimate first-quarter total revenues and organic revenues will grow between 1.5% and 2.5%, negatively impacted by global print. the big 3 total revenues are forecast to grow 4% to 5%, and organic revenues are forecast to grow 3.5% to 4.5% in the first quarter.
and we anticipate the first quarter will be the low watermark for legal professionals organic growth for the year at between 3% and 4%. moving to reuters news. we forecast first-quarter total revenues and organic revenues to be between negative 1% and 1%. the events team is currently holding all events virtual.
we continue to assess when we can resume in-person events based on the local health expert advice and feedback from our customers. finally, global print first-quarter revenues are expected to decline between 13% and 15%. this is partially due to an expected continuing delay in shipping some print materials. we continue to believe these print materials are viewed as critical content by law firms and government agencies.
overall, the first quarter does not reflect what we expect for the full year, evidenced by our total and organic revenue growth guidance of 3% to 4% for 2021. turning to our adjusted ebitda margin and free cash flow. our guidance in 2021 reflects the dilutive impact of the change program investments. adjusted ebitda margin is forecast to range between 30% and 31%.
excluding the change program investment, the adjusted ebitda margin would have been between 33% and 34%. free cash flow is forecast to be between 1 billion and 1.1 billion. if we were to exclude the change program spending in 2021, underlying free cash flow would range between 1.2 and 1.3 billion. in 2022, we forecast we will begin to see the benefits of the change program with higher revenue growth and cost savings helping to lift adjusted ebitda margin to between 34% to 35% and free cash flow to between 1.2 billion and 1.3 billion.
and in 2023, following the completion of the change program, we forecast the adjusted ebitda margin will reach a record high of between 38% to 40%, and free cash flow is forecast to range between 1.8 billion to 2 billion. taking a closer look at our free cash flow growth. we forecast free cash flow per share in 2023 to range between $3.60 to $4, significantly higher than 2020's $2.67 per share. and we have several levers to pull to enable us to achieve that target as you can see on this slide.
bottom line, the changes we are implementing are intended to enable us to achieve record free cash flow per share in 2023. a little more on capital efficiency and effectiveness. today, our capital to revenue ratio is 8.4%, down from 10% two years ago. there are three drivers we are focused on to drive further capital efficiency.
first, we are scaling up machine learning, reengineering underlying processes and creating shared technology platforms to create a modernized technology approach across the organization. second, we are simplifying the product portfolio and building world class cross product capabilities. and lastly, we are shifting our focus to a fewer number of higher-growth product categories. as a result, we anticipate capex as a percentage of revenue to be between 6% and 6.5% by 2023.
let me provide some guidance on the change program cost phasing. we anticipate approximately 300 million to 350 million of total opex and capex change program spend in 2021. you can see on the slide the anticipated split of about 60% opex and 40% capex, with about 115 million to 140 million total spend in the first half and 185 million to 210 million in the second half. we will continue to provide quarterly updates on our change program spend as we move throughout the year.
one housekeeping item to mention related to the expected variance between free cash flow per share and adjusted earnings as we look ahead. first, we expect our capital expenditures will be less than our depreciation and amortization by about 75 million to 125 million in 2021. there will be a quicker impact to free cash flow due to the timing of the depreciation runoff. and second, there should be about 50 million to 75 million of miscellaneous items that impact the p&l but not free cash flow.
we expect annual pension contributions to be lower than annual pension expense. in addition, there are expenses related to our employee stock purchase program and stock-based compensation that have no impact on free cash flow. let me now turn to our outlook. given the size and scope of the change program, we think it is important to provide as much transparency as possible to enable you to track our progress.
this is our detailed guidance for 2021, 2022 and 2023. it reflects our view we can achieve faster revenue growth, higher profitability, lower capital intensity and significantly higher free cash flow as we benefit from transitioning to an operating company. we are very excited and energized with the rollout of our change program. as always, success will require effective execution, but we are clear-eyed as to the work streams and deliverables required to meet our objectives.
we are confident we can do so. as we have said, our goal is to transform thomson reuters into a leading content-driven technology company. when we are successful, thomson reuters will be built to consistently and sustainably drive strong operating and financial performance that builds value for shareholders for the long term. let me now turn it back to frank for questions.
frank golden -- head of investor relations
thanks very much, mike and steve. that concludes our formal remarks and presentation. before we open it up for questions, i want to mention and reiterate what steve and mike had said, that we'll be hosting a virtual investor day on tuesday, march 16. now, that session will run from 8:30 in the morning until about 12 noon with presentations from our management team who'll provide a more detailed discussion regarding our change program, and they will also be highlighting our growth initiatives, including the seven strategic priorities steve had discussed.
we'll be sending more information on the investor day later this week, including a link to register for the meeting. so with that, i would like to open it up for questions. so if we could take the first question, operator, please.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] your first question is coming from the line of kevin mcveigh of credit suisse. please go ahead. you're live in the call.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks so much and congratulations on the results. ok. i don't know if this would be for steve or mike, but i wonder, you know, if you could just compare and contrast a little bit the recovery you're seeing today versus the gfc.
because my sense is you folks are better positioned coming out of covid and maybe the gfc, but maybe some of the puts and takes. and the reason i mentioned, mike and steve, it's obviously more, you know, ceo [inaudible], but any thoughts from either one of you is super helpful.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yeah, happy to start with that, kevin. i'm sure steve would want to  supplement. i think the thing that we're seeing right now is just really great relentless performance from ourselves and account management teams. i think were [inaudible], kevin, if you look back over the last decade and i think that was really amplified in 2020.
so i think the performance net sales would be a key barometer that i would focus on, kevin, in the first quarter. we were up over $20 million in the first-quarter net sales versus the prior year, and we see that momentum continuing into q2. in regards to the print business, kevin, we see that continuing to chip away in regards to when customers get back to the office. so those would be some of my initial thoughts, kevin.
but, really, kudos to ourselves and account management team. and i think the relationships with our customers are stronger than ever. in regards to -- one other additional point, structural changes that we've had in legal, if you go back to 20 -- 2008 and 2009, is another factor, kevin.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
and just to add to that. i think, kevin, we're [audio gap] sort of real signs of a return to confidence and activity preparedness to invest among our customers in their businesses, you know, is putting many of our solutions. so that's -- i think that's, you know, the optimistic side. i think where we're cautious, for obvious reasons, is in places like brazil and argentina or [audio gap] yeah, i mean, smaller law, as you remember, was pretty -- as a -- as a sector was pretty hard hit when the pandemic started.
all of this sort of workaround personal injury and a lot of what was workaround divorce and accidents and so forth just went away as people retreated to their -- to their homes, stopped going to their places of work, and so on and so forth. so i think we've seen a pretty -- no -- no explaining that i think that our teams under market there did a great job throughout 2020 in -- in ensuring that -- that our level of activity stayed -- stayed at -- at good levels. but we've seen a return to -- to activity and confidence among those small law firms.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
kevin, i would just supplement, we've attempted during 2020 to support our customers as much as possible. and i think that's showing in 2021.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks, guys. thanks again.
operator
thank you. your next question is coming from toni kaplan of morgan stanley. please go ahead. you're now live in the call.
[technical difficulty] just to advise, toni, we may be having a --
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, there. hopefully that's better. i picked up the headset. the first-quarter ebitda margins were really strong, up over 350 basis points.
can you just help us bridge to the 30% to 31% guidance for the year? is it that t&e or other costs are coming back? you know, just help us with that cost bridge.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure, toni. a couple of things. the biggest factor, toni, would be the -- the change program investments that we'll make. only completed engagements with our partner to complete the migration of our eagan data center to the cloud.
kirsty has also completed a contract with one of our partners in regards to the content modernization that we also talked about. so those are our two of the key initiatives. karen stroup was [audio gap]
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, toni. so, you know, we made a couple of small acquisitions in 2020 and we've got a -- an active pipeline of opportunities that we continue to sort of assess and turn over and replenish. i'd sum it up by saying, with that -- that pipeline is focused in and around the big 3.
so we don't have plans to make any acquisitions beyond the big 3 at this point. the acquisitions are mostly, if not entirely, sort of bolt on and complementary to both the big 3 and the change program. so we're looking at, you know, just to give you a sense of the kinds of areas we're looking at, and it's  building on our own -- on our sort of a great start in risk, fraud, and compliance with clear, and trss, and -- and pondera. you know, places where we can help our customers automate with -- within the big 3 activities.
now, we're interested in supplementing some of our growth players in places like indirect tax and legal software, building on highq. and we're always on the lookout for smb and international opportunities. so there -- there's a sort of a sense for the kinds of things we're looking at. but as you know, you know, valuations are full at the moment.
and in a way that's healthy because it just means that we have to -- we have to be very confident that we are in advantage doing up. and that in -- in many places, those acquisitions can be helpful to more than one of our segments. so, you know, when you -- when you add all that up, we're going to continue to be very rigorous and prudent as it pertains to our m&a activity. but we are hopeful in the back half of this year that we'll have, you know, a candidate or two to bring forward.
frank golden -- head of investor relations
karen, our next question, please.
operator
thank you. we have your next question coming from david chu of bank of america. please go ahead. just one moment, please.
frank golden -- head of investor relations
hello.
operator
so just to advise, we're taking your next question at the moment from andrew steiner of j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
andrew steiner -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, it's andrew steiner. i don't think i heard your expectation for organic revenue growth for each of the big -- big 3. i definitely heard a tax and accounting comment for second quarter. so that's my first question.
my second question is i was intrigued by the reuters announcement around, you know, introducing a paywall. i wanted to know if you feel like this is going to be a revenue needle mover for news, you know, this year, and maybe what the capture rate you think will be at the subscription price you're proposing?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yeah, andrew, i'll take the first in regards to organic growth rates for the big 3. we do not break that down on a recurring basis, andrew. we stick to the big 3. back on investor day, we did provide some lifecycle trends for each of those for the big 3.
we'll stick with that. i would say that we're quite optimistic in each of them as we progressed during the year. as steve mentioned earlier and i did, legal had a really great q1 and we see that continuing to build throughout the year.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
and then on the  reuters paywall, andrew, a couple of thoughts. one is, you know, we've noticed as i think everyone in the news business has noticed that the sort of consumer and prosumer preparedness to pay for very high-quality news has gone up. so that that landscape has changed over the last couple of years. i think the reuters team has done a wonderful job in sort of doing the hard part, which is ensuring that our content is -- is of a sufficient premium to justify that price point.
and secondarily, putting all the machinery in place to enable us to move to a paywall later this quarter. but let me just finish by saying we're -- we're being very, very conservative as to what the financial implications of this will be. we want to launch the paywall. we want to learn from our audiences and look at those uptake numbers and review the pricing, and then move from there.
so certainly, this year, there's very limited financial expectation. i think we view it as a very promising initiative and one that -- that we'll learn a lot from. but from a financial standpoint, really nothing to say.
andrew steiner -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok, thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question is coming from david chu of bank of america. please go ahead.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
i think we're continuing to have some audio difficulties with david.
frank golden -- head of investor relations
let's -- let's move on.
operator
no problem. thank you. we have your next question from vince valentini. please go ahead.
you're now live in the call.
vince valentini -- td securities -- analyst
yeah, thanks very much. if i can come back to the -- the ebitda margin for this year question again from a slightly different angle. given that you've set these sort of targets through 2023, can you fill us in on how management compensation is working? if there's a big bridge on ebitda in 2021, does that drive the bulk of management bonuses or -- or is targets for 2023 now more impactful too?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
we have to earn out each year, vince, there. so that's how the long-term incentive plan works. so the targets that we provided to you during investor day, we have to get those for the long-term incentive for -- for all three years. in regards to the taxes, it's something that we'll watch in 1% to 2% and at directionally.
the other piece that we're monitoring closely that you referenced is potential global minimum tax. our intellectual property, we're watching closely there internally with our tax team and tax advisors. too early to speculate on that one yet, vince. but we're watching all of those -- all of those items.
for 2021, we feel very confident in achieving the etr that we provided.
vince valentini -- td securities -- analyst
thank you.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
thank you, vince.
operator
thank you. your next question is coming from the line of drew mcreynolds. please go ahead. you're live in the call.
drew mcreynolds -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yeah, thanks. good morning. thanks for taking the questions. i guess two -- two for me.
on the legal side, last quarter, you said q1 would -- would be a low point for -- for legal. i think it was 3% to 4%, and you did 5%. just wondering if that's still a low point for legal for the remainder of the year? and then secondly, maybe over to you, steve, you talked about where you're cautious with the overall business. but certainly, strong out of the gate here in q1, an easier comp in q2.
just wondering, you know, are you -- are you being somewhat conservative with the full-year guidance here or, you know, do you see certainly the tougher comp in the second half of this year kind of kick in and just want to level-set expectations here? thank you.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
hey, drew, i'll start with regards to the legal question. the way you summarize it, it is correct. we do the q1, our organic as the lowest point for the full year. we spent a lot of time with paul fisher and his full management team.
we're very encouraged by the momentum coming out of q1, both with the sales and revenue activity and as we look at the pipeline. westlaw edge continues to do really, really well. we're getting the 100 basis points lift there which we tapped in. they are practical law, which -- which steve mentioned.
the government business, 10% -- nearly 10% organic growth in q1. steve were at least driving that business. so, drew, we're very, very pleased with legal for q1 and encouraged -- equally encouraged as we lookout. with that said, we have to monitor the sales every day as we move forward.
but the recurring net sales from q1, it gives us encouragement there.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
and, drew, with regard to your -- your point about sort of strong out of the gate and you thought we're being somewhat conservative. i think, unequivocally, yes, we are being somewhat conservative. and there's a few reasons for that. i mean, firstly, we're all learning as it pertains to this pandemic.
and i think we're -- we're optimistic, we're hopeful, we're upbeat about where the united states is headed. but, you know, our headquarters is in -- is in toronto as you know, and -- and canada still got some -- some progress to make. we -- we don't have significant exposure to the countries that are really struggling. but we have some exposure.
and i think things will get harder before they get better in places like brazil, and argentina, and india. in addition to that, our folks are sort of poised in the second half of the year to return to office. but we've got to execute against that. and, you know, mary alice and our -- and our people team are very focused on it, but we're -- we're going to get that done.
you know, a lot of our business -- and fourth quarter is an important quarter for us. and -- and then lastly, we're overlaying the change program, and we're very excited about the first quarter or so progress in the change program. but as you've seen from mike's comments on the investment intensity, that -- that ramps up through the rest of this year. so we're going to overlay a lot of change, well, on -- on the team here as well.
so that -- they are reasons for our -- our sort of caution and our conservative approach. but as i said, we are -- we are optimistic and we're pleased with -- with how we started the year and -- and where we're headed. but i think sort of a bit of conservatism is -- is healthy.
drew mcreynolds -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
understood. thank you both.
operator
thank you. your next question is coming from [inaudible] of barclays. please go ahead. you're now live in the call.
manav patnaik -- barclays -- analyst
can you guys hear me?
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes.
manav patnaik -- barclays -- analyst
ok. so i guess that is me. that's not my name. but anyway.
hey, guys. i just got one question. one was -- and that was around just talking about the competitive environment. i was just curious, you know, a, you know, with all the changes you're making, if you're seeing, you know, your competitors make note -- take notice, if they're reacting? just any thoughts there would be appreciated.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yeah, manav, great question. so, ok. and so i think, you know, we -- we have a lot of respect for -- for our competitors, both -- both the folks who've been around a long time and have -- have competed in -- in legal, and tax, and risk, fraud, and compliance, and we also watch carefully what some of the -- what some of the newer players are doing and -- and some of the sort of pure digital and innovators are doing. i think the competitive intensity is -- is the same today as it was when i started 13, 14 months ago.
you know, it's not more and it's certainly not less. so, you know, i don't think we've seen a market change in my time at the company. mike can -- can provide you obviously a much longer time horizon there. but we are -- you know, one -- one of the reasons that we've -- we're sort of so aggressive in pursuing the change program is we -- we do want to create a much better customer experience and we want to lead our sectors in terms of the customer experience we provide.
and we're pretty confident that if we get that right, you know, we're always going to be very diligent about -- about competitive dynamics in our markets. but if we get that right, we'll be in good shape.
manav patnaik -- barclays -- analyst
all right. thank you, guys.
operator
thank you. your next question is coming from aravinda galappatthige of canaccord genuity. please go ahead. you're live in the call.
aravinda galappatthige -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question. just going back to the -- the -- some of the outlook comments you made with respect to legal. i was wondering if you can develop with respect to international growth there.
i was wondering if you can sort of expand a little bit on the international growth element there? and secondly, just as a follow up with respect to the tax comments. is there an update on the u.k. tax dispute? i know that there is an additional component that we're waiting for a larger component. i think, of course, $600 million --
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
it's here about the [inaudible]. in regards to tax for u.k. hmrc, very consistent with the last update that i provided in q1. we did make the initial roughly $100 million that related back to the 2016 disposition of the intellectual property in science business.
we currently are forecasting that we may, emphasized may, we may have to make the payment in q3 related to the 2018 divestiture other representative business. works -- we're continuing to work through it, but certainly, we factored that into our forecast as a potential payment that we would have to make -- potentially have to make in q3.
frank golden -- head of investor relations
karen, we'd like to take one final question -- one -- one final question, please.
operator
thank you. your final question is coming from george tong of goldman sachs. please go ahead. you're live in the call.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, thanks. good morning. i just wanted to dive into the legal segment. you mentioned 1q should be the low watermark growth should accelerate organically from the 5% we saw in the first quarter.
westlaw edge, practical law, government, all tailwinds. just wanted to perhaps have you elaborate on -- on the growth drivers. i mean, if we go above 5%, certainly, that would be the strongest level of organic growth we've seen from the legal segment in some time, and perhaps fold in the increasing contributions you're expecting from the change program and how that's going to lift organic growth in legal to -- to new recent highs?
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yeah. good morning, george. thanks for the question. so look, a couple of things have -- have driven -- driven i think a strong start to the year.
first and foremost, the work that paul fisher and his teams have done in -- in their outreach to our customers throughout 2020 and into 2021. i think i cannot say enough about the way in which they have wrapped their arms around customers and supported them throughout a very difficult period of time. and as -- and as the sort of level of activity about legal customers picks up, so too does our -- our business. that's the first thing.
i think the second thing is, you know, andy martens took you through west -- westlaw edge and -- and we also profiled the -- the progress with practical law. we have made i think very solid -- historically, very solid product bits around those products. and as a -- and as a group, we're very focused on making sure that we continue to out invest our competition in those products to ensure that their value is -- is -- is distinctive relative to any competitive offer. so that's -- that is from a product perspective, you know, that really driven performance.
we acquired highq in the last couple of years. highq had a good first quarter and we're excited about what -- what highq could do and we're excited about the way in which the team in eagan and across the world have embraced highq. and we're excited about the -- that way the corporates team under sunil pandita have embraced highq. so those are a few of the building blocks.
but what i would say is that, you know, there's -- there's been a -- if we get it right. we're hard at work to figure out what additional products and services and -- and potentially what acquisitions we might make to serve that. it's early days now, george. and so i think we're happy with where we are.
but there's some -- there's some real potential upside if we get it right, and -- and we -- we've got some -- some work to do. [inaudible]
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah, a quick follow-up. at -- at the analyst day, your medium-term target for the corporates segment was the highest among all your segments. and so given the strength that we're seeing in legal, would you perhaps touch on corporate? what's -- what's going to drive the growth in corporate to keep that of legal over the next two to three years?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yeah, the corporates business a few thoughts on it, george. sunil pandita joined us in december of 2020. so we look forward for him joining us to -- in some investor conferences coming up. if you think about the corporates business practical law that we've discussed quite a bit today, the direct tax, indirect tax, we're very enthused about global trade management, full portfolio.
they are -- this is where at investor day, erin brown and brian peccarelli talked about our full suite of onesource. so if you really focus on the -- the onesource suite of products, specifically the indirect tax, we're very excited about that. if you look over the time horizon, i think you'll see a very significant increase in our corporates growth as we go through '22 '23 to achieve the ranges that we discussed with investor day.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
very helpful, thank you.
frank golden -- head of investor relations
ok. well, that will conclude our first-quarter earnings call. we appreciate you all joining us this morning and this afternoon, wherever you may be. if you have any follow-up questions, feel free to reach out to me or to megan, and we look forward to speaking with you at a number of upcoming conferences over the course of the next several weeks.
and we'll also speak to you again in early august. have a good day.

operator
good day and welcome everyone to the thomson reuters' quarter 1 2021 earnings call. my name is karen and i'm your event operator. [operator instructions] i'd like to advise all parties, the conference will be recorded for replay purposes. i'd now like to hand over to your host, frank golden, head of investor relations.
frank golden -- head of investor relations
good morning and thank you for joining us today for our first-quarter 2021 earnings call. i'm joined today by our ceo, steve hasker; and our cfo, mike eastwood, each of whom will report our results and we'll take your questions following our presentation. to enable us to get to as many questions as possible, we appreciate it if you would limit yourselves to one question each and one follow-up when we open the phone lines. now, throughout today's presentation, when we compare the performance period on period, we discuss revenue growth rates before currency, as well as on an organic basis.
we believe this provides the best basis to measure the underlying performance of the business. today's presentation does contain forward-looking statements. actual results may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties related to the covid-19 pandemic and other risks discussed in reports and filings that we provided from time to time to regulatory agencies. you may access these documents on our website or by contacting our investor relations department.
let me now turn it over to steve hasker. 
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
thank you, frank, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. i'm pleased to report our first-quarter performance reflects a strong start to the year and we're encouraged by the momentum we're seeing build across the business. our customers are more confident in both an improving economic environment and in this trajectory of their businesses. positive prevailing tailwinds drove strong sales across the business as customers brushed off the restraint and caution exhibited in 2020 and bought our solutions in preparation for an expected rebound through the year.
however, despite the improving outlook, risks remain given that the global pandemic is still significantly impacting many parts of the world. notwithstanding this, we're encouraged by the first quarter's results, and that increasing confidence is reflected in our outlook for the second quarter and also in the increase to the lower end of our full-year revenue guidance. now to the results. as i stated at our investor day, we operate in robust and growing legal, tax, and risk, fraud, and compliance markets.
and our first-quarter results reflect the strength of those markets and our businesses. and within our core markets, we have advantage positions in high growth verticals, including the seven strategic growth initiatives we outlined at ir day which contributed to our strong first-quarter results. this strong performance is reflected in 5% organic growth by our big 3 businesses, our best first quarter post the sale of refinitiv. this performance was led by legal's 5% organic growth, the highest quarter since 2018.
strong sales across our businesses were driven by strong prevailing tailwinds and great performances across the board from our salespeople. law firms see growing demand with small law segment in particular increasingly positive. the large and mid-sized firms have done well throughout the past year and continue to do so. tax and accounting professionals are also busy advising clients on a host of challenges, several of which are related to the u.s.
federal stimulus programs. and governments across the u.s. and the world are now modernizing their systems and protocols in an effort to improve access to justice and reduce fraud, motivated by what they've learned during the covid-related lockdowns over the past year. we believe these strong tailwinds position us well for the balance of the year.
the first quarter's reported revenues were up 4%, with organic revenues up 3%. adjusted ebitda increased 16% to $558 million, reflecting a margin of 35.3%. excluding costs related to the change program, the adjusted ebitda margin was thir -- 36%. this strong performance resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $0.58, compared to $0.48 per share in the prior-year period.
turning to segments. as i mentioned, the big 3 businesses achieved organic revenue growth of 5% for the quarter. a strong performance to start the year. we've seen good momentum in our seven strategic growth priorities, with particularly strong sales performance from highq, confirmation, and practical law.
legal built on last year's organic growth 3%, recording 5% organic revenue growth in q1. legal also had a strong sales quarter, recording double-digit revenue sales growth -- recurring sales growth. and it's all good growth across the businesses, including westlaw edge, which continues to -- to drive strong sales growth and ended the quarter at a 54% acv penetration versus 52% at year-end 2020. and to reiterate, we expect to achieve a penetration rate of between 60% and 65% by year-end 2021.
second, practical law had a strong start to the year, growing 13% as we continue to invest behind this key growth initiative. and third, our government business, which is managed within our legal segment, continues to see good momentum and grew 12% or 8% organically. turning to the corporates business. organic revenues grew 4% despite a 2% reduction in revenue growth due to the loss of revenues impacted by the affordable care act that was recorded in the prior-year quarter but did not reoccur in 2021.
and tax and accounting's q1 organic revenues grew 5% despite the extension of the u.s. tax filing deadline from april to may, resulting in lower transactional revenues. revenue growth was also negatively impacted due to the acceleration of ultratax software from january 2021 to december 2020. organic growth in q1 would have been 8% normalized for the ultratax state release timing.
we're expecting tax and accounting revenue growth to -- to be very strong in the second quarter, which mike will discuss. reuters news organic revenues grew 2% in the first quarter, a good performance. and global print's organic revenues declined 9%, better than expected and helped by higher third-party revenues. you've heard me say that it's imperative that we elevate our value proposition to customers, enhance the customer experience, and maximize our performance.
to achieve success, we must execute on our four key focus areas and achieve the operational and financial goals and targets that we've set. it's early days for our change program, but i'm pleased with the progress we're making and happy to report that we are on track. and to further strengthen our bench, we continue to supplement our existing teams with seasoned experienced talent, with new additions in product development, digital, technology, strategy, and change management. this combined leadership team is executing well within our new operating company structure and is focused on the four key focus areas outlined in this slide.
first, reimagining the customer experience by making it easier for our customers to do business with us. second, optimizing and modernizing by simplifying our product portfolio and product development processes. third, simplifying operations and leverage -- leveraging technology by reducing complexity in our operations and technology organization and finishing the shift to cloud in 2023. and lastly, creating an inclusive culture of world-class talent.
over the course of the first quarter, i've shared with our employees that similar change programs have been successfully implemented at many, many companies over the past decade. we are not first in line, and that's a positive from a learning standpoint as we continue to drive growth and improve efficiencies. in fact, there are numerous success stories we can draw from, including refinitv's successful program as we implement our own change program. and i'm confident we'll achieve similar success.
let me now turn it over to mike who will provide more detail on the first-quarter results.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
thank you, steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. as a reminder, i will talk to revenue growth before currency and on an organic basis. let me start by discussing the revenue performance of our big 3 segments. total and organic revenues at constant currency were both up 5% for the quarter.
this marks the third consecutive quarter our big 3 segments have grown 5%. legal professionals' revenues increased 5% and organic revenues were also up 5%. recurring organic revenue growth of 4% was supplemented by 17% increase in transaction revenue related to our government and elite businesses. westlaw edge continues to drive over 100 basis points to legal's organic growth while continuing to maintain a healthy premium.
our government business, which is reported within legal and includes much of our existing risk, fraud, and compliance offerings, had a strong start to the year with total revenue growth of 12% and organic growth of 8%. in our corporates segment, total and organic revenues increased 4% despite the loss of $3 million in revenue related to the affordable care act, which steve mentioned earlier. recurring in transaction organic revenues were up 4%, driven by our legal and tax solutions. and finally, tax and accounting's total revenues grew 5%, with organic revenues also up 5%, driven by audit products and latin american businesses.
as previously mentioned, we accelerated the release of some of the ultratax state software from january to december to align with the traditional december release. this performance was slightly better than we had anticipated. and global print total and organic revenues declined 9% in the quarter. this performance was better than we had expected, driven by higher third-party revenues for printing services.
from tax and accounting's pay for returned revenues that shifted from q1 to q2 due to the delay in the tax filing deadline, we forecast second-quarter revenue growth between 10% and 15% for tax and accounting. in 2020, these revenues were shifted from the second quarter to the third quarter. leading to reuters news, we forecast second-quarter total and organic revenues to grow between 2% and 3%. this increase is primarily related to reuters events.
the events team is currently holding all events virtual. we continue to assess when we can resume in-person events based on the local health experts' advice and feedback from our customers. finally, global print's second-quarter revenues are expected to grow between 1% and 3%, driven by the covid-19 impact in the prior year and shipment deliver basis points to 43.7%. the strong ebitda margin improvement of each of the three businesses was driven by higher revenue growth and a benefit from 2020 cost savings initiatives.
moving to reuters news. adjusted ebitda was $558 million, a 16% increase versus q1 2020, due to higher revenues, partially offset by change program costs which i will address in a moment. this slide provides more color on the various factors impacting our first-quarter 2021 reported adjusted ebitda ratio and of ultratax revenues to q4 2020, had about a 30-basis-point negative impact. and second, the savings from the cost savings initiatives in 2020 provided a benefit to the margin of 490 basis points.
on an underlying basis, positive impact on adjusted eps in the quarter. let me now turn to our free cash flow performance for the quarter. our reported free cash flow was $239 million versus $35 million in the prior-year period, an improvement of over $200 million. consistent with previous quarters, this slide removes the distorting factors impacting our free cash flow.
working from the bottom of the page upwards, the cash outflows from the discontinued operations component of our free cash flow was $22 million more than the prior-year period. this was primarily attributable to payments to the u.k. tax authority related to the operations of our former refinitiv business. also in the current quarter, we made $12 million in change program payments as compared to refinitiv-related separation cost of $63 million in the prior-year period.
so if you adjust for these items, comparable free cash flow from continuing operations was $288 million, $175 million higher than the prior-year period, primarily due to higher ebitda and favorable working capital movements. next, i'd like to provide an update on the financial components of our change program. first, in the first quarter, we invested $20 million, with the $300 million to $350 million estimated to be incurred in 2021. second, we have achieved $19 million of annual run-rate operating expense savings.
as a reminder, we anticipate saving $600 million by 2023 while reinvesting $200 million back into the business for a net savings of $400 million. and third, as i previously shared, our first-quarter adjusted ebitda margin, excluding change program costs, was 36%, compared to our 2023 target of between 38% and 40%. now, an update on our change program costs for the first quarter and the rest of 2021. let me start by saying none of the annual estimates have changed from what we provided last quarter for the full year.
spending for the first quarter was lower than we expected at $20 million, including $11 million of opex plus $9 million of capex, and was primarily timing-related. we expect change program spend to pick up in the second quarter and over the balance of the year. we now anticipate to have about $85 million to $110 million total spend in the first half and $215 million to $240 million in the second half. for the full year, we continue to expect to spend between $300 million and $350 million related to the change program.
the spend will vary quarter to quarter, but we do not expect a change to the full-year estimate at this time. and there is no change in the anticipated split of about 60% opex and 40% capex. we will continue to provide quarterly updates on our change program spend as we move through the year. and finally, as i mentioned, we are providing revenue guidance for the second quarter and we are increasing the bottom end of our full-year revenue guidance for total tr and the big 3.
we are also reaffirming the balance of our full-year 2021 guidance based on the strong start to the year and our confidence in the trajectory of the business and markets. and we also reaffirm our 2022 and 2023 guidance. let me now turn it back to frank for questions.
frank golden -- head of investor relations
thanks very much, mike. and that concludes our formal remarks and we would now like to open the call for questions. so, karen, if we can have the first question, please.
",2021-Q1,TRI
1.0,,0.9957,,":
operator
thank you. your first question is from the line of gary bisbee from bofa securities. please go ahead.
gary bisbee -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. encouraging set of results here. i guess a couple of things stood out to me.
the first i wanted to ask is just you talked about having had the strongest half -- first-half bookings in a while, and yet a lot of the investments and change you're making to improve the user experience and improve and innovate around the products haven't really taken hold yet. so what's driving? are there any sort of either big areas of success or themes you're seeing that are driving those strong new bookings?
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes. gary, thanks for the question. i'd say two things, and i'm sure mike will supplement. so the first is we've seen a pretty -- a gradual but pretty constant sort of improvement through the second quarter in the sentiment of our customers.
they've got more confidence in making longer-term investments in their own businesses. and so that, i think, has helped. the second -- having said that, the last two weeks, obviously, there's been a bit of a shake in confidence, but we don't see any impact on that so far on our businesses. i think the second thing is the seven growth initiatives that we called out at our investor day, we're starting to see, i think, the green shoots from those investments and the focus on those areas.
and we're increasingly optimistic about those growth initiatives.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yes, gary, i would just supplement with a little additional granularity in regards to the 7seven strategic initiative: practical law, which is split between legal professionals and corporates, as i mentioned, 10% organic growth in the second quarter. government risk, fraud and compliance, which i mentioned, 8% organic growth in the second quarter, and that business is driving to nearly 500 million for the full year. confirmation that we acquired in july of '19 along with highq in july of '19 continue to perform very well. confirmation, part of the overall audit offerings that we discussed during investor day.
gary, you mentioned in regards to the bookings. very pleased with the overall net sales for the first and second quarter of this year across the board, including within our corporates business. corporates was up 4% in the second quarter. as we go into q3, q4, based on the net sales improvement that we've seen in recent quarters there, we have high confidence that corporates will accelerate into q3, q4, but very pleased with the overall performance of our sales and account management teams in the first half of the year, gary.
gary bisbee -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thanks. and then the quick follow-up is what changed in your thinking around the buybacks? obviously, that's a very positive announcement and sort of a change from how you've framed it historically. and should we read into that any less optimism around near-term m&a potential? thank you.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
the optimism is as high as ever, gary. we're very blessed and fortunate to have a lot of optionality in being able to balance both buybacks with also acquisitions. we continue to look at acquisitions, primarily within our big three segments. so we are prepared, ready and willing, gary, to put additional capital to work with acquisitions in the big three as we identify candidates that we are very comfortable with.
but that has to include candidates that we can certainly integrate very quickly, that meets the needs of our customers and accelerate our organic growth. but, gary, please do not read buybacks as any less optimism equal to higher optimism, but we just have the ability to do both buybacks and acquisitions, gary.
operator
thank you. so your next question is from the line of drew mcreynolds of rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
drew mcreynolds -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yes. thanks very much. good morning. my question's already answered out of the gate here.
steve, just cutting it maybe slightly different and just looking for a probably simple answer here. we've seen two consecutive increases in your 2021 outlook, and both of those coming a quarter after you provided the initial outlook. so with your kind of four drivers of growth here, is there one single driver here that is really lifting the trajectory? and then if there is one or two, does that just continue to lift as we kind of go forward here? and then second question just around, i guess, renewed covid impacts. last quarter, you talked about still some uncertainty internationally.
there's a little bit more certainty now domestically here, in north america, in particular, in the u.s. maybe talk to your working assumptions here as to what unfolds in the back half of the year. thank you.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes. all right. thanks, drew. so the three parts of the question.
the first part, we're not -- the beauty of this business is we're not unduly reliant on any one lever. so we've got strength across the big three. and within the big three, we have multiple growth bets. and so we're pleased with the trajectory we see against those growth bets, but we're not unduly reliant on any one of them to fire on all cylinders for us to achieve or exceed our guidance going forward.
in terms of the -- your question, will things continue to lift? we're now six months into the change program. as we are -- mike and i outlined in our comments, we are happy with the start that we've made. but having said that, the next six months will be crucial in our execution. so we're very focused on that execution, led by kirsty roth and andrew pearson and people across our businesses.
and so i would say let's focus on that, let's get through that before we shift out gaze to sort of further lift some further optimism. what we're trying to do is fundamentally reinvent the customer experience, to your point. we still got an awful lot of work to do to get through that, but we are very optimistic that in success, it's going to create a much higher customer satisfaction and give us the ability to grow our business in compelling and interesting ways. and then in terms of the sort of uncertainty around covid and the delta variant, we saw the impacts of covid on our business in 2020, particularly reuters events, the ship and build halts in print and the softness in transactional.
in 2021, we've seen strength on a rebound in all of those areas. and so i think as we go forward, we're sort of cautiously optimistic that things will continue to improve. but certainly, when we talk to our colleagues in places like brazil, india, indonesia, we don't see any improvement yet. so we're keeping our expectations perfectly modest there.
and we're watching very carefully as to what happens in the united states and if things continue to open up and confidence continues to increase or if there's a pause in that improvement. but as we sit here today, we're confident that our products and solutions will be more relevant and more valuable to our customers across the big three in a -- in no matter what environment they move to, but particularly in a sort of hybrid, more flexible working environment.
drew mcreynolds -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
that's great. thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question is from the line of kevin mcveigh, credit suisse. please go ahead.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. i actually wanted to start with just extending our sympathies for your loss, and congratulate you folks on the results. i want to talk a little bit about change program, specifically as it relates to kind of the cloud conversion and how we should think about that within the context of the retention, specifically within legal, steve, if we could. because i think there's a real big opportunity kind of mid or down market on the legal side.
so just how are we thinking about that in terms of retention around those initiatives? and are you starting to see the signs of that already, just given the strength you're already seeing in legal? is that the strength of the clients relative to the last cycle? is that product? is that change program? maybe just help us understand because obviously, really, really nice outcome on the legal side.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
so just as a reminder, in terms of our cloud migration, we started the year at 20% of our revenues in the public cloud. we're now at 33%, and we're on track to get to our stated target of 90% or more into 2023. so on track from that perspective. and credit to our technology and operations team for all their hard work in guiding us through that.
so i think the impact of that are just starting to be felt. so to your point, kevin, within legal, i think the strength of our legal business is based on a couple of things: firstly, westlaw edge; and secondarily, practical law; thirdly, highq. so in other words, our product bets are paying off, and we've got a lot of talent and a lot of investments to those products bets, and it's paying off. and we continue -- and we plan to continue that focus and that level of investment in those key bets, firstly.
secondly, i think we're seeing a very vibrant legal market, particularly in the united states. if you speak with the heads of law firms, they'll talk about shortage of associates. their biggest challenge is hiring talent and meeting the needs of their customers, scheduling the meetings and the calls that they have with their clients. so there's a pretty robust level of activity going across mid -- small, mid, and large firms.
i don't think that the impact of the change program and the improvement in customer experience has been felt in legal yet. we're just at the start. and so i think that is -- as i said earlier, that requires great execution for us, and we're very focused on that. and we're cautiously optimistic that once we execute, we'll see some upside benefits.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yes, kevin, i would supplement. in addition to the cloud conversion being an enabler for our retention -- by the way, legal's overall retention was slightly over 90% year to date. the digital work that we're doing, including at david wong and karen stroup's areas there, will also help us, kevin, especially within small law. i think as you're aware, we have lower retention in small law, higher retention in the global law, led by the strength of westlaw of 95%.
so the combination, as steve mentioned, cloud conversion, digital, omnichannel work that we're doing, optimistic that we'll see the improvement in retention. i've stated on prior calls that we're forecasting 100 basis points for total tr. over the time horizon, certainly remain confident with that.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. and then just real quick a follow-up. the buyback, does woodbridge participate in that? or it will be open market? or just -- it sounds like you also referenced a 10b5, mike, at one point. but just any thoughts in terms of clarity on the buyback?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
sure, kevin. certainly, woodbridge will have the opportunity to participate, just like all shareholders. and woodbridge has always been a great shareholder and a great supporter of ours. so they have the opportunity to participate, kevin.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks so much. great job.
operator
thank you. your next is from the line of andrew steinerman at j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
andrew steinerman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, all. i heard the westlaw edge penetration numbers for the quarter and for the year-end. i wasn't sure if i heard the westlaw edge revenue -- organic revenue growth contribution to legal. i remember in the past, that's been like 100 basis points to legal.
how long do you think westlaw edge could continue to add at this rate? and maybe make a mention about the westlaw edge product road map. as you add more modules, will that be additional revenues for current westlaw edge customers?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
andrew, a great series of questions there. 57% acv penetration as of june 30. forecast that very confident we'll be in the 60to 65% by year end. that continues into 2022 before we peak out there.
as we approach the latter part of 2022, andrew, i would anticipate us launching what we refer to internally as westlaw edge 2.0. that's the next version of westlaw edge. andy martens briefly referenced it during the march investor day. but 100 basis points lift in the second quarter, which is consistent with what we've been seeing, andrew, in prior quarters there.
so no change there. we anticipate that continuing for several more quarters. and we think westlaw edge 2.0 can help continue with that momentum. so we do not see any decrease in westlaw overall in the midterm time horizon, andrew.
we're very confident there. we -- steve and i were in minneapolis in fall with andy martens, david wong, mike dahn recently and making good progress on westlaw edge 2.0.
andrew steinerman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
well said. thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question is from the line of toni kaplan of morgan stanley. please go ahead.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
corporates was a little bit lighter than i was expecting. and i think there's still a way to go to get to the 7 to 9% target that you mentioned. you mentioned that corporates will accelerate in the back half of the year. so just maybe what's going on in corporates? and what are the main drivers that are going to help it accelerate and get up to the target level by '23.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, toni. thanks for the question. so just by way of context, in the sort of history of thomson reuters, corporates as a distinct segment is a relative newcomer.
and so i think it's fair to say that when sunil pandita, the president of corporates, stepped into that role in december of last year, it's -- in the context of our big three, it's something of a start-up. and so he's been working hard on a number of things. so the first is i think he's assembled a world-class team, pulling together a bunch of folks with extensive experience at tr, with some very, very talented newcomers from predominantly software environments. secondarily, he and that team spent the last six months prioritizing the big areas of opportunity within corporates and serving general counsels and heads of techs and heads of risk.
and we see, i think, some pretty significant growth opportunities, which is reflected not only in our second-half projections, but also our outlook for the next couple of years. and they include indirect tax and the recently announced partnership with oracle. they've also -- this also includes the increased penetration of some of the key legal products, like westlaw and practical law to the general counsels offices. and then last but certainly not least, our risk, fraud and compliance business, which previously has been more focused on government agencies through steve rubley and his team, we see a pretty big opportunity to better serve the heads of risk and compliance within corporations with clear and trss and some of the other products we have there.
so all of that adds up to the accelerating growth rate that you see in our commentary.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. also wanted to ask about what you're seeing in terms of your own hiring. we've heard from some of the other info services companies that turnover is maybe a little bit higher right now because of the better labor market. so just in terms of what are you seeing in terms of voluntary turnover and ease of finding good people.
thanks.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes, toni. so one of the things that i'm -- i think we're very proud of in our last 18 months or so has been our ability to attract world-class talent. we have an objective to create the best team in business information services, and we started that journey. our most recent addition to the team was sarah wilkinson, who is our chief information officer.
she joined from nhs digital, where she was previously the ceo. and sarah is the latest in a long line of, i think, great new talent that we've added to the existing long-tenured tr bench of talent. so just -- as i look at that vital sign of, are we getting the people that we need and want externally? i think the answer is yes. and then secondarily, is our talent development -- new talent development approach working for existing tr talent? and i think i'd give a cautious yes to that with more work to go.
we are seeing up and down our organization an uptick in attrition, in voluntary attrition. the labor market is hot. and of course, the virtual -- the working -- virtual working environment, i think, has given people not only at tr, but across the industry, a little -- has broadened their aperture a little bit in terms of the kinds of opportunities that they're prepared to entertain and the types of calls they're prepared to take. so we are remaining very vigilant to make sure that attrition doesn't become a problem for us.
it's not today, it's ticked up, but it's still manageable. and we'll put in place all the measures we need to ensure that, that stays the case.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
perfect. thank you.
operator
your next question is from the line of george tong, goldman sachs. please go ahead.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. thanks. good morning. you're seeing very good traction with your change program with respect to efficiency gains and benefits to the top line as well.
just wanted to explore the potential for margins longer term. certainly, you have the 2023 target out there for ebitda margins that were reiterated. but as you think longer term, where do you think overall corporate ebitda margins can trend to with -- given your progress so far with change initiatives?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yes, george, we're certainly remaining very confident in regards to the guidance that we provided for '22 and for '23. so for 2023, it's 38 to 40%. we remain very confident on that. we're not prepared today, george, to talk about '24 or '25 today.
i would just say as we go into '24, we should certainly see continued sustainability, some potential increases given the operating leverage that we have in our business. as discussed before, once we hit that 3% organic growth, which we are, the operating leverage kicks in, given that about 60 to 65% of our costs are fixed in nature. so we'll focus on '22, '23 guidance now, george.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
understood. and then maybe a follow-up question on the corporates side. you talked about various drivers to accelerate the growth to your longer-term targets and for -- by 2023 of 7 to 9%. as you think about cross-selling, how big of a lever is that? cross-selling legal and tax and accounting within corporates in terms of your goal of getting to that 2023 target? how big of a driver is cross-selling?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yes. george, before i address the cross-sell question, i would just supplement toni's question previously that steve addressed. one of the reasons we have optimism with our q3, q4 uptick in corporates' overall organic revenue is the underlying book of business that we've built in q1, q2. so the net sales performed really well in the first half of the year.
in regards to cross-sell, george, we are at the early stage, the early innings right now in cross-sell. we are optimistic there, especially with sunil pandita, as steve mentioned earlier, in the chair about seven or eight months now. so we still believe we have good optimism in regards to accelerating. it's a relatively small portion now for total tr.
about 15% of our gross sales are generated via cross-sell activity, comparable within corporates. so we have significant opportunity over the time horizon to generate more cross-sell activity. and that's something that sunil is working with david wong and shawn malhotra and product and engineering to ensure that as we enhance our products and build new products, that they will enhance our opportunities for further cross-sell.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes, george, the other thing i'd add to that is that we're excited about the possibilities that will accrue to tr from the oracle partnership. and it's a learning experience for us. it's -- partnerships are not something that the company has done a lot of in the past. and we're cautiously optimistic that with those learnings, we can both expand that relationship and consider others in different parts of our product set.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
and, george, just one final point. steve mentioned sarah wilkinson, kirsty, andrew, others working on the change program. a core component thereof is expanding our salesforce.com and in common instances there of salesforce, that will certainly help. if you think about the infrastructure and underlying business systems, that just makes it easier for our go-to-market teams, led by brian peccarelli, to drive cross-sell.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thanks very much.
operator
thank you. so your next question is from the line of tolecki domina, td securities. please go ahead.
vince valentini -- td securities -- analyst
i assume that's for me. can you guys hear me?
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes, we can.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
we can hear you, yes.
vince valentini -- td securities -- analyst
it's vince valentini. so first off, congrats on the results in the share price today. i assume a new all-time high will help with that employee retention that you were talking about earlier. my question really is quite simple.
there's a ton of optimism in the results here and in your commentary so far to several of the questions, whether it's westlaw edge traction, whether it's the improvement in corporates, i mean, across the board. is there a reason you're not increasing your 2023 targets yet? is that just simply saying that's still a ways off, and you want to be conservative? or i have to assume there's an upward bias to those targets now, unless there's some unforeseen sort of macro negative event between now and then. is that a fair conclusion?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yes, vince, i would address it as follows. our optimism is balanced with the reality that we have to execute like hell every day and we have to win every day. that's our approach today, and that's going to be our approach tomorrow. we're not going to take anything for granted, and we have to earn it.
so there are a lot of quarters between now and 2023. so we're confident in our team, but we also are grounded in the reality that we have a lot of work to do with our change program, as steve referenced earlier, in the rest of this year and into 2022. so what i would say, vince, is we reaffirm we're very confident today in 2023. and we'll provide an update in february on '22 and '23.
so we're going to continue to work our change program. we're going to work on accelerating the top line. we're going to work on improving our customer experience. and we take care of our employees and we take care of our customers.
i think our confidence level in 2023 will just continue to increase. that would be my viewpoint, vince.
vince valentini -- td securities -- analyst
[inaudible] there. thanks.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
operator, we would like to take one final question please.
operator
thank you. your final question is from the line of tim casey, bmo capital markets. please go ahead.
tim casey -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yes. two for me. can we just revisit the change in the buyback messaging? i mean, mike, you've been pretty consistent that you wanted to retain a certain level of float and whatnot. just if you could walk us through how your thinking has changed there.
and what we investors should think about in terms of how much you plan to execute on the buyback program? and second one for you, steve. one of the levers you haven't talked about is pricing power. can you just, from a high level, maybe walk us through your thinking on that in terms of how that factors in, in terms of your organic growth assumptions? thanks.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yes. tim, let me focus on the first question first. i'm going to give you a two-part answer. first, historically, we've talked about 70% being an important threshold in regards with woodbridge ownership.
prior to today's announcement on the buyback, 66% ownership by woodbridge, and we've talked about maintaining it at around 70%. based on our recent analysis, a different way to look at it is the availability of public float, given that our market cap now exceeds 50 million. working with our outside advisors, they feel like $10 million -- 10 billion of public float is really a sufficient amount. so right now, we have 20 billion.
so that gives us great confidence in being able to do the 1.2 billion today, tim, and we can certainly consider more if the board agrees over the time horizon, certainly balancing that with m&a. so i think it's a combination, tim, of that kind of 70% threshold that we've discussed in the past, but also balancing that with the availability of public float, which exceeds 20 billion today. and our advisors believe that we are in a very good position to be able to do additional buybacks like today, tim.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
and then, tim, the second part of your question with regard to pricing. as you know, we have a good a good record of getting price as appropriate, particularly as we add new features and functionality to our products. the change program is about transforming the customer experience. and we're more focused on improving our retention, on taking opportunities where they exist around cross-sell, as mike outlined, and growing the number of net new customers.
we're more focused on those levers than we are on price.
tim casey -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you.
frank golden -- head of investor relations
ok. well, that will be our final question, and we'll conclude our call. we'd like to thank you all for joining us. happy to do any follow-ups that you may have.

operator
good day, everyone, and welcome to the thomson reuters q2 2021 earnings call. my name is simone. i'm your event manager. [operator instructions].
i'd like to advise all parties the conference is being recorded for replay purposes. and now i'd like to hand over to frank golden, head of investor relations. please go ahead.
frank golden -- head of investor relations
good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our second-quarter 2021 earnings call. i'm joined today by our ceo, steve hasker; and our cfo, mike eastwood, each of whom will report our results and will take your questions following our presentation. [operator instructions]. throughout today's presentation, when we compare period -- performance period-on-period, we discuss revenue growth rates before currency as well as on an organic basis.
we believe this provides the best basis to measure the underlying performance of the business. now today's presentation contains forward-looking statements and non-ifrs financial measures. actual results may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties related to the covid-19 pandemic and other risks discussed in reports and filings that we provide from time to time to regulatory agencies. you may access these documents on our website or by contacting our investor relations department.
let me now turn it over to steve hasker. 
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
thank you, frank, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. before i speak to our performance for the quarter, i wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the loss of our much-loved colleague and outstanding pulitzer prize-winning journalist, danish siddiqui. danish was tragically killed while on assignment in afghanistan last month. the impact of his loss has been significant for all of us, especially his reuters news colleagues, and we will continue to honor his memory.
thank you for your respect and acknowledgment of danish's passing. now we'll move to our financial performance for the second quarter. i'm pleased to report the momentum we saw in the first quarter accelerated in the second quarter. our strong performance was above our expectations and positions us well for the second half of the year.
this strong performance reflects several things: first, the solidity of our franchises, our must-have products and our market positions. second, the strength of the information services market itself, which is presenting us with opportunities to expand our positions and further accelerate growth. third, the realization and conviction by our customers that they need to reapportion their spend toward our products and solutions that can fit their workflow and drive growth and productivity. and finally, customers have growing confidence in both an improving economic environment and their own future prospects.
so we're pleased with our first half performance, which increases our confidence in our prospects for the second half of the year and for 2022. now to the results. prevailing tailwinds are playing to our strengths and contributing to strong revenue and sales growth. the second quarter's total company organic revenue growth of 7% was the highest in over a decade, and the big three businesses also grew at 7%.
this revenue growth was mirrored by strong sales growth across the company as customers position themselves to meet expected demand. we also continued to execute aggressively on our change program and achieved run rate savings of $90 million as of june 30th. the program is on track and we will continue to ramp it up in the second half. given this strong first-half performance, we are raising our full-year guidance.
we now forecast total company organic revenue growth between 4% and 4.5% and organic revenue growth for the big three of between 5.5% and 6%. total company ebitda margin is forecast to range between 31% and 32%. and the big three ebitda margin is now forecast to be approximately 39%. and free cash flow is now expected to range between 1.1 and $1.2 billion.
lastly, today, we announced a new $1.2 billion share buyback program. if we are able to complete the buyback program this year, we will have returned over $2 billion to shareholders in 2021, including dividends. second quarter reported revenues were up 9% with organic revenues up 7%. revenue growth was solid for each business segment, including strong growth from our latin american and asia and emerging markets businesses, which grew organically more than 20% and 10%, respectively.
adjusted ebitda increased 5% and to $502 million, reflecting a margin of 32.7%. excluding costs related to the change program, the adjusted ebitda margin was 35.4%. this strong performance resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $0.48 compared to $0.44 per share in the prior-year period. turning to the results for the segments.
as i mentioned, the big three achieved organic revenue growth of 7% for the quarter, a very strong performance. legal second-quarter performance was impressive with organic revenue growth of 6%, the highest quarterly growth since 2008, and building on 5% growth for the first quarter. the u.s. legal market is quite healthy, particularly in small law, where sentiment continues to be strong as attorneys anticipate solid demand over the next 12 months.
but this strong growth isn't isolated to small law, it's across the business: small, mid, and large firms, government and across our product lines and geographies. a few examples. first, westlaw edge continues to achieve strong sales growth and ended the quarter at 57% acv penetration compared to 52% at year-end 2020. we continue to forecast an acv penetration rate between 50% -- between 60% and 65% by year end.
second, practical law, as reported in the legal segment, continued its strong performance, growing double digit. we forecast similar growth going forward, and we continue to invest in this key growth initiative. third, our government business, which is managed within our legal segment, continues to see good momentum and grew 8% organically. we forecast government's growth to accelerate in the second half of the year.
and fourth, findlaw and our businesses in canada, europe, and asia all grew mid to upper single digit in the quarter. finally, legal also achieved very strong sales for both the quarter and half year, recording double-digit recurring sales growth, reflecting the strength and health of the legal market and our customers' willingness to spend. turning to the corporates business. organic revenues grew 4%.
we forecast revenues will accelerate in the second half of the year with healthy growth expected from our direct and indirect tax businesses, risk, the legal products sold into corporates and from europe, latin america, and asia and emerging markets. tax and accounting's organic revenues grew 15%, benefiting from a 43% increase in transactional revenues, primarily driven by the year-over-year timing of individual tax filing deadlines. recurring revenue growth was also strong at 9%. reuters news' organic revenues grew 6% in the quarter, a very good performance, driven by the professionals business, including strong reuters events growth as it begins to recover from the negative impact from covid-19 in 2020.
and global print organic revenues also grew 6%, partly due to an easier prior-year comparable, but also attributable to a gradual return to office by our customers and higher third-party revenues. in summary, it was a very strong quarter and our businesses are in a solid position. but we take nothing for granted, and we still have much hard work to do in executing our change program. with this in mind, i would like to express my gratitude to our employees, our colleagues for a strong first-half performance, which will allow us to intensify our investments in the health and growth of our businesses, enabling us to further support our customers in the second half and into next year.
a final point before i turn it over to mike. the increase in our full-year 2021 organic revenue guidance puts us on a path to exceed our pre-covid 2019 organic revenue growth rates for both total company and the big three. and it also increases our confidence to achieve our 2023 revenue growth target of 5 to 6%. our confidence is also increasing as our legal business is now achieving 5%-plus organic growth.
we believe legal has multiple levers to pull to drive organic growth to between 5 and 6% by 2023. and the corporates segment is expected to build on its first-half 2021 results over the balance of this year. we continue to forecast organic growth for corporates between 7% and 9% by 2023. and we forecast tax & accounting will achieve solid organic revenue growth this year and be able to achieve a growth of 6% to 8% by 2023.
so in closing, we're working to transform thomson reuters into a leading content-driven technology company. we're making good progress, but we still have much to accomplish. we're off to a strong start, and we're confident that 2021 is setting the foundation to position us to be able to consistently and sustainably drive strong operating and financial performance that builds value for our customers, colleagues, and shareholders for the long term. let me now hand it off to mike, who will discuss the second quarter's results in detail.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
thank you, steve, and thanks for joining us today. as a reminder, i will talk to revenue growth before currency and on an organic basis. let me start by discussing the second-quarter revenue performance of our big three segments. organic revenues and revenues at constant currency were both up 7% for the quarter.
this marks the fourth consecutive quarter our big three segments have grown at least 5% and represents the highest growth for our big three segments in over a decade. legal professionals revenues increased 7%, and organic revenues were up 6%. recurring organic revenue grew 6%, and transaction revenues increased 14% due to our westlaw, practical law, and government businesses. please note, 60% of practical law's revenues are recorded in the legal professionals segment and 40% is recorded in the corporates segment.
westlaw edge continued to contribute about 100 basis points to legal's organic revenue growth while continuing to maintain a healthy premium. and edge has now been adopted by all u.s. federal government courts, and by courts, in 44 states. our government business, which is reported within legal and includes much of our risk, fraud, and compliance offerings, had a strong quarter with total revenue growth of 10% and organic growth of 8%.
in our corporates segment, total and organic revenues increased 4%, led by recurring organic revenue growth of 5%. transactions organic revenue grew 1% due to a difficult prior-year comparison when 4 million of onetime clear revenue was recorded and did not reoccur this year. we forecast corporates revenue to accelerate in the second half of the year. and finally, tax and accounting's total and organic revenues grew 15%.
growth was driven by the latin american businesses, audit solutions, which includes confirmation, and a 43% increase in transaction revenues resulting from the year-over-year timing of individual tax filing deadlines. i will remind you, last year, pay-per-return revenue shifted from the second quarter to the third quarter. normalizing for this timing, organic revenues for tax and accounting were up 10% in q2. moving to reuters news.
total and organic revenues increased 6% primarily due to our professional business, which includes reuters events. this performance was slightly better than we had anticipated. and global print total and organic revenues increased 6% in the quarter. this performance was better than expected, driven by higher third-party revenues for printing services and a gradual return to office by our customers.
despite this higher performance, we still forecast full-year revenues to decline between 4% and 7%. on a consolidated basis, second-quarter total and organic revenues each increased 7%. before turning to profitability, let's look closer at recurring and transaction revenue results for the second quarter. starting on the left side, total company organic revenue for the second quarter of 2021 was up 7% compared to a 2% decline in the second quarter of 2020 due to the impact of covid-19.
if we look at q2 2021 performance for the big three, you will see organic revenues increased 7%, a strong performance and well above the 2% performance in q2 2020. total company recurring organic revenues grew 5% in q2, 210 basis points above q2 2020. and the big three recurring organic revenues grew 6%, which was above last year's second quarter growth of 4%. turning to the graph on the bottom right of the slide, transaction revenues were up significantly year over year as the second quarter of 2020 was impacted by covid-19, which affected our implementation services and the reuters events business.
we continue to remain encouraged by the momentum in 2021, especially for recurring revenues, giving us confidence in the trajectory of the business and the sustainability of higher revenue growth beyond 2021. we are also providing guidance for the third quarter given the various impacts related to covid-19. starting with the total tr chart on the top left, we estimate third-quarter total and organic revenues will grow between 3.5% and 4%. the big three total and organic revenues are forecast to grow between 5% and 5.5% in the third quarter.
big three growth will be slightly depressed due to the timing of tax and accounting's pay-per-return revenues in 2020 that shifted 6 million from q2 to q3 due to the delay in the tax filing deadline. we forecast third-quarter revenue growth of low-single digit for tax and accounting. on a normalized basis, we expect revenue growth of mid-single digits for tax and accounting. moving to reuters news.
we forecast third-quarter total and organic revenues to grow between 2% and 3%, driven by all reuters news business lines. finally, global print third-quarter revenues are expected to decline between 5% and 8%, and we forecast full-year revenues to decline between 4% and 7%. turning to our profitability performance in the second quarter. adjusted ebitda for the big three segments was 487 million, up 14% from the prior-year period, and the related margin increased 180 basis points due to strong margin improvement across each of the segments.
the strong ebitda margin improvement for each of the three businesses was driven by higher revenue growth and a benefit from 2020 cost savings initiatives. i will remind you the change program operating costs are recorded at the corporate level. moving to reuters news. adjusted ebitda was 35 million, 10 million more than prior-year period, driven by revenue growth, 2020 cost savings initiatives, and timing.
global print's adjusted ebitda was 56 million with a margin of 37.9%, a decline of about 260 basis points due to higher costs and the dilutive impact of lower-margin third-party print revenue. so in aggregate, total company adjusted ebitda was 502 million, a 5% increase versus q2 2020. the increase resulted in higher revenues partially offset by change program costs, which i will address in a moment. the second quarter's adjusted-ebitda margin was 32.7% and was 35.4% on an underlying basis, excluding costs related to the change program.
this slide provides more granularity regarding our expectations for our reported adjusted-ebitda margin for the full-year 2021. for the first six months, total company adjusted-ebitda margin was 34.1%, and the big three segment's adjusted-ebitda margin was 40.5%. on an underlying basis, excluding change program cost, total company adjusted-ebitda margin was 35.7%. and as steve mentioned, we are increasing our full-year total company guidance for adjusted-ebitda margin to a range of 31% to 32%, and for the big three segments to approximately 39%.
and while first-half performance is impressive, we continue to recommend you assess our adjusted-ebitda margin on a full-year basis as we expect the margin to decline in the second half for several reasons. first, we expect to increase our investment in the change program, which will have a negative impact of between 150 to 200 basis points for the total company. second, we forecast additional business-as-usual investments outside of the change program in advance of 2022. for example, we will invest more in go-to-market initiatives, enterprise technology, and data and analytics capabilities.
this will dilute the margin between 150 and 200 basis points for the total company and between 200 and 250 basis points for the big three segments. and finally, savings from the change program are forecast to provide a benefit to total company and big three adjusted-ebitda margin of 100 to 150 basis points. we believe we have good visibility into the levers at our disposal to achieve our updated full-year margin guidance and are confident in our ability to achieve our target of 31% to 32%. now let me turn to our earnings per share, free cash flow performance, and change program cost.
starting with earnings per share. adjusted eps was $0.48 per share versus $0.44 per share in the prior-year period, a 9% increase. the increase was mainly driven by higher adjusted ebitda. currency had no impact on adjusted eps in the quarter.
let me now turn to our free cash flow performance for the first half. our reported free cash flow was 618 million versus 340 million in the prior-year period, an improvement of 278 million. consistent with previous quarters, this slide removes the distorting factors impacting free cash flow performance. working from the bottom of the page upwards, the cash outflows from discontinued operations component of our free cash flow was 36 million more than the prior-year period.
this was primarily due to payments to the u.k. tax authority related to the operations of our former refinitiv business. also in the first half, we made 28 million of change program payments, as compared to refinitiv-related separation cost of 76 million in the prior-year period. so if you adjust for these items, comparable free cash flow from continuing operations was 692 million, 311 million better than the prior-year period.
this increase is primarily due to higher ebitda, favorable working capital movements, and dividends from our interest in lseg. now an update on our change program costs for the second quarter and the rest of 2021. let me start by saying none of the annual estimates have changed from what we provided last quarter for the full year. spend during the second quarter was within the range provided last quarter at 71 million, including 41 million of opex plus $29 million of capex.
this brings the first-half total spend to 91 million. we now anticipate spending between 210 and 260 million in the second half, opex plus capex. spend is forecast to step up related to cloud migration, streamlining internal systems, third-party contractors to support the change program, and higher capital expenditures. for the full year, we expect change program spend, opex plus capex to be at the lower end of the range of 300 million to 350 million.
and there is no change in the anticipated split of about 60% opex and 40% capex. we will continue to provide quarterly updates on our change program spend as we move through the year. now an update on our run-rate change program savings for the second quarter. in the second quarter, we achieved 71 million of annual run-rate operating expense savings.
this brings the total annual run-rate operating expense savings up to 90 million for the change program. we are currently on track with our run-rate savings expectations. as a reminder, we anticipate operating expense savings of 600 million by 2023 while reinvesting 200 million back into the business for a net savings of 400 million. we will continue to provide quarterly updates on our annual run-rate change program savings as we move through the year.
and as steve outlined, today, we increased our full-year outlook for revenue growth, margin, and free cash flow, which is reflected on the slide. lastly, we reaffirmed the balance of our full-year 2021 guidance, as well as our 2022 and 2023 guidance previously provided and we remain confident in achieving the targets for all metrics. let me now turn it back to frank for questions.
frank golden -- head of investor relations
thank you, mike. and that concludes our presentation for the second quarter. so we would now like to open the lines for questions. so, sue, if we can have the first question please.
",2021-Q2,TRI
,,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] and our first question for today comes from the line of drew mcreynolds with rbc.
drew mcreynolds -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks very much. and good morning. so my two questions. first, great to hear you're tracking to the upper end of your growth guidance for next year.
so thank you for that data point. just wondering, in the current inflationary environment, could you just give us some context around how volume versus price dynamics are changing, if at all, as we move to the end of this year and into next? and then just as a follow-up. on the m&a environment, maybe steve, if you can provide us just with an update on kind of where things stand on that front and how you're balancing that with the buyback. thank you. 
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
drew, thanks for the questions. in regards to the inflationary and the volume price dynamics, we're not currently seeing much change. in regards to the pricing dynamics that we've discussed on prior calls, they remain very consistent throughout 2021. just as a reminder, a significant number of our customer contracts under multiyear agreements was about 60% in legal, 40% within corporates and 10% within our tax business there.
so something we're certainly keeping an eye on, drew, but no significant changes thus far on the price/volume dynamics there. i echo steve's comments earlier, we're seeing very, very strong, consistent performance for all of our sales and account management teams, which are driving the results. 
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes. and drew, it's steve. so in answer to your m&a question, as we've mentioned on prior quarterly calls, we have a pretty robust pipeline that we're constantly replenishing of opportunities really focused in and around our big 3. and we've spent the last quarter doing as we did the previous quarters, which is looking hard at a number of those targets.
and it's not the lack of trying that we haven't done any meaningful deals in 2021. i'd particularly call out scott nelson, who leads a lot of our m&a-related activities, for his thankless and hard work. the reason we haven't done it is we keep -- we hold the bar very high. we want to make sure that thomson reuters is the advantaged owner of any asset that we buy and that the business we buy is complementary to rather than complicating of the change program and additive to the customer experience.
as you know, prices are elevated. so that just keeps that bar even higher. now we're optimistic that as we continue to turn that -- turn the crank on that pipeline, the deals will come into view that makes sense for us. but we'll continue to be unapologetic if we don't do them.
we are very, very focused on the core business, the existing and new customers in the change program, and m&a will be secondary to that.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yes. drew, i would just supplement in regards to your question on m&a activity. if you look at capital strategy, overall, certainly, we're nearly complete the $1.2 billion buyback. question might be, would we consider additional buybacks in 2022? it's an option that we have.
also, as mentioned before, we discuss the annual dividend increase with our board every january. i would anticipate an increase as we go into 2022. we had a 7% dividend increase for 2021. it wouldn't surprise me if we're in the 10% range, which is the midpoint from our value-creation model for 2022 and beyond, which would certainly reflect our confidence in the free cash flow generation. 
drew mcreynolds -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
that's great color. thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of kevin mcveigh with credit suisse. 
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks so much and congratulations on a really just exceptional outcome given the change program and everything. it just really underscores the execution. hey, i guess this is, steve, for you -- or steve or mike.
within the context of the vc fund, and if i heard you right, steve, it sounds like the legal, you've got the highest growth in a decade. it seems like there's a little bit of a structural component to that. can you help us understand how much kind of maybe the retention improvement was associated with that as opposed to new products? and then can you tie in just any incremental comments on new product innovation? and how we should think about that longer-term growth within the context of the vc fund you just announced? 
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes. i'll start, kevin, and i'm sure mike will add. thanks for the word of congratulations. we're particularly appreciative of all of the hard work that our colleagues have put in this year and particularly in the third quarter.
in terms of legal, i think the thing that's pleasing is that, that sort of uplift in performance and a robust year to date is not reflective of any one particular subsegment in legal or any one particular product or price in favor of quantity or vice versa. i think it's a pretty balanced, diversified set of contributors. so the sentiment in small law, as an example, has really ticked up through the second and third quarters. so the smallest of our legal customers who are an important part of our business are starting to be more optimistic about the level of activity that they're seeing among their clients.
mid law continues to perform. and the largest law firms, of course, particularly those with diversified corporate finance-related practices, are enjoying a good year. so we're pretty optimistic about where that sits, and we think we can continue to continue that performance, as we said. as it pertains to new product innovation, this is a major area of focus for us at thomson reuters.
so you will remember that pretty early on in the going last year, after mike and i took our roles, we went out and we attracted david wong, who's our new chief product officer. david came from facebook. we elevated shawn malhotra as our fead of engineering. and they're both based with us in toronto in our tech center.
we also, under kirsty roth's leadership, have replenished and elevated some of the talent within our operations and technology function more broadly to make sure that we're building on a very, very solid foundation. the product that i talked about, which integrates practical law and contract express, highq, and elite 3e, is an example of that, and we have more to come. you'll see us, i think, be pretty modest in terms of our cadence of product innovations through 2022, but with a very aggressive aspiration thereafter to become the leader in terms of product innovation in the segments that we serve. and it's a really important part of the focus that we're putting on the company, and it is the primary focus.
and then the sort of the bolt-on m&a will be the secondary focus after that. 
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
kevin, i would just supplement. the entire portfolio of legal did really well in the third quarter. we've talked quite a bit about westlaw edge with 100 basis points of impact for us. and we'll continue to drive additional penetration with westlaw edge as we go into 2022.
we've already hit the 60% this year, which was our goal of 60% to 65%. practical law, elite, findlaw all did really well, as did our regions in asia, emerging markets and government. highq that we acquired in july of 2019 did well. so really solid performance.
i think you asked about retention, kevin, for the legal business. we're approaching 91%, which is a slight uptick versus 2020. so really good performance across the board for legal. 
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
i took enough time. congrats again and really just a fantastic outcome.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, kevin.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of toni kaplan from morgan stanley.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you. i wanted to ask another question about the venture capital fund that you started. are you viewing this as an m&a incubator or a way to keep sort of more on the ground with trends in the industry? or is this really just an interesting investment avenue for you and a way to sort of get innovation ideas? 
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yeah. hi, toni. i think it's a little bit of all of them. but i'd put more emphasis on opening and increasing our aperture to new innovations at the periphery of our core segments.
i think that, for me, is the biggest area of focus. as i said in response to kevin's question, we've got a real emphasis on being an organic builder of new product innovations to serve our customers in our core markets. that's a huge area of focus. and we view this as supplementary.
there's a fair amount of venture capital money going into, for example, legal workflow solutions and areas like risk, fraud, and compliance. and we want to make sure that as a company and as a group, we're very much keeping abreast of those and aware of those. and we can't think of a better way than to put some capital to work to make sure that we're continually getting smarter as to what's going on and benefiting from those innovations and allowing our customers to benefit from them. as to whether it leads to m&a down the track, i would certainly hope it does, but that's probably not the primary focus.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
terrific. wanted to ask also, last quarter, you had expected 3q to come in at 5% to 5.5% for the big 3. it came in at 6%, so that was a great result. i think you expected tax & accounting to be low single digit, and that came in ahead.
was there anything in particular that drove this strength? or were you trying to be conservative because of the difficult comp? just anything on sort of where the real strong outperformance came from versus what you had been thinking last quarter.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yes. toni, happy to start there. i think it really happened across the board. we just shared some comments with kevin in regards to legal, so i'll just focus on the corporates segment now.
we had a really strong performance from practical law. as a reminder, practical law comes in both legal professionals and corporates. the indirect tax business did well, as did clear. once again, clear is split between the government business and also corporates.
within tax & accounting, we had really strong performance, as steve mentioned, from our latin america businesses, specifically dominio, the tax business, and within elizabeth's business, audit solutions did really, really well. so we had really good momentum across the board, toni, from all of the segments, including print and reuters side. on the reuters events, we haven't done any physical events thus far through q3. we will have a physical event for reuters in -- or in person in q4.
so really good momentum across the board, toni. and retention is slightly increasing across all of our segments. i mentioned reuters earlier, but we're seeing a slight uptick also in corporates and tax & accounting for retention. 
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
thank you, toni. 
operator
and our next question comes from the line of george tong with goldman sachs. please proceed, george.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. thanks. good morning. with westlaw edge, acv penetration reached 60% in the quarter.
can you provide your updated thoughts on where you'd like to see penetration by year-end and longer term?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yes. george, two components there. i would say by year-end, we're looking at 63% to 65% for year-end 2021. over the time horizon, we think penetration will reach around 75%.
so additional runway as we go into -- throughout 2022. and by the time we reach the max penetration, we will have released westlaw edge 2.0. it's what we're referring to it internally there. so george, we're very confident we'll be able to sustain the 100 basis points lift that we're seeing from westlaw edge in recent quarters.
so we're very confident on westlaw edge and the next version.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. you're seeing progress in all seven investment areas of the change program. can you talk a bit about where in the change program you're seeing the most progress?
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes. george, look, i think as we laid out at investor day and beyond, we've got three components to the change program. the first is building a whole new set of capabilities in service of our customers, particularly in digital self-serve omnichannel. we have introduced the sort of first versions of those capabilities to some of our marquee products here in the united states.
and i would say that, that is on or a little bit ahead of track. but it's very modest in the context of the full product suite and all the geographies that we do business in. so i would say a good start, but much work to do. the second component of the change program, of course, is the modernization of our operations and technology stack.
we think that we can significantly enhance the customer experience by improving and making more contemporary to that tech stack. a big part of that, of course, is the migration of our revenues and our products to the cloud. we've set out an aspiration to get to well above 90% in 2023, the percent of revenues in the cloud. we're currently at about 35%, which is slightly ahead of where we thought we'd be.
so good progress, but still a long way to go. and then the third is really optimizing and rightsizing our organization, our organization structure and design and our location strategy. and there, i think we've made really good headway in 2021 so far. so we've put the sort of team fleet together.
we're, i think, executing at or slightly ahead of the plan on that one. so i think the impact is pretty evenly spread across those three big levers. and i would say the change program is on track or slightly ahead of where i thought it would be at this point. having said that, we have an awful lot of work to do through the back end of this year and throughout 2022 to build the kind of capabilities in service of our customers and to make our colleagues' working lives easier and more productive.
so good start, much to do.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
and george, i would just add one additional milestone in regards to our customer experience. we refer to it internally as our customer success platform account experience. we've got 85,000 customers on it as of today, and we're seeing a significant increase in the number of first-time ligands and also the number of self-service transactions. so that speaks really well for our customer experience journey.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst

our next question comes from the line of manav patnaik from barclays bank. please proceed, manav. 
manav patnaik -- barclays -- analyst
thank you. i was just hoping you could address the pricing environment. and perhaps just between the big 3 segments, how much of that growth is coming from price versus volume?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
sure, manav. i'll start with that. in regards to pricing, i mentioned earlier with drew's question, the pricing that we're seeing in 2021 thus far is very consistent with what we've seen in the last couple of years. i talked about the -- starting with tax & accounting professionals, we see approximately 5% as a directional viewpoint there.
corporates is around 3%, and legal is 2%. as i mentioned earlier, it can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year given the number of multiyear contracts that we have across the segments. but pricing, pretty consistent thus far this year, manav.
manav patnaik -- barclays -- analyst
ok. got it. and just competitively, any changes there particularly on the legal side, which i think has been the most competitive historically? or has westlaw edge and some of the other innovations kind of widened that gap even more now?
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
so a couple of comments, manav, from me. i would say, first and foremost, we're very focused, as i said earlier, on our own product innovation road map. we're happy with what westlaw edge has been able to do for our customers. we're happy with the acv penetration that we've driven that to date and where we can take it for the rest of the year and beyond.
we're very focused on the next generations of that product and of others. highly respectful of our competitors, but i don't think at the moment we're seeing anything notable in terms of changing level of competitive intensity.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of andrew steinerman with j.p. morgan. please proceed. 
andrew steinerman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. i just wanted to make sure i understood the fourth quarter implied guidance. obviously, i heard your comments about continued momentum that's built in the year into fourth quarter. i think when you do the math, you get somewhere around 4.3% organic revenue growth to make that full year of 4.5% to 5% for the year, that's total company.
could you just go over that dynamic versus the 5% that you just reported? it just -- it does seem like a touch of deceleration. and as you answer the question, maybe also touch on kind of recent trends in net sales to give us a sense of forward momentum.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
sure, andrew. in regards to net sales, momentum has been good across the board. as a reminder, q4 is our largest quota period. about 30% of our quota occurs in q4, and that splits by month, about 30% october, 30% november, 40% december, which is one of the reasons why we're waiting until february to update our '22, '23 guidance.
at that point, we would have full visibility into the net sales and book of business there. in regards to q4, andrew, i think the momentum continues. certainly, the year-over-year comps comes into play there to some degree given the covid impact. but i think overall, we feel good about the momentum across the board for all of the segments as we head into q4.
but it is the highest quota period for us.
andrew steinerman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of aravinda galappatthige with canaccord genuity.
aravinda galappatthige -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the results so far. two for me. the first, just to kind of follow up on the question around competitive reaction or competitive backdrop.
can you just generally comment about when you look at that element, are you sort of more concerned about sort of the incumbents, the larger players you've been sort of competing with? or is it more the sort of the smallest software start-ups that may be coming up with sort of more maybe fancy and innovative workflow solutions? i mean can you maybe just talk about that landscape a little bit? and then secondly, for mike, can you just remind us about the u.k. tax dispute, where things stand? i know that originally, we were expecting an outflow in q3 on account of that. thank you. 
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes, aravinda, thanks. it's steve. i'll start and then -- with the competitive question, and perhaps mike can take the u.k. tax question.
so we are very focused on both. as i said, the primary focus is on our own product road map and just getting better and better at understanding and predicting, meeting, and exceeding our customers' needs. that's the primary focus. however, very, very respectful of the competitors in our core segments that have been with us for years and also the new and emerging, particularly sort of vc and private equity-funded software players, i wouldn't put -- communicate to you it'd be greater emphasis on one than the other.
we're respectful of both. we watch carefully what they do and the kinds of new innovations that they're driving. i think the picture probably varies a little bit as you move outside of the united states, where there does seem to be a little bit more activity among the new start-ups and software-oriented players relative to sort of some of the larger incumbent players. but it's really a pretty consistent picture and quite balanced across both. 
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
in regards to the u.k. tax dispute, we did make a payment in q1 of 2021, and we made the second payment in q3. so those payments for 2021 are behind us. the majority of those payments are reflected on our balance sheet as a long-term receivable.
it was our intent and believe that we will recover those over the time horizon.
aravinda galappatthige -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of paul steep with scotiabank. please proceed. 
paul steep -- scotiabank-analyst
morning. steve, could you give us maybe a sense of where you'd see opportunity to broaden out the platform in the big 3 verticals? and the second part that maybe ties to it is give us a sense of where you're at on the product rationalization journey as a move toward more of a platform. we've noted that you've, obviously, given end-of-life notices on products like ediscovery point and others. and then just final one.
can you recap that cloud transition comment as well? i think i heard you say 90%, up from 35%. thanks. 
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes, sure. thanks, paul. so we see plentiful opportunities to expand within each of the big 3. just a couple of quick examples.
i gave the example in my prepared remarks about the extension of highq and the integration of highq with practical law and contract express and elite 3e. we are just scratching the surface in terms of our presence in legal workflow software and our ability to integrate that software with our flagship research products. i really think we're just scratching the surface, and we're excited by what we see with highq and how we've been able to enhance and grow highq very significantly over the last year or two. so that looks like an acquisition that we made where we've been able to sort of really take it to a different place relative to where it was prior to thomson reuters' ownership.
in tax & accounting, we're seeing significant growth in audit on the back of the confirmation acquisition. so that's, i think, one example in tax & accounting where we see some opportunity. i think the other area in tax & accounting is international. we're heavily u.s.-focused on tax & accounting.
i think that's an industry and a customer need that is truly global. and so we'd like to think that there's some lots of runway internationally. and then in corporates, this is our sort of, in a sense, our newest business unit. and we've sort of put the pieces in place under sunil pandita's leadership, and we're starting to see that pick up.
so 4% for the first half and then 6% for the third quarter. so signs of good vibrancy in corporates. and there are many areas of opportunity there, including areas like indirect tax and global trade. the one that i'd really point to though is in risk, fraud and compliance.
our risk franchises of clear and trss under steve rubley's leadership are very government-focused. and we're proud of that -- of those businesses and particularly proud of what steve and his team have been able to do. but in addition to that, we think that our ability to provide risk, fraud, and compliance solutions, they're highly sensitive, it's quite unique. and we're excited about exploring that further in the corporates segment going forward.
so that's the first part of your question. on product rationalization, i think we're making good progress, but we've got a long way to go. as a result of many, many acquisitions over the years, we do have, i think, a fairly long tail of products that we can and will rationalize. from a financial perspective, they're not particularly significant in terms of their importance to our financial profile.
but the more we rationalize, the simpler we become, and obviously, the less complex our operations and technology challenges become. and i think that's a very important part of the journey that we're on. just to clarify on that cloud, thirdly and lastly, my cloud conversion comment. so we're making a transition whereby in 2023, by the end of 2023, we'll have over 90% of our revenues in the public cloud.
and so that's the journey we're on. we're currently at 35%, which is slightly ahead of where we expected to be at the end of the third quarter 2021. so happy with that journey progressing well and optimistic that we'll get to exactly where we want to get. 
operator
thank you. our last question comes from the line of douglas arthur with huber. please proceed. 
douglas arthur -- huber research partners -- analyst
yeah. thank you. mike, you mentioned in, i guess, slide 8, the benefit you got from the events business even though it was still virtual coming back. and you've also called out a couple of some strong growth in some international markets.
i'm just wondering, when you look at year-over-year growth, q3, the covid quarter still covered last year, is there any way to sort of normalize the organic growth for some of the covid comps that you had a year ago? or is that not relevant in the third quarter?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
let me break it down, doug, in a few vectors there. in regards to the reuters events business, our revenue in 2021 is currently forecasted to double our revenue in 2020. so when you think about normalizing 2021, 2020 with covid, there are two key items that i would focus on: first one being the reuters events, as i just mentioned; and the second one would be global print. global print was certainly impacted in 2020 given the number of office closures we had for our print and, obviously, the physical shipments there.
very pleased with the progress that jennifer prescott, ryan kessler had driven this year with the print business. but those would be the two key items to focus on, doug, from a normal -- we call it normalization. certainly, the transactional revenue comes into play, but the reuters events and print would be the two larger ones. you asked about the international businesses.
we refer to them as our regions within the company. latin america, another quarter of 20% growth, led by adrian fognini. and then asia and emerging markets led by jackie rhodes, about 20% for latin america, and 10% for aem, doug. 
frank golden -- head of investor relations
that will be our final question. we'd like to thank you all for joining us for our third quarter results. please feel free to follow up with us. and we look forward to speaking to you in february when we report our q4 results.

good day, and welcome to the q3 2021 earnings call. my name is joanne, and i'm your event manager. [operator instructions] i'd like to advise all parties, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. and now i'd like to hand over to frank golden, head of investor relations.
please proceed.
frank golden -- head of investor relations
thank you. good morning, and thank you all for joining us today for our third quarter 2021 earnings call. i'm joined today by our ceo, steve hasker, and our cfo, mike eastwood. each of whom will report our results and will take your questions following our presentation.
[operator instructions] throughout today's presentation, when we compare performance period on period, we discuss revenue growth rates before currency as well as on an organic basis. we believe this provides the best basis to measure the underlying performance of the business. today's presentation contains forward-looking statements and non-ifrs financial measures. actual results may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties related to the covid pandemic and other risks discussed in reports and filings that we provide from time to time to regulatory agencies.
you may access these documents on our website or by contacting our investor relations department. let me now turn it over to steve hasker. 
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
thank you, frank, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. i'm pleased to report the momentum we saw in the first half of the year continued in the third quarter. our revenue and sales performance was strong, exceeded our expectations and position us well for q4 and 2022. we expect to close out the year on a strong footing and appreciate the efforts of our sales and our go-to-market teams.
this strong performance demonstrates our markets remain healthy and growing. and our products across legal, tax, corporates and risk, fraud, and compliance fit the needs of our customers. our products enable them to effectively equip their professionals to better serve their clients. we're also seeing improving customer engagement, including 8,000 registrations for our annual legal, tax and corporates synergy conferences around the world.
these conferences are our premier events for professionals who want to understand the future of their professions, learn the latest trends, and experience how tools and data-driven technology can transform their firms, organizations, agencies, and roles. our leadership team, including the president of our corporates business, sunil pandita; and the president of our tax & accounting professionals business, elizabeth beastrom, will be joining nearly 2,000 of our customers for the upcoming synergy conferences in november in nashville. and as i mentioned last quarter, our customers continue to exhibit confidence in both an improving economic environment and in their own prospects. this potent ecosystem plays to our advantage, and we will continue to capitalize on the opportunities we are seeing to drive growth and expand our positions.
now to the results. our third quarter results reflected a standout performance. four of our five business segments recorded organic revenue growth of 6%. that performance resulted in total company organic revenue growth of 5%, putting us well above the 3.5% to 4% third quarter guidance provided in august.
our healthy markets are providing us with a tailwind. that tailwind, coupled with our nine-month results, give us confidence in our prospects for the fourth quarter. as a result, we've once again raised our full year revenue and free cash flow guidance. full year total company organic revenue growth is now forecast to be between 4.5% and 5% and approximately 6% for the big 3 businesses.
free cash flow for the year is now forecast to be approximately $1.2 billion. turning to our change program. we're making consistent progress as we work through -- as we work toward becoming an integrated operating company. as of september 30, we recorded run rate savings of about $130 million, putting us on a path to achieve $200 million by year end.
i'll remind you, our aggregate savings target is $600 million by the end of 2023, $200 million of which we plan to reinvest in the business. finally, we were active during the quarter executing on the $1.2 billion share buyback program we announced in august. we've already bought back $1.1 billion of stock, and we expect to complete the program before year end. so given the progress we're making, we also reaffirmed our guidance for 2022 and 2023.
now to the results for the quarter. third quarter reported revenues were up 6%, with organic revenues up 5%, thanks to strong results from the big 3 businesses and reuters. contributing to this performance was strong organic growth of more than 20% from our latin american businesses and nearly 10% growth from our asia and emerging markets businesses. adjusted ebitda declined 7% to $458 million due to costs related to the change program, resulting in a margin of 30%.
excluding change program costs, adjusted ebitda margin was 33.5%. adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.46, compared to $0.39 per share in the prior-year period. turning to the results by segment. the big 3 businesses achieved organic revenue growth of 6% for the quarter.
legal's third quarter performance was again strong with organic revenue growth of 6%. this was legal's second consecutive quarter of 6% growth, its highest quarterly growth rate in over a decade. the u.s. legal market continues to be very healthy across the board for small, mid, and large-sized firms, as well as for government and across geographies.
for example, westlaw edge continues to achieve strong sales growth and ended the quarter with an annual contract value or acv penetration of 60%, achieving our full year acv penetration guidance. second, practical law, as reported in the legal segment, continues its strong performance, again growing double digits. we forecast similar growth in 2022 and continue to invest in this key legal workflow initiative. third, our government business, which is managed within our legal segment, continues to perform and grew 10% organically.
and fourth, findlaw grew over 10%, and our legal businesses in canada, europe and asia all grew mid-single-digit in the quarter. legal again achieved strong sales for both the quarter and nine-month periods, recording double-digit recurring sales growth, reflecting customers' willingness and ability to invest in productivity-enhancing products. turning to the corporates business. organic revenue growth increased to 6% from 4% in the first half of the year.
this improvement came from increasing demand from customers for our legal, tax, and risk products. and in tax & accounting, organic revenue growth of 6% was stronger than expected, thanks to our audit solutions products and a strong performance by our latin american tax business, which is called dominio, which grew more than 20%. reuters news organic revenues also increased 6%, the second consecutive quarter of 6% growth. this was driven by the professional business, which includes reuters events, which grew over 60% and continues to recover from the negative impact of covid-19 in 2020.
finally, global print organic revenues declined 5%, less than expected, due to a continued gradual return to office by our customers and higher third-party print revenues. in summary, it was another strong quarter, but we're taking nothing for granted. we continue to invest in the businesses to enable us to further support our customers and properly position us for 2022 and beyond. we still have much work to do in executing our change program, and we've assembled a talented team over the past 18 months who are working well together and clearly understand our goals and our timelines.
i'm very pleased with our progress to date. one additional comment regarding growth. as you can see on this slide, momentum has been building for our big 3 businesses over the past 11 quarters, which we believe will continue in the fourth quarter and into next year. i know many investors have historically viewed our markets as slower growing and have perceived our legal and tax businesses in particular as low single-digit growers.
we firmly believe that's not the case and, in fact, think that with successful execution of the change program, combined with appropriate investments, we can improve growth on a sustainable basis. our markets are broad and dynamic and we have strong positions in the right subsegments. also, we have numerous levers to pull across our businesses. and we're investing in our strategic seven initiatives, which are performing well, and we expect they will continue to do so.
this confluence of factors places us in a position where we believe we can grow mid-single digit on a consistent basis over the cycle. these factors position us well to achieve the upper end of the range of our 2022 revenue guidance of 4% to 5%. we'll discuss our 2022 guidance further when we report our fourth quarter and full year results in february. let me share an example of products that we believe will contribute to sustainable mid-single-digit revenue growth that i just referred to.
first, you'll recall at our investor day, i discussed our goal of becoming a content-driven technology company, which includes excelling at product innovation and successfully integrating our products to provide customers with a seamless offering while delivering an excellent customer experience. we expect this will further improve the customer loyalty and increase retention as we continually enhance our products, adding to organic growth. and at investor day, i highlighted seven strategic priorities reflected on this slide. those include several of our legal workflow solutions: highq, practical law and contract express.
last month, we released the latest version of highq. this release features key integrations with practical law, contract express, elite 3e and microsoft teams and includes more than 50 enhancements and upgrades. it's an example of an integrated workflow solution that customers are asking for. it helps legal professionals and other corporate professionals working with the legal team to identify their work and improve client satisfaction.
this leverages contract express to automate and improve documents. it enables lawyers to structure matters with practical law. and it integrates elite 3e data with highq visualization tools to provide greater transparency around client spend and work in progress. this is truly an integrated legal workflow solution and an example of content-driven technology.
today, these four legal products are growing double digit, comprising over 10% of total company revenue and are contributing to the improving growth in both our legal and corporates segments. highq is just one example of how we're building holistic solutions for our customers through greater product innovation and integration. i expect to share more such examples of product innovation with you in the coming quarters. one final example of how we're driving innovation before i turn it over to mike.
two weeks ago, we announced the establishment of a $100 million corporate venture capital fund focused on the future of professionals. thomson reuters ventures will continue -- will concentrate on investments and portfolio support for companies building breakthrough innovations that will allow professionals to operate more productively and with greater insights. it will focus across the legal, tax and accounting, risk, fraud, and compliance, and news and media markets to identify and support innovative companies to help our customers deliver more to their clients. the fund will be overseen by our chief strategy officer, pat wilburn.
it's an example of how we're thinking about driving more innovation across the company and seeking new opportunities to further strengthen our businesses. now let me turn it over to mike for more detail on the results for the quarter. 
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
thank you, steve, and thanks for joining us today. as a reminder, i will talk to revenue growth before currency and on an organic basis. let me start by discussing the third quarter revenue performance of our big 3 segments. organic revenues and revenues at constant currency were both up 6% for the quarter.
this marks the fifth consecutive quarter our big 3 segments have grown at least 5%. legal professionals total and organic revenues increased 6% in the third quarter. recurring organic revenue grew 6%. and transaction revenues increased 10% related to our elite, findlaw and government businesses.
westlaw edge added about 100 basis points to legal's organic growth rate, is maintaining a healthy premium and is expected to continue to contribute at a similar level going forward. our government business, which is reported within legal and includes much of our risk, fraud, and compliance businesses, had a strong quarter, with total revenue growth of 11% and organic growth of 10%. in our corporates segment, total and organic revenues increased 6% due to recurring organic revenue growth of 7% and transactions organic revenue growth of 2%. recurring revenue was driven by practical law, indirect tax and clear, as well as our businesses in latin america and asia and emerging markets.
and finally, tax & accounting's total and organic revenues grew 6%, driven by 10% recurring organic revenue growth. growth was driven by the latin america businesses and audit solutions, which includes confirmation. transactions organic revenue declined 9%, resulting from the year-over-year timing of individual tax filing deadlines. i will remind you, last year, paper return revenue shifted from the second quarter to the third quarter.
normalizing for this timing, organic revenues for tax & accounting were up 11% in q3. moving to reuters news. third quarter performance was strong, achieving total and organic revenue growth of 6%, primarily due to the agency business and professional business, which includes reuters events. in global print, total and organic revenues declined 5%, at the lower end of the range we had forecast of minus 5% to minus 8%.
we expect full year global print revenue to decline between 4% and 6%. on a consolidated basis, third quarter total and organic revenues each increased 5%. before turning to profitability, let's look closer at recurring and transaction revenue results for the third quarter. starting on the left side, total company organic revenue for the third quarter of 2021 was up 5% compared to 2% in the third quarter of 2020 due to the impact of covid.
if we look at q3 2021 performance for the big 3, you will see organic revenues increased 6% compared to 5% in the same period last year. total company recurring organic revenues grew 6% in q3, 230 basis points above q3 2020. and the big 3 recurring organic revenues grew 7%, which was above last year's third quarter growth of 5%. turning to the graph in the bottom right of the slide.
transaction revenues were up 8%, as the third quarter of 2020 was impacted by covid, which affected our implementation services and the reuters events business. we continue to remain encouraged by our momentum in 2021, especially for recurring revenues. this gives us confidence in the trajectory of the business and sustainability beyond 2021. as previously stated by steve, we have increased our full year revenue guidance.
starting with the total tr chart on the top left, we now estimate full year total and organic revenues will grow between 4.5% and 5%. this is an increase from the previous guidance of 4% to 4.5%. the big 3 total and organic revenues are now forecast to grow approximately 6% for the full year, up from the previous guidance of 5.5% to 6%. moving to reuters news.
we forecast full year total and organic revenues to grow between 3% and 5%, driven mainly by our reuters professional business. this is an increase from the previous guidance of 2% to 3%. finally, global print full year revenues are expected to decline between 4% and 6%, an improvement from our previous guidance of a 4% to 7% decline. turning to our profitability performance in the third quarter.
adjusted ebitda for the big 3 segments was $468 million, up 7% from the prior-year period. the strong ebitda growth for each of the three businesses was driven by higher revenue growth and a benefit from 2020 cost-savings initiatives, offset by incremental business-as-usual investments in advance of 2022. as discussed in the second quarter, we are investing more in go-to-market initiatives, enterprise technology, and data and analytics capabilities in the second half of 2021, with a greater concentration of spend in q4. i will remind you, the change program operating costs are recorded at the corporate level.
moving to reuters news. adjusted ebitda was $25 million, $2 million more than the prior-year period, driven by revenue growth. global print adjusted ebitda was $52 million with a margin of 35%, a decline of about 600 basis points due to the decrease in revenues and the dilutive impact of lower margin third-party print revenue. so in aggregate, total company adjusted ebitda was $458 million, a 7% decrease versus q3 2020.
excluding costs related to the change program, adjusted ebitda increased 4%. the third quarter's adjusted ebitda margin was 30% and was 33.5% on an underlying basis, excluding costs related to the change program. now let me turn to our earnings per share, free cash flow performance, and change program cost. starting with earnings per share, adjusted eps was $0.46 per share versus $0.39 per share in the prior-year period, an 18% increase.
the increase was primarily driven by a decrease in depreciation and amortization and lower income taxes, partially offset by lower adjusted ebitda. for the full year, we have decreased our tax rate guidance to between 14% and 16% due to favorable results from the settlement of prior tax years in various jurisdictions. currency had a $0.01 positive impact on adjusted eps in the quarter. let me now turn to our free cash flow performance for the first nine months.
our reported free cash flow was $1 billion versus $881 million in the prior-year period, an improvement of $120 million. consistent with previous quarters, this slide removes the distorting factors impacting free cash flow performance. working from the bottom of the slide upwards, the cash outflows from the discontinued operations component of our free cash flow was $59 million more than the prior-year period. this was primarily due to payments to the u.k.
tax authority related to our former refinitiv business. in the first nine months, we made $94 million of change program payments as compared to refinitiv-related separation cost of $87 million in the prior-year period. so if you adjust for these items, comparable free cash flow from continuing operations was just shy of $1.2 billion, $327 million better than the prior-year period. this increase was primarily due to higher ebitda, favorable working capital movements, and dividends from our interest in lseg.
now an update on our change program run rate savings. in the third quarter, we achieved $42 million of annual run rate operating expense savings. this brings the cumulative annual run rate operating expense savings up to $132 million for the change program. we are forecasting to achieve $200 million of cumulative annual run rate operating expense savings by the end of this year.
as a reminder, we anticipate operating expense savings of $600 million by 2023 while reinvesting $200 million back into the business or net savings of $400 million. achieving $200 million of operating expense savings by the end of 2021 would put us a third of the way toward our goal of $600 million of gross savings by 2023. we will continue to provide quarterly updates on run rate change program savings. now an update on our change program cost for the third quarter and the rest of 2021.
spend during the third quarter was $79 million, which included $53 million of opex and $26 million of capex. total spend in the first nine months of the year was $170 million. we now anticipate opex and capex spending between $120 million and $150 million in the fourth quarter. spend is forecast to step up related to cloud migration, streamlining internal systems, third-party contractors to support the change program and higher capital expenditures.
for the full year, we now expect change program opex and capex spend to be between $290 million and $320 million. this is slightly lower than the previous guidance range of $300 million to $350 million. we expect the lower spend in 2021 to carry over into 2022 as we are still expecting to incur approximately $600 million over the course of the program. we will provide formal guidance on change program spend for 2022 when we report our fourth quarter results in february.
there is no change in the anticipated split of about 60% opex and 40% capex. we will continue to provide quarterly updates on our change program spend. and as steve outlined, today, we increased our full year outlook for total tr and big 3 revenue growth. we also increased our full year free cash flow guidance to approximately $1.2 billion.
additionally, we have slightly lowered our guidance on change program spend for both opex and capex for 2021 and carry that underspend over to 2022. we have also decreased our effective tax rate outlook, both of which are reflected on this slide. lastly, we reaffirm the balance of our full year 2021 guidance as well as our 2022 and 2023 guidance previously provided. and we remain confident in achieving the targets for all metrics.
let me now turn it back to frank for questions.
frank golden -- head of investor relations
thank you, mike and steve. that concludes our formal remarks on our third quarter results. and we'd like to open the call now for questions. so if we could have the first question, operator, please? 
",2021-Q3,TRI

operator
so your first question is from the line of drew mcreynolds of rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
drew mcreynolds -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yeah, thanks. thank you very much, and good morning. and frank, i want to wish you all the best. you've been just great to work with over the years.
so all the best. and of course, welcome, gary, as well. just with respect to the 2022 and 2023 outlook, maybe a question for you, steve. obviously, coming off a upwardly revised 2021, so good to see the upwardly revised on the upwardly revised.
just wondering from your perspective, if you go back a year from now, you provided 2021 guidance and you upwardly revised through the year. is it kind of a similar setup here when you look at 2022? because it certainly sounds like the net sales environment is still quite strong. and of course, you have very good visibility on how that flows through. and then just a second quick question for you, i guess, mike, just on the buyback, just your latest thinking there, good to see the buyback in q4.
just wondering what your thoughts are for 2022. thank you.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
thanks, drew. but you're right. net sales performance is strong, it's building momentum, and it's giving us confidence. and you're also correct in sort of pointing to the visibility that that provides us into our business.
so as i said in my remarks, we're entering 2022 with real confidence. we've also got a lot of work to do. so we're halfway through the change program. we are on track for all work streams, ahead with a couple of work streams.
but we're yet to really see it translate to the customer experience. and, of course, we're still navigating virtual and hybrid working environments and entering the third year of pandemic. so we believe that the change program is going to gen up thomson reuters with the capabilities required to provide a fundamentally improved customer experience. and that will fuel our growth.
and we're very excited about that future. but we're also contending with a number of the macro challenges. and as i said, i'll hand over to mike for the buyback question.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
drew, in regard to the buyback, i'll start, we're certainly in a highly advantaged position because of the strength of our balance sheet. as you mentioned, we completed the $1.2 billion buyback in q4 of 2021. our focus currently today is certainly completing the change program in 2022 by continuing to accelerate our organic growth on a sustained basis. and we'd like to use our capital capacity to further accelerate or supplement our organic growth.
so as we look at 2022, drew, we're looking to put the capital to work in regards to acquisitions to supplement our growth. buybacks are currently not contemplated at this point. certainly, we have a lot of flexibility and options. but we'll remain focused on accelerating our growth via acquisitions.
drew mcreynolds -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
understood. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. and your next question is from the line of vince valentini of td securities. please go ahead.
vince valentini -- td securities -- analyst
thanks very much. my congrats to frank as well, and all the best to you. the stock...
frank golden -- head of investor relations
thank you, vince.
vince valentini -- td securities -- analyst
you're welcome. your stock is up like 4% to 5% today, which may surprise you. it surprises me a little bit, given the strength of the revenue and the increased guidance. i think there may be a bit of concern about these extra costs in the fourth quarter.
so mike, i'm hoping you can flesh that in a bit more detail. both the extra compensation costs you talk about, is this some sort of one-off? or is this a new run rate? and then the $25 million, i'm not sure i fully get it. it's not part of the change program, but it's related to go-forward improvements in sort of sales and service capabilities. and technically, was that in the corporate line? or was that spread across the other three or five divisions?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yeah. vince, multiple good points there. let me just break those down one by one. and if i miss one, keep me honest here, vince, as we go through.
let me start with the performance bonus expense, vince. that relates to our 2021 annual incentive plan, upon which there are three levers equally weighted: organic revenue, book of business, and cash oi, which is ebitda less capital expenditures. if you go back a year ago, our organic growth rate guidance was 3% to 4%. we ended at 5.2%.
our free cash flow, which is a key lever for our long-term incentive, that target was $1 billion to $1.1 billion. we ended up at $1.3 billion. so if you look at our performance bonus expense for full year 2021, that diluted our full year margin by about 100 basis points. so that's truly a result, vince, as a result of our performance in 2021, whereby we exceeded our management plan, which governs our annual incentive plan and also governs our long-term incentive plan.
so that's truly based on the results that we incurred in 2021. second point, in regards to the change program, we still remain committed to investing $600 million in aggregate for 2021 and 2022. we spent less in 2021 than originally forecasted. that favorability will shift to 2022 to ensure that we do as much as we can to continue to improve the underlying customer experience, which should accelerate our organic growth.
thirdly, in regards to the $25 million, that was truly opportunistic on our part. vince, we, in partnership with brian peccarelli and our segment leaders -- and by the way, this $25 million is within our respective segments and functions, it's not part of corporate. we viewed it as an opportunity to start 2022 strong. we didn't have to do it.
but it enabled us to invest more in our sales resources, our marketing resources. and also with david wong, our chief product officer, shawn malhotra, who leads engineering, and also with kirsty roth, glenda crisp on the data and analytics. so the additional investment, vince, in q4 was truly discretionary, was very optimistic in our standpoint to help us continue our momentum and progress in 2022. i, from my perspective, vince, am not concerned about that.
i think there's too much of a pivot. we have a clear line of sight to achieving our 2022 ebitda margin of approximately 35%. and also, we have equal confidence in achieving our 2023 ebitda margin of 39% to 40%. there certainly has been a hell of a lot of focus on us accelerating our organic growth.
we did that in q4. we had an opportunity to do investments to sustain that growth, and not apologetic.
vince valentini -- td securities -- analyst
thanks for that. actually, can i just clarify? on the compensation impact of 100 basis points, is that a bit of a timing issue because the targets weren't fully met in 2020 for reasons that may have been beyond management's control? but are you sort of snapping back to a full year of all those performance bonuses being paid? so if i look forward to '22, even if you meet all your targets, it won't be another 100 basis point drag, it will be more of a plateau?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
that's correct, vince. 2021 is more a plateau there. and we will get back more to that traditional in 2022. make sure, vince, that i addressed all your points.
vince valentini -- td securities -- analyst
i think you did.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
ok. great.
operator
thank you. and your next question is from the line of toni kaplan of morgan stanley. please go ahead.
greg parrish -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey. this is greg parrish on for tony. just wanted to get your thoughts on the legal market going into '22. demand seems strong but some wage inflation at law firms.
how are you seeing the puts and takes there? i guess, on one side, you're helping them manage cost. i think you called out elite as doing well in the quarter. but maybe there's some pressure, just wanted to get your thoughts there. thanks.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
there is indeed pressure. we're seeing across our legal customer base, the more firms move in, the largest global firms or mid-tier or smaller, sole practitioners, there's inflationary pressure across. but for us, this is a catalyst for providing additional value to our customers and future growth. and let me explain why.
our tools improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the existing legal staff. and i think it's fair to say the single biggest pressure that the law firms face is that wage inflation. and the second biggest is burnout of lawyers. and our tools enable them to get more productivity and more output from the existing staff and enable the burnout to be managed.
and there just aren't many ways to do that. and that's -- we're starting to see that increased demand to come through for our tools, particularly tools like highq and practical law and particularly the integrations that we pointed to last quarter between highq, tracker, elite 3e. so a long way of saying this is a positive trend for us. and if we continue to innovate around our product sets provided for law firms, we'll see a significant advantage from it.
greg parrish -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's great color. thank you. and then just a quick follow-up and just stick with legal, so edge 2.0, if you can give any color on sort of what the go-to-market strategy is going to be. is it going to be -- is it going to replace 1.0? is it going to be modular? and then also 1.0 has been pretty consistent, 100 basis points uplift to growth.
i mean, do you have sort of any expectations going forward? if you could just help us kind of walk through what the edge momentum and sort of life going forward will be. thanks.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yeah. i'll just do a special call out to david wong, andy martens, mike dahn, who have been leading edge, and now edge 2.0. as we go into 2022, we expect the penetration for the acv, as we mentioned, 65% at the end of '21. that increases to 75% based on our forecast as we go through 2022.
we plan to launch edge 2.0 in the second half of this year. so we believe the 100 basis points of organic growth lift that we've now been incurring for several quarters and years, that continues throughout '22 and '23. we have no concern with that. i hope you can respect, we're a little early to expand too much from a competitive standpoint on 2.0 at this time.
i would anticipate, at the second half of the year, paul fischer, our president of legal professionals, will provide a host of external events to expand more on 2.0. but i am headed there tomorrow with steve to spend some time with the group. but a short closing comment there would be we are very optimistic on our ability to sustain legal's organic growth. as i mentioned in the prepared remarks, back in a year ago, we said in 2023, we estimated 5% to 6%.
we have now increased that range to 5% to 7%. and that's based on close partnership with paul fischer and his legal team, along with steve rubley, who runs the government business.
greg parrish -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you very much and all the best to frank.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from andrew steinerman, j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
stephanie yee -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. good morning. this is stephanie yee sitting in for andrew. just had a question on the margin trajectory, i guess, from 31% in 2021 to 35% in 2022.
it looks like you'll already be at kind of that 35% level in the first quarter. and i know you talked about a lot of different drivers. but i just wanted to get a little bit more color on what that step-up -- what's driving that step-up? because as we look to 2023, it looks like the margin that from '22 to '23 is really just taking out the change cost. the 470-basis-point drag in the fourth quarter, you're still investing in '22.
so '23, we don't have those costs anymore. so kind of that step-up from '22 to '23 is, i feel, like more visible. so if you can just kind of comment on kind of going to 35% in the next year in the first quarter. thank you.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yeah. stephanie, let me approach it from two vectors. first, from a reported, as you mentioned, 2021, that focus on reported ebitda with the change program, it goes 31%, 35% and then 39% to 40%. on an underlying basis in 2021, with 33.9%, approximately 37.5% up to the 39% to 40%.
if you look at the increase in 2022, a key component, stephanie, is the continued acceleration in achieving the annual run rate operating expense savings from the change program. we ended 2021 at $217 million. we will approach $500 million by the end of 2022. so we will get margin expansion in 2022 as we ramp up the operating savings, led by kirsty roth, andrew pearce, and the change program.
second component that i would mention there, stephanie, is the operating leverage, given that about 65% of our costs are fixed in nature. as our revenue continues to sustain and accelerate, given that operating leverage, we'll get additional flow through there. so those are two of the key drivers, stephanie, for both '22 and '23. part of the question there on '23, stephanie, as a reminder, of the $600 million of operating expense savings, which we're confident we will achieve, we will begin to reinvest a portion of those in 2023 to help us accelerate growth beyond '23.
stephanie yee -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. great. that's super helpful. and if i can just ask a follow-up question, so you guys talked about additional interest in m&a this year.
is legal contract management solutions an area that thomson might be interested in pursuing?
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
stephanie, we look at a number of areas that are core to the big 3 segments and additive to the change program and additive to our playbook of becoming the leading content-driven technology company. so certainly, the tools and solutions that improve the workflow within our legal customers, whether that's a law firm or a general counsel are in that solution space. and that would certainly include the contract life cycle management, among a number of other things, yes.
stephanie yee -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok, great. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. your next question is from the line of paul steep, scotiabank. please go ahead.
paul steep -- scotiabank -- analyst
great. good morning. congratulations, frank. welcome, gary.
steve, could you just give maybe a higher-level view of m&a? there's more discussion around it in terms of the approach. should we think of it more as a pondera, netmaster-like? or is thse larger acquisitions you're thinking of more transformative? or are you thinking more incremental technologies to drive growth? and then i've got one quick follow-up.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
thanks, paul. i would say, it will be very focused on the big 3 and it will be more additive or incremental in nature than transformative. but by way of backdrop, we -- mike and i took these roles at the start of 2020. we spent 2020 studying the business and with our colleagues, new and preexisting, on the change program.
last year was all about the change program execution. and here we are halfway through. we're building confidence in that program and in our abilities as a team. and we're very focused this year on finishing the change program, and we will not get distracted.
because that's the key to a better customer experience and that's the key to accelerating organic growth. having said that, there's a couple of things in our favor. our confidence is building. our underlying capabilities are improving.
and our capital position continues to strengthen. and perhaps even later this year, valuations may be a little bit more reasonable, who knows? that's very -- that last part is hard to predict, and we're certainly not going to bank on that. but i would say we don't need transformational acquisitions. what we're looking for is acquisitions where we are an advantaged owner, that are additive to the change program or accelerants to the change program and help us provide a better customer experience to our existing customers and provide access to new customers.
that's the laser-like focus. and we'll continue that focus through this year.
paul steep -- scotiabank -- analyst
great. and then the follow-up would just be could you remind us a little bit on the size of the grc business today and maybe the opportunity set that it's looking at in terms of growth potential relative to the rest of the group, obviously, reflecting it's off a smaller base?
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yeah. our grc business is around about $500 million, gross circa double digits. and it's, today, very government-focused under steve rubley's leadership, and steve do a great team. and just as a reminder -- do a great job.
just a reminder, there is the clear asset, which is a unique risk, fraud and compliance data set. there is the thomson reuters special services elite analysts, who have extraordinary capabilities and extraordinary relationships with a multitude of government agencies. and this pondera, which is -- which prevents and -- protects and prevents benefits fraud. and then of course, there's caselines, which is around digital and virtual court systems.
so that is the real constellation of our risk business today. we do apply those tools to the corporate sector, but it's relatively early days, and we're making some good progress there. we view this as an enormous opportunity. we think we're one of the few companies that has the capabilities and the trust of customers and other stakeholders to handle these sensitive questions.
and we think there's a very significant opportunity to extend into corporates. and so that's something that we're thoughtfully pursuing.
paul steep -- scotiabank -- analyst
great. thanks for the color.
operator
thank you. your next question is from the line of tim casey. please go ahead.
tim casey -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thanks. good morning. steve, you've consistently talked about the customer experience being the -- one of the end games to the change program. and you've noted that you're not there yet.
can you maybe flesh out a bit what milestones you're looking for and when you think you'll get there, given you're halfway through the change program and what the impact will be -- what the financial impact of those changes will be? thanks.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yeah. yeah, tim, i'm happy to expand upon that. so what it isn't is just hoping that our customer service and support people get a little better at their jobs. we're not sort of relying on better sort of human interactions.
what we are doing is fundamentally building and rebuilding all of the component parts and the technologies that support our customer experience. so that's everything from our initial marketing through to the digital and automated presentation of product materials and trials to sign up some authentication enablement all the way through to billing and renewal. so there's a very heavy component of digital and self-serve that we're building in. and we think that will better enable us to serve existing customers, who are increasingly expecting those frictionless personalized experiences.
and we think it will enable us to access new customers. so there's an element of addressable market growth there. in addition to that, we think better customer experience will provide us with additional firepower around price, should we decide to exercise that. and then thirdly, something mike has talked a lot about for the past 18 months or so, which is improved retention.
and the way we think about retention is it's about customer engagement. and this is where data and analytics comes into play. the better we understand how customers are using our products today, individual products and groups of products, the better insights we'll have into the degree of engagement. and we think we can fundamentally improve our retention rates through that data-driven approach.
so i hope, tim, that gives you a sense of why we are so focused on this. i think if you look at our company, we've had some very, very compelling products, and we've got some great people. but the experience we've provided, that hasn't been where it needs to be. and i think when we get it right, it's going to have significant financial upside for us.
tim casey -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question is from the line of george tong. please go ahead.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, thanks. good morning. i'll also offer my congrats to frank, and welcome to gary. you've increased your outlook for 2022 and 2023 organic revenue growth.
as you look across legal, tax and accounting, and corporate, where are you seeing the most upside relative to your original outlook? and what would you say are the key drivers?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yeah, george, happy to start there and, of course, steve will supplement. as i mentioned earlier in regards to legal, with 2023, they were increasing the range from 5% to 6% to 5% to 7%, certainly encouraged there, not only by westlaw edge and edge 2.0 but the full breadth of the offerings that we have, including practical law and the government elite, findlaw and highq. tax and accounting, 9% growth in 2021. we're very encouraged by the work that elizabeth beastrom, president of tax and accounting professionals.
so she and her team made the recent talent additions there. corporates, we saw them accelerate their growth throughout 2021. it was about 4% during the first half of '21, accelerated to 6% in q3, 7% in q4. and we expect they'll sustain that throughout 2022.
within the reuters business, we don't expect 12% there every quarter, but very pleased with stabilizing the reuters events business there. and i think print will continue at kind of the mid-single digit declines there. but legal, on a good run, tax on a really good run and corporates is showing really good momentum as we exit q4 and begin q1.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yeah. just to add to that, george, i think one of the things that makes me excited about being here at thomson reuters and about our prospects over the next few years is that we're not reliant on any one particular product or any one particular segment to achieve the growth rates that we've set out to meet our longer-term organic growth expectations. and i think that seems how it's supposed to be. we see the integration of information and software research and software and legal fundamentally change the way lawyers do their work.
it's a big opportunity for us. and particularly coming out of covid, i think that's going to be there. we see it reasonably the same in tax and accounting professionals as they look to streamline and make more easy, the tax return preparation process and enable them to serve their customers with advisory-type services. and then in corporates, i've commented a number of times before, this is pretty new for us.
it's a sizable business. but it's not one as a company that we've been focused on for many, many years. we have a very talented leadership group under the leadership of sunil pandita in corporates. and we're excited about where they'll take this business.
and then mike's commentary on reuters, lots of opportunities for us to grow in reuters in appropriate ways to better serve refinitiv, to better serve the agency customers and the kind of broad set of professionals, including royalty, tax income, and risk professionals. if we look across, i think we probably see the most upside in corporates but certainly a nice, diversified set of growth options.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. very helpful. historically, westlaw edge has contributed about 100 bps to organic revenue growth in legal. as you look to launch edge 2.0, would you expect that to extend the runway of the 100 bps of organic growth contribution? or should it drive increased contribution to legal organic growth?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yeah, george, our current position is that we'll be able to sustain the 100 basis points of growth that we've now achieved for many quarters and couple of years there. so the best assumption is that the 100 basis points of growth will continue longer term with edge 2.0.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. very helpful. thank you.
operator
your next question is from the line of aravinda galappatthige, canaccord genuity. please go ahead.
aravinda galappatthige -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question, and all the best to frank. my congratulations as well. i wanted to just touch on the international opportunity.
i mean, in most of the recent quarterly results commentary, you've been talking about the contributions to each of the divisions from the various international markets, lat am, in particular, i was wondering whether you sort of summarize that a little bit for us. as we look ahead, what's sort of the magnitude of the opportunity mid to longer-term? and what are the limitations, given some of the jurisdictional differences? maybe you can sort of spend a moment on that. thank you.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, aravinda. it's steve, i'll start, and i'm sure mike will add, too, comments. so look, as a company, thomson reuters have had a lot of experience in the international markets over time.
i personally have had a lot of experience in the international markets. and one of the rationale i would make is that international is a bit of a misnomer. in businesses like ours, it is country-by-country. and it's a question of having unique content and support that with ai and machine learning and software to deliver those solutions to customers.
as mike has outlined over the last couple of quarters, we have a very strong position in latin america, particularly in brazil and particularly in tax and accounting, we have a very strong team here. they have performed under all weather conditions in recent years. and we expect them to continue to do so. and we've invested behind it, and we will continue to do that.
there's some interesting growth opportunities there, to say the least, to help our tax and accounting customers serve their clients better. we think that's a substantial growth opportunity. and we think there's opportunity to expand in countries like mexico, where we have a very modest starting position and some big aspirations. we enjoy a good starting position in asia and emerging markets, particularly in australia and new zealand, where our asian business is based.
and as we look north from that base, we like to look at opportunities in a number of southeast asian markets and in markets like japan. the strength of our solutions, we think, will play well there over time. and the other place where sunil pandita has invested in new leadership and talent is in europe in the corporate sector. and we're starting to see some promising signs in markets such as the u.k.
and germany. so as we look across, we're going to be selective in terms of the markets we go after. and we want to make sure that where we invest in a market, we make our mark and we achieve a no. 1 or no.
2 position in the places we play. but if you look at our starting point today, it's 80-20. about 80% of our revenues come from the united states. and that, i think, sort of leads you to a pretty big international growth opportunity over time.
aravinda galappatthige -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
excellent. thank you.
frank golden -- head of investor relations
very good. we get to take one final question, please.
operator
your final question is from the line of sami kassab of bnp paribas. please go ahead.
sami kassab -- bnp paribas -- analyst
thank you very much. and thank you, frank, for being the last question, and many thanks for the support for these many years. gentlemen, good morning. i have two questions, please.
the first one is on the small and medium business opportunity. it looks as if getting into the long tail of smes is a significant part of how you want to drive growth. can you provide a little bit of color in terms of the share of revenues from the sme market across the big 3 divisions, please? and the second question is on labor cost inflation. there's a lot of talk around and some indication and the like.
can you comment on what type of unit labor cost inflation you have assumed in the '22 and '23 margin guidance? and to what extent is that difference from what you've seen in '20 and '21? thank you, gentlemen.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, sami. it's steve. i'll start with the first smb question, and then mike will add to that and answer the inflation question.
so the smb opportunity, about 35% of our revenues today come from small firms, whether they're small law firms, small tax and accounting firms or small to medium enterprises in the conventional corporate sense. and that's more heavily weighted toward the tax and accounting and legal side of things. so we think there's a pretty big opportunity to serve the corporate side in a number of different markets, including the united states. and the approach we're taking is to lead with these investments in digital and self-serve, customer service and support capabilities because that's -- they're the ones that best serve the smb market.
so we're starting there. we're also looking hard at our products and making investments in existing products to make them better suited to the small end of town and also generating and developing new products that are specifically dedicated to those areas. and so that's the approach we're taking. and we think that as that market segment grows, we can both grow with the segment and take some share as our capabilities have developed over time.
it's also an area where we will be very opportunistic and selective in terms of m&a. if we think there's an opportunity to extend our franchise into those areas inorganically, then we'll take advance of that. mike?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yeah. sami, in regards to the cost inflation, let me address it from two standpoints. first, in regards to pricing and then labor. if you look at our guidance for '22 and '23, we have assumed a slight uptick in both our pricing and in our labor costs for both years.
those are reflected in our updated guidance that we provided today. when you think about our pricing -- and just as a reminder, we have a significant level of our contracts under multiyear contracts. about 60% of legal are multiyear, corporates are about 40%, tax, about 10%. so in regards to uplift in price having realized effect in a given calendar year, you have to take the multi-years into effect.
but we have reflected, sami, both an uptick in pricing and labor costs in our guidance.
sami kassab -- bnp paribas -- analyst
thank you very much, gentlemen.
frank golden -- head of investor relations
good. have a good day. and that will be our final question. we'd like to thank you all for joining us today, and feel free to contact myself and gary with any follow-up questions you have.
have a good day, everyone.

welcome, everyone, to the q4 2021 earnings call. my name is sue, i'm your event manager. [operator instructions] i would like to advise all parties that this conference is being recorded. and now i'll hand over to frank golden, head of investor relations.
please go ahead.
frank golden -- head of investor relations
good morning and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. i'm joined today by our ceo, steve hasker, and our cfo, mike eastwood, each of whom will report our results and take your questions following their remarks. today marks my final earnings call as head of investor relations for thomson reuters. i'm pleased to announce that we're also joined by gary bisbee, who will assume the role of head of investor relations for thomson reuters on march 1, in advance of my retirement in july.
i couldn't be more pleased to place the baton in the very capable hands of gary, who many of you already know. gary has covered thomson reuters on the sell side of bank of america securities for the past three years, and i know will do a very terrific job. after 18 years at thomson reuters, including 71 earnings calls and eight investor days, it's time for my next adventure and to spend more time with my wife and family. i truly enjoyed my time at tr, having worked with four ceos, three cfos and hundreds of very talented colleagues over that time.
i also will miss speaking with many of you. you challenged me, informed me and even entertained me a bit of times, and helped me do this job better. and for that, i am grateful. lastly, i've watched thomson reuters evolve to become one of the preeminent business information services companies in the world.
and under steve and mike's leadership, i'm confident tr will continue to build on its progress, further strengthening its position for the benefit of our investors, customers and employees. and now, to the results. a lot to share today, so to enable us to get to as many questions as possible, we'd appreciate if you would limit yourselves to one question each and one follow-up when we open the phone lines. throughout today's presentation, when we compare performance period-on-period, we discuss revenue growth rates before currency, as well as on an organic basis.
we believe this provides the best basis to measure the underlying performance of the business. before i turn it over steve, i want to note that reflecting how we currently manage revenue across our segments, we are making two changes effective january 1, 2022. for comparability, we will revise our 2021 results and during when we report our first quarter 2022 results in may. these changes will not have any impact on our consolidated results.
first, we will record intercompany revenues for reuters news for content-related services that it provides to our legal professionals, corporates and tax and accounting professionals businesses. previously, these services have been reported as a transfer of expense from reuters to these businesses. so there is no impact on any segment's adjusted ebitda. two, we will transfer $9 million of revenue from the corporates business to our tax and accounting business, where it will be managed and where it fits better.
i'd like to direct you to the investor relations section of our website, where we posted a schedule that reflects our revised full year 2019, 2020 and 2021 results, as well as our revised 2021 quarterly results in the manner we will begin reporting in 2022. today's presentation contains forward-looking statements and non-ifrs financial measures. actual results may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties related to the covid impact and other risks discussed in reports and filings that we provide from time to time to regulatory agencies. you may access these documents on our website or by contacting our investor relations department.
let me now turn it over to steve hasker. 
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
thank you, frank, for the introduction, and thank you for all that you have done for thomson reuters for over 18 years, and welcome to gary. thanks to all of you for joining us today. i'm pleased to report the momentum we saw in the first nine months of the year continued in the fourth quarter. revenue and sales growth were again strong, exceeded our expectations, and we closed out the year on a solid footing.
this performance has created momentum as we started 2022. and it has helped build our confidence as we work to achieve our 2022 and 2023 targets. we are increasingly in a position of strength. since march 2020, when covid began to negatively impact the global economy, professional markets have remained resilient and continued to grow, helped by a significant global shift by our customers to upgrade legal, tax, and risk, fraud, and compliance products.
customers also continued to exhibit more confidence in their own future prospects. and our products are proving well suited to enable our customers to effectively serve their clients, targeting investment in products that are driving faster growth and where we have strong positions in growing markets. this dynamic enabled us to achieve 5% organic revenue growth for the full year 2021, the highest growth rate in over a decade, while also improving our underlying profitability and free cash flow. our fourth quarter results reflect an improving performance.
four of our five business segments again recorded organic revenue growth of 6% or greater and total company organic revenues grew 6%. we continue to make steady progress with our change program as we transform to a content-driven technology company. and we have achieved over $200 million in savings thus far, one-third of our $600 million target. we also achieved all of our 2021 guidance targets that we increased throughout the year.
given the momentum in the business and our growing confidence, today, we increased our 2022 and 2023 guidance from what we provided at this time last year. and finally, this morning, we announced a 10% increase in our annual dividend to $1.78 per share, the 29th consecutive annual increase and the largest increase since 2008. now, for the results for the quarter. fourth quarter reported and organic revenues were up 6%, attributable to strong results from the big 3 businesses in reuters.
and similar to the last quarter, this performance included strong organic growth of more than 20% from our latin american businesses and nearly 10% growth from our asia and emerging markets businesses. adjusted ebitda declined 14% to $452 million due to cost related to the change program, higher performance bonus expense and a discretionary investment of $25 million to better position the business for 2022, which mike will discuss. this resulted in a margin of 26.4%. excluding change program, costs, adjusted ebitda margin was 31.1%.
adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.43 compared to $0.54 per share in the prior year period. the additional $25 million we invested in the quarter lowered adjusted eps by $0.04. turning to fourth quarter results by segment. the big 3 businesses achieved organic revenue growth of 7%, reflecting strength across each of the businesses.
u.s. legal market was very healthy throughout 2021. and our performance benefited from that dynamic. legal's fourth quarter performance was again impressive with organic revenue growth of 6%, the third consecutive quarter of 6% growth.
full year revenue growth was also 6%, the highest annual growth rate since 2008. sales was strong throughout the year, including q4. we exited the year in a good position, recording double-digit recurring sales growth in q4, reflecting customers' willingness to invest in productivity-enhancing product. for example, westlaw edge continued to achieve strong sales growth in the end of the quarter with an annual contract value, or acv, penetration of 65%, achieving the top end of our guidance with more opportunity in 2022 with a target of 70% to 75% penetration and the expected launch of edge 2.0.
second, practical law, as reported in the legal segment, had a terrific quarter and year, growing mid-teens in both periods. we forecast another strong performance in 2022 for practical law as we continue to invest in this key legal workflow initiative. third, our government business, which is managed within our legal segment, grew 7% organically in q4 and 9% for the year and achieved strong sales in q4, setting it up well for strong growth in 2022. and fourth, our legal businesses in canada and asia grew double digits in the quarter while europe grew mid-single digits.
turning to the corporates business. organic revenue growth continued to accelerate and was up 7% from 6% in q3 and 4% in the first half of the year. this improvement came from increasing demand for customers for our legal, tax and risk products. and tax and accounting had a terrific quarter and year with organic revenue growth of 9% for both periods and strong q4 sales.
this performance was stronger than expected, thanks to ultratax, our audit solutions product, and a strong performance by our latin american tax business, dominio, that grew more than 20% for the year. reuters news organic revenues increased 12% in q4 with growth across all of the business lines, particularly the professional business, which includes digital advertising, custom content and reuters events, which continues to recover from the negative impact of covid-19 in 2020. and finally, global print organic revenues declined 4%, more than expected due to a continued gradual return to office by our customers and higher third-party print revenues. so in summary, we're very pleased with our results, and we're very excited about the momentum we're building.
we expect further improvement to our performance this year as we invest to further strengthen our positions across the business segments. full year reported revenues were up 6% and organic revenues were up 5%, thanks to strong results from the big 3 businesses in reuters. adjusted ebitda declined slightly and was just shy of $2 billion due to cost related to the change program and higher performance bonus expense, resulting in a margin of 31%. excluding change program costs, adjusted ebitda margin was 33.9%, about 100 basis points higher than 2020.
adjusted earnings per share for the year was $1.95 compared with $1.85 per share in the prior year. now, let me discuss several of the key contributors to our accelerating growth and improving prospects. during our investor day in march last year, i shared with you that we're investing in seven strategic growth priorities with the big 3 segments. these businesses grew 6.5% on a combined basis in 2021 with several growing double-digit and our foundational westlaw product up 4%.
we continue to believe that our opportunity is about powering the world's most important professionals. and we're helping forge their future through digital automation, augmentation and collaboration, powered by a combination of unique content, world-class ai and machine learning and best-of-breed workflow software, and these products do precisely that. against this frame, we'll continue in investing heavily in these strategic priorities, and we'll continue to shift the proportion of capital investment allocated to these initiatives. these investments are expected to continue to help accelerate organic growth and enable us to achieve our revenue growth target of 5.5% to 6% in 2023.
m&a is also expected to play an important role in accelerating our organic growth and priorities. and we have an active pipeline of potential future acquisitions across our core segments. additionally, we recently launched our new thomson reuters venture fund, which will invest up to $100 million of seed funding to start-up companies to cultivate innovation and expand our m&a pipeline. let me finish on the financials for full year by noting that we met or exceeded each of our 2021 guidance metrics, which reflects the resilience of the business and the visibility we have in our businesses and markets.
i would now like to update you on the progress related to our change program, including highlighting the progress from our product and innovation teams. you will recall, i presented this slide at our investor day last year. and it's as relevant today as it was then. we continue to benefit from fundamental and prevailing tailwinds due to increasing legal, tax and regulatory complexity, which favors business information services markets and providers.
and as we enter the third year of the pandemic, its lasting impact on the market segments we serve is becoming clearer. digital transformation has accelerated, driven by virtual working and client demands to engage digitally with the firms and departments that serve them. it's unlikely to be a passing fad. hybrid and virtual working is here to stay, which is increasing customer expectations of digital experiences.
and demand for content-enabled, cloud-based, ai-powered solutions that drive professional efficiency and effectiveness continues to grow. hesitation to embrace new technologies in our core -- in our more traditional customer segments is giving way to an appreciation of the benefits to be gained from doing so. and our goal of becoming a content-driven technology company includes excelling at product innovation and successfully integrating our products to provide customers with a seamless offering while delivering an excellent customer experience. we believe this approach will further improve customer loyalty and increase retention as we continually enhance our products, adding to organic growth.
our change program is targeted at achieving these objectives. and we're making good progress. let me share several examples of that progress. i won't take you through each of the items on this slide.
rather, i want to highlight the progress we've made last year in transforming to a more integrated, simple, agile company. we are reducing complexity in our operations and technology group, which is critical for us to achieve the change program goals and margin targets. we've made significant progress, which you can see on this slide, including 37% of our revenue is now on a cloud solution, and we're on track to achieve our target of 90% of our revenue available in the cloud by the end of 2023. smb digital sales increased to 29% as a percentage of total sales.
improving our internal process within order-to-cash has reduced customer-facing incidents, invoice rework and have brought together our product, content and editorial strategies to improve customer delivery and drive efficiencies. each of these achievements are critical if we are to simplify and improve the customer experience we provide. we also reduced our global footprint of office locations from 102 to 46 and our call centers from 99 to 77. and one additional point here.
talent is key to completing our initiatives. and our goal is to build the best team in business information services by developing and attracting top global talent and delivering a differentiated employee experience. over the past two years, we have brought in new key talent into our organization within product, engineering, marketing, data and analytics, design, operations and technology, among other key areas, adding talent with different perspectives and approaches, which have complemented the skills and experiences of existing leadership. i'm very, very pleased with the progress we're making.
a few additional points regarding the change program. we made progress toward shifting customers to a more digital, automated experience with the launch of self-serve capabilities and automated tools for support. delivery of the customer experience of the future is underway. and our goal remains to create fast, frictionless, connected, transparent and personalized customer experiences.
our key areas of focus continue to be: first, a digital-first approach for small customers. second, a 360-degree view of the customer. third, simplified and standardized commercial terms, billing processes, and customer support. fourth, seamless digital product trials and digital purchasing.
and fifth, data-driven and ai-powered sales and marketing. we expect these changes to redefine our customer experience to match their expectations by the end of 2023, by which time a large portion of customer-facing sales, sales operations and support could be digitized and automated. the impact of this should be twofold. first, we believe delighting our customers will translate to improved net promoter score, leading to improved retention and new sales opportunities.
and second, decreasing the cost to serve customers enables us to reallocate funds to pursue new organic growth opportunities, improving our agility to test new product ideas quickly with customers, which we believe would lead to further improvements in the top and bottom lines. so let me now turn to product innovation. last year, we ramped up our focus and our investments in product innovation, and we will continue to do so. we expect new products and product enhancements will be a key lever to accelerate revenue going forward.
and our product development teams are making good progress. entering 2022, the product organization is prioritizing resources where we can build and maintain leadership positions and support fewer products, a shift from our historical approach of making small investments in many products. the organizational design model enables us to work as a better integrated, more effective team, moving from an organization with data to a data-driven organization. our content is a significant competitive advantage and differentiates us against our key competitors.
the new product organizational structure we formed last year positions us to achieve greater success by leveraging that valuable content, enriching it with world-class ai and machine learning and best-of-breed software and delivering it in the cloud. investing in an improved user experience across our products is another important priority so that our customers can interact with our content with minimal points of friction. and we're increasing investments in our people, as well as our technology and product organizations to expand and accelerate innovation and speed to market. we believe this will enable us to continue to be leaders within our core market segments and allow us to expand into adjacent market opportunities.
and lastly, here are some examples of products and initiatives in which we're investing that are contributing to higher organic growth. practical law and indirect tax, two of our strategic seven initiatives, released new and enhanced product modules last year, which were well received by customers. and we expect they will again contribute to higher organic revenue growth in 2022 and beyond. we also made good progress last year forming a centralized partnership team, led by our corporates group, which we are seeing good traction having signed partnership agreements with oracle, sap, aws, and alteryx.
and in 2021, we accelerated the work we're doing to provide our content and workforce solutions to customers via our apis. for 2022, we'll accelerate and expand our api ecosystem, where we can improve the experience for both existing and new customers. we're confident this will open up new channels, new business models and new product offerings and will help grow our partner ecosystem. and as our capabilities surrounding apis continue to grow, it will enable us to further integrate our best-in-class content and solutions into our customers' workflows, contributing to our growth.
before i turn it over to mike, let me discuss our updated guidance for 2022 and 2023. i am very pleased to report that given the positive trajectory of the business, we're increasing our revenue, adjusted ebitda margin and free cash flow guidance from that which we provided at investor day in march 2021. we now forecast total company organic revenue growth of approximately 5% for 2022 and 5.5% to 6% for 2023. let me remind you that 2021's organic revenue growth of 5% included about 100 basis point benefit from easier year-over-year comps related to covid-19 items in 2020.
big 3 organic revenue growth is forecast between 6% and 6.5% in 2022 and 6.5% to 7% in 2023. we forecast an adjusted ebitda margin of 35% for 2022 and between 39% and 40% for 2023. and free cash flow is now forecast at about $1.3 billion for 2022 and between $1.9 billion to $2 billion with free cash flow per share between $3.90 and $4.10 for 2023. i'm confident we'll achieve these higher targets.
and let me now turn it over to mike.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
thank you, steve, and thanks for joining us today. as a reminder, i will talk to revenue growth before currency and on an organic basis. let me start by discussing the fourth quarter revenue performance of our big 3 segments. revenues were up 7% organically and at constant currency for the quarter.
this marks the sixth consecutive quarter our big 3 segments have grown at least 5%. legal professionals' total revenues increased 5% and organic revenues increased 6% in the fourth quarter. recurring organic revenue grew 6% and transaction revenues increased 6%. fourth quarter organic revenue growth was driven by practical law, elite, findlaw and our government business.
westlaw edge added about 100 basis points to legal's organic growth rate, is maintaining a healthy premium and is expected to continue to contribute at a similar level going forward, supported by the planned release of edge 2.0 during the second half of this year. our government business, which is reported within legal and includes much of our risk and compliance businesses, grew 7% for the quarter and 9% for the year and exited q4 with strong sales and good momentum entering 2022. quarter-to-quarter performance can vary for this business, given the government contracting process, project work, and fiscal year funding from the various agencies. we believe 2022 will be another year of healthy revenue growth, supported by strong q4 2021 sales.
in our corporates segment, total and organic revenues increased 7% for the quarter due to recurring organic revenue growth of 7% and transactions organic revenue growth of 4%. recurring revenue was driven by clear, practical law, indirect tax and legal software, as well as our businesses in latin america. and finally, tax and accounting's total and organic fourth quarter revenues grew 9%, driven by 9% recurring organic revenue growth, thanks to strong performance in our audit solutions and latin america businesses. and transactions organic revenue increased 10%.
moving to reuters news. fourth quarter performance was very strong with total and organic revenue growth of 12%. reuters achieved growth across all business lines, including the bounce-back in the events business as it continues to recover from the negative impact from covid in 2020. in global print, total and organic revenues declined 4%, better than expected.
on a consolidated basis, fourth quarter total and organic revenues each increased 6%. before turning to profitability, let's look closer at recurring and transaction revenue results for the fourth quarter. starting on the left side, total company organic revenue for the fourth quarter 2021 was up 6% compared to 2% in the prior year period, which was impacted by covid. fourth quarter 2021 performance for the big 3 was strong with organic revenues up 7% compared to 5% in the same period last year.
this was partly driven by strong performance in the corporates segment, which grew 7% organically compared to 3% in q4 2020. total company recurring organic revenues grew 6% in q4, 110 basis points above q4 2020 with big 3 recurring organic revenues up 7%, above last year's fourth quarter growth of 6%. turning to the graph on the bottom right of this slide. transaction revenues in q4 were up 16% compared to the prior year period, when covid affected our implementation services and the reuters events business.
we continue to remain encouraged by our momentum in 2021, especially for recurring revenues. this gives us confidence in the trajectory of the business and our ability to achieve our 2022 growth targets. turning to our profitability performance in the fourth quarter. adjusted ebitda for the big 3 segments was $488 million, down 2% from the prior year period, driven by higher performance bonus expense.
fourth quarter costs also included a discretionary investment of $25 million related to go-to-market initiatives, product development initiatives and data and analytics tools to support the customer experience to better position us for 2022. i will remind you the change program operating costs are recorded at the corporate level. moving to reuters news. adjusted ebitda was $15 million, $9 million more than the prior year period, driven by revenue growth.
global print's adjusted ebitda was flat at $61 million with a margin of 35.9%, 130 basis points higher than q4 2020. so in aggregate, total company adjusted ebitda for the quarter was $452 million, a 14% decrease versus q4 2020. excluding costs related to the change program, adjusted ebitda increased 1%. fourth quarter's adjusted ebitda margin was 26.4% and was 31.1% on an underlying basis, excluding costs related to the change program.
for the full year, total company adjusted ebitda margin was 31%. excluding costs related to the change program, full year adjusted ebitda margin was 33.9%. now, let me turn to our earnings per share and free cash flow performance. starting with earnings per share, adjusted eps was $0.43 per share versus $0.54 per share in the prior year period.
of note, fourth quarter adjusted eps was reduced by approximately $0.04 due to the additional $25 million investment in q4. let me now turn to our free cash flow performance for the full year 2021. finished the year on a strong footing and exceeded our guidance, thanks to strong cash collections in q4. this performance reflects the momentum of our businesses as we transition into 2022 and continue to execute on the change program initiatives.
reported free cash flow was $1.3 billion, $74 million lower than in 2020. consistent with previous quarters, this slide removes the distorting factors impacting free cash flow performance. working from the bottom of the slide upwards, the cash outflows from the discontinued operations component of our free cash flow was $51 million more than the prior year. this was primarily due to payments to the u.k.
tax authority related to our former refinitiv business. for the full year, we made $166 million of change program payments as compared to refinitiv-related separation cost of $95 million in the prior year. so if you adjust for these items, comparable free cash flow from continuing operations was just shy of $1.5 billion, $189 million better than the prior year. this increase was primarily due to higher adjusted ebitda and dividends from our interest in lseg.
we'll now provide an update on our change program progress. in the fourth quarter, we achieved $85 million of annual run rate operating expense savings. this brings the cumulative annual run rate operating expense savings to $217 million for the change; program, which exceeds our target of $200 million. this puts us more than a third of the way toward achieving our goal of $600 million of gross savings by 2023.
as a reminder, we anticipate reinvesting $200 million of the projected $600 million savings back into the business for a net savings of $400 million. now, an update on our change program costs for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. spend during the fourth quarter was $125 million, comprised of $78 million of opex and $47 million of capex. for the full year, change program opex and capex spend totaled $295 million, at the lower end of the range of $290 million to $320 million we have forecast last year.
spend is forecast to step up in 2022 related to cloud migration, streamlining internal systems and product engineering. we are still expecting to incur approximately $600 million over the course of the program. and there is no change in the anticipated split of about 60% opex and 40% capex. i'll now provide an update on our capital structure at year-end.
as you can see, our capital structure and liquidity position remained strong as we exited 2021. we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow last year. we had $0.8 billion of cash on hand at december 31. we have an undrawn $1.8 billion revolving credit facility.
and we also have a $1.8 billion commercial paper program. from a liquidity and capital structure standpoint, we entered 2022 in a very strong position. and we would like to put that capital to work to further accelerate our growth. we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions within our core markets and have the ability and desire to move quickly if an opportunity presents itself this year.
one final point. we received notices from the u.k. tax authorities requiring us to pay about $80 million in march related to an ongoing tax matter. while we believe we will prevail on these issues and be refunded substantially all the payments, including those made last year, we are required to pay the amount upfront while contesting them.
any payment would not reflect our view of the merits of the case as we believe our position is supported by the weight of law. regarding our investment in the london stock exchange group. the pre-tax value of our 72.4 million shares is currently $7 billion, or an estimated $14 per share in tr stock price. in march 2021, we sold 10.1 million shares to pay taxes related to the transaction.
we expect to receive dividends from lseg of more than $75 million in 2022 based on lseg's current annual dividend payout. i will remind you, dividends from the investment are part of our free cash flow. we remain subject to a lockup for our lseg shares until january 30, 2023. at which time, we can sell approximately one-third of the shares.
the remaining two tranches can be sold in january 2024 and 2025. we view our equity interest in lseg as a store value, which we expect to continue to monetize over time, which provides us with a significant level of financial flexibility related to the use of proceeds. and finally, today, we announced a 10% annualized dividend increase, the largest percentage increase since 2008, taking our annual dividend to $1.78 per share, up $0.16 per share from $1.62. this also marks the 29th consecutive year of annual dividend increases for the company.
the increase will be effective with our q1 dividend payable next month. these annual dividend increases speak to the solidity of our business and consistent and growing free cash flow generation. we'll now turn to our outlook for 2022 and 2023. as steve mentioned, we are increasing our guidance for both years since we expect to continue the positive trajectory for all key metrics.
organic revenue is expected to continue its upward trajectory as we work to become a consistent and sustainable mid-single-digit grower. we forecast organic revenue growth of about 5% in 2022 and 5.5% to 6% in 2023. key drivers include continued investment in our seven strategic priorities and delivering on our digital and sales effectiveness work streams and the change program. we forecast the big 3 organic revenues to grow between 6% and 6.5% in 2022 and between 6.5% and 7% in 2023.
we also believe our legal business can grow 5% to 7% over the cycle versus the 5% to 6% we mentioned at investor day last year with continued margin expansion. turning to adjusted ebitda margin and free cash flow. our guidance in 2022 reflects the dilutive impact of the change program investments. we forecast adjusted ebitda margin in 2022 will increase to about 35% with an underlying margin of over 37%, putting us on a path to achieve our 2023 margin target of 39% to 40%.
free cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion in 2022 and includes change program spend of over $300 million. free cash flow is expected to increase to between $1.9 billion and $2 billion in 2023, driven by higher revenue growth and savings and efficiencies from the change program. let me conclude with our updated and detailed guidance for 2022 and 2023. this slide includes the guidance we provided in february 2021, enabling you to compare the changes and raised guidance.
i will also note, we expect our first quarter revenue growth rate and adjusted ebitda margin to be comparable to our full year 2022 guidance targets. now, the guidance metrics on the slide are self-explanatory. but i would like to address the outlook for our effective or book tax rate and our cash tax rate for 2022 and 2023 based on current tax law. in 2021, our effective or book tax rate was 14% and included a 200-basis-point benefit from the reversal of reserves for prior tax year.
this benefit will not reoccur in 2022. we also forecast in 2022 minimum taxes this year, which bumps the expected etr up to between 19% and 21%. looking to 2023, we expect our etr to decline to the upper-teens. and as a rule of thumb, our cash tax rate is forecast to be approximately 5% below our book or effective tax rate.
this is fully reflected in our 2023 free cash flow guidance of $1.9 billion to $2 billion. to conclude, our confidence in achieving our 2022 and 2023 guidance has only increased from one year ago. we continue to believe we can achieve faster revenue growth, higher profitability, lower capital intensity, and significantly higher free cash flow as we benefit from transitioning to a content-enabled technology company. now, let me ask steve to wrap up before we turn to your questions.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
thank you, mike. i will conclude by saying that we're very pleased with our 2021 performance, but we still have much more work ahead. our confidence is strengthened by our 2021 organic revenue, and we have good momentum entering 2022. the change program is progressing well.
and we're confident in achieving our $600 million savings target and our $100 million incremental revenue target. we have numerous levers to pull that should help us accelerate our growth. and we're building a strong leadership team with new talent that's brought different perspectives, which complemented the skills of existing leadership and has energized our teams. and lastly, to elevate our ambition, we kicked off the year with confidence by announcing our new company purpose, which is to inform the way forward.
this unites our commercial strengths, the critical role we play in society. customers and employees have responded very positively to this, redoubled commitment to serve professionals, advance critical institutions and to build trust through our products and with our actions. let me now turn it back over to frank.
frank golden -- head of investor relations
thanks very much, steve and mike. and that concludes our prepared remarks. and we'd now like to open the call for questions, operator, so if we could have the first question, please.

[operator instructions] and the first one is coming from the line of vince valentini from td securities.
vince valentini -- td securities -- analyst
great quarter. i'll leave it to others to ask about that. i just -- given the environment in the tech sector and multiples collapsing in a lot of spaces, i'm wondering if you can give us any update on acquisition targets. i assume this is a potentially good news scenario for you guys with cash rate with a strong balance sheet and looking for strategic acquisitions that will bolster your growth.
is there any hope that these things are getting more imminent given more -- what valuations are doing?
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
it's steve. thanks for the question. look, i think we're closer for two reasons. one, we're another quarter through the change program and building confidence in our -- in the capabilities we're building and the -- and our execution team.
and we think that the further we get along that journey, the more of an advantage to acquire we will be. and so we're making good progress there. and second, as you say, there's been some pretty significant changes in public valuations and potentially toward the end of this year, private technology-related valuations. so i think both of those two things provide us with some optimism that we'll be able to do one or more acquisitions that are additive to the customer experience that we provide.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yes. vince, i'll just supplement it as a reminder to everyone, the first tranche of the lseg state, the lockup expires q1 2023. as we've previously stated, it's our intent to monetize the first da, which is approximately one-third in q1 '23. the second item i would emphasize, vince, as steve mentioned in his prepared remarks, depending on the cadence or sequencing of acquisitions, we still have the option of considering additional share buybacks comparable to what we did in 2021.
vince valentini -- td securities -- analyst
can i just clarify one thing you said, steve, that public valuations have come down, you're expecting private valuations could come down later this year. does that imply you haven't seen them come down yet?
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
well, there's always a gap between the sort of the expectations of sellers, which tend to lag and the expectations of buyers, which sort of pricing any declines pretty quickly. so we haven't seen any significant transactions that would indicate just yet that, that correction has occurred, but we think it might.

and the next question is coming from heather balsky from bank of america.
heather balsky -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
can you share some color in terms of the demand you're seeing from your customer base in legal and accounting as well? and there's general concern about sort of state of the economy and things slowing with rising rates. i'm curious just sort of what you've seen in the past in terms of your customers' demands in a slower economic environment.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes. heather, let me start. it's steve. let me start, and perhaps mike can provide some more historical context because he was at tr during the '08-'09 financial crisis.
we continue -- i alluded to this in my remarks. we continue to see robust demand for our solutions in all big 3 segments. and it's really being driven by a need to automate and simplify their workflows and access content that gives them a competitive advantage and allows them to be more efficient and effective in their work. and sort of coming through and coming out of covid, that trend continues unabated.
so far, the sort of turbulence in the broader geopolitical and macroeconomic environment has not translated into any softening of that demand in any of the three segments. and i'd just point to the fact that 80% of our revenues are recurring. and so that gives us, i think, real confidence through the rest of this year and justification for raising our revenue guidance. so of all of the businesses you follow, we're in a robust category because of that 80% revenue recurring revenue.
but let me ask mike to supplement based on our historical experience through difficult economic times.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
heather, i'd additional two points, in addition to steve's point on 80% recurring growth, the key factor with that 80% recurring is about multiyear contracts. as a reminder, approximately 60% of our legal revenue is under multiyear contracts; about 40% of our corporates revenue, multiyear; and 10% of tax and accounting is multiyear. that's a key point. the second point, heather, we saw really strong q1 net sales.
and thus far, early indicators of a strong april results there. so based on that, heather, remain positive. we'll have to continue to monitor it, obviously, throughout q2 and the full year. but i think the strength of our multiyear contract certainly helps us.
heather balsky -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
and a follow-up question on the margin guide. you talked about inflation being one of the factors that led you to maintain at this quarter for the full year. curious as sort of your ability to take price against that. and is it a timing issue? i'm just curious sort of what's going on there.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yes. certainly, heather. in regards to the margin, i'll mention a few items. you touched on the potential for inflationary headwinds.
but another key factor business is to support our customers. that's something that we'll continue to assess. specifically in regards to inflation, i'll touch on two aspects: pricing that you mentioned; i'll also add some color in rear in regards to the cost side. on pricing, our pricing in q1 was fairly consistent with prior years.
it was up slightly, but the strength of the revenue was really the underlying performance of the business. so a slight uptick in pricing. as we go through the full year, our current estimate is a slight uptick versus 2021, but not hugely significant. as a reference point in 2021, our price increases, which vary by segment.
tax and accounting was 5%; our corporate segment, 3%; in legal, 2.5%, yielding the weighted average there. on the cost side, we did provide higher merit increases in april of this year, which is our annual increase there. and if you look at the supply -- traditional supply chain impact, our print business, we refer to it as the 3ps: print, paper and postage. certainly, we're seeing higher price and costs there in the print business, which is about 10% of our total revenue.
given all of those potential inflationary factors, heather, we have considered those in our updated guidance for 2022 and when we reaffirmed our guidance for 2023. so based on what we know, on the potential inflationary factors, heather, we think we've been prudent in factoring into our margin and full guidance for '22 and '23.

the next question is coming from drew mcreynolds from rbc capital markets.
drew mcreynolds -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
two follow-ups for me. just following up on vince's m&a question. first, thanks for the drill-down on the legal and particularly legal solutions business, very, very helpful. i think for those that have followed some of your m&a over the years, finding things like practical law are just amazing assets that generate that kind of growth over years and years.
wondering, i guess, for you, steve, if you've identified practical law-like assets out there. or are these more difficult to find, just in general? just would love to get that context. and then second follow-up, we've all known kind of complexity drives the end markets for legal, tax and accounting. you're going through a kind of post-covid work-from-home period.
just even bigger picture than that, where else is the complexity growing in these end markets? just wanted to just better understand more of that bigger-picture structural tailwind.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, drew. great questions. look, no two acquisitions are the same, obviously.
but what we're seeing among our law firm customers in particular, but increasingly, the general counsels' offices as well is a real need to invest in technology and workflow software and to have the content flow seamlessly through that software. so we think this sort of combination of unique content, ai machine learning and software is a very valuable play at this time. and it plays to some degree in your second question. the law firms like all firms, financial institutions and thomson reuters and business information services are sort of finding their footing in a post-covid world, but certainly a world that involves more time back in office than the last two years.
and with that comes more technology investment, potentially less real estate investment and more technology investment. so we think that there will be quite a few opportunities for us to build organically and buy inorganically in the space. i think the one, while not a direct parallel to practical law, is thoughttrace. we look at this area of contract analysis, it's enormously time-consuming for general counsels and for law firms to go through hundreds, if not thousands, of contracts when the law and the regulation changes and be able to quickly and seamlessly update them and have confidence that, that process has been effectively and correctly done.
and so it's a big area of demand. i've had a conversation with a number of our legal customers and sort of described thoughttrace and described the investments that we're going to make in it and what the outcome of that will be, and they're excited about it. so we'll see how that plays out. in terms of your second question, look, i -- whether good for humanity or not, we certainly see lots of examples of increasing compliance-related complexity.
so cyber is one area. we're getting comfortable with sort of data management, privacy and management of cyber-related risks. the legal landscape gets more complicated in terms of rules and regulations, not less, for corporations, big, small and medium. and we don't know as many tax codes that are getting simpler.
and so it really is across our business that we see this sort of rise in complexity. and what that presents in a inflationary environment and a talent-constrained marketplace is that companies need reliable partners to help them handle that complexity and, in a sense, take it off of their plate. and that's what we're here to do. and we think we're one of the few players who can do it effectively at scale in a truly trusted and transparent manner.
operator
and the next question is coming from kevin mcveigh from credit suisse.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
congratulations on the change program. i wonder -- can you give us a sense as -- because obviously things have changed a lot since you started the change program. i want to talk about maybe retention a little bit across the enterprise. can we talk about that? and then maybe pricing expectations kind of today versus kind of when you started the change program, maybe just a little more color around, again, retention and pricing as we're kind of working our way through change.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
sure, kevin. let me start with regards to retention. i believe, kevin, back at march of '21 at investor day, we estimated that we could improve our overall retention for total tr by roughly 100 basis points over the time horizon. we're at approximately 91% today, which is a slight uptick over the last 12 to 15 months.
we have 100 basis points left. and i think it's directly correlated to the work that we're doing with kirsty roth, andrew pearce, crystal and others in regards to our customer experience. and we're continuing to do that. so i think we're on the right trajectory, kevin, on improving our retention.
as we've discussed before, our retention does vary by customer size with significantly higher retention for large customers, lower retention for the smallest customers, but that's where the work that we're doing with digital self-serve and the overall end-to-end customer experience. we remain optimistic that will help us not only with retention, but also attract new customers and new logos. second question there in regards to pricing, consistent with what i shared with heather, let me just repeat that for everyone's benefit, kevin: a slight uptick in our pricing in q1 versus 2021. it does vary by segment.
as i mentioned, tax and accounting, about 5%; corporates, 3%; and legal, 2.5%. based on what we see right now over the course of the year, we see a slight uptick for the full year compared to last year. one factor there is the multiyear contracts that we talked about earlier in one of the questions. as we do implement some price increases for multiyear contracts, there'll certainly be a timing impact as to when that price is realized.
i think those were the two questions on retention and pricing. and steve may want to touch on the last one. kevin, you initially talked about the change program. if we largely look at the work streams that we started on the change program around 15 months ago, we're continuing to march on each of them.
there are, and we pivot along the way as you would expect us to there. but we remain on track. and a lot of heavy lifting remaining for the year, but i think we'll be in a really good spot, kevin, at the end of '22 on the change program. steve may want to add some comments.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes. kevin, just to supplement, i think everything mike said, with the change program, i'm sort of surprised at how correct our assumptions were going in. i don't say that with any arrogance. but when you design one of these programs, there's a lot you don't know and there's a lot of assumptions you have to make.
and i give credit to kirsty roth and andrew pearce and many others for that sort of initial design work. but in each of the work streams, the sort of customer experience upgrade, the modernization of ops and tech and the sort of organ location we bought, all of those have changed to some degree and all of those have required problem solving and some pivots. perhaps the biggest one has been the org design and location. i think we're staring at a very significantly more fluid and flexible working environment than we were when we launched the program through the pandemic.
there was an assumption that things would return to some version of what they were before, whereas i think as we sit here today, we realize that we're in a hybrid working environment that just won't resemble the 2019 work environment. we've got very significant -- we're providing our colleagues with much more flexibility in terms of where they -- from where they work and how they work together in service of our customers. and that affords us a company with flexibility in terms of investing in real estate and physical locations.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
kevin, the last point i would make with some of the sound like crates arm that we've joined and looking at our product development road maps and the timing of the releases and frequency thereof, to me, that's probably one of the positive factors that we have as we think about our product development road map over the next couple of years. so i think that's a key factor.
operator
the next question is coming from andrew steinerman from j.p. morgan.
stephanie yee -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
this is stephanie yee sitting in for andrew. just a question on your public cloud migration. can you give us an update there? is it progressing on track? is it accelerating? just any color you can provide on that front?
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes. stephanie, it's ahead of track. so as you may remember, we got to about 33%, i think, by the end of last year, and that continues to accelerate. and we're looking at -- we're at about 50% or more now.
we're looking to get 90% plus by the -- in the back end of 2023. so we're on track with that. i think what it does is provide us a bit of flexibility as to whether to continue to invest in that and accelerate it further or to use some of that sort of progress that's a little ahead of where we thought we'd be to accelerate some other areas. and that's one of the areas that we'll solve for in the next few months.
but we are very happy with the way that's going, and it is ahead of track. and i think it provides us with increased confidence that we can use it to support the rate of innovation, particularly for our top couple of dozen products.
stephanie yee -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. ok. great. and if i can just ask one more on practical law.
can you talk about the geography difference in terms of the traction you're gaining? so i think it had great adoption in the u.k. it was a little bit more nascent in the u.s. a few years ago. have you seen most of the pickup in adoption being in the u.s.? or can you just comment on kind of the geographic split in terms of the customer mix?
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes. i mean when we bought the company, it was a predominantly, if not entirely, u.k.-based offering. so it was built on practical know-how of u.k. law.
and one of the things that thompson reuters has been able to do is bring that to the united states and ramp it up very significantly. so we've done the same in other markets like australia and so forth. so i think a big -- it's an interesting proof point for us because it does suggest that we can take an acquired asset that's perhaps a bit constrained to a single market -- geographic market and we can really make -- create great great value by bringing it to other markets. i think the other example where we're well underway in doing that is highq, right, which we bought back in 2019.
and one of the things -- that's also a u.k.-focused legal workflow software offering. and some of the biggest growth we've seen for highq have been with law firms and general counsels' offices here in the united states. so we've taken that and replicated it with highq as well.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
stephanie, i'd add one additional dimension. you asked specifically about geography and maturity and penetration there. kind of a dual path there is the maturity level with law firms versus the general counsels that steve just referenced. we have stronger growth right now with general counsels as there's additional opportunity to further the penetration there.
so think of it as a dual access, stephanie, geographic expansion, but also general counsel versus law firm.
operator
and the next question is coming from aravinda galappatthige from canaccord genuity.
aravinda galappatthige -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
i wanted to ask you a little bit about sme exposure. i mean staying within the subject of some concerns around macro level slowdowns, i wanted to get a sense of how you're seeing sort of the traction in the sme space. and can you just update us or remind us about sort of the exposure you have to sme-level customers? and then a quick follow-up. to the extent that you can discuss this on westlaw edge 2.0, very generally, how much of a step-up are we talking about in terms of the product? obviously, that would sort of manifest itself in pricing and arpu as well.
but any kind of color you can provide on that front would be useful.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes. aravinda, i'll start and, michael, supplement here. so on sme, we have strong presence among small law firms, strong presence among small tax -- particularly small tax and accounting firms. we have, i think, modest but very promising presence among small to medium enterprises in the corporate sector.
so you have to sort of differentiate as to where you're talking about the professional services firms and their size versus the corporates. we think the sme sector itself, and that's within corporates, is led by an executive called brad roe. brad and his team are doing a good job, but it's a modest -- we have a modest starting point. we think there's lots of upside there.
we're not overly exposed to that segment should have taken disproportionate hit hitting more difficult economic climate. i'm sure michael will supplement that. just on westlaw edge, what we won't do today is to sort of go into any significant detail as to what that product is for sort of competitive reasons. but the sort of early testing we've done with customers is very, very promising and suggest that, that will sort of continue the trajectory that we and our customers have enjoyed in terms of westlaw edge 1.0 that 2.0 will be at least that sort of value add to customers and the experience they have with the product.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yes. aravinda, we plan to launch westlaw edge 2.0 in the second half of this year. at that time, paul fischer, president of legal professionals; david wong, our chief product officer, will do some external launches there with and will share more there. i think from a financial lens perspective, westlaw edge 1.0, we've been sharing consistently, has been generating about 100 basis points of organic growth for us very consistently over the last four years since we launched it in july of 2018.
we fully assume and we have strong confidence that westlaw edge 2.0 will continue that. so the 6% organic growth that legal has now achieved for four consecutive quarters, we believe, will continue for the full year '22 and into 2023. so we do not believe there will be any drop-off in legal professionals organic growth as we shift into westlaw edge 2.0.
operator
the next question is from toni kaplan from morgan stanley.
greg parrish -- morgan stanley -- analyst
this is greg parrish on for toni. congrats on the quarter. wanted to ask about government. it's been a strong growth driver for you for some time now.
can you talk about what's driving the strong growth, what you're expecting for the next few years and just maybe broadly about the sustainability of the growth?
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, greg. so look, i think what sort of drives the growth and will sustain the growth is an extraordinarily -- extraordinary and enduring set of relationships with key government agencies. steve rubley and his team have been out in a long time and have a fantastic set of relationships that are bipartisan, that are enduring, and they're built on trust and they're built on delivery.
so we think that, that sort of positioning and the growth trajectory are eminently sustainable. the business today includes a number of things, including the clear franchise, which is a unique data set and a unique franchise; thompson reuters special services, trss, who a security-cleared set of analysts very, very talented set of analysts with a track record of highly impactful work; and of course, the pondera acquisition that we made in 2020 among other things. we see real sort of growth and upside in all 3 of those. and in fact, we'd love to further invest in those businesses in the -- within the sort of rubric about risk, fraud & compliance broader franchise, both apply that to government agencies and to the corporate sector.
the last part of it is our -- it was the acquisition of caselines, which is the automation of the activities of courts. and we see lots of promise and activity outside of the united states, in the court systems. we see some inside the united states, states like arizona removed quite quickly. a number of other states court systems are sort of very much analog in their appearance today and are moving quite slowly toward a digital future.
so we'll be there with them and for them when they're ready. but certainly, the progress we've seen in the u.k., in canada and in places like south africa has been more robust in the court systems.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
greg, i'll add two additional points. westlaw is also a contributor to the government growth. steve rubley and team have done a great job with penetration of westlaw edge in at the state and federal level. and you specifically asked, greg, about sustainability in the next few years.
we have strong confidence there based on the visibility of current pipelines, product road maps, etc., at 9% organic growth for government in q1. we anticipate double-digit for the full year. and if you look into 2023, we would expect a similar 10%-type organic growth for government, greg.
greg parrish -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. that's very helpful. and for my follow-up, i wanted to talk about cross-sell. i think, mike, you talked about the 15% of your revenue being generated from cross-sell.
this is maybe a year ago that you said that, i guess. wondered -- maybe there's an update there. and then, i guess, broadly, where do you think that figure could get to over time? how big of a driver can it be? does digital self-serve, can that sort of bring that number higher? and then if you can just talk about kind of how much that can contribute to organic growth.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yes. greg, about 15 months ago, i shared that roughly 15% of our gross sales activity driven by cross-sell activity. that's in the 20% range today, greg, and we do see that continuing to rise. we've made additional investments in talent and tools and systems in regards to our commercial excellence, commercial policy area that will help fuel that.
a little early today, greg, for me to give you a long-term view on what it could be. but i can safely say i see sustained increased opportunity as we move over the time horizon in each of our segments there. you mentioned the digital self-serve. that will definitely help us with cross-sell activity, but also the work that we're doing with product, once again, with david wong, charlie claxton on the design side.
so i think as part of that product innovation, that's also an element of cross-sell that will definitely help us that, greg.
greg parrish -- morgan stanley -- analyst
congrats again.

thank you, greg.

and the next question is coming from douglas arthur from huber research.
douglas arthur -- huber research partners -- analyst
steve, a lot of your information services peers have lowered guidance for 2022. arguably, your business mix is a lot more resilient, as shown by your guidance change. so i guess the question is, on the margin, what sort of -- if some softness in demand develop later in the year in legal or corporates, particularly, what sort of areas would you be tracking to see if there was any softness in demand? i assume that's mostly on the project side.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes. i mean you have [inaudible]. it's worth remembering, 80% of our revenues are recurring. so i understand your question, but it is a very small portion of our business.
and that's not to say we're not focused on winning every customer every day and increasing our retention, taking price where we can and fundamentally improving the customer experience to sort of drive better nps and more receptivity to our innovation. we're focused on all those things. and i don't want to let the 80% recurring revenue sort of be a source of arrogance or complacency. it's not.
so please don't take that from my answer. but this is a business that provides an enormous amount of forward visibility. so i can't give you a good answer. i don't think there are particular areas that we look at and say that could be a problem.
reuters views, to the extent we're selling advertising, will involve -- will always involve a sort of a transactional nature to it and rise and fall as ad markets do. and print, of course, is in a long-term secular decline. and so we're always carefully monitoring sort of trajectory of that, and we see that being on a fairly manageable glide path at the moment. then our transactional revenue, yes, there's a degree of variability to it.
we had some benefits from that in the first quarter. but you have to remember, i mean, these are -- although they are transactional, they're essential sort of services and software and content for our customers. so much of it is not optional. so that gives us some confidence as well.

good day and welcome, everyone, to the thomson reuters first quarter 2022 earnings call. my name is matt, and i will be your operator today. [operator instructions] i'd like to advise all parties that this conference is being recorded. and with that, let me hand it over to gary bisbee, head of investor relations.
please go ahead, sir.
gary bisbee -- head of investor relations
thank you, matt. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2022 earnings call. i'm joined by our ceo, steve hasker; and our cfo, mike eastwood, each of whom will report our results and take your questions following their remarks. [operator instructions] throughout today's presentation, when we compare performance period on period, we discuss revenue growth rates before currency as well as on an organic basis.
we believe this provides the best basis to measure the underlying performance of our business. today's presentation contains forward-looking statements and non-ifrs financial measures. actual results may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties discussed in reports and filings that we provide from time to regulatory agencies. you may access these documents on our website or by contacting our investor relations department.
let me now turn it over to steve hasker. 
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
thank you, gary, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. before i begin with a review of our q1 results, i must recognize our reuters news colleagues and express our great appreciation for the difficult but important work that they are doing on the ground in ukraine to provide us all with unbiased and reliable news, video and imagery. their efforts, which come at significant personal risk, exemplify the best of our company purpose, which, as you know, is to inform the way forward and the principles of trust and transparency that all of us at thomson reuters aspire to achieve. now on to our q1 highlights.
i'm pleased to report that the momentum that built throughout 2021 continued in the first quarter of 2022 with both sales and revenue exceeding our expectations. four of our five business segments again recorded organic revenue growth of 6% or greater, and the total company organic revenues grew 7%. our big 3 business segments also grew 7% organically. we have growing conviction that our businesses are benefiting from a significant prevailing tailwind driven by a step change in the complexity of regulation and compliance in our legal, tax and risk-related markets.
the resulting need for trusted, accurate and actionable content and technology plays to our strengths as to the accelerating trends of digitization and changing ways of working. when combined with our change program progress to date and an increased focus on innovation, these tailwinds position us well to continue our recent momentum. due to the q1 revenue strength and healthy book of business or acv growth, we are raising our full year revenue outlook. we now see total revenue rising by 5.5% and big 3 revenue by 6.5%, up from our prior views of 5% and 6% to 6.5%, respectively.
we maintained our margin outlook as we continue to invest in our businesses and customer success and also absorb heightened inflationary pressures. overall, the strong start to the year provides confidence that we're on the right path to achieve our 2022 and 2023 targets. turning to our change program. we continue to make steady progress on key initiatives.
as of march 31, we've achieved annualized operating expense run rate savings of $305 million, and we're on a path to achieve $500 million by year-end and the full targeted $600 million by year-end 2023. and lastly, we remain in a strong position, ample capital capacity. we continue to assess inorganic opportunities to strengthen our big 3 customer markets. and share repurchases remain another option based on the timing of these inorganic opportunities.
now to the results for the quarter. first quarter reported revenues rose 6% with organic revenues up 7%. as mike will explain in more detail, our revenue growth benefited by close to 1% from transactional revenue that is unlikely to recur at this level and, to a lesser extent, timing. but even adjusting for these items, organic revenue grew at a healthy 6% driven by organic recurring revenue growth of 7%.
this recurring revenue growth is an improvement from 6% in q3 and q4 of 2021. adjusted ebitda increased to $600 million, reflecting 50 basis point margin improvement to 35.8%. excluding costs related to the change program, the adjusted ebitda margin was 37.9%. this strong performance resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $0.66, up $0.58 in the prior year period.
turning to first-quarter results by segment. the big 3 businesses achieved organic revenue growth of 7%, reflecting broad strength. legal continued its recent momentum, delivering a fourth consecutive quarter of 6% organic growth. the legal market remains healthy across all key sectors: small-, mid- and large-sized u.s.
firms, corporate general counsel, government clients in key overseas markets. for instance, westlaw edge adoption continues to drive revenue, and we continue to expect annual contract value, or acv, penetration to approach 75% of by year-end from 65% at the end of 2021. second, practical law as reported in the legal segment had a terrific quarter, growing mid-teens. we forecast this growth to continue for the remainder of the year, and i'll discuss practical law in more detail shortly.
third, our government business, which is managed within our legal segment, grew 9% organically in q1, and we see acceleration as likely in the balance of the year. fourth, our legal businesses in canada and asia also both grew organically at double-digit rates. turning to corporates. organic growth momentum continued with revenue up 8%.
while transactional revenue contribute, underlying growth trends continue the improvement seen in the second half of 2021. we remain confident in the corporate segment achieving 7% to 9% organic growth in 2023, as discussed during our march 2021 investor day. tax and accounting had another healthy quarter with organic revenue growth of 11% or 10% excluding the timing benefit of a return to historical tax filing deadlines. our latin american business, dominio, grew nearly 30% in the quarter and remains a key growth driver.
reuters news organic revenues increased 9% in q1. growth occurred across all lines of business, particularly benefiting from the segment's professional business, which includes digital advertising, custom content and reuters events and the increase in our london stock exchange group, lseg news agreement. finally, global print organic revenues flat compared with the prior period, which were better than expected due to higher third-party print revenues and timing benefits that we expect to normalize in the remainder of 2022. one other update.
we recently closed the acquisition of thoughttrace, which brings key talent and legal contract analysis technologies. we believe thoughttrace will accelerate our time to market with a key capability set in ai-based contract analysis, which we see as a powerful combination in our editorial content. we see these capabilities bolstering both our legal workflow and practical law offerings over time. we also recently closed the acquisition of gestta, an accounting-focused software provider in brazil that enhances client automation and integrates seamlessly with our dominio offering.
we welcome the thoughttrace and gestta teams to tr, and we look forward to working with them to build a very significant potential. in summary, we're very pleased with our results, and we're excited about the momentum building within our businesses. now let me take a few minutes to discuss several key contributors to the recent momentum in our legal professional segment and why we are confident in its forward prospects. i want to provide a bit more transparency around our legal professionals revenue mix and what is driving the strengthening performance.
as background, organic revenue growth of legal has accelerated 4% in 2018 and '19 to 6% in 2021 in q1 2022 driven by several factors. first, we have seen solid acceleration in recent years from our key westlaw brand, which has benefited from rising adoption of the higher-value westlaw offering. second, we have several other offerings within legal that are increasingly contributing to our growth. this includes three of our seven strategic growth focus areas: practical law; risk, fraud & compliance; legal workflow solutions.
in total, our non-westlaw businesses comprise nearly half of legal's revenue and a growing high single-digit base. like westlaw, these businesses have accelerated in recent years. looking forward, we remain confident in the growth potential of both westlaw and the non-westlaw offerings, supported by healthy market demand and a robust product roadmap. for westlaw, key drivers include continued penetration of the premium edge offering and the future launch of westlaw edge 2.0.
outside of westlaw, we expect continued double-digit growth from our rfc franchise, legal workflow and practical law offerings. as a result, we believe the positive mix shift toward the higher-growth non-westlaw offerings is likely to continue in the next few years, which we expect to sustain our recent revenue momentum. building upon this legal professional discussion, i will extend -- expand a little bit on practical law, which has been a terrific and, in many ways, underappreciated story and an important growth driver for our legal professionals and corporate segments. like westlaw, practical law provides strong value to both board rooms and corporate tenant councils through a plan premium content, technology and analytics.
our 650 practical law attorney editors to bring very significant practice experience problems over a broad range of practice areas, jurisdiction and industry sectors leveraging technology unique search capabilities and analytics. they create and maintain a wealth of know-how resources, including standard documents and clauses, how-to guides and explanations, checklists and legal and regulatory updates, among others. practical law has proven to be a key resource for both lawyers and corporate users as it helps these professionals work more effectively and efficiently with both law firms and corporations facing tight labor markets and cost pressures, the efficiency benefits of practical law resonate particularly well today. however, practical law's success is not a recent phenomenon.
since its acquisition by thomson reuters in 2013, practical law has grown revenue at a 16% compound annual growth rate, more than tripling in total. this includes mid-teens growth in both 2021 and q1 2022. today, the business approaches $500 million in revenue with roughly 60% in legal professionals to 40% corporates. looking forward, we remain bullish on practical law's potential.
we expect revenue growth to continue. in addition to opportunities to further penetrate both the law firm and corporate markets, deep product innovation and content enhancements are key drivers. this includes two recent major upgrades, featuring both enhanced and expanded content, technology and analytics. we recently launched the global customer experience, which brings expanded international editorial content, global product integration and an improved user experience.
also, the practical law dynamic package that launched last summer brings incremental content, improved search capabilities and advanced enhanced analytics. in both cases, the expanded content enhanced capabilities command a premium price point, which like the westlaw edge rollout, should contribute nicely to growth as adoption is expected to increase over the next few years. with meaningful white space in both the legal and corporate markets, executing our go-to-market strategies remains another key driver practical. slide 12 illustrates the broad appeal of practical law across customer performance personas.
rather than going through these details, i'll wrap up my commentary by explaining a real-world example of how practical law can drive meaningful roi on law firm customers. in our scenario, a large corporate client needs to understand non-compete laws in all 50 states. with a modest labor and employment practice, an associate lawyer is assigned to research statutes and case laws and prepare a 50-state survey on noncompetes. this associate could easily spend in excess of 100 hours on this project with a partner spending several more reviewing the work.
the same work with practical law would take 4 hours. and using the quick compare tool from the practical law dynamic package, the law firm could illustrate the findings in a compelling visual schematic. this example illustrates the efficiency and accuracy benefits from practical law can be very significant. we believe they provide a growing tailwind for demand given rising pressure on law firms to do more with less while managing increasing risk and complexity.
let me now turn it over to mike, who will provide more details on the first-quarter financial results.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
thank you, steve, and thanks for joining us today. as a reminder, i will talk to revenue growth before currency and on an organic basis. let me start by discussing the first quarter revenue performance of our big 3 segments. revenues rose 7% organically and at constant currency for the quarter.
this marks the fourth consecutive quarter our big 3 segments have grown at least 6%. legal professionals total revenues increased 5% and organic revenues increased 6%. organic growth was driven by practical law, findlaw and our government rfc business. westlaw edge continues to add about 100 basis points to legal's organic growth rate, is maintaining a healthy premium and is expected to continue to contribute at a similar level going forward, supported by the planned release of westlaw edge 2.0 during the second half of this year.
in our corporate segment, total and organic revenues increased 8% for the quarter with both recurring and transactional growing 8%. corporate growth benefited from transactional revenue strength that is unlikely to recur at q1 levels. however, recurring revenue growth of 8% continues the momentum that began in the second half of 2021. recurring revenue was driven by clear, practical law and indirect tax.
and finally, tax and accounting's total and organic first-quarter revenues grew 11% with latin america, again, leading the momentum. please note the return to april tax filing deadlines last from may in 2021 increased growth by approximately 1.5%, which were the first in q2. moving to reuters news. total and organic revenues increased 9%, primarily due to our professional business and the increase in our lseg use agreement.
lastly, global brand total and organic revenues were flat to prior year period, ahead of expectations. higher third-party revenues for printing services and timing of new sales drove the outperformance, but we expect both to normalize in the remainder of 2022. on a consolidated basis, first quarter total and organic revenues each increased 7%. one last note on revenue.
as it relates to the russia-ukraine conflict, our exposure to the region is immaterial at less than $10 million annually. turning to our profitability. adjusted ebitda for the big 3 segments was $584 million, up 11% from the prior year period, a 42.9% margin, rising 190 basis points. improvement was driven by legal and tax and accounting due to higher revenues and change program savings.
i will remind you the change program operating costs are reported at the corporate level. moving to reuters news. adjusted ebitda was $37 million, $9 million more than the prior year period, driven primarily by revenue growth. global print's adjusted ebitda was $53 million with a margin of 37%, a decline of 290 basis points due to the dilutive impact of lower-margin third-party rent revenue.
in aggregate, total company adjusted ebitda was $600 million, a 7% increase versus q1 2021. excluding costs related to the change program in both periods, adjusted ebitda increased 11%. the first quarter's adjusted ebitda margin was 35.8% or 37.9% on an underlying basis, excluding cost related to the change program. moving on to earnings per share.
first-quarter adjusted eps was $0.66, up from $0.58 in the prior-year period. the increase was mainly driven by higher adjusted ebitda. let me now turn to our free cash flow performance for the first quarter. reported free cash flow was $86 million versus $239 million in the prior year period.
consistent with previous quarters, this slide removes the distorting factors impacting our free cash flow. working from the bottom of the page of. the cash outflows from the discontinued operations component of our free cash flow was $22 million more than the prior-year period. this was due to payments to the u.k.
tax authority related to the operations of our former preventative business. also in the current quarter, we made $114 million of change program payments as compared to $12 million in the prior year period. if you adjust for these items, comparable free cash flow from continuing operations was $259 million, $29 million lower than the prior-year period, primarily due to annual incentive plan bonuses. we reaffirm our 2022 full year free cash flow outlook of approximately $1.3 billion.
speaking of our free cash flow, i wanted to provide an update to a disclosure we initially made at our 2018 investor day. we continue to expect our free cash flow to exceed our adjusted earnings by a comfortable margin as it has in recent years. this pattern of converting more than 100% of our adjusted earnings into free cash flow backs up well versus our information services peers and indicates a high-quality earnings stream as the earnings are more than backed up our free cash flow. three factors drive the strong conversion.
first, we expect our capital expenditures will be less than our depreciation and amortization by approximately $140 million to $170 million in 2023 as the reduction in capital intensity has a quicker impact to free cash flow due to the timing of the depreciation runoff. second, we expect our cash taxes to be lower than our p&l taxes by approximately $100 million to $150 million in 2023. as mentioned last quarter, we expect our effective tax rate to decline to the upper teens in 2023. and as a rule of thumb, our cash tax rate is forecast to be approximately below our effective tax rate.
lastly, we expect $25 million to $50 million of miscellaneous items that drive the variance between the p&l and free cash flow. we expect annual pension cash contributions to be lower than annual pension expense. in addition, expenses related to our employee stock purchase plan and equity-based compensation has no impact on free cash flow. we also expect to receive dividend from lseg that are part of our free cash flow.
i will now provide an update on the progress related to our change program. in the first quarter, we achieved $88 million of annual run rate operating expense savings. this brings the cumulative annual run rate change program operating expense savings to $305 million. this increases our confidence in reaching approximately $500 million of annualized savings by year-end and $600 million gross operating expense savings by 2023.
as a reminder, we anticipate reinvesting $200 million of the projected $600 million of savings back into the business for net savings of $400 million. now an update on our change program costs for the first quarter and remainder of 2022. let me start by saying none of the annual estimates have changed from what we provided last quarter. expenditure during the fourth quarter was $62 million, comprised of $34 million of opex and $28 million of capex.
we anticipate $130 million to $150 million of total spend in the first half and $160 million to $180 million in the second half of 2022. for the full year, we continue to expect $305 million of change program investments, which would bring total 2021 and 2022 cumulative investments to approximately $600 million. we also continue to anticipate a split of approximately 60% opex and 40% capex. let me conclude with our outlook for 2022 and 2023.
as steve outlined, we have increased our full year 2022 outlook for total tr and big 3 revenue growth. we now forecast total organic revenue rising by approximately 5.5% and big 3 by approximately 6.5%, up from the prior 5% and 6% to 6.5%, respectively. we are maintaining our adjusted ebitda margin outlook of approximately 35% as we continue to monitor potential inflationary impacts and assess investment opportunities to drive continued success and revenue momentum. there is no change to other 2022 outlook items, and we reaffirm our 2023 targets.
looking to the second quarter. we expect revenue growth for total tr and the big 3 to be comparable to our updated full-year forecast of approximately 5.5% and 6.5%, respectively. we expect our adjusted ebitda margin to be approximately 200 basis points below the full-year outlook of approximately 35% due to the normal seasonality in our tax and accounting segment and the cadence of change program investments. we also see our effective tax rate at the midpoint of our 19% to 21% full-year range.
in summary, we remain confident in achieving our 2022 and 2023 targets, aided by the strong start to the year and healthy underlying momentum in our key businesses. over time, we continue to believe we can achieve faster revenue growth, higher profitability and significantly higher free cash flow as we benefit from transforming to a content-driven technology company. let me now turn it back to gary for questions.

[operator instructions] and the first one is coming from toni kaplan of morgan stanley.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
to raise the '22 organic growth guidance by 50 basis points, which is great to have a few quarters in a row of raising the guidance there, so congrats on that. i noticed you didn't raise '23. is that conservatism or concern about potential recession in '23? or do you just need to go through your in-depth planning process first? just what drove sort of the decision not to raise '23?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yes. it's more of the latter, toni. we certainly remain very confident in delivering on our 2022 updated guidance. we remain confident in delivering on our 2023 targets as we provided.
we're very confident in our team. we're very confident in our execution, but we think it's very prudent given the various macro factors to wait to complete our full-year planning process in the next few months. and we look forward to providing an update on our 2023 guidance in february. but based on the first half of the year, the strength of our underlying book of business and the execution of our sales and go-to-market team, the execution against our change program, confidence is very high.
but it's more what you mentioned, toni, in regards to going through the planning process and being very prudent in assessing the macro factors, but all signals are very positive.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes. toni, it's steve. just adding to that. so mike and dave larsen conduct our qbr fully business review process, and that comes in late september, october.
and as you know, we have 80% of our revenue is recurring. we have a very high percentage of multiyear contracts across our big three segments. so we've got good visibility, but we want to get through that process and be very diligent about it before we make any sort of further predictions.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
just one additional point there, toni, in regards to that getting through the plan process. you mentioned also, as we complete the year, the visibility to steve's point at 80% is recurring in nature. our book of business will have good line of sight as we complete q3 and q4, which will give us a good visibility as we go into the february earnings call.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. and hoping you could sort of talk about, has the macro changed? have any client conversation?
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
toni, thanks for the question. so as you know, we like to spend an enormous amount of time with customers and getting a deeper and deeper understanding of their businesses. i think based on my conversations with the heads of small, medium, large law firms, tax and accounting firms and some of our corporate and government customers, i would say that to date, their results have been pretty solid. i mean, the law firms had record results in 2021.
and so far, in 2022, they've seen pretty robust demand through their litigation practices through their restructuring. the corporate practices are a bit soft, fewer ipos, fewer debt issuance. but i think the -- our customer base has the same stance that we have, which is sort of proud of results to date, but i think a bit of healthy paranoia as to what might come next and just watching very, very carefully for some early signs of softness. but we haven't seen it yet, and most of our customers haven't seen it yet either.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yes. toni, i would supplement with two additional points that we monitor our renewal rates or retention rates. retention rates are slightly higher in 2022 thus far than 2021. as a reminder, we have a lot of multiyear contracts and also on the pricing front, our pricing is slightly higher in 2022 versus 2021.
and then the third quantitative measure is our sales pipelines that we monitor with all of our segments, subsegments and regions. do we have a second question?
operator
yes. we do. ad that is coming from the line of tim casey of bmo.
tim casey -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yes. two for me. just quickly, i know it looks like you did an acquisition in the quarter. could you just talk a little bit about what happened there? and, steve, a question for you, just a recurring one really.
just wondering if you can give us an update on your assessment of the -- i guess, the progress you've made and the shortcomings to date of your initiative to improve really the customer experience? i know that's been a primary focus and things like customer interfaces and whatnot. what's your assessment of where you are on that journey?
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, tim. great question. so our most recent acquisition was of a business called thoughttrace, which is based in houston, texas, run by a very talented executive by the name of nick vandivere.
thoughttrace, we think, is the leading ai-driven contract analysis tool. nick and his team are focused today on oil and gas, particularly oil and gas leasing contract. but we've done a lot of work with them prior to the closing of the acquisition and as you can imagine, an awful lot more since closing the acquisition as to how we can extend that capability into a broader set of commercial verticals. so whether that's financial services or pharmaceutical or you name it, we're looking at it.
and so it's a small acquisition for us. it's very much at the cutting edge and the application of ai and machine learning to our unique content, but we like to look at that. and emily colbert and kriti sharma from our teams, among others, have been focused on building that out. the second part of your question with relation to the change program.
look, it's a complicated program with many moving parts, as you know, tim, but we have spent a good chunk of the $600 million onetime investment. mike talked about the run rate savings that are accruing from that and how it positions us for 2023. so from a financial standpoint, the change program is in great shape, and it's delivering what we expected it to. i think the sort of components that are going among a number of the components that are going very well would be our cloud conversion, firstly.
secondly, the progress that jason escaravage, cyber leader, has made in terms of addressing our strengths around cyber fraud and compliance. thirdly, digital assist. so the idea that a customer will have a whole series of digital sales support and renewal capabilities. they have been well received and are very popular.
and then last but not least, we've done a lot of work on our location strategy and where we want our go-to-market talent, where we want our product and engineering talent and so on and so forth. and that that's being led by kirsty and her teams and is doing well, too. i would say we still have a lot to get done through the balance of this year and into next. and mainly, it's converting these investments and capabilities into customer satisfaction.
i think there are pockets where the customers are really starting to see it, and there are other customers where they're not yet. and so we're laser-focused on that conversion. and i'd call out our go-to-market leaders for navigating their way through this environment with the backdrop of the pandemic, the backdrop of inflation and increasingly, economic unease, an enormous amount of change and disruption being driven by the change program. and yet, our price has gone up a little bit, our renewal has gone up a little bit, and our organic growth is headed in the right direction notwithstanding all of the disruptions and turmoil that we've imposed on ourselves.
so i'd say the punchline, tim, is so far so good on the change program with lots of work left to do.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yes. tim, i'll just add one additional data point in regards to the cloud migration. we provided back in february that we had 37% of our revenue available in the cloud at the end of 2021. at the end of june, we were 47%.
we forecast to be at 60% by the end of '22, and we remain confident in being at 90% by the end of 2023, which is consistent with our prior estimates. nica, additional questions?
operator
the next question is coming from the line of kevin mcveigh of credit suisse.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
congratulations on the results. i guess, steve or mike, the 50 basis point boost to the organic growth guidance, was that pricing, retention, a little bit of everything? or i guess, what gave you the confidence to do that, number one. and then can you talk about retention just a little finer in terms of maybe upmarket versus down versus mid, and you're starting to see any initial benefits from the change program around retention?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
sure, kevin. let me focus on the guidance question first. the increase in 50 basis points for total tr and the big three was really driven by the underlying performance and health of the business. prices included therein, but price is up only slightly, kevin, in 2022 versus 2021.
that will continue to increase as we progress in '22 and '23, given the multiyear contracts, as i mentioned earlier, in regards to toni's question there, so primarily the underlying health of the business. the book of business that we have, kevin, at june 30, coupled with the pipeline for the remainder of the year, were really the drivers for us increasing our guidance by the 50 basis points. in regards to retention, we're seeing slight increases across the firm, but we still have significant opportunity on a weighted average basis using revenue as the benchmark, not number of customers. but based on revenue, we're slightly over 91%.
so we continue to have a lot of opportunity to improve our retention and the time horizon as we continue to address the underlying customer experience items that tim addressed during his questions there. so a little bit of improvement in price, a little improvement in retention, but we continue to have opportunity in retention. and just a reminder, kevin, our recurring revenue growth rate, we're forecasting at 7% for the full year. each quarter is roughly 7% rounded.
so a couple of quarters a little higher, a couple of quarters a little lower. as we go into q3, q4, the comps are a little higher. so hopefully, that's helpful, kevin. nica, please?
operator
next we have a question from aravinda galappatthige of canaccord genuity.
aravinda galappatthige -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
steve, when you talked about the m&a criteria, you touched on the legal software and workflow space. can you just sort of revisit the size of that market? i know that it's encumbered right now seemingly by some mid-tier companies. are you kind of looking at that space as sort of simply just being large enough, and you being positioned to kind of take share there? or do you even look at sort of the industry participants as relatively weaker, and that kind of gives tri even maybe some incremental opportunity? just wanted to get your sort of expanded thoughts there. and then secondly, just with respect to 2023, maybe for mike, when you think about inflation, i mean, obviously, you have a significant labor component.
can you just talk about how that changes the puts and takes there, recognizing, of course, that there may be some opportunities to sort of move rates around as well on the recurring -- on the subscription front? any color would be helpful there.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, aravinda. let me quickly address the first point. so as you know, we've got a pretty robust pipeline of m&a that we're looking at.
we're optimistic that the valuations are coming our way versus the other way around, but we'll be very rigorous, very disciplined and patient about going after them. focused on automation, workflow automation tools that drive efficiency and take many hours out of key tasks for our legal, tax and accounting and risk, fraud and compliance, government customers, that's really the sort of area of focus also with an eye to some selected international expansions. within legal, yes, look, we're very bullish. what we see is an industry that is at the start of a transformation.
and it's an information- and tech-driven transformation. so for many years, the legal profession has been reasonably slow to move and slow to adopt technologies. and we've seen that change pretty markedly coming out of the pandemic. so every head of a law firm is asking us the questions around how can our tools, how can our research content and our tools combined help them be less reliant on hiring new lawyers or additional lawyers to drive growth.
so they want to create a different set of economics and a different vibe within their firm. and we're one of the few players that's well positioned to take advantage of that. so as we look at the life cycle management, document management, further workflow tools, we see a pretty big opportunity. and the tam is growing in a meaningful way because traditionally, it's a profession that's underspent on information and technology and arguably overspent on real estate.
and that is being addressed pretty aggressively by the leading firms. we think it provides a pretty big opportunity. so that's a few thoughts on the first part of your question.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yes. aravinda, on the second part of the question in regards to 2023 and inflation, i would say both for 2022 and for our 2023 guidance based on how we see inflation of top line and bottom line, we have fully incorporated our current view into '22 and '23 guidance. to your point there on labor, we certainly provided higher merit increases in 2022. we're working very closely with our hr team, chief people officer in regards to 2023 there.
but we think we factored in the appropriate increases for the labor cost. the other element of inflation that we monitor with jennifer prescott leading the print businesses, paper, print and postage, we've certainly received incurred some inflationary increases on the cost there, but we've been able to offset majority of that with our pricing. so managing pricing coupled with the increased labor cost and other costs. we think we're managing all of those aspects very well.
as you mentioned, there are a lot of puts and takes. but with those puts and takes, we think we've fully incorporated them into our guidance for '22 and '23. nica?
operator
the next question is coming from the line of heather balsky of bank of america.
heather balsky -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i was curious if you can just talk about some of the sort of incremental areas you're investing in. you talked about on the margin keeping kind of guidance the same for opportunity to invest. what are the organic opportunities you're most excited about?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yes. i'll start with that, heather. first, i would say that we're continuing to invest in our change program where we've centered that on improving our customer experience. i think steve itemized a number of items earlier that involved the change program.
so i'd say first, we're continuing to execute that. a lot of lifting still in q3, q4. but i think the team has a very good glide path to work on the change program items. in regards to other areas of investment, i would highlight our product and engineering.
first, our westlaw edge 2.0, which will be released later this year within legal. that's an important area for us. practical law that we highlighted during our may 3 earnings call, practical law helps both our law firm customers and also our general counsel customers within corporate. risk, fraud and compliance, as steve discussed today, impacts both our government customers and also our corporate customers is another area steve referenced earlier, certainly highq that we acquired back in july of 2019 is a key area for us.
over within our tax and accounting professionals business, ultra tax that i referenced during the prepared remarks today, confirmation that we acquired in july of 2019 continues to perform incredibly well under elizabeth beastrom's leadership. we also have leverage there within our corporate customers. so outside of our change program, heather, the key focus for us is in regards to investing in our products to help our customers there. and it's very balanced across our portfolio, including within our latin america region and also asia and emerging markets.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes. i mean, it's -- if you go back to our investor day presentations at the start of last year, we talked about seven growth initiatives. we continue to invest behind those because we're seeing good results, and we're excited about where they can take us.
heather balsky -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
helpful. and as a follow-up, when you think of 2023, if there is a downturn, if you were to see some sort of sales impact on the margin side, you have the benefit of the cost cutting with change program. but more broadly, how are you thinking about margins and the things you can control?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yes. i think, heather, for '23, we remain confident in achieving our guidance of 39% to 40%. in regards to any revenue headwinds, where we would potentially see those first would be in transactional revenue, which includes our reuters events. i'd say reuters events is having an incredibly good year, over $20 million of revenue in q2 for us there.
transactional certainly did well in the first half of the year. as i mentioned, we expect it to normalize in the second half for us. but for margin, 39% to 40% back to our aravinda's point, we have lots of puts and takes that we can manage and pull. and we feel confident in delivering 39% to 40% in 2023.
and we have enough levers to effectively manage through while supporting our employees and our customers.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes. not -- heather, not to be flippant about it, but should we head into a recession, be it a broad and deep one or a relatively shallow one, we view it as an opportunity, an unequivocal opportunity to emerge stronger relative to our customers and be better able to -- relative to our competitors and better able to serve our customers. we have no. 1 and no.
2 positions in just about every market in which we operate. and we think a more difficult economic backdrop will provide us with an opportunity to further those leads, which should it happen, we'll be looking forward to.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yes. heather, back to your first questions on areas of investment. i think the areas of investments just intentionally make it stronger as we go through '22 and certainly position us, to steve's point, for '23. so we think they go hand in hand.
nica?
operator
next, we have a question from the line of drew mcreynolds of rbc.
drew mcreynolds -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
late coming on to the call, so i apologize if you've covered this off. maybe mike, just an update on westlaw edge 2.0, if that's still on track for some launch in the back half of this year. and maybe a bigger picture question. it's my understanding in terms of comps and internal ai and machine learning capabilities, you went down that path many, many years ago.
and obviously, you're leveraging it into products like westlaw edge. just wondering, as the ai and machine learning markets have evolved over the last five or six years, could you speak to your internal capabilities to keep pace with that kind of innovation versus your m&a strategy where you look to different companies with these capabilities perhaps to backfill your own internal kind of innovation machine. so sorry for the kind of broad motherhood big picture question, but just curious just what you just acquired in the quarter.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
drew, great questions. let me tackle westlaw edge 2.0. drew, we confirm that we will launch westlaw edge 2.0 in the second half of this year. steve and i have had multiple sessions, demos from andy martens, mike dane, paul fischer, david wong, in the last few weeks.
i think you'll be incredibly pleased. more importantly, our customers will be super pleased when we launch it later this year. so fully on target there. in the meantime, drew, the team, our go-to-market team within legal professionals and corporates, they continue to work with our customers on westlaw edge 1.0.
we're approaching 70% penetration with westlaw edge 1.0, but 2.0 will definitely launch later this year, drew. and look forward to sharing it with all of you and our customers. i think steve will address the ai/ml question.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes. so we have a couple of hundred ai and ml and world-class experts in tr labs. and so those folks are spread throughout the world. there's quite a number of them here in toronto.
there are a number in london, in new york into -- and in other operating centers like msp and another in dallas. and we're very proud of the work they do. they have been instrumental in westlaw edge 1.0 and have been, i think, even more influential as we think about the launch of 2.0. so the proof is there.
i think we are keeping up with a changing environment, if not outrunning it, which is obviously no mean feat. and the opportunity for us is to along the lines of being a content-driven technology company is to increasingly add ai, machine learning to our unique content and best-of-breed software. we've done more of that in the legal professionals area, but we are starting to ramp those efforts up across the portfolio, including in tax and accounting and risk, fraud and compliance, among others.
drew mcreynolds -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
super. and maybe one last quick one. back to you, steve. just you spoke about taking advantage of your no.
1, no. 2 positions in a downturn. just before we get to that phase, as your kind of peers coming out of covid and not that these are only your peers, but wolters kluwer and relx, are you seeing any change in their capabilities, their ability to execute on all the things they're trying to capitalize on post covid? just any change in the competitive dynamic, that would be great.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
no, drew. as you know, we have towering respect for our traditional competitors and the new and emerging competitors. so we don't take it lightly, and without doing it, we do keep abreast of what they're up to. i don't discern any meaningful change in competitive intensity or rate of innovation from our customers at the moment, but we'll stay on top of that.
operator
next, we have a question from andrew steinerman of j.p. morgan.
stephanie yee -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
it's stephanie stepping in for andrew. thanks for all the color you provided on the corporates segment. i was wondering if you can talk about your positioning in indirect tax relative to competitors in the marketplace. is thomson gaining market share in that area?
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, stephanie. so our indirect tax proposition, i would say, in terms of its size is not a no. 1 or no.
2 to the earlier points made but is closer to three or four. so we tend to compete at the high end of the market with vertex. and i think we're holding our own or a bit better there. it is one of the seven -- so one of our seven growth verticals that we announced at investor day last year.
so we've been investing in it and building the capability and the team, and we're proud of the efforts. [inaudible] in a different territory. they've come from the smb space, but are trying to move up the scales there. and of course, sovos, which is private equity owned, have a pretty robust portfolio.
it's a somewhat fragmented portfolio but a robust portfolio. so i think this is an area where we're seeing robust growth -- industry growth in the mid-teens. we're matching that, but we'd like to -- we'd certainly like to have a bigger, more robust presence and move into a no. 1 or no.
2 position over time. and we'll be sort of thoughtful and rigorous about how we might get there.
operator
and so the next question is coming from the line of scott fletcher of cibc.
scott fletcher -- cibc world markets -- analyst
i just have a question on the sales cycle and the impact of macro headwinds and your comments around sort of that healthy paranoia and whether it's extending sales cycles, given some more scrutiny on or different levels of review as you go through the new sales cycle.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yes, scott, thank you. in regards to the sales cycle, we're not -- we're watching it, as you can imagine, incredibly closely with all of our segment leaders and subsegment leaders there. we're not seeing any noticeable change right now in the length of our sales cycle.the one that's probably the trickiest for us is within our government business, and it's really nothing new. but just given the government procurement process, it's a little bit more variable in nature, a little bit less predictable than our other businesses right now.
but we're not seeing any significant change right now in the sales cycle or length thereof.i do credit, scott, our sales team for that, both our direct sales reps, but also account managers, client managers, customer success managers, all the different resources that we apply to supporting our customers there. but that's one that we're watching closely, and we'll keep you updated in future quarters.
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes. and the other thing to note is that we're investing in our growth initiatives, particularly around tools that drive efficiency. the conversations remain very healthy with customers, where they can see a tangible, measurable increase in their own efficiency. so fewer hours required to achieve core tasks, fewer bodies required to achieve core tasks.
that's really a big area of focus. and that embraces westlaw and practical law, highq, thoughttrace and extends into our tax and accounting propositions.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yes, scott. two additional points i would mention just in the last two and a half years, i think our teams, sales, go-to-market teams have done a hell of a job adjusting in this hybrid environment, virtual environment, supporting our customers that way. we do have our annual meeting with our sales leaders coming up in mid-august. that will give us additional time to get direct impact.
but right now, we're not seeing any significant change, scott.
operator
the next question is coming from -- yes, sorry. we have a question from manav patnaik of barclays.
unknown speaker
this is brendan on for manav. just wanted to ask real quick on the guidance. obviously, revenue is up 50 bps twice over the last two guidance increases. you kept margin at 35%.
just want to -- is the bias there or simply just a bit higher costs from cost from inflation or investments? or how should we think about that?
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
yes. three items i would mention, brendan. first is certainly we have made incremental investments. you're specifically focused on margin, but we've made incremental investments in both opex and capex as we see opportunities to sustain and accelerate our organic revenue.
secondly, to your point, brendan, certainly, inflation. here, i think we're doing a good job managing the puts and takes, as i've discussed earlier, but certainly inflationary pressures is one that we're watching very closely. and then thirdly, i would mention we're being very prudent, eyes wide open on macro factors just during the remainder of the year. so i think the convergence of those three items that we're closely monitoring and investing in are the reasons why we maintained the margin at approximately 35% for the full year.
but we're confident in delivering on that, brendan.
operator
and the last question is coming from the line of douglas arthur of huber.
douglas arthur -- huber research partners -- analyst
steve, just a sort of big picture question. when you talk about technology work solution adoption at the big law firms, among others, is that enhanced by sort of a generational change in the leadership? i mean, i think of some of the old-time law partners that i know, and if you walk into their office and start talking about ai and cloud-based solutions, they look at you blankly. so -- but there does seem to be a younger group of managers, and i'm wondering if that's sort of accelerating adoption?
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
yes, doug. it is for sure. i mean, if you sort of looked at our business 5 or 10 years ago, you'd see on the research side, a knowledge -- chief knowledge officer or a librarian who was very much the sort of gatekeeper and curator of the research content for the practicing attorneys. now more and more, the attorneys themselves would look direct into our products, and they're very adept at doing so and providing us feedback.
and we do our best to incorporate that feedback into subsequent releases. so i think that is very much the trend. the other thing that occurred during covid among the senior most longest-tenured lawyers, including managing partners, because they went to work from home for the first time in their careers. and as one of them joked with me, he said, ""i become my own it guy, right? so i didn't have a clue how to do any of the stuff for the pandemic and now have no choice."" and i think -- so even the longest tenured folks are starting to adopt technologies and getting much more comfortable with directly using our products.
and that's a really healthy dynamic for our business because the more users are directly exposed to the experience and as we invest behind charlie claxton and our ux and design teams to improve that, we think the stickiness of those products goes up, and the chances of renewal at healthy price increments goes up, too.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
i think, nica, i think that's the last question. we really appreciate everyone's time today.
operator
thank you very much, everyone. that concludes your conference call for today. you may now disconnect. thank you for joining, and enjoy the rest of your day.

operator
good day, everyone, and welcome to the q2 2022 earnings call hosted by gary bisbee, head of investor relations. my name is nica, and i'm your operator today. [operator instructions] i would like to advise all parties that this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. and with that, i'd like to hand the floor to gary.
please go ahead.
gary bisbee -- head of investor relations
thank you. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for thomson reuters second quarter 2022 earnings call. i'm joined today by our ceo, steve hasker; and our cfo, mike eastwood, each of whom will discuss our results and take your questions following their remarks. [operator instructions] throughout today's presentation, when we compare performance period-on-period, we discuss revenue growth rates before currency as well as on an organic basis.
we believe this provides the best basis to measure the underlying performance of the business. today's presentation contains forward-looking statements and non-ifrs financial measures. actual results may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties discussed in reports and filings that we provide from time to time to regulatory agencies. you may access these documents on our website or by contacting our investor relations department.
let me now turn it over to steve hasker. 
steve hasker -- chief executive officer
thank you, gary, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. now on to our q2 highlights. i'm pleased to report the momentum that has been building in our businesses continued in the second quarter with healthy sales and revenue ahead of our expectations. four of our five business segments again recorded organic revenue growth of 6% or greater, and total company organic revenues rose 7%.
our big three business segments also grew 7% organically. we see internal and external drivers of our improving momentum. solid execution and efforts to better prioritize investments toward our best opportunities have contributed. and we're starting to benefit from meaningful tailwinds driven by a step change in complexity of regulation and compliance in our legal, tax and risk-related markets.
we believe these tailwinds are in the early innings and position us well to continue our recent momentum over the next few years. due to the q2 revenue strength and healthy book of business or annual contract value growth, we are raising our full-year revenue outlook. we now expect to see total revenue rising by 6% and big three revenue by 7%, up from our prior views of 5.5% and 6.5%, respectively. we maintain our margin outlook as we continue to invest in our businesses and also absorb heightened inflationary pressures.
overall, the strong first half provides confidence that we're on the right path to achieve our 2022 and 2023 targets. while market concerns around slowing economic growth and inflation have increased, our business is well positioned. our momentum through q2 was strong, and leading indicators remain healthy. and we're blessed with a resilient business.
80% of our revenue is recurring, and we operate in historically stable and growing end markets. we also benefit from our change program efforts, which will significantly boost our margins, cash flow and earnings in 2023. our capital capacity and liquidity remain a key asset that we are focused on reinvesting to create shareholder value. we took an important step in early june with the announcement of a $2 billion share repurchase program.
through july 31, we've purchased $394 million of our shares, and we look to complete the program within 10 months. we also continue to assess inorganic opportunities and expect to have ample capacity for both buybacks and strategic m&a. as a reminder, our acquisition focus includes workflow software and automation in our legal and tax markets and risk, fraud and compliance and targeted international expansion. for example, in legal professionals, we see a sizable opportunity to play a critical role in the tech-driven transformation of the legal profession.
we are uniquely positioned to provide customers with a smarter, seamless experience through the combination of our highly differentiated research content and expertise with workflow software. the ai-driven contract analysis capabilities we gained through the recent thoughttrace acquisition is a step in this direction and builds upon unique capabilities like practical law and highq. we continue to assess both organic and inorganic opportunities to further expand our capabilities and integrate our leading content with workflow solutions that drive automation and better outcomes for our customers, particularly around legal documents and contract drafting. now to the results for the quarter.
second-quarter reported revenues grew 5% with organic revenues up 7%. organic recurring revenue again grew 7% with organic transactional revenue up a robust 13%, aided by a calendar shift and the return to in-person events at our reuters events business. while we expect transactional revenue growth to moderate in the second half, we see recurring revenue momentum continuing. adjusted ebitda increased to $561 million, reflecting 200 basis points margin improvement to 34.7%.
excluding costs related to the change program, the adjusted ebitda margin was 36.6%. this strong performance resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $0.60, up from $0.48 in the prior-year period. turning to the second quarter results by segments. the big three businesses achieved organic revenue growth of 7%, reflecting broad strength.
legal continued its recent momentum, delivering a fifth consecutive quarter of 6% organic growth. the legal market remains healthy across all key segments: small, mid- and large-sized u.s. firms, government customers and in key overseas markets. for example, westlaw edge adoption continues to drive revenue, and we continue to expect annual contract value penetration to approach 75% by year-end from 65% at the end of 2021.
second, practical law, which contributes to growth in both corporates and legal segments, continued a strong performance with a quarter of double-digit revenue growth. and third, our government business grew 8% organically, and we see acceleration as likely in the balance of the year. turning to corporates. organic growth momentum continued with revenue up 9%.
recurring revenue rose a robust 9%, and transactional revenue again exceeded our expectations in writing 8%. i will discuss our corporates business in more detail shortly. tax and accounting had another strong quarter with organic revenue growth of 9%. our latin america business called dominio grew nearly 30% in the quarter and remains a key growth driver.
reuters news organic revenues increased 12% in q2. growth occurred across all lines of reuters business. events, in particular, was a key driver. and finally, global print organic revenues declined 1%, which was better than expected due to higher third-party print revenues and timing benefits that we expect to normalize in the remainder of 2022.
in summary, we're very pleased with these results, and we're excited about the momentum that's building within our businesses. now let me take a few minutes to discuss our corporates segment and our risk, fraud and compliance businesses and why we are confident in the growth prospects of both. as we did last quarter, i'd like to provide some incremental transparency around our portfolio with a brief discussion of our corporates segment and our risk, fraud and compliance or rfc businesses. beginning with corporates, some brief background may be useful.
the segment was formed in the fourth quarter of 2018 to better serve, innovate for and penetrate corporate users for our key legal, tax and rfc offerings. corporates is the no. 1 provider of both legal and tax solutions for corporations in the united states and serves all of the fortune 100. momentum has built nicely over the last year with corporates organic revenue growth accelerating from 4% in the first half of 2021 to 6% in the second half and 8% in the first half of this year.
for full year 2022, we are confident in achieving the 7% to 9% organic growth target we previously set for 2023. so what's driving this momentum? we see strong growth from a range of offerings across all three product areas. key double-digit growers, which are circled in green on the slide, include indirect tax and confirmation from our tax portfolio, practical law and highq from legal and clear from rfc, among others. in total, double-digit growers in our corporates product portfolio comprised 39% of segment revenue and are growing at a mid-teens year-over-year rate.
as we described last quarter for our legal professionals segment, a healthy mix shift toward these more rapidly growing offerings is contributing to our corporates momentum. looking forward, we remain confident in the long-term growth potential for the segment driven by our building momentum, a healthy product portfolio and corporate demand for actionable insights and efficiency-driven workflow tools combined with significant addressable market and whitespace penetration opportunities. building upon this corporates discussion, i'll expand on our risk, fraud and compliance businesses. we have historically discussed rfc as part of our legal professionals government subsegment, which also includes our legal offerings sold into government and core customers.
however, our rfc businesses are also an important driver for corporates, which generates a bit over 40% of our rfc revenue. we have several businesses that make up our rfc franchise, led by clear, a leading public record solution. this is complemented by thomson reuters special services or trss and pondera. trss provides a combination of information, technology and security-cleared analysts to support government customers in mitigating global risk and improving public safety.
pondera provides a cloud solution that leverages advanced algorithms to help detect fraud in government entitlement programs. both trss and pondera leverage clear data, adding insight and decisioning capabilities that extend our value add. our rfc businesses have contributed nicely to growth with total rfc revenue expanding by a 16% compound annual growth rate over the last five years and clear growing by double digits in every year since it was acquired in 2008. there have been several key drivers of this growth, including an expanding number of use cases across government and corporate customers, enhanced functionality that has bolstered usage and pricing and growth of access through apis, which has also boosted our partnership efforts.
looking forward, we believe that our rfc businesses are well positioned to deliver revenue growth in the teens over the next few years. we also believe our current position is a strong platform from which to consider future m&a in the rfc space. let me go a little bit deeper on clear, which makes up approximately two-thirds of our rfc revenue. clear is a leading public records database and analytics solution powered by proprietary technology and a highly unique data set.
it brings billions of data points from public records and third-party data bases together to deliver insights for investigative, compliance, risk mitigation and fraud prevention purposes. historically, clear has focused on building an aggregated data set that enables investigators to perform a single search across multiple sources to uncover connections and identify risk-related information aided by customizable and easy-to-navigate dashboards. this enhanced due diligence use case remains an important revenue growth -- revenue and growth driver today. in recent years, we've added decisioning tools and configurable analytics around identity verification and entity risk indicators and scoring.
we've also added incremental content, including sanctions lists and business beneficial ownership data. these additions have resulted in a more robust offering that has expanded customer user base pricing. and they are adding to our growth runway and our customers' success. we believe clear is a market leader with several advantages, including robust identity resolution technology, comprehensive content, real-time data connections, strong data source transparency and a compelling analytics-driven dashboard.
our clear product nps scores for both government and corporate users are among the highest in the company, which speaks to the value customers see in this important offering. the graphic on slide 12 illustrates how clear can help customers prevent, detect and investigate risk and fraud by answering key questions about their potential customers or counterparties. these questions demonstrate the critical need for a deep understanding of entities, both people and companies, relevant for government and corporate customers across numerous use cases ranging from criminal investigations to identifying human trafficking networks to kyc and aml compliance as well as others. to bring our rfc efforts to life, let me close with a real-world example from our government business.
during the initial pandemic period, unemployment insurance claims skyrocketed, and unfortunately, so did fraud-related activity. the state of california processed more claims than any other state and initially struggled to process claims while minimizing fraud. it turned to a combination of our solutions using pondera's algorithms and ai in combination with clear and the state's own data to identify and verify legitimate claims and highlight potential fraudulent claims. this solution helped the state work through a backlog of 9.7 million claims in a two-week period while accelerating payments to qualified recipients and denying fraudulent claims.
since implementation, thomson reuters has been a key partner in helping california to stop $125 billion of fraudulent claims. we're proud of the work done by our risk, fraud and compliance teams, which help support safe communities, uphold the integrity of government entitlement programs and support robust compliance efforts. now let me turn it over to mike, who will provide more detail on the second-quarter results.
mike eastwood -- chief financial officer
thank you, steve, and thanks for joining us today. as a reminder, i will talk to revenue growth before currency and on an organic basis. let me start by discussing the second-quarter revenue performance of our big three segments. revenues rose 7% organically and at constant currency for the quarter.
this marks the fifth consecutive quarter our big three segments have grown at least 6%. legal professionals organic revenues increased 6%. this also marks the fifth consecutive quarter of 6% growth for legal professionals. organic growth was driven by practical law, findlaw and our government business.
westlaw edge continues to add about 100 basis points to legal's organic growth rate. it is maintaining a healthy premium and is expected to continue to contribute at a similar level going forward, supported by the planned release of westlaw edge 2.0 later this year.in our corporates segment, organic revenues increased 9% for the quarter driven by recurring revenue growth of 9% and transactional revenue growth of 8%. clear, practical law and indirect tax were key drivers of the recurring revenue. the transactional revenue growth benefited from volumes that are seasonal in nature and is unlikely to continue at that level in the second half of the year.
however, we see recurring revenue growth momentum continuing. and finally, tax and accounting's organic revenues grew 9% driven by recurring revenue growth of 11%. organic growth was driven by ultra tax, audit products and the segment's businesses in latin america. moving to reuters news.
total and organic revenues increased 12%, exceeding expectations due to strength in our professionals business. in particular, reuters events drove the growth as it benefited from both a favorable event calendar shift into q2 and also the return of in-person events. we expect more moderate growth from reuters news in the second half of the year. lastly, global print total and organic revenues declined 1% in the second quarter ahead of expectations.
higher third-party revenues for printing services and timing of new sales drove the outperformance. so we expect both to normalize in the remainder of 2022. on a consolidated basis, second quarter organic revenues increased by 7%. turning to our profitability.
adjusted ebitda for the big three segments was $524 million, up 8% from the prior-year period with a 40.7% margin rising 80 basis points. improvement over prior-year period was due to higher revenues and change program savings. as a reminder, the change program operating costs are recorded at the corporate level. moving to reuters news.
adjusted ebitda was $44 million, up $9 million from the prior-year period with a margin of 23.3%, up 310 basis points. revenue growth and higher events mix drove margins. global print's adjusted ebitda was $50 million with a margin of 35.4%, a decline of 250 basis points due to the decrease in revenues and the dilutive impact of lower margin third-party print revenue. in aggregate, total company adjusted ebitda was $561 million, a 12% increase versus q2 2021.
excluding costs related to the change program in both periods, adjusted ebitda increased 9%. the second quarter's adjusted ebitda margin was 34.7% or 36.6% on an underlying basis, excluding costs related to the change program. turning to earnings per share. second quarter adjusted eps was $0.60, up from $0.48 in the prior-year period.
the increase was mainly driven by higher adjusted ebitda. currency had a $0.01 positive impact on adjusted eps in the quarter. let me now turn to our free cash flow performance for the first half. reported free cash flow was $428 million versus $618 million in the prior-year period.
consistent with previous quarters, this slide removes the distorting factors impacting our free cash flow. working from the bottom of the page upwards, the cash outflows from the discontinued operations component of our free cash flow was $25 million more than the prior-year period. this was due to payments to the u.k. tax authority related to the operations of our former refinitiv business.
also in the first half, we made $186 million of change program payments as compared to $28 million in the prior-year period. if you adjust for these items, comparable free cash flow from continuing operations was $685 million, $7 million lower than the prior-year period primarily due to higher annual incentive plan bonuses. we reaffirm our 2022 full-year free cash flow outlook of approximately $1.3 billion. i will now provide an update on the progress related to our change program.
in the second quarter, we achieved $64 million of annual run rate operating expense savings. this brings the cumulative annual run rate change program operating expense savings to $369 million.this increases our confidence in reaching approximately $500 million of annualized savings by year-end and $600 million gross operating expense savings by 2023. as a reminder, we anticipate reinvesting $200 million of the projected $600 million of savings back into the business for a net savings of $400 million. now an update on our change program costs for the second quarter and the remainder of 2022.
let me start by saying none of the annual estimates have changed from what we provided last quarter. spend during the second quarter was $67 million, comprised of $30 million of opex and $37 million of capex. we anticipate $175 million of total spend in the second half of 2022. for the full year, we continue to expect $305 million of change program investments, which would bring total 2021 and 2022 cumulative investments to approximately $600 million.
we also continue to anticipate a split of roughly 60% opex and 40% capex. let me conclude with our outlook for 2022 and 2023. as steve outlined, we have increased our full year 2022 outlook for total tr and big three revenue growth. we now forecast total organic revenue growth of approximately 6% and big three organic revenue of approximately 7%, up from the prior 5.5% and 6.5%, respectively.
we are maintaining our adjusted ebitda margin outlook of approximately 35% as we continue to monitor inflationary impacts and assess investment opportunities to drive continued revenue momentum. there is no change to other 2022 outlook items, and we reaffirm our 2023 targets. looking to the third quarter, we expect revenue growth to be 50 to 100 basis points below the updated full-year forecast due to lower transactional revenue and more normalized growth rates for reuters news and global print. however, we expect fourth-quarter revenue growth to improve from q3.
we expect recurring revenue to expand by 7% for the full year. we expect our third quarter adjusted ebitda margin to decline 300 basis points sequentially from q2 due to normal seasonality, timing of reuters events and the cadence of change program investments. we expect q4 margins to be the high watermark of the year, aided by seasonal strength from our tax professionals segment and scaling change program savings. we see our effective tax rate likely at the midpoint of our 19% to 21% full-year range.
in summary, we remain confident in achieving our 2022 and 2023 targets, supported by the strong first half and healthy underlying momentum in our key businesses and markets. over time, we continue to believe we can achieve faster revenue growth, higher profitability and significantly higher free cash flow as we benefit from transforming to a content-driven technology company. let me now turn it back to gary for questions.
