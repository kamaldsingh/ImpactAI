thank you. [operator instructions] we'll go ahead and take our first question from itay michaeli with citi. please go ahead.
itay michaeli -- citi -- analyst
great. thank you. hi, everybody. just two questions.
first, maybe just on the business development. it looks like i think nonauto now accounts for maybe over 50% perhaps of your total projects. i was hoping if you could maybe talk about what you're seeing in the nonauto versus kind of adas, av side. and perhaps also talk about the latest in the competitive environment, particularly on the adas side of things with velarray and velabit.
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
so as far as the pipeline goes, we continue to see this strong trend of growth in the nonautomotive segment, while the automotive segment also continues to grow, especially in the adas space. so i think that that broad split of half auto and half nonauto still remains mostly relevant for velodyne. definitely, in the nonautomotive segment, especially in industrial robotics, we have seen explosive growth in the number of projects in that space, driven by all the changes that we are seeing in this post-covid world to our supply chain and the enormous investments that mid-e-commerce and logistics customers are making in that space. could you repeat your second question, itay?
itay michaeli -- citi -- analyst
thanks for the answer. so maybe just on the adas side, just talk about the competitive environment there and just the traction you're seeing with velarray and velabit.
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
sure. we have, as of now, about 194 projects in our pipeline, with about 61 of them being adas projects. and we are seeing a significant portion of those being demand for the velarray. so the velarray product has continued to mature.
and as we talked about in the earnings call, we manufactured and shipped over 700 of these products just in the last quarter. so we are seeing tremendous demand and excitement around the velarray project. we're also really excited by the fact that the velabit product has now entered our pipeline as well, and we have over 20 projects in our pipeline that are around the velabit. so both the velarray and the velabit continue to garner significant attention in the automotive space, and we see lots of projects around them developing.
itay michaeli -- citi -- analyst
that's helpful. let me just ask a second quick question just on the financials. thank you for the update on the forward business outlook through 2025. i think back in september, you'd mentioned that, i think, maybe roughly like 56% of your prior 2024 revenue outlook was signed and awarded.
i don't know if you could be in a position to update that today or can you talk about roughly kind of where you are relative to that for 2024? i believe the number was maybe like $380 million at the time that was signed and awarded back in september?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah. so we aren't providing any guidance that far out at this point. however, we do feel very confident with the signed and awarded contracts that we have currently plus the pipeline that we have that we should be able to achieve our financial goals as we get out into '23, '24, and '25.
itay michaeli -- citi -- analyst
that's very helpful. thanks.

we'll take our next question. please go ahead.
tristan gerra -- baird -- analyst
this is tristan at baird. can you hear me?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yes, we can. thank you for dialing in.
tristan gerra -- baird -- analyst
could you provide a little bit more color on the velabit design wins? is that l2 plus applications? and if not, can you talk about the prospects for l2 and whether you have already design wins in that segment? and presumably what the time frame will be for a ramp?
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
yes. we are seeing significant interest and discussion around the prospects of using lidar for level 2, especially around products like our velabit products. we don't have that converted into a design win just yet. however, as we have talked about before, tristan, the fact is that lidar is capable of providing far more robust functionality even in the context of a level 2 application such as pedestrian automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping, and lane-centering than some of the existing technologies because of its ability to work across all lighting conditions.
and because of that, we are continuing to see significant interest from our automotive customers around the usage of lidar in conjunction with our software for level 2. so those conversations are still continuing, and we believe that lidar will be adopted in level 2 applications in the future.
tristan gerra -- baird -- analyst
ok. great. and then i know that you're not going to provide a guidance until the second half of the year. how should i look at the unit growth this year relative to the expected price declines? and ultimately, does that translate into actual revenue growth for this year, year over year?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah. so we can't provide guidance on the year and year over year. but we are thinking that we should see a jump in our unit growth this year because we'll be selling more velarray, and we expect the velabit to also enter the market here in the second half of the year, actually starting in q2, i believe. so with those introductions that will bring the asps down a bit.
so even with the increasing volumes, we may see an impact on revenues overall. but we're very focused mostly around getting the unit volumes to expand because we believe that's where the success of the company lies in the future, which, of course, is also backed up by all of the work that we've done by getting our units so that we are in production on a number of our products in our manufacturing operations offshore and mass production. and also in the process of getting all these units up and running in the offshore operations with our contract manufacturer. so really feel that we should be able to drive a lot more volume, which will ultimately in the years to come, drive significant growth of revenues.
tristan gerra -- baird -- analyst
great. thank you.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
thank you, tristan.

we'll take our next question. please go ahead.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
thanks so much, guys. it's colin rusch from oppenheimer. could you talk about the pipeline and the activity around the software that you guys can monetize with this hardware? are you seeing real active agreements around the recurring revenue potential for some of the software upgrades? and how should we think about that as a percentage of revenue over the next couple of years?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah. so we are seeing a very busy pipeline. as anand mentioned, we have a lot of projects currently focused on software products. and that is expanding on a regular basis, almost daily at this point.
and the types of products we're expecting to have out there are going to be products that will allow us to get to a revenue model of kind of a saas nature where they will have recurring revenue streams that will be on a monthly or annual basis. we're expecting that growth will really start to kick in out in '23, '24 and should represent a larger portion of our revenues. targeting right now being at around 20% in revenues as we get to, say, 2024. so those are the key drivers for the software revenues.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
great. and then just in terms of system design, we're working on a variety of different messages around portion of the sensor suite is designed to lidar and the ability to take some of the functionality away from radar and ultrasonic sensors. can you talk a little bit about that in terms of what you're seeing with the customers as you look out into the out years on the revenue model?
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
sure. yeah. i mean, you know, i think all the sensor technologies will continue to progress and grow, and we see that investments in all the different sensor technologies continue. but lidar is now, by no means, left behind with significant investments being placed with public companies like velodyne being able to make significant r&d investments in the improvement and scalability of lidar.
so as that happens, we see that all of these sensor technologies will asymptote toward their physics limitations. and lidar by virtue of being able to really work across many different lighting conditions and provide a much higher resolution than radar does is assuming sort of a prime position in advanced safety systems, as well as advanced robotics and autonomous systems. and we believe that trend will continue with all of the exciting technology work that is happening in the space and as well as the fact that you have significant investments in software development around the usage of lidar and lidar-based point cloud. so we definitely see that reflected in the growth in our pipeline and in our conversations with our customers.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
thanks so much, guys.
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
thank you.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
thank you, colin.

we'll take our next question. please go ahead.
richard shannon -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
hi. richard shannon here from craig-hallum. i'm going to make this quick as i got to jump on a couple of other calls here. but let's see, you talked about in your early january press release about seeing some reduced visibility.
and anand, i think you referred to a couple of scenarios, which i think you've identified in the public realm. i think we mentioned those few. are those things that are actually affecting this year because march actually indicates they may have been for the out years there? so are those correlated or are those different situations there?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
i think we're seeing covid-19 being more -- expecting it to be a short-term kind of an impact where people are just kind of waiting to get back into their offices and get busy. we've had a lot of -- continue to get good responses around wanting to do multiyear agreements and honoring the multiyear agreements. however, their hands are tied, like all of ours, where they can't get into the office and start moving units through to customers because the customers are also at home like the rest of us. so there's a lot of excitement among our customer base to get back on plan and get back on track with all of the agreements we have, as well as the contracts we're talking about entering into, which are in our pipeline.
however, there's just always that uncertainty around when are they going to be able to start doing that because of the speed at which the vaccinations are rolled out geographically. each geography tends to have its own impacts right now. but people are very much interested in getting back on track.
richard shannon -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. so would it be fair to say that your decision to provide some guidance for this year starting in the second half based on hopefully the covid dynamics are getting over with and getting better visibility to that? is that fair, drew?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
exactly. that's what we're expecting. that's right.
richard shannon -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. second follow-up question here is on the topic of adas, following on a couple of other ones earlier here. just kind of big picture here. what do you see as potential for attach rate of lidar to adas, where the cost sensitivity is fairly high? do you see this as mostly a replacement of other technologies or in conjunction with?
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think when you talk about adas, there's really, in our mind, two possible applications. there is level 3 adas, which going from like a traffic jam assist functionality to a highway autopilot as well as -- and then with level 2 adas as the previous question alluded to, and we believe lidar has an incredibly strong role to play in both. of course, really, the high-volume attach rates for lidar in automotive really open up with level 2 adas, where you have the ability to really see high penetration and attach rates for lidar.
and on the backs of really cost-efficient scalable technologies like our velabit, we believe that that opportunity set will open up and really drive volumes, while the attach rates for level 3 remain quite modest and low because it started the high-end vehicles.
richard shannon -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
appreciate that touch. that's all for me. thank you.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
we'll take our next question. please go ahead.
raji gill -- needham & company -- analyst
yeah. thank you for taking my questions. this is raji gill from needham. so, drew, you had mentioned that you expect to see kind of a jump in unit growth this year kind of following the significant unit growth in 2020, but asp is coming down as you try to proliferate this into the industry, which may impact revenue.
and it did impact revenue in 2020 in terms of that offset between unit and asp. just wondering what is the kind of the right mix of asp versus unit growth. do you think that you need to hit where you start to see kind of revenue growth? just curious how to think about those competing dynamics.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yes. so it's very important because it's been part of the company's strategy to introduce. we have a broad portfolio of products that are all designed to meet different customer needs and also included in those needs are coming into the market at the right price point so that we can allow the proliferation of lidar in multiple applications. the impact of that, of course, is that it's going to be bringing down the asps as where we have the velabit at $100, we have the other sensors at a couple of thousand eventually.
so we really think that as we get further out into, say, 2022, 2023, you'll start seeing hundreds of thousands of sensors being sold, but they'll be at that lower asp. and i want to caution people to think of it, in a quarter, it's very hard to make any judgments. you have to look at it kind of on a linear kind of basis because products sold mix in a given quarter not necessarily represent the overall impact. so maybe annual basis is a better way to look at it.
and we're expecting that as we get out into '22, '23 and the unit volumes start moving up toward 100,000 and maybe out as we get closer to '24, we may be even approaching 1 million sensors that these asps are going to be coming down into the $600 range. so it's really going to be a transition from where we are today and the asps we're seeing it, and we anticipate those will continue to come down. but the volumes will start to increase significantly as we get out into '23 and '24. [audio gap]
raji gill -- needham & company -- analyst
hello?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
sorry, i only heard that. can you repeat the question?
raji gill -- needham & company -- analyst
sure. could you provide what the blended asp was for 2020 versus 2019?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
for 2020, the weighted average asp was approximately $3,800. 2019, sorry, off the cuff, i don't remember. i'll have to get back to you on that.
raji gill -- needham & company -- analyst
ok. no problem. and the last question, i mean, i saw that you're getting a lot of adoption in solid-state. i think you talked about the goal is to get to 30% in 2021 and then 60% in 2024.
just correct me if that's not right. just wondering if you can elaborate in terms of your traction on solid-state. what the adoption has been with your customers? thank you.
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, you know, i think we see definitely that as i said before, there's more than one lidar technology needed to serve all of these different marketplaces. and i think we are really served very well by having both the rotational product line, which continues to actually work very well for av, as well as shuttle and some smart city applications. but then we are seeing the solid-state lidar family really get a lot of traction, obviously, in the adas space, as well as in some of the robotics applications.
so really, in applications where you have small form factor systems or systems where design aesthetics are really important, the solid-state directional lidar portfolio is really seeing a lot of traction and growth and demand in those sorts of applications, including robotics and adas.

[operator instructions]
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
actually, if you don't mind, i'd like to just make a correction there to raji's question about the asps. in fiscal-year 2020, the weighted average asp was about $4,800. and just on 2019, it was approximately $7,100. sorry.
thank you. please go ahead.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question. please go ahead.
ruben roy -- the benchmark company -- analyst
it's ruben roy from benchmark company. drew, i wanted to just follow up on the asp discussion just a little bit more. you guys mentioned, obviously, there's other lidar companies coming out. i understand you guys are shipping many, many more sensors than a lot of the competitors.
but has anything changed, would you say, in the last 90 days as we've seen more discussion around lidar, etc., around the way you were thinking about asps maybe back in june when you had your analyst day?
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
let me start by talking about that. i mean, no, i think we have -- as a result of being the first mover and having the ability to sit across the table with our major customers for many years at this point, we have always had a clear and clear-eyed understanding of where the end cost of the technology needs to get to for all of these different applications to enable mass-market adoption. and really, we have been making the investments from an r&d perspective and really driving the technology toward this point. if anything, all of this discussion around lidar over the past few months has really validated everything that we have said, both from our leadership position, as well as really where we think the market needs to go to enable mass-market adoption.
and further, as is also evidenced by all of the conversations we are seeing, we believe there is a very strong market for lidar, both in automotive, as well as in nonautomotive industrial applications. and i think that is also being borne out by what all the discussions we're seeing in the marketplace. so no, nothing has really changed in terms of our outlook.
ruben roy -- the benchmark company -- analyst
i appreciate that. and i guess as a follow-up, i know you guys aren't providing any explicit guidance here and your visibility should start to improve in the second half. but based on what you just said about asps, based on when you typically get purchase orders, which i think you have some lead time and backlog visibility, is it realistic at this point to expect that you're going to grow revenue in '21 versus '20?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
again, i can't provide guidance. it's really going to be about the unit volumes and the orders that come in from the customers about being able to grow revenue in '21 versus '20. and until we get a better sense of people coming back into the workplace, there's not much i can say about that right now.
ruben roy -- the benchmark company -- analyst
right. ok. thanks, guys.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
we'll take our next question. please go ahead.
michael filatov -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
this is michael filatov from berenberg. thanks for taking my question. i just wondered if you guys could maybe provide a little bit more detail around some of the business, i think you said, was lost to a competitor that's a legacy competitor in this space and why that was in sort of -- whether that impacts your business with that customer on additional platforms or other business opportunities with them? or it's purely sort of the near-term first-production model?
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, obviously, we cannot talk for specific customers and customer contracts. but really, as you described it, we have seen instances where the customer may go with a lower performance competitive product while our technology is going through validation and being put through its paces. we continue to be very actively engaged with both our tier 1 partners and the oem customers around next-generation platforms with our velarray technology, which is clearly capable of far higher performance than any of the older technology products out there.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
which, by the way, they're evaluating for the next generation of various vehicles that they'll be bringing to market. so we're very, very busy in those conversations on various projects that are going to be for the next-gen projects that will be coming up.
michael filatov -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
understood. and just following up on that. i guess where do you see yourselves right now in terms of getting the velarray to sort of desample auto-grade qualifications? where are you in that process? and what does that timeline look like at the moment?
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think we are -- we have gone through our automotive-grade qualification in the fourth quarter and continue to go through that right now. our h800 product is in that phase today where i would say it's automotive-qualified and is capable of hitting the environmental, as well as the level of performance for some automotive applications. so i think we have made significant progress in the past six months, really maturing the product and we see as a result of that, significant opportunities in our pipeline with interest across many different oems for that product and for products in the velarray family.
michael filatov -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
understood. thank you.

thank you, mike.

[operator instructions] we'll go ahead and take our next question. please go ahead.
aileen smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good afternoon, guys. this is aileen smith from boa. can you elaborate a little on the commentary of the opportunity for over $1 billion in revenue from signed and awarded projects over 2021 to '25 versus an additional pipeline of projects of $4.4 billion? specifically, what of the signed and awarded contracts makes that backlog estimation sound a bit less firm as a quoted opportunity versus what we might hear from a standard supplier around their respective backlogs? is it a function of narrowing down pricing? is it differences in contract structure of production contracts versus spot buys or something else?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah. so signed and awarded contracts are kind of a standard industrial agreement that we have with many of our customers that are based on the unit volume agreement and they have normal price curve. so that also gives us visibility into where we'll be as we get out into the coming years with those particular contracts. and it helps us to gain confidence now.
as is normal, these contracts will probably have -- the firm pos will come in as we get closer to production in a given year. so the respective customers, as they understand what the production levels will be, will give us more firm contracts as they approach production. and all of these contracts are designed so that they have a component where if the contract isn't -- the ultimate order isn't at the level that was originally agreed to in the signed and awarded agreement, the production agreement, then we have an opportunity to increase the price or renegotiate the price that they pay for each unit. of course, if they come back and they want more units, then probably, they can go back and renegotiate the price as well.
so standard industrial types of contracts for people to get to a kind of commercial production for a component as an application or a solution that they'll be producing. and they would lock us in on the front end as kind of a design win. and then they do all their work, putting all the final work designs into whatever it is that they're going to be manufacturing so that they can be able to make their commitments on the other end and delivering those goods.
aileen smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then to ask a question on another headline recently being ford's decision to sell down their velodyne stake. can you talk about what this means, if anything, from a customer relationship with ford and argo ai and even potentially relatedly with volkswagen? and separately, many automakers, including gm and others over the past few years have acquired their own lidar technology that they're working to commercialize.
how has that impacted your discussions with existing and potentially new customers?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah. so we're finding like, in the case of ford, this is a relationship we've really benefited greatly from. they are in the business of making strategic investments in critical suppliers, when they need to stand them up and ensure that they'll be financially secure to deliver these components that they need, in our case, lidar. when those particular companies that they've invested in are capable of standing on their two feet, so to speak, then they don't like to stick around as a financial investor.
that's not their nature. they'd rather reallocate that capital to other investment. so we benefited greatly from this relationship with ford, both in terms of what they've done for velodyne lidar in helping it to develop its products as a partner and becoming that critical supplier for them. and then also from their investment.
and then as we go forward, we have a number of different projects in the pipeline where we're on some existing cars in phase 1, phase 2, and they're continuing to evaluate us as a technology that would continue to phase 3 in some of those cars. so we are very appreciative of the relationship with ford. we continue to work with them very closely on both current products that are being used, as well as the development of new technologies, and we'd expect that to continue for a long time to come.
aileen smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. and last question, what specific milestones, whether from a return to work or production, bookings, or other perspective, do you think you need to see through the first half of this year in order to start establishing the more formal outlook for 2021 onwards toward later this year?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah. so this is -- i keep having steady conversations with our sales organization in the field. and it's really focused around the conversations they're having with customers to start getting to release their pos. so a lot of the countries like europe, we thought europe might be up sooner and now that they could be locked down through 2021.
and even some of the asian countries are seeing similar things, and then they kind of keep telling us they hope. so we have great relationships with our customers. we continue to talk to our contacts on a regular basis. and we're really waiting for them to get confident that they'll be coming back to the office and when.
so to have that visibility, it's really about how does the world start to unfold out there so that our customers who are going to be using our lidar in some system that they're building, feel confident that their customers are returning to the office and they're going to be able to sell through, so they can have confidence to getting those pos. so from who you talk to, it depends. some people hope that they're going to come back to the office in april. others are a little less optimistic, so they may be further out.
we're just looking for those conversations to firm up so that we can get confidence around when those orders are going to come in and then we can start providing clearer guidance.
aileen smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok, great. thanks for taking the questions.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. as there are no further questions at this time, i'd like to turn the call back over to mr. gopalan for any additional or closing remarks.
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
thank you, and thank you all for joining us today and for your great questions. it is a very exciting time for lidar and for velodyne. we believe we have hit an inflection point in the lidar industry as demonstrated by our record unit shipments in the fourth quarter and our expanding pipeline, which we believe is the most robust in the industry. in 2020, we significantly enhanced our balance sheet supporting this robust pipeline.
this, together with our leadership in broadly diversified end market for lidar, gives us great confidence in our long-term outlook for growth. we look forward to sharing our continued successes with you and hope everyone has a great rest of the day. thank you.

good day, and welcome to the velodyne fourth-quarter, fiscal-year 2020 earnings call. today's conference is being recorded. at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to kirsten chapman of lha investor relations. please go ahead, ma'am.
kirsten chapman -- lha investor relations
good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss velodyne lidar's fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 financial results. with us on the call are dr. anand gopalan, velodyne's chief executive officer; and drew hamer, the company's chief financial officer. before we begin, i would like to remind you that shortly after the close of market today, velodyne issued a press release announcing its fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 financial results.
velodyne also published an investor presentation. you may access this press release and presentation in the investor relations section of velodynelidar.com. today's discussion includes forward-looking statements. please refer to our press release for a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements.
i would also like to remind you that during the call, we will discuss some non-gaap measures related to velodyne's performance. you can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable gaap measures in the press release. to ensure that we address as many analyst questions as possible during the call, we request that you please limit yourselves to one initial question and one follow-up question, then you may reenter the queue. now, i'd like to turn the call over to dr.
anand gopalan, ceo of velodyne. please go ahead, sir. 
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
thank you, kirsten, and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon. i'm anand gopalan, ceo of velodyne. our fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 results demonstrate that we continue to expand our leadership position in the lidar market. velodyne is the only lidar company today with both the breadth of product portfolio and the manufacturing capability to deliver low-priced lidar with multiple specifications at scale for many real-world applications.
we shipped a record 4,237 sensor units in the fourth quarter and 11,710 for the full year. this included 718 solid-state lidar units in q4. we are manufacturing and shipping more lidar units than all our competitors have reported. in fact, we shipped more products in a week than all the other players have reported shipping in a whole year.
in addition, we have expanded our offerings and now provide full solutions of hardware plus software through our acquisition of mapper.ai. this is an exciting new part of the story. in terms of manufacturing, we have fully automated wafer scale-like lidar manufacturing processes in place today and operating with our contract manufacturers. we can produce at scale, and we are far along the path to mass production and continue to execute on our strategy of transferring manufacturing of mature products to contract manufacturing partners.
despite covid-19, we have not slowed down. we continue to set production records and are making significant progress on our growth plans. this uniquely positions us to meet the rapidly growing volume requirements of our customers in the coming years. thanks to its broad rotational and solid-state lidar portfolio, velodyne's ability to address many segments is a key competitive strength.
and we continue to derisk our business model by being the leader in multiple markets with multiple customers in each. velodyne supplies over 300-plus customers, including major oems and leading tech companies such as caterpillar, ford otosan, gm, honda, hyundai mobis, toyota, volkswagen, zoox, didi, easymile, gatik, google, and leica geosystems. we announced agreements in the fourth quarter of 2020, covering industries from autonomous vehicles and trucking to robotics and mapping. as of today, we now have 26 active multiyear agreements, up almost ninefold from three in the first quarter of 2020.
over the past few months, we announced that we signed a multiyear agreement with motional, a hyundai and aptiv combination to be the exclusive provider of long-range surround-view lidar sensors for motional's sae level 4 driverless vehicles. we executed an agreement with may mobility for its entire fleet of self-driving shuttles. signed an agreement with local motors to use our sensors to enable safe, reliable operation of olli, the company's 3d printed electric and self-driving shuttle. we signed a five-year sales agreement with thordrive, who will be using our lidar sensors to power its cargo and baggage ground support tractors in a groundbreaking av program at the cincinnati/northern kentucky international airport.
and we entered into a strategic partnership with beijing trunk technologies, or trunktech, with whom we will collaborate in developing next-generation autonomous heavy trucks to accelerate the commercialization of driverless trucks in china's logistics market. in mapping, we signed a multi-year sales agreement with emesent, a world leader in drone autonomy, lidar mapping, and data analytics, who will use our sensors for mapping hazardous and gps-denied environment. our pipeline, which is the most robust in the lidar industry, now stands at 194 projects. this is up from 183 reported for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 131 projects reported at the beginning of the year on january 1, 2020.
there is expanding adoption of lidar across a wide variety of industries, some of which are accelerating in a post-covid world such as last-mile delivery. our pipeline of opportunities in industries such as robotics grew 220% from 873,000 units in february of 2020 to 1.9 million units today. i'd like to take a moment to comment on our pipeline, which is very fluid and will vary with customers' changing needs and expectations as it continues along its long-term growth trajectory. a recent example of this is an av project that we had with an oem customer.
while we are on this customer's first and second-generation autonomous vehicle platforms, the customer made a choice to use a different technology for their next-generation platform. however, we continue to be actively engaged with them on multiple other opportunities which, if successful, could more than offset any financial impact of this project. we have also seen an adas customer select an older technology for their first-generation rollout while they continue to move forward with us on projects for next-generation platforms. on the other hand, recently, we had a major oem customer reengage with us and renew our long-term relationship through a follow-on multiyear agreement.
our product portfolio also includes the complex algorithms and software solutions to complement our sensor products. software is only possible with a robust preexisting hardware installed base like velodyne has today. a higher-margin software subscription model is a natural adjacency for us. we have made significant progress on executing new software contracts and now have 18 opportunities in our pipeline with the software component, 3 times the number than in the third quarter of 2020.
velodyne is innovating on the cutting edge, and in 2020, we launched, industry-first, our new velarray solid-state sensor product line and velabit lidar, our smallest sensor, which are designed to be manufactured at scale and at price points targeted at broad-based lidar adoption. velodyne's velabit lidar sensor was named a winner in the best of what's new awards by popular science and won the 2020 innovation award by silicon valley robotics. last but certainly not the least, we have 28 velabit projects in our pipeline today. we are the most innovative lidar company as evidenced by our track record, and you will see additional new lidar architectures and technologies introduced by us in the near future.
velodyne transforms lives and communities by advancing safer mobility for all. in the fourth quarter, we joined the qualcomm's smart cities accelerator program to promote using lidar technology in smart city solutions. by becoming part of the qualcomm's smart cities ecosystem, we are now working with private industry, governments, and solution providers to create smart city applications that improve public services and enhance safety and the quality of life. earlier this year, we issued a white paper in conjunction with the university of nevada, reno center of applied research that outlined how roadside lidar is the key to building smart and safe transportation infrastructure.
the past few months have seen a few more lidar companies look to go public on the backs of our success. the information in their public filings validates our substantial leadership position and also showcases the massive opportunity for velodyne due to our dominance in each of their industries. in summary, it is an incredibly exciting time for lidar and for velodyne as we work toward democratizing lidar for many applications. we believe we have hit an inflection point in the lidar industry, which is evidencing itself in our expanding pipeline and by shipping more units than ever before in the fourth quarter of 2020.
in many applications, lidar status as a critical sensor is giving us the opportunity to add higher value to our customers by providing full solutions, not just hardware. before i turn the call over to drew, i wanted to take a moment to touch upon our recent board and leadership transition. as you saw, our board has named brad culkin as chairman to succeed david hall. brad cofounded velodyne lidar's predecessor company, velodyne acoustics, and has been involved in velodyne lidar throughout its history including serving on velodyne lidar's board since september 2016.
we look forward to continuing to benefit from his invaluable guidance on technology and business strategy. i'm also excited to see sally frykman take over the role of chief marketing officer. her expertise in managing public relations and digital marketing will prove invaluable as we continue to execute on our strategic plans. and finally, it's my pleasure to welcome hamid zarringhalam to our board of directors.
in his role as corporate vice president at nikon corporation, hamid is responsible for the external investments, strategic alliances, and the private equity strategy of nikon corporation, leveraging their core competencies to enable and scale growth in new markets. and he is responsible for nikon's strategic partnership activities in semiconductor lithography in the united states. with his appointment, we are further deepening our relationship with our valued manufacturing partner, nikon. i'd now like to turn over the call to drew for a discussion of our financials.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
thank you, anand, and thank you again to everyone for joining us today. i'm drew hamer, the cfo for velodyne lidar. i'll begin with an overview of the company's fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 results before moving on to a discussion of our target business model, supporting our positive long-term outlook. total revenue was $17.8 million for q4 2020, compared to $19 million in q4 2019.
product revenue was $14.4 million in the quarter, compared to $18.2 million in q4 2019. as we disclosed in january, we reduced production capabilities at our manufacturing sites late in the fourth quarter of 2020 due to covid-19, which impaired our ability to fulfill certain customers' orders in december and negatively impacting product revenue. as our strategy is to accelerate the adoption of lidar by lowering asps and driving higher volumes, reduced asps also had a negative impact on revenue year over year. we are extremely pleased to see our strategy working as demonstrated by the fact that units sold went up year over year to record levels.
as we predicted, the products mix continues to transition to more efficient solid-state units. we are anticipating the sales of solid-state lidar units will be 30% in 2021. on reviewing our current pipeline, we expect that this could increase to 60% of revenues by 2024. when combined with the increasing pipeline for 2020, we continue to see that this strategy will drive long-term growth for velodyne.
license and services revenue was $3.4 million, up from $780,000 in q4 2019 due to cross-license agreements recognized during the quarter. gaap gross loss was $5.3 million and non-gaap gross profit totaled $2.1 million compared to fourth-quarter 2019 gross profit of $224,000 on both a gaap and non-gaap basis. gaap operating loss was $111.5 million and included $91.3 million of stock-based compensation. non-gaap operating loss was $20.1 million, compared to q4 2019 gaap operating loss of $29.8 million and a non-gaap operating loss of $27.2 million.
gaap net loss was $111.5 million and non-gaap net loss was $20.1 million. gaap loss per share was $0.64, and non-gaap loss per share was $0.04. loss per share for the fourth quarter is calculated using weighted average shares outstanding of 173.9 million. as of december 31, actual shares outstanding were 175.9 million.
we had $350.3 million in cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet at december 31, 2020, which included $73.7 million of proceeds from the exercise of public warrants. we received an additional $89.3 million in proceeds as of february 19, 2021. i will now turn to the full-year 2020 results. total revenue was $95.4 million, compared to $101.4 million in 2019.
product revenue was $68.4 million. this compared to $81.4 million in 2019. for the year 2020, we sold roughly the same number of units as 2019. part of our strategy is to drive widespread adoption of lidar with sensors designed to enter the market at lower price points.
as a result, the average selling price was lower in 2020, which impacted revenue. license and services revenue was $27 million, up from $20 million in 2019. the $7 million increase in license and services revenue primarily reflects recent cross-license agreements, partially offset by a decrease in repair services and engineering fees. gaap gross profit of $25.1 million or 26% gross margin and non-gaap gross profit of $32.5 million or 34% non-gaap gross margin exceeded our guidance and compared to 2019 gaap and non-gaap gross profit of $29.8 million.
the decrease in gaap gross margin was primarily due to $7.6 million of stock-based compensation expense. gaap operating loss was $153.9 million, exceeding our full-year guidance. included in the gaap operating loss figure was $91.5 million of stock-based compensation. non-gaap operating loss was $62.4 million, also exceeding our full-year guidance.
gaap net loss was $149.9 million and non-gaap net loss was $65.1 million. accordingly, gaap loss per share was $1.01 and non-gaap loss per share was $0.44. we continue to monitor covid-19's impact on our nearer-term business, and we'll review our guidance practices when we have greater visibility of its impact on our business. our target is to provide financial guidance starting in the second half of 2021.
we saw strong growth in signed and awarded projects in 2020 going from three to 26 as of february 19. in 2020, we also saw strong growth in our project pipeline as it went from 131 to 194 as of february 19 and anticipate this growth will continue in 2021 and beyond. we are further encouraged by the diversity of our customer base as demonstrated by the pipeline, having multiple customers in multiple industries. as we saw in 2020, having a pipeline that isn't dependent on a concentrated number of projects in one industry derisks our business model.
this progress provides support for our long-term growth plans and business opportunities. as of february 19, 2021, we estimate that we could have the opportunity for over $1 billion from our signed and awarded projects for the period 2021 through 2025. when we combine this with a pipeline of projects that are not yet signed and awarded of $4.4 billion, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term financial plans. in addition, our manufacturing strategy of outsourcing production to our contract manufacturing partners with the objective of reducing the per-unit cost of revenue, together with our plan to increase in licensing and software, underpins our long-term business outlook of total gross margins ranging in the mid- to high 50% and ebitda margins of more than 20%.
please refer to our investor presentation for a more detailed target business model. we remain focused on delivering disciplined growth for all our stakeholders. in closing, our long-term optimism remains strong. recent high-profile wins, our significant pipeline of contract opportunities, and our commitment to new product development positions us well for the future.
we look forward to sharing results that reflect our progress in the quarters ahead. anand and i are ready to address your questions. as a reminder, we kindly ask that questions are focused on our business and operations and fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 earnings results. operator, we are now open for questions.

operator
[operator instructions] and the first question comes from colin rusch with oppenheimer.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
thanks so much guys. you know as you're looking at your over-the-road customers and the cycle times and cadence for their move toward level 4, level 5 adas. can you speak to the timeframes on those development programs? are they ramping as you expected or are we starting to see some slippage on those things?
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think -- thanks for the question, colin. as we look at level 4, level 5 programs, we are seeing a couple of different things happen. we are seeing our major customers continue to stay on track and ramp their programs as we expected, in a methodical linear fashion. you will see these systems roll out in a couple of cities in one year, and then follow with more cities the next year, and so on.
so that plan stays on track. the other thing, of course, we are seeing consolidation in this space with many of the smaller players getting consolidated into the large customers that we have. but broadly, our outlook for lidar technology, our lidar technology being designed into these systems and being deployed in mass volume continues to be the same and as these major customers roll out their systems over the next three to five years.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
that's super helpful. and then just looking on the cost side, as you guys have started working with automated lines a little bit more. clearly, are you seeing meaningful opportunities for designing cost out? you've seen additional component suppliers come online that can support that. just help us understand the cost structure and the cadence of lowering your cost structure as we go forward here.
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think you know, this is really an important part of what will make lidar adopted across all these applications, and why we feel strongly in the choices we have made. the cost starts at the architecture level. and some of the choices we have made from an architecture perspective are really holding us in good stead, as we move toward mass adoption. the other thing that we've talked about is the common core technology platform that we call the micro-lidar array that started off with our solid state products.
but now it's making its way across our entire product portfolio, including the products that are used in the av segment. and as a result of that, we expect to see our ability not just to continue to push performance further and further, but do that at a lower cost point and much improved scalability. so for that reason, you will see end cost of lidar technologies across the entire av mapping segment as well come down as we roll out the second generation of products.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
ok. thanks so much guys.
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from rajvi gill with needham & co.
uknown speaker -- needham & company -- analyst
hi. this is dennis taking a question on behalf of rajvi gill. if you guys don't mind, could you speak a little bit more about the full-year guidance and maybe provide a bit more color about the basically the spread of the revenue and kind of the gross margin downgrade. can you speak about some of the key drivers of this change?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah. so the key things, first is just the revenue. that's really kind of two questions there. so the spread of the revenue is, -- it's a bit back-end loaded here.
we have good line of sight to kind of the low end of the range. but as we get out into the year, we're looking for other markets to open up. and so, as we start to see europe come back online and other regions of the world become a little bit more successful in their deployment of vaccinations, we anticipate that they could start to ramp back up in their purchases of spot-buys and executing against the multi-year agreements we have with them. in addition, for the upside, we also have a number of larger projects that are also kind of targeted, that could come in here and the second, third and fourth quarter of the year.
it will also provide potential upside revenues that we could see come in, which will allow us to hit the upper range of the revenue guidance which we're targeting. so it's really just, time will pass here, and we'll get an opportunity to close these deals. but for now, this is a higher confidence revenue ratio we can provide. on the gross margins, as it relates to the first quarter, and that affects your whole year, we had lower unit sales, and we're still in the transition of our manufacturing offshore to our contract manufacturers.
so, we had higher kind of overhead costs that we had to absorb here in q1 and potentially q2, as we get further out into the europe and going to continue those transfers to the contract manufacturers, or anticipate can continue that transfer to contract manufacturers. there is a risk there, as i think we're all well aware of countries like thailand and japan, are also seeing increased covid-19 cases. and so it makes it a little bit more challenging to get these transfers completed, because people can't travel to those countries and accelerate them. it doesn't mean we won't get them done, but it might take a little bit longer than we originally expected.
uknown speaker -- needham & company -- analyst
got you. thank you. and then for my follow-up, could you speak a little bit about the non-auto design pipeline with regard to maybe what parts of the pipeline we could see kind of hit the top-line first and which aspects of that pipeline make you most excited?
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
i can start and drew feel free to jump in as well. the fastest growing parts of our pipeline definitely are around the industrial segment. we see tremendous growth in robotics in general. i frankly accelerated in the post-covid world that we live in, we see this across the entire supply chain of delivering goods to your doorstep.
we also see it in other applications, such as forklifts, and smart agriculture and so on. we have seen lidar adoption clearly pick up at a fast clip. and this is a very exciting part of our pipeline, because time to revenue is shorter, and we see our ability to provide the products exists today. and further, many parts of this pipeline also involve a software opportunity, where we have the ability to add more value to the end applications of our customers, not just by providing hardware, but we're also providing software hardware solutions.
and that's actually a really exciting growth opportunity for the company.
uknown speaker -- needham & company -- analyst
great. thank you. i'll get back in the queue. thanks.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from itay michaeli from citi.
itay michaeli -- citi -- analyst
great. thanks. good afternoon, everybody.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
hi, itay.
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
hey, itay.
itay michaeli -- citi -- analyst
just the first question on going back to the gross margin. drew, any color you can share just given i guess the lay in the transfer? and where you think you might exit the year, let's say in the fourth quarter to try and think about the trajectory of gross margin over the next couple of years, see if anything has changed?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah, so we're expecting to be kind of coming out of the year, at kind of approaching those ranges where we originally discussed, probably, i think it's going to be a linear trajectory coming through the year. so kind of starting low and going out high such you can hit to the average as we gave you for the full year.
itay michaeli -- citi -- analyst
got it. ok. that's helpful. and just secondly, on the higher r&d, based on the visibility from the multi-year agreements, hope you could elaborate more about kind of what you're seeing there? is that that sort of new product development because of greater revenue opportunities or an acceleration in launch? it's kind of curious sort of more details around the product spending there.
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
sure. i mean, i would say that there's a couple of areas that are really exciting, as we just talked about. we're seeing a tremendous uptick in opportunities to not just provide hardware, but provide hardware software solutions, and that's definitely going to drive some additional r&d investment on our part to develop and deliver the solutions to market, that's definitely happening and it's happening at a faster rate. and then further i would say that we are seeing on the backs of technology like development, we're seeing an incredible expansion in the number of applications that use lidar.
and there's opportunity for innovation around new lidar architectures and technologies as well. so that's driving increased investment on our part, so that we can capture the huge upside opportunities that are coming into the pipeline.
itay michaeli -- citi -- analyst
that's helpful. and just to sneak one quick one. in the five additional awards you expect by year-end, any color or kind of which end market is adas? is it non-auto robotics in terms of what you expect to those additional links?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah, we're actually expecting that they'll be a spread across all those markets you just described, honestly. and we're going to see that we anticipate we have some in the pipeline that are larger than others. so i think it's very relevant that there are some very strong conversations going on around some adas opportunities. we also have some strong conversations going on with a couple of people with robotic solutions, that are going to be coming to market.
and then, it's going to be a nice spread, i think of different opportunities across different markets that are forming to use lidar, now that we have something that's at a price point that people can incorporate it in their solutions.
itay michaeli -- citi -- analyst
excellent. that's very helpful. thank you.
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from tristan gerra with baird.
tristan gerra -- baird -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. i think you had mentioned on the last call about your expectation for pricing to decline about 20% this year? with you whether you forecast for the year, is that implying a low teens increase in units? is that in the ballpark of what's embedded in your guidance?
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think that we're definitely seeing the guidance, again, it will be a linear thing. so you have for example, last quarter was lowers asp than we saw this quarter. but the trend is that they will yes, continue to go down at those levels.
tristan gerra -- baird -- analyst
ok. so if we look at the growth from a unit standpoint, given the increasing adoption rate that you've described in the past for velabit, which is lower price than the 360 lidar. how do i reconcile the two? i mean, is it fair to assume that the 360 units are actually coming down year over year, but then you have a double digit increase in the solid state lidar for this year? as you've been targeting a percentage, adoption rate, exceeding this year, how should we look at that? and should we see an acceleration unit growth next year?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah, so we are expecting the solid state sensors, the volumes to at least double this year. they are sold at a lower asp so that they'll -- as the volume starts to pick up, the asp will continue to come down because we can volume price them accordingly. so as we get out into this year, we do see that representing a larger portion of that overall revenue, which will affect product metrics, which affects the weighted average asps.
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think the only color i would add to that is, we are as drew described, there are several opportunities that we are seeing around the solid state lidar technology, both the velarray and velabit. so definitely we will continue to see an acceleration of adoption of that technology, across many different applications. so, i think that's definitely happening.
tristan gerra -- baird -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from richard shannon with craig-hallum.
richard shannon -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for taking my questions as well. i think my first question is on adas as you provided in your investor presentations, we see the number of projects by quarter here. and a number of projects come down last couple of quarters, if i caught the numbers, right from 70 down to 56 here.
can you discuss what's going on there? do you see this as a retrenchment in use of lidar and adas or is it just higher quality projects that are still around here? could you kind of help us understand the situation there?
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think what you're seeing is really the quality of the projects is getting defined much better, as the customers are further along in their evaluation of lidar, as a key technology, pray that. so broadly, we don't see the retrenchment in the adas market, we see actually a very robust set of opportunities that are just getting more -- better and better defined. further, i would say that really we are seeing the adas opportunities settle into two buckets. what i would call the fast ev adopters where players like faraday future are looking to come in, and leapfrog existing traditional players by adopting both electrification and lidar technology, as part of adas offerings.
and you see these players move very fast and adopt lidar at fast rate. combined with that, you are seeing the traditional oems also continue to make good progress, especially the leaders in the pack around creating sophisticated level three adas systems that incorporate lidar in them. so you are seeing both those buckets move forward. so broadly, i would say we don't see this at all as a retrenchment for the usage of lidar in the adas market.
richard shannon -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. helpful perspective on that. thanks for that. second question is on software, if i caught the numbers right here is increasing the number of projects that are looking at that.
can you give us a sense of how far down some of the more advanced discussions are going? can we see some agreements signed in the next quarter of by the end of the year? are these all automotive? are you seeing any opportunities outside of automotive?
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
yeah, we're seeing a broad base set of opportunities for software, both in automotive and non-automotive. but as i said before, the really exciting part for us is, in the industrial segment, where time to revenue is much faster, we are seeing opportunities for us to provide both hardware and software. so certainly, we believe that we will see some of these opportunities materialize into signed multi-year agreements in the near future. in addition to that, earlier today we announced the intelligent infrastructure solution, which is our first hardware software solution that we have publicly talked about.
and really, this is focused on the smart city segment, where again, we see our ability to work across different state dot, city organizations and commercial companies. we have the ability to provide not just the lidar hardware that makes this possible, but also the entire solution, including the data analytics platform that these companies can use to really mine the valuable data that exists, whether it's a city intersection or whether it's retail or public space. so we are pushing forward fast and creating products around these different segments that incorporate both velodyne's hardware, compute and software.
richard shannon -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. and could you specifically comment on the progression of software within the auto space too?
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think, the progression of software in the auto space, as we've always talked about is on the backs of the hardware installed. so as we continue to see traction and get installed into these adas systems, we see opportunities for software there. one of the things that we showed in the first quarter of this year is lidar-based, automatic emergency braking system, comparing it with the state-of-the-art camera and radar system, where you could see significant advantages, especially in the nighttime for the lidar-based system over the camera radar base systems.
as you can imagine, this has led to some very deep conversations, not just around level three, but on level two, level two plus sorts of applications, where we could provide not just, again the lidar hardware, but our paeb software solution as part of the offering. so lots of great progress there. but ultimately, the time to revenue for software in paid ads will be combined with when the hardware gets installed on the vehicles. and so that that continues to be the critical path.
richard shannon -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
got it. ok. thanks for the detail. and that's all for me.
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] and the next question comes from aileen smith with bank of america.
aileen smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good afternoon, guys. first question, when we look at the 2021 revenue outlook, it's a pretty notable shortfall versus what i think was $150 million, plus that you outlined upon going public in september of last year. but it's also the lowest annual revenue that you've reported since 2016. i think we can all appreciate that there's some near-term headwinds associated with semiconductor shortages and supply chain disruptions.
but 2021 looks like it could be more of a structural air gap as you try to make the shift from r&d project-based lidar to commercial multi-year contract lidar. so why or why not would that be a fair characterization for 2021? and what gives you confidence that some of the out year financial targets you've outlined are still valid?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah. so the key thing for us, aileen is the fact that we are still having deep conversations with customers across a broad base of contracts, about these discussions, where they are actively interested in looking forward and moving forward with these different production agreements that we're talking to them about. and they provide a baseline, as the world starts to accelerate, again, hopefully here in the second-half of the year, we'll be able to see that pickup, and we'll be able to get back on pace for the expectations of the forecast for 2022. so it's really, if there's anything in the air gap, we really feel it's more kind of a macro headwind.
and that it really should start to take shape here in the second-half of the year, as the vaccinations and other things start to take hold and the market starts to come back.
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
just to add some color to that. we should keep in mind while we talk about that, that as we sit here today, we still have the highest revenue of all the lidar companies in the market. we have a maximum number of units produced and shipped across the broader set of applications, as a broad product portfolio, the largest pipeline of projects in the space. so i think this is what gives us confidence that we can we can hit the numbers that we outlined in the in the future, as we sign these multi-year agreements, and will these deep relationships with our customers and manufacture and scale and deliver these products at scale?
aileen smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok, that's helpful. and then, i wanted to ask another question around the gross margin. some of the comments today are a little bit counterintuitive, versus how you describe the company upon going public of shifting more toward that fabulous model and manufacturing with partners. and then also relative to some of the factors that you outlined is driving margin expansion, like the micro-lidar arrays and low cost country sourcing.
again, i think we can understand covid delayed the manufacturing transition a little bit, and it's going to be a pressure point this year. but if you think about the business going forward, is there a certain volume or revenue level that we should be thinking about above which you can leverage fixed costs? and what i'm trying to get out with this is, as we think about bridging that 16% to 24% gross margin this year versus 50% plus of the long-term, is it something that can be achieved in the next year or so as you complete the shift toward stem balanced manufacturing or are your targets based on certain volume levels that may have been pushed out along with covid?
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
so i can start and then drew feel free to jump in as well. again, keep in mind that we build and ship real volumes of products. and as we make these transitions, these transitions are not a step functions. so you have to transition starting from subsystems and work your way to building an entire lidar.
so yeah, these transitions really are driving our ability to switch to the gross margins that we have talked about. and as those transitions get completed, we will be able to move toward those targets that we are talking about. in terms of the micro-lidar array, the asics, these things are in production both in our factories as well as our partner factories. and as the product mix evolves and more and more of the products are using the micro-lidar array, you will see that part of the rewards also being transferred into the gross margins.
so i think it is it is more complicated, because we -- again, we have a broad portfolio of many different products that we build and ship. at the same time, the plants that we laid out are still absolutely valid. the transition for the micro-lidar array the asics across the product line is happening. as we talked about before by end of 2021 we will have the entire product line will have the benefit of micro-lidar array, and the transition to overseas manufacturing is happening.
and we continue to make progress on that despite covid.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
we share that by giving you kind of a direction of the gross margins as we come out of the year, so that, that will be a linear trend that should continue upward as we go out of 2021, and into 2022 and beyond.
aileen smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. great. thanks for taking the question.
operator
thank you. and this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing comments.
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
thank you. as we started off saying, velodyne lidar is the leading producer of lidar in the world, and we are clearly the ones defining the lidar market. and this happens to be because we have the highest revenue in the space, we build and ship more units than all the other players put together combined, in multiple product categories. we have a broad portfolio of products.
we have a robust pipeline of products across many different applications. we have the manufacturing leadership and ability to scale up to meet the demand, and whether the inevitable uncertainties that exist in the marketplace. and finally, we are moving forward fast and including software as part of our offerings with our first software product that we announced today. with all of this, we have very high confidence in our ability to continue to grow, continue to execute, as we have done so consistently, and continue to be the pioneer in bringing lidar-based safety, across all of these different applications to all of our customers.
thank you very much for your time and your questions.

hello and welcome to the velodyne lidar first-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to moriah shilton. ms. shilton, please go ahead.
moriah shilton -- investor relations
good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss velodyne inc. first-quarter 2021 financial results. with us on today's call are dr. anand gopalan, velodyne's chief executive officer; and drew hamer, the company's chief financial officer.
before we begin, i would like to remind you that shortly after the market close today, velodyne issued a press release announcing its first-quarter 2021 financial results. velodyne also published an investor presentation. you may access the press release and presentation in the investor relations section of velodynelidar.com. today's discussion includes forward-looking statements.
please refer to our press release for a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements. i would also like to remind you that during the call, we will discuss some non-gaap measures related to velodyne's performance. you can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable gaap measures in velodyne's quarterly financial press releases. to ensure that we address as many analyst questions as possible during the call, we request that you please limit yourselves to one initial question and one follow-up question.
now, i'd like to turn the call over to dr. anand gopalan, ceo of velodyne. 
anand gopalan -- chief executive officer
thank you, moriah. and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon. i'm anand gopalan, ceo of velodyne lidar. as the leading lidar producer in the world, and the one that is clearly defining the lidar market, we continued to make great progress in the first quarter of 2021.
once again, velodyne shift a market leading to 2,684 sensors in the quarter, and continued our leadership position in solid state sensor sales, with more than 600 sensors sold. we shipped 65% of our sensors to customers as spot-buys, which we use to seed the global lidar market, and 35% of our sensors to customers under our multi-year agreements with them. our strategy of leveraging our manufacturing scale to seed the global lidar market with our products is evidenced, both by the strong spot spot-buy business, as well as the continued conversion of these customers into multi-year agreements, which number 29 as of may 1, up from 26 as of february 19. we are also seeing increased pipeline strength.
velodyne's pipeline of projects grew to 198 projects as of may 1, up from 194 projects reported on february 19, 2021. when you look at where we were one year ago at this time, we are seeing significant growth in the robotics and industrial segment, which is one of the lidar segments closer to commercialization. in addition, 23 of our projects now include software as a component. we continue to build out that aspect of our business by providing complete hardware software solutions to our end customers.
in the first quarter, we also built out our executive team with seasoned technology and business veterans. we appointed sinclair vass, as chief commercial officer; james barnhart, as chief operating officer; and mike jellen was promoted to chief strategy officer. we strengthened our board of directors with the appointment of hamid zarringhalam, corporate vice president of nikon cooperation, and deborah hersman, former chair of the national transportation safety board, ntsb to our board. velodyne lidar is the market leader with a broad portfolio of products at the necessary price points to drive mass market adoption of lidar.
we have been working with companies across various lidar segments on r&d projects for more than 10 years, as lidar technology matured to the inflection point we are at today, with the first wave of mass commercialization ramping across several segments. our ability to manufacture and ship at scale will be crucial in this new phase. our lidar technologies are the eyes for autonomous machines, which operate in many diverse markets, each of which having different time to revenue, different tams, different sales pipelines and different margin profiles. for example, the mapping an av markets, considered the traditional market for velodyne continue to be strong, and have good long term viability as they ramp at a linear pace.
our rotational products are in high demand in these markets, and continue to be the de facto reference architecture for the industry at large. to break out auto more finely, interest in the adas market is growing robustly, with commercial revenue ramping a few years out. in the adas market, there is significant and growing interest in our solid state solutions, which are targeted at large volume applications. further, lidar in consumer vehicles is being accelerated by new ev players in the space, who are adopting lidar and advanced safety technology at a rate that is far outpacing the traditional automotive oems.
companies in the industrial robotics segment are automating everything, from heavy construction machinery to the airborne drones that could deliver packages to your door. safety and potential cost savings, plus operating in geo-fenced environments are the dynamics driving automation of construction machinery. additionally, the automation of the supply chain is being driven by the significant growth in e-commerce. we are receiving revenue today from sales of our products for industrial robotics applications, across a variety of different segments relating to getting goods from the port to your doorstep, and all using lidar to do so.
we are heading toward a future that involves autonomy, not just in mobile systems, but in the infrastructure that helps these machines navigate through the world. there is a renewed effort by governments across the world to update aging infrastructure. adding lidar sensors and intelligence to the infrastructure can make cities safer and more productive, without violating personal privacy. in both smart cities and industrial robotics, we see opportunities to sell not just hardware, but complete solutions of hardware plus software, increasing the value we bring to customers.
all of this combines to make a robust business for velodyne a very robust cohort of customers. we are the category definer and several of those categories are now ramping to mass commercialization with velodyne playing an important role. it's incredible to see the technology, products and solutions that we develop, touch everyday life in so many meaningful ways. here are a few examples.
first delivery. we announced in the first quarter, a multi-year agreement with gatik, the industry leader in automating on-road transportation network for b2b middle mile logistics. gatik is using velodyne's lidar sensors as a key part of a fully redundant sensor suite to deliver goods safely and efficiently, between micro fulfillment centers, dock stores and retail locations. a logistics flow known as the middle mile, that is an expansion of supply chain robotics.
gatik fulfills revenue generating autonomous orders daily for multiple fortune-500 customers in the u.s. and canada, including walmart, reducing customer costs, and keeping delivery times short. gatik solution helps retailers meet consumer demand for rapid delivery of goods, driven by soaring e-commerce growth, increased road safety for all road users and help consumers and customers meet an unprecedented expectation for contactless delivery. it may surprise you to learn that gatik av using velodyne sensors were likely involved in delivering some of the goods that you are using in your home today.
we have previously talked about other projects in the space around forklift applications, warehouse logistics and last mile delivery. in mapping, in the first quarter, we announced a multi-year agreement with agm systems, who provides state-of-the-art hardware and software technology for the collection, processing and analysis of air and mobile mapping data. some of the largest companies in the world rely on agm solutions, equipped with our ultra-puck to achieve precise mapping. agm systems products are an example of how velodyne sensors enable serving, real time assessment and monitoring applications of valuable energy resources.
in april, we jointly announced with knightscope, one of our robotics customers, with whom we have been working for seven years, that they had selected our lidar technology to power their future fifth generation autonomous security robots. knightscope's robots have been patrolling across the country for well over one million hours, and operate across five different time zones. we are seeing an increased interest from potential customers for complete solutions that go beyond just sensor hardware. as you may have seen earlier today, we have introduced our first hardware software solution, the intelligent infrastructure solution or iis, which is used in the smart city segment.
when implemented, iis will enable everything from safe intersections to robust data for city planners. in our cities, the cost of congestion is estimated to be $350 billion annually, and our iis will help reduce this burden. there is a growing commitment by governments worldwide to rebuild our data transportation infrastructure systems. in the u.s., the biden administration has proposed to invest $2.25 trillion to modernize vehicles, roads and transit systems.
as we look at a world with connected and autonomous vehicles, we know that infrastructure will play a critical role in moving this industry forward. also announced this morning, we signed our first iis sales agreement with rutgers center for advanced infrastructure and transportation, to deploy our iis equipped alpha prime lidar sensors at multiple intersections in new brunswick, new jersey, as part of the middlesex county smart mobility testing ground project, in collaboration with the new jersey department of transportation. the same technology can be used to monitor public and retail spaces, providing valuable real time data and analytics, without violating individual privacy, giving it a clear edge over camera solutions. now, let's turn to the automotive market.
first adas, it is becoming clear as we work with our customers on lidar for mass adoption, that the winning solution needs to have the right performance and cost combination to ultimately win. a great proof point is evidenced by faraday future selection of velodyne to be the exclusive lidar supplier for their flagship ff 91 luxury ev, bringing adas and advanced safety to the ff 91. our solid state velarray h800 lidar sensors will power the ff 91's autonomous driving system that aims to deliver a comprehensive suite of highway, urban and parking autonomy features. we also continue to work with major high volume oem customers, such as our ongoing collaboration with hyundai mobis for mass production of level three lidar system.
in av, we continue to bring new technologies to market, supported by the strength of our core foundational ip. we have a product today that already hits 265 meters at 10% reflectivity. but we are certainly not stopping there. we are building the next generation that will see farther and can be manufactured at lower cost and higher volume, which will be the key for mass adoption and commercialization of lidar in this segment.
we believe that lidar will be the primary sensing modality for fully autonomous vehicles, and that velodyne's technology will be front and center as avs rollout in the coming years. velodyne has been able to create the broadest lidar product portfolio on the backs of its common core technology platform, called the micro-lidar array. this technology forms the common engine that allows us to scale down cost and increase manufacturability, without compromising on performance. this approach continues to be unique in the industry, and gives us the strongest opportunity to capture new applications in this broad emerging space.
the velabit, our smallest sensor brings new levels of versatility and affordability to 3d lidar perception. it is a cornerstone solution in our mission to democratize lidar-based safety and autonomy. as we show off this incredible technology to our major customers, we are getting tremendous positive feedback with over 25 pipeline projects that include a velabit sensor. the versatility of our velabit enables customers to use it in multiple applications, such as, for sidewalk or last mile delivery, and industrial warehouse obstacle detection and path planning, or for pedestrian and traffic monitoring for efficiency and safety improvements, or to assist with blind spot monitoring, rear cross traffic detection and urban paeb.
speaking of paeb , in the first quarter, we demonstrated how velodyne's affordable lidar based paeb solution delivered superior performance in all conditions, a decisive advantage over radar camera based systems, which can significantly improve pedestrian safety. with our sensors priced for mass adoption, we truly are democratizing the usage of lidar based safety in level two plus across as many cars as possible. over the past few months, the world has continued to grapple with incredible challenges. and we have faced them by coming together and focusing on real problem solving.
velodyne is a microcosm of this. and i am incredibly proud of what we have achieved as a business, building real products, working with incredible customers, and ultimately, by continuing to live up to our mission of bringing lidar technology to many applications that can touch everyday lives meaningfully. velodyne continues to be the pioneer and leader that it has always been in defining this exciting space and forging a path to a safer future for all. now, i'd like to turn the conversation over to my colleague, drew hamer to go over our financials.
thank you.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
thank you, anand. before i begin my quarterly financial review and provide our outlook, i want to spend a moment discussing the sales cycle driving our multi-year production agreements. the sales cycle begins with a customer discussion around the need for solution that would benefit from incorporating lidar technology, including potential software requirements. based on these discussions, potential sensors that align with the use case are identified along with the anticipated start of production date or srp.
customers then generally do what we refer to as spot-buys, or book in turn orders to purchase sensors as part of their research and development process related to the solution. when they are ready to put in place in industrial production agreement that includes at least three years of volume and pricing forecasts and share this information with us, the project is added to our multi-year project pipeline. completion of this cycle comes with a design award or signed multi-year agreement. as anand mentioned earlier, of the 2,684 sensors we shipped in the first quarter of 2021, 65% of the sensors were spot-buys, 35% of the sensors were shipped to customers with multi-year agreements.
now, i would like to begin my quarterly financial review. total revenue was $17.7 million, compared to $17.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. product revenue was $10.6 million, compared to $14.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. the company's weighted average selling price per sensor was $3,887 compared to $3,381 per sensor in the fourth quarter of 2020.
the overall product revenue reduction reflects a previously discussed decline in unit sales due to covid-19, and ongoing evolution of the product mix. license and services revenue of $7.1 million included a $5.5 million licensing fee. total license and services revenue was $3.7 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2020. gaap gross profit was $1.9 million and non-gaap gross profit was $2.7 million compared to a fourth-quarter 2020 gaap gross loss of $5.3 million, and non-gaap gross profit of $2.1 million.
gaap gross profit was reduced by $800,000 of stock based compensation expense, compared to fourth-quarter 2020 gaap gross loss, reflecting $7.4 million stock based compensation expense. gaap operating expenses were $42.5 million and non-gaap operating expenses were $28.6 million, compared to fourth-quarter 2020 gaap operating expenses of $106.1 million, and non-gaap operating expenses of $22.1 million. gaap operating expenses included $13.3 million of stock based compensation expense, including employer taxes, compared to fourth-quarter 2020 gaap operating expenses, including $83.8 million of stock based compensation expense. gaap and non-gaap operating expenses included increased spending in research and development, that is in response to the visibility provided by our multi-year agreement pipeline.
gaap net loss was $40.8 million and included $14.2 million for stock based compensation expense. non-gaap net loss was $26.1 million. gaap net loss per share was $0.22 and non-gaap net loss per share was $0.14. this compared to a fourth quarter of 2020 gaap net loss of $111.5 million, included $91.3 million of stock based compensation expense.
non-gaap net loss was $20.1 million. fourth quarter of 2020 gaap net loss per share was $0.64 and non-gaap net loss per share was $0.12. eps for the first quarter of 2021 is calculated using weighted average shares outstanding of 189.2 million. as of march 31, actual shares outstanding were 190.8 million.
velodyne completed the quarter with $383.6 million in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet, which included $89.3 million in proceeds from the exercise of publicly traded warrants. now, i would like to review our business outlook. at the end of the first quarter of 2021, we estimate we could have the opportunity for over $1 billion of revenue for signed and awarded projects through 2025, plus, a pipeline of projects that are not yet signed and awarded of $4.5 million. in addition, it continues to be our top priority to invest in scalable lidar architectures, advanced manufacturing technology and software solutions.
this underpins the company's long-term business outlook with total gross margin percentage ranging in the mid to high 50s and ebitda margin of more than 20%. we also anticipate our multi-year agreements increasing to at least 34 by december 31, 2021. now, for our full-year 2021 financial statement guidance, revenue is expected to range between $77 million and $94 million. our revenue comes from a global customer base to whom we are actively shipping products.
we are seeing parts of our market come back and meet the expectations for the second-half, such as the u.s. and china. other geographies we serve, such as europe, the rest of asia and india are impacted more negatively by the continued toll of covid-19, and are struggling to keep programs on track for spot-buys and multi-year agreements. these remain macro headwinds, another reason we are providing the broad revenue range.
this compares to a full-year 2020 revenue of $95.4 million, which included unique one-time items of $11 million in product revenue from a restocking fee, and $17.5 million in license and services revenue that came from lump sum licensing activity. when we account for these non-periodic elements, we expect to see product based revenues grow year over year, despite various macroeconomic uncertainties. non-gaap gross margins are expected to be between 16% to 24%. this reflects fewer units sold to cover remaining fixed overhead costs of our factory in san jose.
on a gaap basis, gross margins will include approximately $2 million of stock based compensation expense. on a non-gaap basis, operating expenses are expected to range between $125 million and $129 million. based upon the visibility provided by our multi-year agreement pipeline, we are increasing our spend in new product development by approximately 50% in 2021. general and administrative expenses will increase by approximately 30% in 2021, due increased public company and legal expenses.
on a gaap basis, operating expense will include approximately $84 million of stock based compensation expense, that reflect approximately $52 million to be charged against sales and marketing in the second quarter, related to our 2020 merger with graf industrial. on a gaap basis, income tax expenses are anticipated to be approximately $600,000. weighted average shares outstanding for the year are estimated to be 193.5 million. now, i would like to turn the call over to the operator for questions.

we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] and it appears our first question comes from itay michaeli of citi. please go ahead.
itay michaeli -- citi -- analyst
great. thanks. good afternoon, everyone.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
hi, itay.
itay michaeli -- citi -- analyst
hi. just hoping we can just go through the kind of second-half gross margin bridge again. just want to understand the key puts and takes to kind of drive the implied second-half exit rate?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, as we're looking at the second half of the year for gross margins, we've given you a sense of what we see for sensor counts. and we -- so that will contribute to the gross margins as we -- we're still a little bit delayed in getting the manufacturing moved offshore. so that -- and just in the sensors, creates a little bit of a drag on where those gross margins will go.
but as you get out toward the higher end of the range of the guidance we provided, there is a pretty solid pipeline of newer contracts that will come along with some non-recurring engineering, which is a significant gross margin contribution upwards of 100%. so as we have a kind of clear pipeline to bottom end of the range, but more confidence as we get out into the middle, the additional nres will bring that gross margin number up. so as we look out toward the end of the year, we expect that the gross margins start to move up from there as those nre deals come in. 
itay michaeli -- citi -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then just on the adas award that begins in 2026. can you give a little bit more color maybe in terms of the region and perhaps even the prospective volume of that award going forward?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
so, without getting into too many specifics because of the -- what's that phrase, is it confidential?
unknown speaker
confidential.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
confidential nature of the agreement. the -- that is a large oem, and it's project we're working with them closely on. they have actually -- i think there are two projects underneath there, but we're just going one for now. and it starts moving into what would be a normal oem scale kind of volume, and it would be in the adas space.
itay michaeli -- citi -- analyst
got it. ok. that's very helpful. thank you.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
ok.
operator
our next question comes from colin rusch from oppenheimer. please go ahead.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
thanks so much, guys.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
hi, colin.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
you know, with your non-auto customers, can you talk about the level of activity versus a year ago in terms of customer quotation sales cycle, close -- like so what's going on in that segment of the opportunity?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, you know, it's interesting to us. even when we look at our -- the project pipeline that we share with people in our investor presentation, we're seeing significant uptick. i think the initial adoption for lidar is going to be coming more from our kind of robotics and industrial customers.
and so when you look at this space, adoption will be -- come a little bit faster. the sales cycles come a little bit more quickly, and the implementation and use of the sensors has happened much more rapidly. so, as we're looking at -- even as we look out a couple of years into our forecast, we're expecting that the linearity of revenue will actually start with these industrial, maybe in robotic sensors, some of the smart city and other kind of nonautomotive applications. and then as automotive comes into play in the later years, '23, '24, '25, '26.
this relative -- this side of customers will start to generate revenues. and the other automotive space will start to generate volumes of sales as well that will kind of gather up and catch up. so we are seeing a much shorter sales cycle, much quicker implementation to -- from when you get the design win to start a production with the industrial customers. and so that was resulting in quicker revenues for us.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
perfect. and then, within the guidance, how much of that guide is constituted by nre?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
so the -- you know, we have -- we're pretty comfortable that a smaller portion of the low end of our guidance is nre. so, it's mostly made up of sensors. but as we get out further into the range of the guidance, it becomes more and more nre at this point because the volumes to catch up would be -- would require having those fixed contracts in place today and the manufacturing up and running. so that is going to be a little bit more at the higher end of the guidance.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
ok. thank you so much, guys.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
next question comes from rajvindra gill of needham and company. please go ahead.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
hi, rajvi.
unknown speaker
hi. yeah. hi, guys. this is actually denis asking a question on behalf of rajiv.
so, first question is just regarding the solid-state transition. do you guys mind talking just a little bit about like kind of maybe the mix of solid-state versus regular sensors and maybe kind of who the top adopters are right now for your solid-state sensors?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
sure. so, i can take this one. yes. so for us, the initial solid-state sensors are actually going out to people in the industrial space.
we have a lot of kind of r&d buys. there's certainly a lot of that. we mentioned how, with our velabit days that we had here, we had a lot of activity, but those aren't necessarily turning up in revenue. so, those will be more production in the coming years.
the velarrays, which are producing the solid-state sensors today, in terms of kind of moving into production are more in the industrial spaces. this would be kind of the delivery space. we're seeing a little bit more of the activity for industrial contracts for multiyear agreement kinds, as well as discussions in the smart cities or the iis solutions and what's another space, i think it's three of the mine. so yes, i think we covered most of it there.
unknown speaker
could you guys provide any color on how many of the solid states you shipped this quarter?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
we put in there, it's about 234, something like that. we're anticipating that it will increase as we get into q3 as well. so there's going to be a balancing. i think it's like a lot of things that even like our asps are one of those things, where you need to be careful not to take this quarter's asp and assume that that's going to be next quarter or that there's some kind of a steady decline trend there.
i think people need to use multiple quarters and look for a linear line trend, it will be a little bit more gradual. so, as it relates to the sale of the solid-state versus the rotational, there's a balancing act going on where the mix will change from quarter to quarter. but gradually, more and more, we're going to see more of the solid-state sensors moving in there.
unknown speaker
and well, my follow-up was actually related right to that. is there anything you can tell us about what kind of asps, either for the rotational units or for solid-state kind of how you're trending either sequentially or year over year? is there any kind of color you can provide either on the high-end units or some of the lower-end units in detail would be great?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
without -- you know, i'm not going to get into much more detail and tell you that we have a weighted average asp that we share with everybody. however, we have seen the prices of all the sensors coming down. and as we get out into next year and the years beyond that, as our mla and asic chips become incorporated in the rotational sensors, we'll be able to manufacture them at a lower cost, which will also allow us to -- while still maintaining our gross margin targets, be able to sell them at lower price points and achieve broader market adoption, which is sticking with the strategy that the company has had in place for about five years now.
unknown speaker
got it. all right. that's it for me. thank you very much.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
thank you for joining. have a good day.
operator
our next question comes from richard shannon of craig-hallum. please go ahead.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
hi, richard.
richard shannon -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
hello, guys. hi, drew. just a clarification, drew. did i hear something in your prepared comments about something like 30% of your sales are coming from solid-state sensors this year expected? i know i got that wrong, so please clarify what that was.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah. we believe that overall sensor sales, we're going to see a bit of a pickup in the solid-state sensors here in the second half of the year, and they could be upwards of 30% of our total sensors sold. so looking at our current kind of visibility that we're getting from customers and expected buys from them, as well as the work that we've got with multi agreements, we see that as a very real possibility. and that's steady.
i believe we shared that with you last quarter as well.
richard shannon -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. maybe i missed that one. and is that especially for the year or for the second half?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
for the full year. 
richard shannon -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
so clear. ok. perfect. thank you for that.
let's see here. my first question was, obviously, when you -- in your process to coming public, you talked about a large last-mile delivery customer. and i think you just mentioned the, you know, potentially new opportunities with that customer. specific to the last-mile delivery engagement, is that one still on track in terms of timing and scale?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
so, of course, due to confidentiality obligations, i can't be too specific about that, but we are seeing nice pickup on the delivery solutions, yes, we are. and then, we're also seeing some nice activity with a similar type of customer in china, who's also going to be using that our sensors or similar applications. so, that is a -- we're really seeing nice activity across kind of the space that includes some of these e-commerce, large e-commerce customers.
richard shannon -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. perfect. and my follow-on question was following up on the topic of gross margins here. just trying to get the -- again, the bridge to the second half of the year to fit the full-year range, even if getting to the low end with gesture looking at gross margins in kind of the 30% range for the second half of the year.
is that a fair number? and since that wouldn't include much nre, would that be, you know, a range to think about going into next year?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, the low end of our guide, the low end of our gross margin -- gross margins would be at the low end of our revenue range. but it would be, you know, kind of escalating a bit as we come out of the year here as we start seeing unit volumes continue to pace as they are.
richard shannon -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. fair enough. that's all for me. thanks.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from aileen smith of bank of america. please go ahead.
aileen smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, everyone.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
hey.
aileen smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i wanted to follow up on the commentary -- hi. i wanted to follow up on the commentary that a lot of the traction you're seeing on the solid-state centers is actually coming from industrial end markets. i think most of us would characterize velabit, or i think you've characterized velabit in the past as really the level 1, 2 plus adas-oriented sensor. so, is your customer traction on the automotive side consistent with your expectations? or what's your thought process on what is a sustainable mix of solid-state sensors between automotive and nonautomotive end markets over time?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, that's a really important question because the last part of your statement is really -- you know, it's the over time part. so, you know, we live in a unique world where you guys kind of measure us on how we're doing this year and this quarter in terms of our p&l. but where are we expecting things to go in the coming years.
so, for the current period, you know, we're seeing -- so, the solid-state sensors being picked up in industrial spaces, where those markets are really kind of the early adopters of this technology, and it's rolling out a little more quickly. we are getting a lot of activity in the adas space, very much so around the velabit, as well as some of our velarray products, what we're working with. and some of our asia customers is strictly along the velarray family line. and then, the 2026 solution that we talked about is also solid-state, primarily around the velarray space.
so, in time, we're expecting that the automotive space will probably -- not so much the robotics, so i should say, the robotaxi space. robotaxi is not as concerned about aesthetics, and they're more likely be using rotational sensors on their cars because they're more efficient and provide more data to ensure the safety of the vehicle driving. but as you get into cars that are more focused on the aesthetics, then the velabits and the velarrays become more important because they can embed them in the car and doesn't, you know, detract from the nature of the vehicle. so, we are seeing a lot of activity.
there was a lot of, you know, very, very good feedback from the oems when they hear for our velabit days a few -- you know, a month or so ago. and we're having a lot of extended conversations with them at this point around that.
aileen smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. that's helpful color. and then, i wanted to touch base a bit, i think on slide 12 and to kind of compare it versus last quarter. is there anything to read into the billion-dollar revenue number, and signed and awarded contracts despite what is an increase, i think, of 15% to 20% in the number of those signed and awarded contracts themselves? i think it was 29 in may 2021 and 34 as of this quarter.
yet the, you know, estimated revenue number is similar. are some of the contracts that you're winning smaller in scope or revenue size? or have there been adjustments to perhaps assumptions in the previous pipeline?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, this is -- it's a very important conversation because the reason why we kind of talked about 2026 activities because we aren't forecasting or providing any information on that yet, which we'll probably do starting next quarter. but -- so, the billion-dollars is, you know, with these additional customers. some of the industrial contracts are slightly smaller than the myas.
it's just the very nature of their businesses, where others of the more recent mya agreements continue to be larger and will expand in the coming years. but as you start looking out past 2025, we're seeing the potential for those numbers to continue to expand rather substantially with some automotive activity. so, you know, for right now, we're confident that these numbers, you know, become a little bit more reliable, and we're working toward ensuring they're, you know, turning into the p&l. and adding additional contracts is something we anticipate.
as time comes to pass, these numbers will continue to grow.
aileen smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. and one more, if i may. can you provide a little bit more color on what specifically is the delay in the industrialization process and moving some of your production offshore, particularly, as it sounds? you referenced it last quarter. and it sounds as if it's incrementally worse this quarter than maybe you, perhaps, had anticipated.
so, as you think about that resolving itself through the remainder of the year, you know, what's still outstanding that needs to be completed that the industrialization process will get back on track?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
you know, if you don't mind, i'm going to introduce jim barnhart. he's our new coo. he's had a month here evaluating this. he's seasoned coo with many -- this is in his first rodeo as coo.
he's evaluated it. he's got some feedback. and then, i'll add some additional color at the end if there's any other questions for a follow-up. jim?
jim barnhart -- chief operating officer
thanks. good question, aileen. and certainly, you know, the pucks have been with our contract manufacturers for years. the strategy was to have the pucks assembled.
and so -- then sent back to our facility here in san jose for final testing. and we're moving toward having really the full work being done at the contract manufacturer. so, that's in process. and what's frankly delayed it is, again, the resurgence of covid, both with our contract manufacturers facility in thailand, as well as in japan.
they, unfortunately, have been hit fairly hard with the delta variant. so that has delayed not getting the equipment in the facilities but allowing our engineers to travel to help make sure that things are properly set up, calibrated, aligned, etc. there's been some delay there. but certainly, with the ultra pucks, it's already, you know, completely with the contract manufacturer in japan.
and we're in process with the alpha prime transition that is moving forward as well. but again, it has been somewhat delayed just due to the unfortunate timing of the resurgence of the covid pandemic. i guess, just to comment also -- sorry, but the velarray, the m1600 and h800, those transitions are in progress as well, even as we're finalizing, you know, the various phases of designs of the product. so, already, these subassemblies, the modules, if you will, that go into the full lidar module, those are in process of being transitioned to the contract manufacturers as well.
so, to your point, it's slowed a little bit to the right, but it's really due to the resurgence of covid that have slowed things down for us a bit here.
aileen smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. great. that's very helpful commentary. thanks for taking the question.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
ok. thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from michael filatov of berenberg. please go ahead.
michael filatov -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
oh yes, thanks for taking my question. i guess, i just want to follow up on a question that was asked by one of my fellow analysts earlier about that last-mile delivery customer. i believe in an earlier presentation you put out a while ago, you know, there had been some numbers put out that said, you know, 100,000 units related to that customer for 2022 and ramping to 250,000 in 2023 and 2024. so rather important, i think the projections.
so, i'm just wondering -- i mean, obviously, you don't have to say who the customer is, but i mean, are those volumes still in play? is that customer still in your, you know, multiyear agreement backlog? you know, just any other additional comments?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
so, the customer is still in the multiyear agreement backlog. i think the -- you know, we're not giving any 2022 guidance as of right now, but it's not unreasonable to suggest that the customers' priorities might change where some of the things could move in any direction. but we also believe that with some of the other activity from other projects that are coming in, if anything, move down, others could move up. so that kind of beauty of our business relationship is, you know, we're in multiple industries with multiple products with multiple customers.
so, as it relates to that one customer, there are so many different opportunities in there that even if that did slip, we believe that other solutions would probably fill in.
michael filatov -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
got it. thanks. and then just looking at, you know, license and services revenue. if you back out the lump sum sort of one-time adjustments, i guess, from the prior year, it looks like maybe sort of a baseline coming into this year would be $10 million for the license and services revenue.
but even if you annualize the first half and back out that one-time, you know, number from the first quarter, it looks like maybe license and services could be like, you know, $10 million or less. i don't know. maybe tell me if i'm wrong there. but on top of that, you know, with asps coming down, it seems like your volume growth -- unit growth would have to be pretty robust in the back half.
i mean, we're talking, you know, maybe 50-plus percent unit volume growth in the back half from a step-up in the run rate. so i guess, is that achievable? i mean, is that sort of what you're targeting in terms of unit volume growth? or is there maybe, you know, a mix impact that's going to drive the asp back up in the back half of the year? 
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
so, i did talk about, you know, the volume of sensors we expect, at least, in the second half of the year by quarter. so you can put that together. we think asps -- and like i said, they're probably not going to be -- it's going to be more of a linear trend for asps than trying to take one quarter and applying that. so it could be overly conservative if you just use q2's asps.
and then the -- any deltas between what you might get from taking unit volumes and asps will probably be made up in nres. and the nre opportunity is pretty significant for us right now.
michael filatov -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
gotcha. thanks. and then, one last question just around sort of the adas activity recently. i mean, we've seen from other competitors in this space, you know, awards from some several oems.
i guess, i'm curious, i mean obviously, you guys have been competing for those awards. i just wanted to get your thoughts as to why you think, you know, velodyne hasn't been selected for the sort of a near-term award outside of faraday future. just any commentary as to why you think that could be? 
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah. you know, it's an interesting conversation because when we talk about the awards, i'm not sure what your near term is, but, you know, we're not expecting anybody to see anything significant in the next year or so. so, you know, the awards -- most of the words we've heard discussed and we've seen out there a couple of years out, we believe that a lot of those will still be in play. you know, we've had -- we mentioned earlier, we've had some conversations with customers who are coming back to us because the ones who are more near term are finding that the people they selected, or who might have previously announced their relationship, are unable to produce, and they're not confident in the sensors to be able to perform at the level that was expected, where velodyne lidar is currently producing sensors and can deliver sensors at the volumes that they need to meet their start-up production targets, and are also going to be capable of providing the levels of, you know, accuracy that they need in order to be able to release their systems.
so, you know, this is -- you know, it's an evolving story, but that's why we've gotten so far. so, we are aware of some of them. we look at them, and we feel like some of them are kind of really still kind of r&d stage, and there's still -- you know, this could change. and we'll see the dynamic we just discussed could play out more so in the coming years.
michael filatov -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
understood. thank you for the color. i appreciate it.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
ok.

good day, and welcome to the velodyne lidar second-quarter 2021 financial results conference call. all participants will be in listen-only mode. [operator instructions] after today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [operator instructions] please note, this event is being recorded.
i would now like to turn over to ms. moriah shilton. please go ahead. 
moriah shilton -- investor relations
good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us on today's conference call to discuss velodyne lidar's second-quarter 2021 financial results. with us on today's call are drew hamer, the company's chief financial officer; and members of velodyne's office of the chief executive, or oce. jim barnhart, the company's chief operating officer; and sinclair vass, the company's chief commercial officer. drew will run through the call's prepared remarks and jim and sinclair are available for q&a.
before we begin, i would like to remind you that shortly after the market closed today, velodyne issued a press release announcing its second-quarter 2021 financial results. velodyne also published an investor presentation. you may access the press release and the presentation in the investor relations section of velodynelidar.com. today's discussion includes forward-looking statements.
please refer to the press release for a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. i would also like to remind you that during the call, we will discuss some non-gaap measures related to velodyne's performance. you can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable gaap measures in the press release. to ensure that we address as many analyst questions as possible during the call, we request that you please limit to one initial question and one follow-up question.
now i'd like to turn the call over to drew hamer, cfo of velodyne, and one of the members of velodyne oce. 
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
thank you, moriah. good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. as moriah mentioned, i am one of the four members of our oce, and together, we are executing on the company's growth strategy as developed by members of our executive team and former ceo, dr. anand gopalan.
as many of you know, anand now serves and in an advisory capacity, and our board is undertaking a search to find a full-time ceo. the oce has decades of collective business experience, including operations, general management, supply chain, services, manufacturing, engineering, employee engagement, financial strategy, and execution in industries ranging from telecommunications to consumer electronics, automotive, and industrial laser markets. speaking of markets, the use of lidar today in our served markets and emerging target markets like gaming continues to gain momentum. we are executing against this trend by closing deals with customers across a variety of markets, supported by a broad lidar product portfolio that we are manufacturing today.
velodyne is the only lidar company that has an off-the-shelf, full software and hardware solution that can be put into vehicles and infrastructure. we are the global lidar leader, shipping more units in the second quarter than the aggregate of all our peers when combined have reported shipping year to date. we shipped more than 3,800 sensor units in q2, up from more than 2,600 in q1 as we increased the breadth of market adoption for our lidar, across multiple industries and applications. of those units, 260 were solid-state units.
we expect roughly 30% of our sales to be solid-state for the full year. not only did we ship more sensors in the prior quarter, we also shipped them to a larger group of customers as 72% of our sensors sold were through spot buys, indicating the broader market interest for our solution. the number of inquiries from customers is increasing. we believe we are now going through the other side of the covid-19 pandemic.
we expect unit volumes to start averaging more than 3,800 sensors a quarter for the rest of the year. we are listening to our customers and moving people and goods closer to them. we've placed inventories in china and europe. we are strengthening in-country technical support in all the regions we serve, including south korea.
we also established a design center of excellence in india. we continue to deepen our relationships with existing customers and building relationships in new markets. we signed five more multiyear agreements, bringing our total to 34 and meeting our prior stated goal for the year, well before the end of the year. we now expect to sign four additional multiyear agreements by the year-end, which will bring our total to 38.
our pipeline continues to grow. we had 213 projects at august 1st, up from 198 projects at may 1st. twenty-five of these opportunities include solid-state velabit, included in the signed and awarded pipeline are new adas multiyear agreements, which we expect will begin to ramp starting in 2026. we have an additional $4.5 billion of opportunity for projects that are not yet signed and awarded that go through 2025.
turning to our served markets. i would like to run through both how lidar sensors and software are being used in the various applications of the various markets, as well as provide an update on our progress with customers. we have 300-plus customers over the past decade have bought product and most continue to buy product from velodyne. we are seeing many of these customers move from a long research and development phase with lidar to the first wave of mass adoption.
first, automotive. in adas, you will find our solid-state velarray h800 long-range sensor, velarray m1600, a mid-range sensor, and velabit from ultra-short-range to mid-range sensing. all of our sensors can enable advanced blind-spot monitoring, parking assist, lane keep assist, adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, including for pedestrians, and more. faraday future was our first publicly unveiled automotive program using the velarray h800, and we are currently making progress in our relationships with major high-volume oem customers as well.
for example, our project with a major tier 1 adas provider in asia for mass production of level 3 lidar systems continues to move forward. as part of this project, we are adding headcount in-country to support this effort and to build further relationships with customers in south korea. av can use both solid-state and rotational lidar. an application could include the full suite of rotational surround-view product family, including our pucks, ultra puck and alpha prime mid- to long-range sensors, plus our solid-state velarray mid-and long-range sensors and velabit, which are ultra-short-range to mid-range sensors, or it can start with rotational and move to solid-state is needed.
as one example, trunk.tech, the first company in china to independently develop level 4 driverless trucks, will use our ultra-puck in velarray h800 sensors as core sensor hardware in its autonomous trucks. trunk.tech recently became one of the first companies to obtain beijing's permit that allows road tests for self-driving commercial vehicles. as i mentioned earlier in the call, we are increasing our in-country support, as well as moving inventories closer to customers. we are already seeing these efforts result in new customer wins.
we have signed another large company in china, who will use our current and next-generation rotational lidar sensors to support their logistics with precise, reliable navigation for real-time autonomous vehicle operation. we are working with existing customers to extend their current agreements with us to include additional products within our portfolio. some of these opportunities came to us as a result of the customer's concern that their current lidar supplier cannot manufacture the scale they need. in robotics and industrial, you will find our surround-view product family, including our ultra-puck and alpha prime, plus our solid-state velarray in velvet.
we recently signed an agreement with an undisclosed north american large company to provide our sensors and solutions for use in warehouses. this builds upon our existing agreement for relationship with this customer for last-mile delivery. it's another example of our success in deepening our relationships with our customers due to our broad product portfolio. as announced earlier this week, antibiotics is equipping its autonomous mobile robots with our puck sensors.
by using our puck sensors, the antibiotics robotic inspection solution is able to map industrial environments to detect obstacles and allow an email to avoid any collisions while navigating harsh environments with a higher level of accuracy. we also signed a five-year sales agreement with a leading defense and security company who have selected our sensors to provide mapping and autonomy capabilities for their robots, the large-scale manufacturing production of which is scheduled to begin in 2024. the quality of our lidar sensors plus our ability to mass manufacture continues to set velodyne apart from its competitors and are driving additional customer wins for us. in addition, you will also find our surround-view product family.
seabed b.v., which specializes in high-quality equipment for offshore surveying and dredging has selected our puck sensors for its lidar mobile mapping system. the seabed system is a turnkey mobile lidar solution for hydrographic surveys that helps companies transform their businesses with offshore 3d mapping solutions, which can deliver highly accurate, detailed data collection to support safe navigation and protection of marine environments. last but not least, our smart city solutions, which is our first offering to combine software and hardware. our intelligent infrastructure solution, or iis, combines our award-winning lidar sensors and powerful ai software to monitor traffic networks and public spaces.
in may, iis was named a winner of the 2021 smart 50 award, which honors the 50 most transformative smart cities projects in the world. iis is deployed in multiple north america cities, including in quebec and british columbia, boca raton, florida, with upcoming installations at the rutgers campus in new jersey and austin, texas, and moving forward with a significant project in the bay area. in july, we announced we joined the nvidia metropolis program, which is designed to nurture and bring to market a new generation of applications and solutions that make the world's most important spaces and operations safer and more efficient with advancements in ai's vision. at velodyne, we continue to advance our industry-leading technology.
on the hardware side, in june, we launched the next generation of velabit sensor, which delivers on what our customers are asking for, an ultrawide field of view fov and higher resolution. our next-generation velabit was launched in under a year, highlighting our commitment to meeting our customers' demand. we have developed a demo day for key customers in june. seventeen companies attended, including five oems and other customers evaluating or using our solutions in industrial robotics, delivery, av, and adas applications.
across the board, companies told us they are looking forward to incorporating the product in their solutions. importantly, development is equipped with our breakthrough proprietary micro-lidar array architecture for mla. the mla brings together the core elements that make lidar work, the optical chip and our asic or application-specific integrated circuit technology. the miniaturization, combined with velodyne's proprietary fully automated manufacturing process enables cost-effective, high-quality mass production.
we are currently working on our next-generation rotational sensors that will use proprietary asics and our mla technology to provide ultra-long-range, high-resolution auto-grade performance at scale. overall, for all hardware technology choices we have made, we are marrying the high-performance that is needed with scalability and the ability to manufacture these technologies at the right cost point to enable mass-market adoption. on the software side, last week, we launched a new software development kit that allows customers to utilize the advanced capabilities of our vella lidar perception software in their autonomous solution. the vella development kit, or vdk, enables companies to accelerate time to market for bringing cutting-edge lidar capabilities to autonomous vehicles, adas, mobile delivery services, industrial robotics, drones, and more.
technology innovations such as these advance our mission to democratize lidar-based safety and autonomy. the role lidar can play in improving safety and autonomy continues to gain recognition by the larger public sphere as well. recent news from the nhtsa on reporting crashes, involving autonomous vehicles in adas, shows that the federal government is taking a hard look at crashes and near misses for vulnerable road users such as pedestrians. we have a solution available now that enables automatic emergency braking for a wide variety of objects, including pedestrian.
on the commercial vehicle side, we developed our velarray for a windshield implementation and the federal motor carrier safety administration recently published a notice of proposed rulemaking concerning vehicle safety technology installed on the interior of commercial motor vehicle windshields, which, if adopted, will provide a blanket exemption for lidar and therefore, should lower the threshold to its adoption. on the infrastructure side, the smart cities and communities act would provide technical and financial resources to local governments to implement smart city technology, especially suburban and rural communities. smart city is a proxy for technology that enhances and deploys safety in the infrastructure. at velodyne, we have technology for both infrastructure and vehicles and are the only lighter company as a result, providing a full circle of safety and autonomy.
now, i'd like to discuss our financials. i will review first our second quarter and first-half results and then provide our full-year 2021 guidance and business outlook. total revenue was $13.6 million compared to $17.7 million in the first quarter of 2021, which included a $5.5 million licensing fee. product revenue was $12 million, up nearly 30% from $10.6 million in the first quarter of 2021 as we were getting renewed demand for our lidar sensors from customers with delayed purchases due to the uncertainty caused by the covid-19 pandemic.
the company's weighted average selling price per sensor was $3,106 compared to $3,887 per sensor in the first quarter of 2021. license and services revenue was $1.6 million, compared to $7.1 million in the prior quarter that included a $5.5 million licensing fee, i previously mentioned. gaap gross loss was $5.8 million and non-gaap gross loss was $5.3 million, compared to our first-quarter 2021 gaap gross profit of $1.9 million and non-gaap gross profit of $2.7 million. gaap gross loss in q2 did not benefit from the licensing fee in q1.
gaap operating expenses were $84.8 million and non-gaap operating expenses were $28.8 million, compared to first-quarter 2021 gaap operating expenses of $42.5 million and non-gaap operating expenses of $28.6 million. gaap operating expenses included $53.2 million in stock-based compensation expense and including employer taxes. included in stock-based compensation expense was approximately $42 million charged against sales and marketing-related to our 2020 merger with graf industrial. this compared to first-quarter 2021 gaap operating expenses, including $13.3 million of stock-based compensation expense, including employer taxes.
included in general and administrative expenses are $1.4 million in legal and professional expenses in connection with our audit committee's investigation announced in the first quarter of 2021 and to conduct by david hall, the company's former chairman; and marta hall, the company's former chief marketing officer and a current director of the company. for the first half of 2021, this figure was $3.7 million. gaap and non-gaap operating expenses included increased spending in research and development that is in response to the visibility provided by our multiyear agreement pipeline. gaap net loss was $80.7 million and non-gaap net loss was $34.4 million.
gaap net loss per share was $0.42 and non-gaap loss per share was $0.18. this compared to a first quarter of 2021 gaap net loss of $40.8 million. non-gaap net loss was $26.1 million. first quarter of 2021, gaap net loss per share was $0.22, and non-gaap net loss per share was $0.14.
eps for the second quarter of 2021 is calculated using weighted average shares outstanding of 193.0 million. as of june 30, actual shares outstanding were 195.2 million. velodyne completed the quarter with $353.6 million in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet. now, for the first half of 2021.
total revenue for the first half of 2021 was $31.3 million, comprised of $22.6 million in product revenue and $8.8 million in license and service revenue. this compares to $45.4 million in the first half of 2020, of which $27.9 million was product revenue and $17.6 million was license and service revenue. gaap net loss for the first half of 2021 was $121.5 million and non-gaap net loss was $60.5 million. this compares to a gaap net loss of $33.1 million for the first half of 2020 and $35.9 million in non-gaap net loss.
now, for our full-year 2021 financial statement guidance. revenue is expected to range between $77 million and $94 million. we are seeing parts of our global markets such as the u.s. and china recover, while other geographies is still negatively impacted by the continuing toll of covid-19.
we believe we have good line of sight to the low end of our guidance range and see a number of larger projects that would provide upside revenue should they come in. many of the upside projects would generate nonrecurring engineering revenue in 2021. non-gaap gross margins are expected to be between 13% to 24%. this reflects fewer units sold to cover remaining fixed overhead costs of our factory in san jose, while we experienced ongoing delays in moving this manufacturing offshore due to covid-19.
gross margins at the higher end of our revenue guidance would benefit from increased nonrecurring engineering. on a gaap basis, gross margins are expected to include approximately $2 million of stock-based compensation expense. on a non-gaap basis, operating expenses are expected to range between $125 million and $129 million. based upon our expectations regarding our multiyear agreement pipeline, we are increasing our spend in new product development by approximately 40% in 2021 compared to 2020.
we expect general and administrative expenses will increase by approximately 35% in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increased legal expenses and public company expenses. on a gaap basis, operating expenses would include approximately $87 million of stock-based compensation expense that reflects approximately $42 million to be charged against sales and marketing in the second quarter related to our 2020 merger with graf industrial and $8 million related to the recent departure of our ceo. on a gaap basis, income tax expenses are anticipated to be approximately $800,000. weighted average shares outstanding for the year are estimated to be 193.5 million.
finally, i would like to review our business outlook. at the end of the second quarter of 2021, we estimate we can have the opportunity for over $1 billion of revenue from signed and awarded projects through 2025, plus a pipeline of projects that are not yet signed and awarded of $4.5 billion. as i mentioned earlier, included in our multiyear agreements are new adas agreements, which are expected to begin to ramp starting in 2026 and the years beyond. this concludes my formal remarks.
operator, we are now ready to take questions.
",2021-Q2,VLDR

operator
[operator instructions] first question is from colin rusch of oppenheimer. please go ahead.
kristen owen -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. this is kristen on for colin. thank you so much for taking the question.
i wanted to follow-up on some of the final remarks that you made about just sort of the variability and rollout schedules. really wanted to ask about your customers have been operating in this hand-to-hand combat environment for the last year now. how are you seeing the pace of innovation and design cycle times right now with your customers? and if you could provide just some context around the end markets and how that differs among those end markets, that would be helpful. thank you.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
fair enough. i think i'm going to start with the final question first, i guess, then, because each of the different markets -- i'm sorry, this is drew. each of the different markets certainly has its own pace. and what we're seeing in the industrial markets and the last mile delivery markets, as well as some of the mapping and other industrial sectors, the pace of design is increasing.
we see that in our pipeline, the number of projects that have entered our multi-year agreement pipeline has increased substantially in that space very nicely, in fact. and the time to market for a lot of their solutions tends to be about a year, maybe two years at the most. when we start talking about the automotive manufacturing solutions, those solutions tend to be further out. they could be four or five years away from the design win to the design completion and the start of production.
so they tend to take a much longer and require a much larger investment by velodyne lidar. and so really, the shift we're seeing right now is there is a more rapid movement in the industrial space to commercialization and revenues for velodyne lidar. and for the automotive space, we're feeling like that still feels any real rapid movement there is still going to be four or five years out.
kristen owen -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
that's really helpful. and then wondering if you can touch on any changes in the competitive environment? we're certainly seeing some indications of industry consolidation. but also, as you're focusing on this customer engagement and quality, are you seeing any customers come back after working with other platforms?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah. it's our belief that now that we're getting into more of a higher volume production, our focus is on the higher quality on a consistent basis in what we deliver. the sensors that are going out to customers, they want sensors to be the same kind of performance every time when they open up the box and they take it out. being the one company that's doing that on a regular basis, has created opportunities where customers have come back and let us know that the reason they want to go with velodyne is because those sensors are consistent when they receive them.
we've also, during this quarter, with the assistance of jim barnhart, spent a lot of effort in really closing our relationships with the existing customers who are buying some of those sensors and making sure that we're meeting that requirement, which has allowed us to -- or put us in a position where we had to move some of this revenue out to q3 as we've ensured that the quality of the products was -- and the performance was consistent from sensor to sensor. they opened each box. the impact of that is definitely something that customers have given us a lot of feedback is much appreciated. it's something that they're counting on and they're looking forward to.
and then our continued evolution along those lines is something that they expect. and the fact that we're the leader in that space should lead to additional deals coming not only going forward, but also, i'm sure, in the current quarter, i should say, but out into 2022 and beyond.
kristen owen -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
thanks. and if i could fit one more in. i do just want to ask, as we're looking at that first wave of mass commercialization, how are you feeling about component availability and your confidence in ramping production? thank you.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
jim, do you want to take that one?
jim barnhart -- chief operating officer
sure. yeah. this is jim. excellent question there, kristen, and we are seeing increased lead times, of course.
we're working with our suppliers, giving them advanced forecast on a rolling 12-month availability right now. we are having some near-term surprises here and there, but nothing that has gated our production yet, and we're working daily with customers -- excuse me, with suppliers to make sure we're getting the components in. and the constraint is there, as everyone is seeing, but we are overcoming that on a regular basis. and as we see the pre shortages as we're looking out at least a quarter in advance for our production needs with our contract manufacturers, as well as the direct recatch to our suppliers, we're addressing these shortages as we see them.
and so far, we've been able to mitigate all of them. and we're continuing to do that, like i say, on a regular basis. it is rather tactical at this point. but we -- i'd say, working with customers to make sure we have the clear demand from them and sending those signals to our supply chain, we've been able to keep the supply continuity and anticipate being able to continue doing that.
kristen owen -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
great. thank you so much. i'll turn it over.
operator
thank you. next question is michael filatov of berenberg. please go ahead.
michael filatov -- berenberg bank -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question, guys. i guess this is going to be a pretty straightforward one. do you anticipate revenue increasing next year?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yes. 
michael filatov -- berenberg bank -- analyst
ok. great.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
based on the contracts that we have in place, some of the pos that we've already received from customers, we are expecting in the conversations we've had with a number of customers we do, as we go through this next two, three months, we talk to all of the 300-plus people that we sell sensors to, and we get some feedback from them on what they expect their needs to be and what they're expecting. what we have changed here in the forecast that we've provided for the rest of this year, so we've taken out the nre portion. so in the past, we've had customers tell us about they'll have a contract, and it will have a piece of nre. we're finding that those tend to take a little bit longer to close, and then they're going to be lumpy.
so what we're really looking at right now, if you look at our kind of revenues from last year and you take out the kind of the one-time items, we had the one-time restocking fee in q3, and we had some other license revenues that came in from somebody who is now a license customer of ours, we're expecting you're going to see some nice growth in our product revenues this year and what we anticipate as we go forward in '22 and beyond is that these product revenues will continue to maintain a growth. and then to the extent that the nre types of relationships do come in, we're going to leave those to be kind of an upside and instead focus on product, product quality, and delivery of sensors to customers, and then we will take those things as they opportunistically present themselves.
michael filatov -- berenberg bank -- analyst
got it. thank you for that thorough answer. just following up on that, i mean, you guys have lowered the non-gaap gross margin guidance again. and i'm kind of curious, do you have sort of a target revenue level in mind for when you expect to reach maybe breakeven on the operating income line or ebitda level? is there a target revenue threshold you're expecting or a time frame that you're expecting to reach breakeven?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah. so at the avoidance of not getting 2022 guidance, it's our belief that with some of the work that we're doing, it does have something to do with the mix of products. we're continuing the work of getting our production done offshore, which will also contribute to that. but it will be the increase in the product volume.
so we should expect that as we come out of next year, we should be getting to that breakeven and maybe even better as we go out into '23, '24. but again, that's subject to our review of everything that we're going to be providing for the 2022 plan. now that we have ted on board, we're giving everything for our overview.
michael filatov -- berenberg bank -- analyst
got it. all right. i'll leave it there. thank you.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
thank you, michael.
operator
thank you. the next question, mark delaney of goldman sachs. please go ahead.
mark delaney -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, guys. good afternoon, and thanks for taking the questions. i believe you said ted's on as well. and so i was hoping to start with a question for ted, and maybe talk about your experience with velodyne so far, what led you take the job and any initial views you may be able to share with us?
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
sure, sure. so first of all, let me thank drew for the generous introduction and just say how excited i am to be a member of the velodyne team. it truly is an honor to have been unanimously selected for this position by the velodyne board, and i'm really looking forward to rolling up my sleeves and working with the team to do a deep dive across the company and all the business areas. i was attracted to velodyne for a very simple reason, which is, as you all know, the company is the undisputed lidar technology pioneer and market leader.
the company has the broadest product portfolio, has shipped more sensor units than all the other competitors in the industry combined. and very importantly, velodyne is really the only company that's demonstrated the ability to manufacture at scale. and so i looked at that and just saw an enormous opportunity to build on that strong foundation. for those of you who are familiar with my background, you'll know that i have a proven track record of building and scaling innovative technology businesses and driving revenue growth, profitability, and shareholder value, which, in my view, is exactly what velodyne needs today.
so this was a perfect fit. and as i said before, i look forward to working with the velodyne team to unlock the company's potential and make that a reality.
mark delaney -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you. and if i could ask a second question, i'm hoping to better understand the consistency issue with the product that was mentioned in the prepared remarks. if you could talk about it from a few different dimensions. i mean, maybe first, how did you identify the issue? do you have a good handle now on what's causing it? have you come up with a fix and a timeline to fully remediate the consistency issue with the other products? thanks.
jim barnhart -- chief operating officer
sure. yeah. good question. this is jim.
we found during the quarter that customers, in some cases, were actually using sensors in applications beyond the original intent. for example, ultra puck's originally were released with the anticipation of being for more automotive use, and customers are starting to use them for mapping and surveying type applications where there are concerns for tighter accuracy in some cases. in other cases, a different sensor -- we're seeing -- on the puck, the vlp-16, as we call it, we're seeing both high-temperature requests, as well as even back to the ultra puck for a freezing temperature request. so we're taking all that feedback in, and we actually did pause shipment while we made sure on the individual sensors, the product families, i should say, make sure we understood really well what the customers were looking for.
we, in some cases, modified firmware to enable us to go to the freezing temperature type operations. other cases, we changed the components to enable some of the higher temperature operations. and just bottom line is, as drew mentioned, we have received very positive feedback from customers on that. they appreciated the fact that we kept them informed of what we were doing.
we did delay some shipments to them, but made sure that what we were shipping was going to be conforming to their actual use case requirements. and again, the feedback has been quite positive from the customers on that. and i will say it's actually been positive among the employees as well. they appreciate the fact that we're making sure that what we're shipping now to customers are -- is really more conscious of what their use case needs are and conforming to their needs and drew mentioned it in the prepared remarks that we've been refining both the engineering practices for how we actually release the products, as well as the production processes for producing them.
so it's really coming all together, the holistic approach to quality. we really doubled down in q3, the third quarter, and we're continuing that going forward. so, so far, the momentum is quite positive there.
mark delaney -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. next question will come from aileen smith, bank of america. please go ahead.
aileen smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good afternoon, everyone. thanks for taking the questions. first one on the number of projects and the theoretical units that you have in the pipeline. i just wanted to square this away with the presentation last quarter.
i think you had 213 projects that you were citing for 9 million possible units versus this quarter, you're pointing to 220 projects with 7.5 million units. i think we can understand that some of the more incremental projects you're winning are coming from nonautomotive end markets, and those are more spot buy than the multi-year high-volume programs. but how do you explain the change in the 1.5 million sensors that are so-called missing from quarter to quarter? and are the contract terms really changing that much as you are in rfi or rfq or other stages?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
so this is over -- first of all, i just want to be careful. there's nothing missing. we are gathering this information from the customers. it comes from them specifically, and we provide to you our pipeline.
so this isn't a -- this is a pipeline of the business that we're currently tracking and the opportunities that are presented. and when i share with you a pipeline, you're seeing the dynamics of any normal business, where it goes in and out based upon customer needs. so the change that we saw this quarter is a result of direct conversations with a number of our customers about where they're saying -- they're seeing changes in the priorities of their business. a big chunk of this change actually came from the pre rfi category, where a customer has indicated that a big business that they're planning on entering into as they've continued to evaluate their business and restructure their business model and focuses for the future, they've decided to spend less in one of those segments, and they'll be -- so they anticipate volume of purchases would be declining.
there are other areas where, as with a number of customers who are moving forward with their projects, but as they've gotten into the projects and they better understand their capabilities of launching, they've reduced the amount of sensors that they might be buying on the front end, even though they're still expecting to achieve the total volumes, year two, three, four, or out, which have also impacted those numbers as, again, we're talking to them on a regular basis. and as these customers are launching, they're very close contact with us about what their needs are so that we can set up the production lines and meet their needs. so that has also affected what we're seeing in the pipeline. so this is a living, breathing pipeline.
this is a normal business. it's a lot of disclosure, but we think it's right so that people understand the opportunity and the potential for lidar in the future. that's why we continue to provide it.
aileen smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. great. understood. that's helpful.
and then i wanted to ask a question around the average selling price and specifically in comparison to the first quarter. and apologies, i think these numbers are right, but when i'm looking at the mix of units sold that are solid-state and some of your lower price sensors, your absolute units from the first quarter to the third quarter, we're about comparable, but the percentage of the total was much lower, and yet your weighted average selling price was also much lower in 3q versus 1q. so that would lead us to conclude that you're dropping price potentially substantially across some of your older and more legacy products. is that a fair interpretation? or are we missing something?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
well, first of all, in the first quarter, we had almost 2,700 units that we shipped. in this quarter, we shipped over 4,400. so the volumes are up substantially. it's affected a bit because we are seeing an increase in the number of solid-state sensors that we're shipping.
and those are shipped at a lower price. so when you're doing a weighted average asp, of course, that's going to have an impact. and then as it relates to the traditional role -- the rotational sensors, there are some contracts we have with customers that are certain volumes. we do normal unit volume commitments with those people or -- sorry volume price commitments with those customers, and so there are some that may be sold at lower prices versus some that are sold to others.
it's really not an isolated thing. but as we go forward, we're expecting that on a linear basis, we try not to take it one quarter at a time or sequential quarters. we do expect that we're going to see asps coming down on a linear basis, we'll also see movement inside the number of units that are shipped. and as we get further out in the mix between solid-state and rotational and the higher price and lower price sensors starts to come into play, we'll see this dynamic continuing as we go forward that volumes will go up.
as volumes increase, they'll offset some of the decreases that are coming from the asps, and that will give us the appropriate contributions we need to the business.
aileen smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. but as a clarification, i was referencing the solid-state units from 1q versus 3q, which i think were both around 600 units. that 600 units in the first quarter out of a base of 2,700 versus out of a base of 4,400 in the third quarter on a mix basis, that's actually accretive for you guys in the third quarter. so i'm also trying to square away, that average selling price would imply that across your other products, some of those rotational products that you were taking down price on those units.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
there have been some price reductions on those units because customers have increased the volumes that they're purchasing. so on a unit volume versus price agreement, there will be some of those happening, but i think it will be -- it will -- like i said, it's not going to be something we could look at on a sequential basis. we should see things like this happening on a more linear basis, but we could also see those rotational sensors go up and up in price as well on an asp basis in future quarters.
aileen smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. great. that's helpful. thanks for taking the questions.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
thank you for joining the call.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from sam peterman, craig-hallum capital group. please go ahead. thank you, sir.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
hi, drew. thanks for taking my questions. my first one is going to be on that same slide in your investor deck that shows your pipeline, not on the $7.5 million versus 9 million units. but if you look at kind of the -- just as a percent of the whole graph, where adas is at, it looks pretty similar to prior quarters where it's trending up pretty strongly in later years.
and it doesn't look like there's a huge change to kind of what you're expecting from adas and yet your adas projects in that pipeline are down quarter over quarter and year over year, quite a bit year over year. so i'm just curious how you reconcile that? and if you can give us any color into what is going into your thinking on adas there and what you're seeing from customers?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah. so on the adas customers, we are seeing those projects aren't moving as quickly as we've indicated. they could take three to four, five years. and customer priorities are shifting on a pretty regular basis, and it's an area where we're very carefully evaluating the adas space, while we're getting tremendous activity from the industrial space.
so we are seeing that some of those projects are -- they're shifting. the oem's priorities are changing and their commitment to incorporating lidar into their solutions. we'll have varying priorities as we go forward.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. and then one more on adas is you talked last quarter about your 2026 agreement with an oem, i believe, in asia for -- around your solid-state product. i'm curious if you could provide any update on that and how that's looking and then. i'm not sure this is clarified for then -- in an rfi or a key stage? or just any color around that would be great.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah. that's actually -- we're focusing on the rfi, rfq stage with that. it's a very close partner, one of the oems in asia. and we work with them.
we've set up an operation close to them, and we work with them on a regular basis and have daily calls with them on that project and getting to that point where we can have those sensors move to the signed and awarded category.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. thanks. then quick last one for me on velabit. pipeline went up here for a substantial bit.
i'm curious if you could give any color on the markets that you're seeing some activity and where those additional eight wins or eight projects into your pipeline are coming from?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah. so we are seeing enormous demand for us to get the velabits to market. it's a product that we really don't have planned for production, commercial availability until about 2023. and the amount of interest from customers has made it a top priority for us to keep that moving along.
we are seeing across the board demand for that solution. a lot of activity in the oem shops. there's a lot of activity in all of our industrial customers. and then -- and it's interesting, there's even as we break down the industrial customers between the last mile deliveries, the kind of the robotics and even in newer spaces like delivery using drones and things like that, it's a really tremendous response from the market for us to get that product out and to them.
so it's really widely spread that we're seeing it across all the markets, the interest in buying that, and we're very aggressively moving to get that to beat their standards.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. thanks, drew.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. next question will be from tristan gerra of baird. please go ahead.
unknown speaker
hi. this is tyler on for tristan. maybe first off, can you talk about what efforts you're putting into the software platform that maybe extends beyond just object recognition and into car actualization?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah. so we have actually got -- we've already built out a kind of a platform of products that can be incorporated into those systems. we are working very closely to identify additional features and functionality that the customers would want and require so that we can incorporate that into our development plans as we go out to 2022 and beyond. and then we'll work closely with them on any feedback they have as we continue to develop that and work toward some kind of a commercial agreement.
unknown speaker
ok. great. and then for my follow-up, do you expect a rebound in 360-degree lidar shipments? and if so, what would the timing of that inflection be? and then maybe what applications would you see that inflection point in?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
a rebound in rotational sensor. so we actually haven't seen a decline in the demand of the rotational sensors. we are actually in a number of very, very steadily selling our puck sensors. our alpha puck sensors actually had a nice uptick this quarter, contributing to the unit volumes, as aileen kindly pointed out earlier.
we are also engaged with a number of customers around the next-generation lidar sensors, which will use our mla and our asic chips. so we have a number of customers that want to use some of our sensors that will be kind of moving toward that automotive-grade capability, and they're working very closely with us and defining how that should work they're running tests on those sensors today on their vehicles. and so i really don't think it's as much a rebound as we do expect it to continue to be a strong product for velodyne lidar, a market-leading product, as well as our velodyne products. and -- sorry, our solid-state products.
and we do have agreements with customers to incorporate it into solutions. so i think you'll see it in the automotive vehicle solutions, the av, sorry, autonomous vehicle solutions. and we're also seeing an interesting dynamic where with the robotics, some people want to use rotational because it gives them more data and gives them a full surround view from one sensor where others just want to use a solid-state sensor, whether it's a velarray, or a velabit. and then we're also seeing that in the iis solutions where people use them in an intersection, it gives them, again, it gives them more data so that they can see the whole intersection with one sensor.
so we're really -- and then we also have in mapping. a lot of people use our rotational sensors, our tuck lights, and they'll put them on drones, and they'll use them to do topographical mapping. we also have a customer who's using it for backpacks. so they put them on backpacks and they use them walk around people's neighborhoods and do the mapping in the neighborhoods as well.
so really seeing rotational sensors are still very much a product that people want, as well as giving them that option to be able to go with a solid-state sensor.
unknown speaker
all right. great. thanks for all the color.
operator
thank you. next questions comes from raj gill of needham & company. please go ahead.
denis pyatchanin -- needham and company -- analyst
good afternoon, everyone. this is denis on for raj. so for my first question, i just want to ask them, can you talk about your current kind of mix of the in-house versus outsourced production? and how much of the guidance reduction that we're seeing here from the previous one was due to supplier component challenges that you're having versus this issue of improving consistency?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah. so we don't usually speak specifically to the particular components of in-house versus out of house. but what we have shared previously is that a number of our sensors are being produced by our contract manufacturers. so our pucks, a number of other products, our ultra pucks, even our vls-128s are now being produced by contract manufacturers.
however, as we started looking at our solid-state products, we haven't been able to move as many of those offshore because of the delays we've talked about in previous quarters. although a number of the components are being produced offshore, and then they come back to the united states for final assembly. and then the newer products as they're being assembled and stood up, those will continue to be done here in the san jose facility. so the spilt is generally done across the line.
i'm sorry, i think there was a second question there and i missed it. would you like to repeat it, please?
denis pyatchanin -- needham and company -- analyst
sure. so essentially, and then we had the guidance reduction here versus last quarter, moving to 61.5% from 85% or so how much of this was due to component shortages that are affecting the entire semiconductor industry versus just the ones that are -- versus this issue of you guys trying to improve consistency for volume production?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
it's actually -- none of it has to do with supplier shortages or anything of that nature. it's mostly around the improving production consistency for our customers. but it's also just an expectation that we're finding nre very difficult to forecast. so we have customers who are talking to us about long-term contracts.
and we had some of that in the pipeline because it felt like they should move forward in q3 or certainly in q4, and we're believing that they're taking longer than expected. so that part, we've decided to take out of the forecast, and we're leaving it as an upside unless we have the signed agreement in hand as we go into the guidance.
denis pyatchanin -- needham and company -- analyst
great. and then so with regards to the issues of moving production offshore, so in the current quarter, would you say that the situation is getting worse? is it the same or is it improving? can you provide some more color on some of these issues and what's going on as we speak essentially?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
i'll let jim speak to that.
jim barnhart -- chief operating officer
yeah. it's interesting -- this is jim. i don't see any issue with moving production offshore. i mean, we're continuing with the state of the strategy as we do our development in-house to the initial prototyping up to pilot in our main center facility.
and then once we have the technical transfer documentation done, what the manufacturing process instructions are, etc., we hand that package off to the contract manufacturers for production. and that's -- actually, that's progressing well.
denis pyatchanin -- needham and company -- analyst
all right. that's it for me. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from michael filatov of berenberg. please go ahead.
michael filatov -- berenberg bank -- analyst
hey. sorry. just another one for me. i was looking -- just to confirm, the non-gaap gross margin guidance for the full year.
that negative 8% to positive 10%. is that correct?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
no, it's negative 8% to negative 10%.
michael filatov -- berenberg bank -- analyst
ok. gotcha. thanks for clarifying that. just looking at sort of the full-year revenue guidance again, i mean if you look back at the original stack deck, it was $150-something million for 2021 and now it's in the 60s, and margins are obviously down quite a bit.
i mean what would you characterize as the main driver of that quite significant change in the revenue and margin expectations for this year? and what is the primary driver of that?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yeah. for us, the primary driver, now that we're at the end of the year versus when we came into the year or actually, when this -- these numbers were provided during the merger, honestly, so these weren't even guidance for the company for the year. the main thing that we're seeing that's a difference from what we saw back in the beginning of 2020 versus to where we were today is, of course, throughout the year, there was the impact of covid slowing programs down and creating that dynamic for the first two, three quarters here of not being -- customers just sort of slowing everything down, pushing it out, we locked into some. we've definitely been impacted by that.
and then some of that is resulting in some of the projects that we were expecting to get this year, pushing out to next year. so people are as they come back, they're starting to pick those projects back up again, and we look forward to those coming back into vogue in 2022. and then lastly, i think the key thing for us now, of course, in this forecast is a lot of those pipeline numbers there were consistently that nre piece, and by taking that out, it's gotten us to where we are with the current forecast that we're sharing with everybody.
michael filatov -- berenberg bank -- analyst
so based on what you said, it seems like things have just kind of gotten shifted back. does that imply that in the next year or two, we could see that $150 million plus revenue become realized?
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
it -- we have seen things shift back. and what we want to be really careful of, especially given the benefit of having ted come on and evaluating all the different components of the business, as we talked about earlier, is that that would be the case. so i can't verify or deny that right now, but we are certainly going through every single project in our pipeline, having deep conversations with those customers to gain better understanding of where they're at with their projects and what their intentions are going forward, so that when we speak to you again, we're giving you a cleaned up deck, if you will, of what we're looking at.
michael filatov -- berenberg bank -- analyst
all right. thanks very much.
operator
thank you. that concludes the question-and-answer session. i'll now turn the call back to management for closing remarks.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
ok. well, everybody, i just want to thank you very much for joining our call today. i want to thank, we're very excited to have ted join in the company. it's honor to be working with him and looking forward to working with you going forward.
again, i also just want to reiterate, we are very excited about what we're seeing in our unit volumes increasing. the activity that we're seeing with our industrial customers is really exciting for velodyne lidar because we expect it, at least in the near term, that will be the key generator of revenues. as we go forward, it will allow us to build out our products, our ability to produce its scale and consistency, and the level of quality that customers expect. and then as we get out into the future, as other projects get closer to start of production, we're looking forward to being able to satisfy customers' needs in ways that other lidar companies can't because we'll be that proven technology that has evolved to having all of the various components of their boxes they need to check in order to be able to use a lidar sensor in one of their solutions.
so thank you very much for your time today. we look forward to talking with you more as we go forward. and hope you all have a good evening. bye-bye.

thank you, andrew, and welcome to velodyne. ladies and gentlemen, as most of you saw, on november 10th, we will have a new ceo, ted tewksbury, leading our company. ted is a seasoned technology executive who brings to velodyne, a proven track record and more than three decades of experience leading innovative businesses. a true visionary.
i am looking forward to working with him to expand our lead in the global lidar industry, execute on our strategic growth plan and drive long-term value for all shareholders. i also would like to welcome our new board member, virginia boulet. she is a renowned corporate governance expert, whose expertise and deep experience will further strengthen our board of directors. since our last earnings call in august, we have done a number of things.
we signed one additional multi-year agreement for a total of 35 on track for our goal of 38 by year-end. we've grown our pipeline to 220 projects with an increasing concentration in the industrial and robotics market, which make up a third of the pipeline projects and has grown nearly 50% when compared to last year at this time. we believe the industrial and robotics market is one of lidar market's closest to commercialization, and we expect our activity with customers in this market will only accelerate. we shipped more than 4,400 sensors in the third quarter, continuing our market leadership.
our customers today are giving us purchase orders for larger volumes as they move into the first wave of mass commercialization. we are the global lidar leader, shipping more sensors in the third quarter than the aggregate of all our peers combined that have reported shipping sensors year to date. we expect to ship more than 15,000 sensors in 2021, up at least 28% over 2020 and significantly more than our peers. the interest for our new solid-state products continues to grow.
we shipped over 630 solid-state sensors in the third quarter, more than double the prior quarter. we are excited about the potential for these next-generation products and anticipate long-term growth in the linear fashion, smoothing out what could be volatility from quarter to quarter. velabit projects continue to grow. we now have 33 opportunities, including solid-state velabits, up from 25 in the prior quarter.
we anticipate shipping velabit samples for revenue late in 2022. overall, the use of lidar today in our served markets continues to gain momentum. in automotive, we continue to make progress in our relationships with both emerging and major high-volume oem customers for the use of our lidar in adas systems. in av, we are working with new customers and existing customers who are looking to extend their current agreements with us to include additional products within our portfolio.
in robotics and industrial, we announced a multi-year agreement with renu robotics to use our puck sensors and their vegetation management for solar energy facilities. in mapping, we have new customers such as topodrone, which is based in switzerland and develops affordable, high-precision solutions for aerial surveys. they signed a multi-year agreement for our sensors to be used for high-precision mapping and 3d modeling in demanding environments, including farms, force, and infrastructure to support development that advances economic and sustainability goals. we are also collaborating with move.ai to provide robot manufacturers with enterprise-grade automation solutions, including mapping, navigation, obstacle avoidance, and risk avoidance.
we also expanded our relationships with existing customers, such as agm systems, who has deployed our alpha prime lidar sensor on the agm-ms5.prime, their latest high-performance mobile scanning solution. this is the second sensor type agm systems has purchased from velodyne. last but not least, our smart cities. our intelligent infrastructure solution, or iis, was selected for a major deployment in the university of california irvine smart cities initiative, where it will be used at 25 intersections as part of a $6 million road network project in irvine.
we continue to expand our iis proof-of-concept deployments across north america. now for our financials. i will first review our third quarter and nine months results and then provide our full-year 2021 guidance and business outlook. total revenue for the quarter was $13.1 million, compared to $13.6 million in the second quarter of 2021.
product revenue was $11.8 million, slightly down from $12 million in the second quarter of 2021 due to a combination of the lower weighted average asp than the prior quarter, reflecting the ongoing evolution of our product mix toward consumer affordable solid-state sensors and ensuring consistent performance across and within our product lines, crucial for our customers as they ramp toward massive commercialization. the weighted average selling price per sensor was $2,622, compared to $3,106 per sensor in the second quarter. license and services revenue was $1.3 million, compared to $1.6 million in the prior quarter. gaap gross loss was $4.7 million, and non-gaap gross loss was $4.2 million, compared to a second quarter gaap gross loss of $5.8 million and non-gaap gross loss of $5.3 million.
gaap operating expenses were $50 million, and non-gaap operating expenses were $33.4 million, compared to the second quarter gaap operating expenses of $83.3 million and non-gaap operating expenses of $28.8 million. third quarter gaap operating expenses included $16.3 million of stock-based compensation expense, including employer taxes. this compares to the second quarter gaap operating expenses that included $53.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, including employer taxes, of which $41.6 million was charged against sales and marketing, the majority of which was accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation related to our 2020 merger with graf industrial. included in general and administrative expenses are $1.3 million in legal and professional expenses in connection with our audit committee's investigations and to conduct by david hall, the company's former chairman; and marta hall, the company's former chief marketing officer and the current director of the company.
for the nine months ending september 30, 2021, this figure was $4.7 million. gaap net loss was $54.7 million and non-gaap net loss was $37.5 million. gaap net loss per share was $0.28, and non-gaap loss per share was $0.19. this compared to a second quarter of 2021 gaap net loss of $79.2 million, non-gaap net loss was $34.4 million.
second quarter 2021 gaap net loss per share was $0.41, and non-gaap net loss per share was $0.18. eps for the third quarter of 2021 is calculated using weighted average shares outstanding of 196.2 million. as of september 30, actual shares outstanding were 195.9 million. we completed the quarter with $324.5 million in cash and short-term investments on our balance sheet.
for the nine months ending september 30, 2021, total revenue was $44.4 million, comprised of $34.3 million in product revenue and $10 million in license and services revenue. this compares to $77.5 million in the nine months ended september 30, 2020, of which $53.9 million was product revenue, including a one-time $11.1 million stocking fee and $23.6 million was license and services revenue. gaap net loss for the nine months ended september 30, 2021, was $174.8 million, and non-gaap net loss was $98 million. this compares to a gaap net loss of $38.4 million for the nine months ended september 30, 2020, and $45 million in non-gaap net loss.
now for our full-year 2021 guidance. we expect to ship over 15,000 units in 2021, a growth of at least 28% as compared to 2020. revenue is expected to range between $60 million and $63 million. as i mentioned earlier in my remarks, we are moving into the first wave of mass commercialization with customers who are now expecting consistency of performance within our various product lines.
this is a natural evolution from the r&d purchases our customers had done with us historically where test samples were acceptable. we are refining our engineering and production processes to meet customer delivery and performance expectations. as a result of this focus on customer satisfaction, approximately $4.3 million of product sales shifted out of the third quarter into the fourth quarter of 2021 and first quarter 2022. our revenue forecast also reflects the removal of any contribution from nonrecurring engineering fees that aren't already signed.
non-gaap gross margins are expected to be between negative 8% to 10%. this reflects volume in weighted asp mix and ongoing delays in moving manufacturing offshore due to covid-19. on a gaap basis, gross margins are expected to include approximately $2.3 million of stock-based compensation expense. on a non-gaap basis, operating expenses are expected to range between $125 million and $129 million.
we expect general and administrative expenses will increase by approximately 55% in 2021 when compared to 2020, primarily due to increased legal expenses and other related public company expenses. on a gaap basis, operating expense will include approximately $89 million of stock-based compensation expense. on a gaap basis, income tax expenses are anticipated to be approximately $800,000. weighted average shares outstanding for the year are estimated to be 193.7 million.
finally, i would like to review our business outlook. at the end of the third quarter of 2021, we estimate we could have the opportunity for approximately $800 million of revenue from signed and awarded projects through 2025, plus a pipeline of projects that are not yet signed and awarded with an opportunity for approximately $4.2 billion. as certain of our customers are progressing with their lidar solution rollouts, we are seeing variability in their rollout schedules. as they get into their projects, some have reduced their initial ramp rates while maintaining their ramp rates in outlying years.
this is reflected in these aggregated business outlook numbers. we anticipate providing updated project pipeline data through 2026 plus 2022 financial guidance in our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. this will allow our new ceo, ted tewksbury, the opportunity to address these metrics. this concludes my formal remarks.
operator, ted, jim, and i are now ready to take questions.
",2021-Q3,VLDR
0.9956,0.9956,,0.9981,":
operator
[operator instructions] and the first question comes from colin rusch with oppenheimer. please go ahead.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
thanks so much. can you break out the mix of hardware sales by application? obviously, the automotive market is coming a little bit slower than folks had expected. so i'm just curious how much of those hardware sales are actually going into testing programs? and how much of it is going in dollar in other industrial applications that are actually growing right now?
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
so we see our sales -- this includes all of our r&d sales and everything else, so it's not just the commercial sales or industry. but we do see our split. it's probably around 30% in the automotive space and the rest is growing across various industrial sales.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
ok. excellent. and then as you ramp up production, can you talk a little bit about yield coming off those automated lines and what you're seeing and how much improvement there might be a lot to go in terms of some of the cost reduction and efficiency of that manufacturing.
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
yes. so paul, we're not going to talk openly about our yield. however, i can say that we're seeing, through jim barnhart leadership as our coo, we're seeing continuous improvements in our yields.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
ok, great. i'll take it offline. thanks so much, guys
operator
the next question comes from raji gill with needham & company. please go ahead.
raji gill -- needham and company -- analyst
yes. thanks for taking my question. i appreciate it. just, drew, on the gross margins, we've started to see some improvement on the product gross margins.
the negative decline is not as great. it's about negative 8%. and the overall gross margins have been helped by a higher mix of licensing and services. so when you kind of look into 2022, how should we think about the asp declines? and then how do we think about kind of the mix of licensing and services.
so the -- we clearly see you guys moving offshore to kind of reduce the cost of manufacturing, reducing the product cost, but how do we think about asp? should we be expecting kind of another decline in asps as you kind of ramp production? so any thoughts there would be really helpful. thank you.
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
so let me -- this is ted. let me just comment on the asp trends that we're seeing. first of all, long term, as i indicated in my prepared remarks, we are committed to driving down our cost structure so that we can reduce our prices and simultaneously pull gross margins up. so that's all happening.
however, in the short term, we have headwinds from the supply streams that i mentioned, in particular semiconductor components, which are in scarce supply. and in some cases, we have to pay higher than normal prices for those components and, virtually, we're able to pass on these costs to our customers in the present environment. so you will see asps starting to drift up due to that second trend. but then going forward toward the end of the year and into 2022, you'll start seeing asps coming down.
anything you want to add to that...
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
yes. so i think similar to what ted has said differently is, right now, we're not in normal times with everything is going on with inflation. it is the first time people have seen this in decades. so our customers are understanding that, and we will see asps come up a bit.
but in a normal situation, i think as we've talked about it in the past, we think of asps coming down kind of on a linear basis over time, i think it's like a four-quarter kind of linear line that you might average out so that you could see it trending down. and that's going to be a function of us bringing to market sensors that have a lower price points like our velarray and others, while we still may maintain higher prices on some of our other sensors. so we'll be giving you the weighted average asps across all the sensors, but we do expect to kind of on a linear basis, over time, we should see that trending down and when things return to normal.
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
and i should add to that the increase in prices that we're seeing as a result of the supply constraints are not causing us to lose design wins because the entire supply chain is in the same environment, including all of our competitors.
raji gill -- needham and company -- analyst
very good. and my follow-up, i appreciate, ted, outlining the strategy, the four pivots. just wondering, in terms of your customer portfolio, you did mention that you're seeing an increased penetration of solid state sensors. wondering how you think about solid state sensor penetration this year, what customers -- and which end markets are adopting the solid state.
and wondering about the nature of some of these multiyear agreements and how you're looking at those multiyear agreements and project pipelines progressing throughout the year?
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
sure. so let me first comment on the solid state sensor question. we are seeing solid state sensors being sold into automotive applications. also, a lot of the robotics and industrial automation applications are using solid state, but they're also using rotational.
so we're seeing both types of sensors being sold in those kinds of applications. in the intelligent infrastructure segment, the ceramic view rotational sensors are very popular -- products are very popular because you can mount it on a telephone pole in an intersection, and you've got immediate real-time 3d view of traffic and road conditions and pedestrians and other road users. so we're seeing both of those. as far as -- but we do expect to see a continuing increase in the solid state sensors.
they do have a benefit, a couple of lower price point, and are very suitable for a lot of those industrial applications. as far as the multiyear agreements are concerned, you will notice that they were conspicuously asking from the press release, as well as from the prepared remarks. the reason for that is that these are very important metrics that we use to measure the business internally, and we will continue to measure both multiyear agreements, as well as the funnel statistics, the number of aggregate customer projects that we have ongoing. the company was very transparent in the past and providing those details in these calls.
however, given the increasingly competitive nature of the industry, we made the decision that we will no longer be reporting those multiyear agreements and active projects in the funnel as we've done in past. we are in the process of defining new metrics that we will be able to share with you that will give you a more accurate leading indicator of future revenue growth, and we'll start doing that next quarter.
raji gill -- needham and company -- analyst
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from sam peterman with craig-hallum. please go ahead.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for taking my question. i want to ask first on sales for next year -- i'm sorry, for next quarter. can you break down how much of that you expect to come from products versus licenses and services?
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
yes. so a vast majority of that's going to come from products. we have kind of a run rate of license to services of around $1 million a quarter, and so that should continue. and then the rest will be coming from products.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. great. that's really helpful. and then kind of bigger picture here.
you mentioned a new architecture that you're transitioning to. can you describe that architecture a little more? and then can you talk about what that means for the vella family of products that you have developing as your next gen products?
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
so i prefer not to give any more detail publicly on the architecture that we're working on, the low-cost architecture. i think the company has aired in the past and being a little bit too open, but not seeing products before they were ready for global volume production. and i think that doesn't serve our customers well, it doesn't serve the company well, it certainly serves our competitors very well. so we don't want to do that anymore.
but just to elaborate a little bit more on the products that we have in the development queue right now, the first would be these new architectures to achieve the performance that our customers require in our target market at a much lower price point. and that's particularly to accelerate adoption in automotive, where, as i mentioned, our customers are demanding prices of several hundred dollars. so that's a pretty good hurdle, and that does require new architecture development. the second kinds of products that we have in the pipeline are next generations of platforms that we already have, where we are addressing new use cases, as well as reducing cost.
and we're doing that, and as i mentioned in the prepared remarks, by leveraging reusable hardware, software configurability and the micro light on the rig, which has really been a workhorse building block that we can proliferate through the entire product lines in order to reduce cost, improve the scalability and get products to market very fast. and then the third new product category, of course, is the software, where we continue to move up the software stack in order to deliver complete solutions to our customers and deliver more value to them, which in turn increases our gross margins and our profitability.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. great. thanks for the detail. that's all for me.
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
thanks, sam.

operator
good day, and welcome to the velodyne lidar fourth quarter and year-end 2021 financial results conference call. [operator instructions]. please also note, this event is being recorded. and i would now like to turn the conference over to andrew chan.
please go ahead.
andrew chan -- investor relations
thank you, operator. good afternoon. this is andrew chan, head of ir for velodyne lidar. thank you for joining us today to discuss velodyne lidar's fourth quarter and year-end 2021 financial results.
on our call, chief executive officer, ted tewksbury, will open with his vision and a review of 2021 accomplishments, then chief financial officer, drew hamer, will review the financial results and outlook. ted will return to summarize and open the call for questions. to ensure that we address as many analyst questions as possible during the call, we request that you please limit one initial question and one follow-up question. before we begin, i would like to remind you that shortly after the market closed today, velodyne issued a press release announcing its fourth quarter 2021 financial results.
velodyne also published an investor presentation. you may access the press release and the presentation in the investor relations section at velodynelidar.com. today's discussion includes forward-looking statements. please refer to our press release and our sec filings, including our most recent 10-k and 10-q for a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
in management's financial remarks, non-gaap metrics will be referenced. management provides non-gaap metrics because it uses them for budget-planning purposes and for making operational and financial decisions and believes that providing these non-gaap financial measures to investors as a supplement to gaap financial measures, help investors evaluate velodyne's core operating and financial performance and business trends consistent with how management evaluates such performance and trends. in addition, management believes these measures facilitate comparisons with the core operating and financial results and business trends of competitors and other companies. a full description and reconciliation of these non-gaap measures versus gaap is included in the company's press release issued today.
now i'd like to turn the call over to our new ceo, ted tewksbury. 
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
thanks, andrew, and thanks to all of you joining us today. i'm very excited to be on my first call as ceo of velodyne lidar. in the several months that i've been at velodyne, i have been meeting with employees, customers, partners and board members. i have been enormously impressed with the deep bench of talent here, the strength of our customer relationships, and the capabilities of our products and technologies.
we have everything we need to achieve our mission of creating smart technology for our world in motion and our vision of science and service and safety. velodyne invented lidar as we know it, creating an entirely new industry. lidar is a critical technology for autonomy, enabling the movements of people and goods safely through the world. it has the potential to transform every industry as we know it, and demand is growing exponentially across a wide range of applications.
velodyne has always been the lidar technology innovation and market leader and is well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. i joined velodyne to build on its strong foundation to create the fastest-growing, most profitable, and financially successful global lidar company. as ceo of 3 public technology companies prior to velodyne, i have a proven track record of scaling new technologies into profitable growth businesses. i'm here to do the same for velodyne.
i'd like to start today with a brief summary of our q4 and full year 2021 financial results and some recent highlights. then, i'll discuss our focus areas for 2022, followed by an overview of product traction we are seeing with customers in our target markets. in the fourth quarter of 2021, we sold a record number of sensors for a quarter, more than 4,900 units. this brings sensors sold to over 15,000 for 2021, of which 2,400 were solid state.
with a strong fourth quarter, we delivered full year 2021 revenue of $62 million. drew will provide a detailed review of our financials in a moment. the first step in any business transformation is to get the right people in the right seats. last year, we announced key new hires, including our chief product officer, sinclair vass, and our chief operating officer, jim barnhart.
last month, we hired dr. anurag gupta as executive vice president of engineering, responsible for both hardware and software. anurag's proven engineering leadership will help us accelerate the introduction of cutting-edge next-generation lidar solutions. last june, we opened our india design center in bangalore, and we are already benefiting from the addition of a large team of brilliant engineers.
in 2021, velodyne put in place a strong foundation for growth. in 2022, our top priority is to accelerate the path to profitability by rationalizing our cost structure and driving lidar deployments at scale across a wide range of industries. our strategy for doing this consists of four pillars. the first pillar is to drive lidar volume in early autonomous markets, such as industrial, robotics, and intelligent infrastructure, paving the way for success in later automotive applications.
we are synchronizing our investments to coincide with two major waves of lidar commercialization. the first wave will be dominated by industrial automation, robotics, and intelligent infrastructure. according to yola, these markets alone are estimated to be $2.8 billion by 2026, and their growth ramp has already started. velodyne has the right products ready to ship in volume to these markets today.
the second wave, autonomous vehicles, or avs and advanced driver assistance systems, or adas, will ramp into production later in the decade. according to yola, by 2026, the automotive market is estimated to be another $2.9 billion, bringing our total available market to $5.7 billion. within automotive, our strategy is to focus initially on trucking, avs, and leading-edge electric vehicles, or evs, which are an excellent fit for our existing products. based on our conversations with many automotive tier 1s and oems, we believe that mainstream adoption of lidar in passenger cars will require smaller form factors and lower prices than are currently available today.
supplying high-performance lidar at scale into the early markets will generate near-term revenue while enabling us to perfect the high-volume, low-cost manufacturing needed to succeed in automotive and other price-sensitive applications. this strategy will enable us to benefit from successive layers of revenue growth, maximizing our return on investment over both the short and the long term. the second pillar is to develop high-performance sensors at a price point to accelerate mass adoption. as i mentioned, this is essential for automotive and adas applications, where sensor prices need to fall well below $500 before most tier ones and oems will deploy lidar at scale.
velodyne already offers the broadest lidar portfolio with the best overall performance-to-price ratio in the industry. this includes both rotational, as well as solid state sensors for a wide variety of applications. going forward, we are pursuing a multipronged approach to reducing product costs even further while simultaneously meeting our customers' most demanding performance requirements. first, we are developing new sensor architectures with fewer components and inherently lower bill of materials costs.
second, we are employing a platform-based design approach, leveraging our proprietary chip-based technology, the micro lidar array, across our entire product portfolio. we will continue to miniaturize, integrate, and modularize common building blocks to improve engineering efficiencies and scalability. third, we are using software configurable hardware to address diverse use cases with speed and agility. these initiatives will enable us to drive prices down while simultaneously pulling gross margins up.
the third pillar is to expand our software to deliver complete autonomous vision solutions to our customers. our customers use our lidar sensors as one component of a system that also includes software and sometimes other sensors. our goal is to provide as much of that solution as possible to increase our value to customers while expanding our revenue and gross margins. in 2021, we strengthened the company's software offerings with the introduction of vella development kit, which we call vdk.
vdk provides customers with the ability to plug in our lidar sensors with vella, an off-the-shelf library of software functions, to fast track their solution development. our vella software translates raw point cloud data into actionable information, delivering high-level perception outputs for roadways, sidewalks and indoor environments, including seen segmentation, object detection, velocity estimation, free space detection and lidar-based odometry. the next generation of vella and vdk will include even more advanced software and machine learning capabilities, including scalable machine learning, enabling our sensors to continuously learn, improve performance and adapt to changing environments and use cases. platform services, enabling customers to develop their own applications with velodyne lidar, using our cloud analytics, diagnostics, calibration, perception, visualization and other apis.
sensor fusion, enabling multiple lidar to be integrated with camera, radar and other sensors for applications like adas that require redundancy. and new vertical market solutions optimized for our target applications, including warehouse robotics, intelligent infrastructure, av, adas and ground truthing. and finally, our fourth pillar is to lead with operational and manufacturing excellence. with over 67,000 sensors shipped to date, velodyne has established itself as a clear leader in shipping lidar at scale.
in 2021, we made excellent progress in transferring our high-volume products offshore. 80% of our velarray line and 100% of our puck product family are now running at contract manufacturers. we expect to complete the transfer of all of our lines offshore later this year while maintaining optionality for buy american-compliant products here in the u.s. in 2022, we continue to increase the automation of our manufacturing processes and put in place the capacity to deliver high volumes and quality levels as required by an industry poised for significant growth.
successful execution of the four pillars will enable velodyne to focus investments on high roi opportunities that deliver greater value to customers while lowering the company's overall cost structure and driving the volume levels needed to build a profitable growth business. now i'd like to provide a deeper dive into the impressive progress we've made with customer adoption of our products in our 3 target markets: industrial and robotics, intelligent infrastructure, and automotive. the industrial and robotics market is closest to large-scale commercial deployments. companies worldwide are automating their supply chains to save money, improve efficiencies and alleviate bottlenecks caused by the pandemic and other macro issues.
in warehouses, our customers are using velodyne lidar enabled robotics to move goods with a high level of precision, efficiency and safety, helping to maintain continuity of operations. currently, e-commerce retailers and side robotics programs are deploying our lidar for fulfillment, delivery and data center operations. for example, one of our customers is gatik, whose middle mile delivery trucks fulfill revenue-generating orders daily for walmart and other fortune 500 companies. in industrial environments, customers have integrated velodyne's lidar sensors to power robotics in the airports and seaports.
also, velodyne is the lidar provider of choice for drones. our sensors enable 3d mapping and digital twin modeling of indoor and outdoor environments, providing an efficient and cost-effective way to map large areas in just hours. the second target market ripe for commercialization is intelligent infrastructure in smart cities. velodyne's intelligent infrastructure solution, or iis, generates real-time data analytics and predictions, helping to improve traffic and crowd flow efficiency, improve sustainability, and protect vulnerable road users.
lidar reliably collects data in any weather or lighting condition, 24/7. iis is cost-effective and easily installed with a single sensor. it can provide coverage for an entire intersection, replacing inductive loop detectors, camera and radar. our award-winning solution is implemented across three continents with north american pilots rolled out in seven states so far.
we expect traction in the intelligent infrastructure market to accelerate with new funding from the recently passed $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill. the third market, automotive, includes both avs and adas. while level two-plus and level three as have been slower than expected to reach full deployment, we remain convinced that the high functional safety levels needed for automotive require lidar as an essential component of the sensor suite. autonomous shuttles, including beep by navya, may mobility, and leading robo taxi innovators such as motional, are integrating velodyne's lidar in their systems to provide the highest levels of performance and safety.
new electric vehicle companies like faraday future are using our solid-state directional sensors to leapfrog traditional ev oems. velodyne will power their autonomous driving systems to help deliver a comprehensive suite of highway, urban and parking autonomy features. trucking accounts for over 72% of the transportation of goods in the u.s. alone.
autonomous trucking programs are rapidly expanding to address capacity, efficiency, safety and environmental concerns. velodyne's lidar and perception software are being deployed in driverless trucks by companies like ford otosan and trunktech. for safety critical applications, our pedestrian automatic emergency braking software solution, also called paeb, has been shown to dramatically improve safety in darkness as compared to current camera plus radar solutions. tragically, 2021 saw a historic increase in road rate fatalities.
data showed that approximately 76% of pedestrian fatalities happen at night or in low light conditions. velodyne's paeb can help prevent these strategies and save lives. velodyne is actively working with the national highway transportation safety administration and other government agencies to update performance standards and require the safety performance that lidar can provide to help protect vulnerable road users. finally, velodyne would not be where we are today without our partners and customers.
our automated with velodyne program now has 100 partner companies, including nvidia and siemens. our partners are working to commercialize next-generation autonomous solutions in the global market, using velodyne's lidar sensors and software. while we are proud of all of these successes, we acknowledge that the company needs to do a much better job of parlaying these opportunities into financial results and shareholder value. we believe that the focus provided by the four-pillar strategy will enable us to do this.
we also recognize that the company's previous guidance has fallen short of actual financial results. as i start my tenure as velodyne's new ceo, it is important to me to build credibility and trust with all of our investors and analysts. with that in mind, it would not be judicious to provide guidance beyond the range of our visibility. as you have seen, velodyne is experiencing robust customer demand for our products across all of our target markets.
these early deployments of velodyne lidar in real customer products are the best leading indicators of revenue growth in the next several years. that said, our ability to supply this demand is severely constrained by shortages of critical semiconductor components needed to build our sensors. given our limited visibility, we will not provide full year guidance as the company has done in the past. instead, we will provide quarterly guidance as we move into 2022.
we look forward to providing longer-term models when our visibility improves. with that, i'll turn it over to drew to provide more detail on our financials.

thanks, ted. hello, everyone. it's my pleasure to speak with you today. as noted at the onset of the call, i will provide non-gaap results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021.
starting with the fourth quarter. total revenue increased to $17.5 million, up from $13.1 million in the third quarter of 2021, reflecting across-the-board improvements. product revenue grew to $13.7 million, up from $11.8 million in the third quarter of 2021. this reflects our third consecutive quarter of increased demand and growth in our unit sales volumes.
during the fourth quarter, we sold more than 4,900 sensors, of which more than 900 were solid state, reflecting a linear increase in demand. the weighted average selling price per sensor increased to $2,738 in the fourth quarter compared to $2,622 in the third quarter, reflecting strong demand for our products. license and services revenue was $3.9 million, up from $1.3 million in the prior quarter, reflecting an annual royalty true-up of approximately $2.4 million due to increased usage. we delivered a gross profit of $3.2 million, improving $7.4 million when compared to a third quarter gross loss of $4.2 million.
this reflects increased sensor licensing revenue, the benefit of higher volumes and improvements in production yields and reserves for potential excess materials. operating expenses were $35.2 million compared to $33.4 million in the third quarter, primarily due to increased investments in our technology. net loss improved to $31.8 million or $0.16 per share compared to $37.5 million or $0.19 per share in the third quarter of 2021. we ended the year with $294.4 million in cash in short-term investments compared to $350.3 million at december 31, 2020.
this reflects $89.3 million from the exercise of our publicly traded warrants, offset by our operating cash usage of $120.7 million. for the year ending december 31, 2021, we are pleased to have grown our unit volumes to over 15,000 lidar sensors, up 35% compared to 2020. we are proactively working to achieve mass adoption pricing levels, and we lowered weighted average selling prices from 4,632 in 2020 to $2,988 in 2021. total revenue was $61.9 million compared to $95.4 million in 2020.
product revenue was $48 million compared to $68.4 million in 2020. the change reflects a onetime $11.1 million stocking fee in 2020 and $16.3 million related to lower asps in 2021 that are partially offset in 2021 by an increase of $7 million in the volume and mix of sensors in parts sold. license and services revenue was $13.9 million in 2021 compared to $27 million in 2020, which reflected a nonrecurring fee for the patent cross license agreements entered into during the second and third quarters of 2020. net loss was $129.8 million compared to $65.1 million for 2020.
turning to guidance. as ted mentioned, going forward, we will provide guidance on a quarterly basis until visibility into market conditions improves. based on currently available information, we expect revenue for the first quarter to be between $10 million and $12 million, driven by shipments of products to the company's global customer base. we expect the number of sensors shipped and weighted average selling prices to fluctuate each quarter based upon customers' needs and product mix.
the revenue guidance excludes an estimate of the noncash contra revenue charges of $5 million to $7.5 million, vesting in the first quarter of 2022. this is expected to result from the issuance to amazon.com nv investment holdings llc of a warrant or the amazon warrant to purchase up to an aggregate of 39,594,032 shares of the company's common stock, subject to adjustment investing in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the amazon warrant. while we believe the warrant has far-reaching value implications to velodyne lidar, the accounting rules fall within u.s. gaap revenue standards since the warrant is directly related to our product sales with amazon.
the number of warrant shares vesting will primarily be proportionate to the discretionary purchases by amazon or its affiliates and recorded as a contra revenue in the periods that discretionary payments occur. the vesting of the warrant shares is based on these discretionary payments made pursuant to existing commercial agreements with velodyne and amazon, any possible future commercial agreements between velodyne and amazon, and the anticipated entry into an agreement between velodyne and amazon related to the use of velodyne's technology. with that, i'll turn the call back to ted.
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
thank you, drew. we have taken decisive action by strengthening our exceptional leadership team, adding outstanding engineering talent and advancing our road map of lidar innovation. as you have seen, we are experiencing strong traction across multiple applications, especially in industrial, robotics, and intelligent infrastructure, and this is the best leading indicator of revenue growth in the next several years. to summarize, we plan to make lidar ubiquitous in a wide range of mainstream applications by focusing on the four pillars.
first, by driving lidar volume in early autonomous markets. second, by developing high-performance sensors at a price point to accelerate mass adoption. third, by expanding our software in order to deliver complete autonomous vision solutions. and fourth, by leading the industry in manufacturing and operational excellence.
by focusing on the four pillars, we plan to expand our value to customers while accelerating the path to profitable revenue growth. lidar is going to make our communities safer, our supply chains more efficient, and our planet greener, and velodyne is leading the way. i thank each of you for joining today's call and look forward to touching base throughout the year as it unfolds. in march, we will be at three events: cowen's virtual mobility disruption summit, berenberg's virtual industrial technologies conference, and roth annual conference in person.
then in april, we will present at bank of america's annual global automotive summit, hosted in conjunction with the new york auto show. operator, i'd now like to open the call for questions.
",2021-Q4,VLDR
1.0,1.0,,1.0,":
operator
yes, thank you. [operator instructions]. and the first question comes from colin rusch with oppenheimer.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
thanks so much guys. within that automotive revenue that you're talking about, could you talk about the diversity of customers? obviously there's a couple that are pretty easy to identify, but if you could talk about the number of folks you're shipping to right now.
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
sure. please, to do that collin. so yes, on the one third of our revenue that came from automotive, most of that came from robo taxis, as they mentioned in the prepared remarks. and i think you're familiar with motional, we're working very closely with them.
also some of that revenue came from gm as well as some other smaller customers in that segment. we with these robo taxi applications, safety is a top priority and many of these applications are less price sensitive than what you would see in more mainstream, adas kinds of applications. so we're getting very good traction with those customers. we expect that revenue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis.
and as i've said before, in terms of time to volume, we still haven't changed our opinion that the early volumes will be coming primarily from industrial and robotics. we expect some of that robo taxi revenue to go to volume in the 2025 timeframe and beyond. but that timing is really dictated more by regulatory and other non-technical issues rather than the performance. we have an act, a very good product market fit with our sensors into those robo taxi, autonomous shuttles and other level four and level five, adas type of programs.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
that's incredibly helpful. thank you. and then with the software ecosystem that you guys are developing, the lack of bandwidth for automotive and commercial vehicles around software has been notable and on multiple fronts. i mean, can you guys talk about, how much leverage you're getting from that effort in terms of building sticky customer relationships and position yourself for high volume sales as these, some of these programs start [inaudible]?
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
the software is adding an incredible amount of value to the total system solution. if you look at what our customers are doing, they're developing autonomous systems, which might be robots. they might be autonomous vehicles, or they could be intelligent traffic systems, but regardless, all of those systems are observing the environment and they need to be able to understand the environment and then be able to make real time decisions autonomously in order to take action or to provide analytics. and that's where our software comes in.
so our vision, our long-term vision for the company is to be the leading provider of ai powered autonomous vision systems. and those include lidar as an essential component, but it also includes an enormous amount of software, as well as aiml and in many cases, other types of sensors. and so if you look at our software stack, it consists of three levels. we have the core level that interfaces with those sensors and does the sensor fusion provides the user interface reads the point cloud data does analytics and diagnostics.
and then the second layer is the perception layer that provides the object detection, identification, tracking, time to collision measurements, and those kinds of things. basically translates the raw point cloud data into actionable information that can make those autonomous decisions. and then sitting on top of that, we have what we call that the vella portal layer, which consists of a variety of tools and apis that users can download and use to develop their own custom autonomous systems. so that entire stack is providing tremendous value to customers.
and probably the best example of that is our intelligent infrastructure solution, which we've talked about at length in previous forms.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from tristan gerra with baird.
unknown speaker
hi, this is tyler on for tristan. thanks for taking the questions. could you talk about the impact you're seeing, if any of the china lockdowns either directly to you or to your customers?
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
we're not seeing any immediate impact from the china lockdown. our footprint in china is not as large as i would like it to be. we've actually got a plan right now to pull together a plan to expand our presence in china, expand our customer profile in china. but right now it doesn't have a lot of impact on us.
most of our customers are in the eu or in the north american continent.
unknown speaker
great. for my follow up, are there specific end markets, you were accelerating your focus on such as solid state lidar for automotive, or does your approach continue to be focused on high end rotational lidars that are end market agnostic?
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
so our market focus is really focused predominantly on industrial and robotics. and the reason for that is quite simple. our top priority as a company right now is to become profitable as soon as possible. and to do that, we need to intersect high volume markets at the right time with products that have the right product market fit.
and so i've talked about our strategy for doing that, which we call our four pillars strategy, but in terms of time to volume, we see the markets rolling out in three waves. so the first wave, which is occurring right now is industrial and robotics, and that's really being driven by automation of the supply chain. second, we expect to see intelligent infrastructure rolling out. and we talked about that in the press release as well as in the prepared remarks.
and then automotive will come sometime later. in industrial and robotics, we're getting tremendous traction, especially with our solid state sensors. but also with the rotational, i talked about intelligent infrastructure there. there's actually a very strong demand for our rotational sensors that intersections why, because they can see 360 degrees real time round the clock in any weather condition.
and it's really an ideal fit for those kinds of markets. so, we're seeing, i would say a trend toward increasing solid state sensors because of the lower cost, but we're also seeing continuing demand for rotational's in many of these kinds of applications. if think about an autonomous vehicle driving through an urban street or a suburban street where they need to see the environment 360 degrees around the vehicle rotationals are a perfect fit for that. and in many of the avs and the robo taxi kinds of applications, the form factor and the size of the lidar are less important than they would be say on a passenger vehicle on a highway.
so that's why, i talked about the one third of the revenue that we're getting from automotive. most of that is coming from the robo taxis, precisely that reason they provide the 360 degree of view very high resolution, very long range. and it's a very good fit for us. so, we're not, favoring either rotational or solid state there's applications for both of those, but in terms of market segments in terms of timing we see the first volume production first commercialization happening in industrial and robotics followed by an intelligent infrastructure, followed by the automotive applications.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from sam peterman with craig-hallum capital group.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for taking my question. i wanted to ask on asps, it sounds like they were up quite a bit quarter over quarter just because of the supply environment with, i guess how large that, that hike was quarter over quarter, curious how much visibility you have into units growing to -- units growing quarter over quarter to drive the sales growth that you're seeing in your guidance.
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
so we're still not giving guidance more than a quarter out. we have very limited visibility. most of the lack of visibility is not due to the fact that we don't see demand. we see plenty of demand across all of our end markets for our products.
but we are extremely challenged on the supply side as i talked about. so it really comes down to our ability to supply. i think you know, in q2 we're confident that we can hit the guided range, because we do have backlog and we do have supply to meet that demand. but as we get into q3 and beyond things become pretty cloudy.
and then of course you've also got all the macroeconomic challenges of interest rates, inflation ukraine and other geopolitical uncertainties layered on top of that. so as a result, we are still not providing guidance beyond q2.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
got it. ok. that's helpful. second question, i wanted to ask on solid state sales looks like those were down pretty substantially year on year.
i guess our shortages that you're seeing in the supply chain weighted more toward solid state rather than rotational at all, or is the decline kind of more so driven by demand in the solid state?
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
it's an interesting question. i wouldn't read too much into the fact that solid state was down for the quarter. we see fluctuations quarter to quarter depending on demand and depending on customers builds. we did happen to see a very strong demand for rotationals in q1, which was limited our ability to supply that was limited by the availability of components as they indicated we actually can supply the m1600 solid state.
so that one is not supply constrained. and there is plenty of demand that we see for the remainder of the year. it just so happens that in q1 our customers were not building as much product.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from mark delaney with goldman sachs.
unknown speaker
hi, this is bruno on for mark. thank you for taking the questions. the company previously talked about an 800 million of signed an awarded revenue through 2025. i realize the company's not long -- no longer updating that metric, but do you have any recent commercial wins you can speak to or an update on the number of projects?
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
so that, it's a great question, mark. we talked about two multiyear agreements or wins today. one was qinetiq and one was russelsheim am main, germany for the iis. we are currently not reporting on the design win metrics.
we are looking for a new metric that will provide a leading indicator to future revenue growth. the previous design are actually was a multiyear agreement metric that we had was problematic for several reasons. number one in a highly competitive environment, such as we're in, i want -- i need to balance keeping investors informed with disclosing confidential information that could help our competitors that's really the first and foremost reason. but secondly, not all of the projects, the active projects that we have in our funnel will go to production.
and so i need to give you a second piece of information for you to make sense out of those multi-year agreement numbers. and that is the conversion rate. what is the probability of those design wins or those multi-year agreements going to production? and that conversion rate can only come out of an analysis of historical data, which we don't yet have. and so that, that's the second piece.
and then third, the multi-year agreement metric while appropriate for automotive is not necessarily the best metric to use for customers in the industrial and robotics segment, who many of whom don't want sign a three year multi-year agreement. so for them, we're looking at other metrics, whether it's design wins or some metric that takes into account lois or sows that would be more appropriate. so we're working on finding a new metric that will give you the information you're looking for without showing our customers where the gold is buried. and so i'm going to hold off until we have our new cfo on board before we disclose that, but we are working on that.
unknown speaker
ok, great. yes, that would be very helpful. and just shorter term. how should we think about cash use in 2q? and do you have any thoughts on potential plans to strengthen the balance sheet?
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
so historically our burn rate has been between 30 and $40 million. we've been holding opex flat ever since i arrived. it was $35 million, little bit over $35 million in q4 when i came on board we've held that flat. it was actually a little bit down in q1, but we're very carefully monitoring our cash usage and managing costs to ensure that we have no issues with cash.
we've got a very strong balance sheet, as you saw. we had a very strong quarter we're executing very well to our plan. and even if we burn $40 million a quarter, we still got six quarters to seven quarters worth of cash runway. we're currently completing our five-year plan and we're rationally rationalizing our product roadmap.
and like any well managed company, we're always evaluating our capital allocation and looking at all our options which includes opportunities for m&a as well as future financing. but we don't have any plans at this time. and anything we do will not happen until after our new cfo comes on board.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes to aileen smith with bank of america.
aileen smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good afternoon, everyone. so i wanted to follow-up on the question around the price increases, and specifically, is that solely a function of what is going on from a supply chain perspective, meaning you're just passing on your higher input costs to your customers, or is that indicative of some strategic move to establishing pricing power? and more specifically, can you talk about the customer receptivity to this effort? you've been on a bit of a product journey over the past few years working to lower asps for your sensors. so how does that conversation go with your customers as you try to raise them?
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
yes. great, great question. and it's complex because we are increasing pricing power as a result of software and system solutions, as i talked about earlier, but also it is a key element of our strategy to bring down the price of lidar price and cost is the number one challenge that the lidar industry has today relative to other sensor modalities like radar or camera. so in order to drive the mass adoption of lidar in applications like adas and other price sensitive use cases, the prices have to come down.
and that's why, that second pillar of our strategy is to develop a very aggressively priced new architecture that we can sell for $200 or $300. so that is the long term secular trend to bring down the pricing. however, that will not start to happen until we have those, those new products introduced which will take, anywhere from 18 months to two years. in the meantime, we've got this very challenging supply constrained environment, which is driving costs up across the industry and our price increases that we're talking about today, which was essentially a doubling of asp from q4 to q1 is being driven by those component shortages.
now, fortunately, the entire industry is seeing the same kinds of supply constraints. and so, all ships are rising with the tide and we're able to pass on those cost increases to customers, without a great deal of pushback. i mean, we are, our suppliers are putting us on allocation and we're essentially putting our customers on allocation, but as the tide starts to come down hope which it hopefully will in 2023. and these components become more readily available then i expect to see our competition start to lower our prices, their prices, and we will have to respond in kind.
aileen smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. got it. and then i wanted to follow up on a comment and a press release on what you define as comprehensive organizational transformation. what is encompassed in that? is it just a pivoting of the business model to focus on capturing the early lidar markets first? or are there some more aggressive efforts internally around restructuring that we should be aware of? and where are those initiatives focused? i know you've had kind of quite the executive turnover in the past year or two.
so just trying to get a sense of whether there's a broader reorg going on.
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
so there was a broader reorg that went on and, and it was a very important one. when i joined this company, it had a very strong engineering base and in a very strong cto organization, but several things were lacking most important of which was a strong customer focused product management front end that could go out and understand customer systems, understand their the problems they were trying to solve, and then bring our technologies to bear on solving those problems and partly that information into market requirement, documents, product requirement documents, new product definitions, business plans, and so forth. so we put that organization together under the company's first chief product officer. so that, that was a major organizational change.
and then in addition we combined and consolidated our software and hardware groups under one umbrella which is now being led by our new executive vice president of engineering. and it has a systems focus versus just a sensor focus. and so that was also a major change in the way we operated. in addition to organizational changes, we've put in place very rigorous and disciplined processes, everything from the way we select products and staff products to, the way we manage products through engineering.
we have a robust product life cycle management system. i can't claim credit for that. that was started before i came on board. but we've tightened it up.
we are running engineering in a very disciplined way. we have robust processes for design, for manufacturability, test yield cost and so all of these are keeping the trains running on time, and that that's really what enabled us to achieve the exceptional execution in q1, despite very strong supply headwinds. we've got a very disciplined operations group now under jim barnhart, our coo. and so the company just looks very different than it did a year ago or even six months ago, when i joined, and it's we have a much more discipline way of planning, managing products and making sure that we deliver on what we say we're going to do, which is exactly what we did in q1.
operator
thank you. and the next question customer is rajvindra gill with needham & company.
raji gill -- needham and company -- analyst
yes. thanks for taking my questions, and nice working with you, drew, best luck and welcome mark. just a follow up question on the pricing situation, when the pricing environment begins to normalize over time. how are we looking at the cost side with respect to off-shoring in operational improvements? i know you had mentioned in the past, roughly 80% of the velarray and 20% of the alpha puck are being built in thailand, wanting to get a sense of kind of what's the progress, the roadmap of additional offshore production across the product lines, while we kind of wait for the pricing to normalize, because the biggest, as you said, the biggest impediment to lidar adoption overtime is going to be pricing.
and in order to get for the pricing to be below 500, the cost has to come down. so that's crucially important.
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
yes. you're absolutely right. so this is a key element of our strategy, which we call the fourth pillar here. and right now, we have already transferred as you said, 80% of our sensors to thailand, which is a very low-cost manufacturing site.
we will have that transfer a 100% completed by the end of the year. that's going to enable us to improve our manufacturing efficiencies, but that in a loan -- that alone is not going to get us all the way to the low cost that we need to be able to sell a lidar sensor for $200 or $300 in order to do that, we also need to do some design level innovation. and so i talked about the new architectures that we're developing, which will be simpler, fewer components, lower cost components that will allow us to dramatically reduce our cost. the other thing that we're doing, which we're already doing actually through our micro lidar array and architectures is developing very building block style platform based design methodologies, whereby we can reuse a given building block in multiple sensors making it easy to design, making it more agile, making it easier for us to get products to market on time, and also facilitating the assembly of these products for workers in thailand, because we have these very building block style assembly processes.
so those are some of the things that we're doing to reduce costs.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
and then long-term to design in.
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
yes.
raji gill -- needham and company -- analyst
i appreciate. and just for my follow up. two-thirds kind of industrial robotics, one-third automotive that seems to be the really, big tam and most immediate tam for you guys. despite kind of the asps that are kind of moving up, which could be transitory, any kind of specific details in terms of what segments within that area are you seeing a lot of hyper adoption? is it more on the robotic side? is it more intelligent infrastructures? any thoughts there would be helpful? thank you.
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
sure. so again, in terms of time to volume, we see it rolling out industrial and robotics first followed by intelligent infrastructure followed by automotive. and the reason intelligent infrastructure, is number two, rather than automotive, is simply because the design cycles are very short in that segment. the design cycle in intelligent infrastructure can be five months or six months, whereas an automotive it's upwards of two years.
it takes a long time to get a product designed into an oem or a tier 1. so our strategy is to number one, sell our existing products into existing industrial and robotics markets. that's where we have the best product market fit. and that's where we have the quickest path to revenue.
those markets are highly diversified. so we don't talk a lot about specific customers. it's a lot of fragmented customers that add up to a $2.8 billion market by 2026. in automotive, while we see the volumes farther out, as i just mentioned, we're investing today in developing the right product with a $300 asp to intersect that market when it starts to ramp.
now in automotive, there are really two segments that are important. there's the level four and level five autonomous vehicles. and that's where we're getting excellent traction with companies like motional and various others. those customers value safety above all else.
and since they are businesses, they have the business model to be able to pay higher prices for lidar. so we're getting very good traction with those customers, however, as they mentioned, the time the volume is still fairly far out because of regulatory and other non-technical issues. and then in adas, what we've learned through engagements with many oems and tier 1s is that the prices do need to come down to $300, $400. and the reason for that is that lidar while we believe it is an essential technology in the sensor suite for adas, because of the safety requirements.
it is not mandatory today. and that means that the only way the oems will adopt adas is if they can sell more vehicles by adopting it. and so it can't increase the msrp of the vehicle. and that's what's driving the need for the price to be $300 or $400.
now, the other thing we can do to help make lidar mandatory for adas is to work with government agencies, which is exactly what we're doing to help persuade them to put in place regulations and laws that will require lidar as part of the adas sensor suite. so, we're working with government agencies like the national highway and transportation safety administration, and working with congressional leaders in order to get mandates in place that require lidar as part of the adas sensor suite. and also to test adas systems in low light conditions and dark conditions where lidar really shines, no pun intended, but that's where cameras and radar fail and lidar will really have a strong advantage. so those are some of the things that we're doing in automotive, but we still feel that the time to volume is, is going to be farther out than the robotics and industrial and the intelligent infrastructure.
operator
very good. thank you. and this does conclude the question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the floor to management for any closing comments.

hello, and welcome to the velodyne lidar first quarter 2022 financial results call. [operator instructions]. please also note, this event is being recorded. and i would now like to turn the conference over to andrew chan.
mr. chan, please go ahead.
andrew chan -- head of investor relations
good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. this is andrew chan, head of ir for velodyne lidar. with me on the call today, are ted tewksbury, velodyne's ceo; and drew hamer, velodyne's cfo. on this call we will discuss velodyne's first quarter fiscal year 2022 financial results.
ted will open with the review of the strategy and q1 accomplishments and drew will review the financial results and outlook. ted will return to summarize and open the call for questions. to ensure that we address as many analyst questions as possible during the call, we request that you please limit to one initial question and one follow-up question. before we begin, i would like to remind you that shortly after the market closed today, velodyne issued a press release announcing its first quarter 2022 financial results.
velodyne also published an investor presentation. you may access the press release and the presentation in the investor relations section at velodynelidar.com. today's discussion includes forward-looking statements. please refer to our press release and our sec filings, including our most recent 10-k and 10-q for a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
in management's financial remarks, non-gaap metrics will be referenced. management provides non-gaap metrics because it uses them for budget-planning purposes and for making operational and financial decisions and believes that providing these non-gaap financial measures to investors as a supplement to gaap financial measures, help investors evaluate velodyne's core operating and financial performance and business trends consistent with how management evaluates such performance and trends. in addition, management believes these measures facilitate comparisons with the core operating and financial results and business trends of competitors and other companies. a full description and reconciliation of these non-gaap measures versus gaap is included in the company's press release issued today.
now, i'd like to turn the call over to our new ceo, ted tewksbury. 
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
thanks, andrew, and thank you all for joining us today. we'd like to welcome any new investors on the call and remind you that velodyne lidar creates smart technology for a world in motion. lidar is making our communities safer, our supply chains more efficient, and our planet greener. with over 69,000 lidar sensors shipped to date.
velodyne is leading the way. our first quarter of 2022 was one of solid execution in the face of significant supply chain headwinds. billings of $11.5 million was at the top end of expectations. revenue, which for the first time this quarter includes the non-cash counting treatment of amazon warrants came in at the high end of our guidance range.
this reflected our ability to secure scarce components and partially offset the cost impact of shortages via pricing. demand for our products remain strong. however, we expect component shortages to continue to challenge our ability to fulfill this demand for several quarters. even with these near-term headwinds, we expect sequential revenue growth in the second quarter of 2022.
drew will review our financial results as well as the warrant accounting in greater detail in a moment. i'd like to begin by reviewing some highlights from the first quarter of 2022. we continued to see robust customer engagements across all three of our target markets, industrial and robotics, intelligent infrastructure, and automotive. approximately two-thirds of our lidar sensors sold during the quarter were for industrial and robotics applications.
and about one-third were for automotive uses. progress in industrial and robotics continued to be driven by automation of the supply chain across diverse applications, including warehouse, logistics, and port automation. demand and automotive was dominated by sales of our high performance rotational sensors for robo taxis. in intelligent infrastructure, our solutions are being deployed in an increasing number of pilot programs for smart cities.
our intelligent infrastructure solution or iis was selected by russelsheim am main, germany to create a citywide system for truck passage control. and we are very excited that our iis won the sxsw 2022 innovation award in the smart cities, transportation & delivery category. we are also seeing growing interest in our sensors for military applications, a largely untapped market, which requires the high performance that velodyne provides. in q1, we announced a five-year sales agreement with qinetiq, a leading defense and security company to provide perception and mapping capabilities for their unmanned ground vehicle portfolio.
and our automated with velodyne program surpassed the 100 partners milestone, including global brands like nvidia and siemens. earlier this year, i laid out our four strategic pillars to accelerate our path to profitable revenue growth. first, by selling existing products into early autonomous markets, including industrial, robotics, and intelligent infrastructure. second, by developing an ultra-low cost sensor platform to drive mass adoption in automotive and other price sensitive markets.
third, by expanding our software to enable complete ai powered vision solutions, and fourth, by leading the industry and high volume manufacturing at the lowest cost and highest quality. in q1, we made significant progress in transforming velodyne's organization, processes, and culture to ensure the successful execution of this strategy. we built a customer-centric product management group under the oversight of velodyne's first chief product officer, sinclair vass. this group has been working closely with our customers to understand their system requirements and pain points in order to define the right products with the right features, specifications, and costs.
we established a solutions oriented engineering organization under dr. anurag gupta, velodyne's first executive vice president of engineering to facilitate the agile development of autonomous vision solutions, encompassing both hardware and software. for the first time, velodyne has an end-to-end product development engine to consistently define, develop and deliver innovative solutions to our customers while maximizing our return on investment. as a result commencing in 2023, we expect to increase new product throughput to at least two new sensors and four software releases per year.
we also plan to introduce at least one full stack system solution every year. looking to full year 2022, we are experiencing strong customer demand for our puck and ultra puck rotational sensors in the industrial, robotics and, infrastructure markets. as we shared last quarter, our ability to supply this demand has been constrained by shortages of critical semiconductor components, particularly field programmable gate arrays or fpgas. our operations and engineering teams are working hand in hand to allow us to satisfy as much of this demand as possible during this challenging period.
we have been able to procure small quantities of the scarce components, albeit at elevated cost, which we have been able to partially recover through price increases. additionally, we have been able to secure limited quantities of similar components as substitutes. this requires some redesign and requalification of our hardware and firmware, which we expect to be completed in the third quarter. and finally, we are developing an improved next generation puck family using a readily available lower cost fpga.
this is expected to provide a sustainable solution in early 2023. in addition to pucks, our solid state velarray m1600 sensor is experiencing strong demand from customers in the industrial and robotics markets. this sensor is currently not constrained by component shortages, and we recently launched a major marketing campaign to help drive additional sales. looking to 2023 and beyond we expect improved revenue growth.
as we introduce new sensors, software and services. we anticipate these introductions will include our next generation velabit and velarray solid state sensors in 2023, followed in 2024 by our low-cost software-configurable sensor platform. we are designing these sensors to sell for just a few $100 a price point that we believe will drive mass adoption in advanced driver assistance systems and other price sensitive high volume markets. turning now to price and gross margin trends.
in 2022, we expect asps to directionally track the prices of key underlying components. many of which are supply constraint. in 2023, we anticipate sensor asps to revert to a more normal pattern as supply chain constraints abate and new lower price sensors start to contribute to the mix. we believe that gross margins will improve as these new products, which are designed for low cost and ease of manufacturing are introduced.
our gross margin improvement plan includes several initiatives, launching higher value system solutions and software to increase our pricing power, developing new sensor architectures to dramatically reduce bill of materials and assembly costs. and increasing volumes, yields and manufacturing efficiencies to drive down the cost of goods sold. while we still have significant work ahead, we are confident that we're on the right track to deliver turnkey, intelligent vision solutions to our customers, which we believe will accelerate revenue growth and profitability. with that, i'll turn it over to drew to review our first quarter financial results.
drew hamer -- chief financial officer
thank you, ted. hello, everyone. it's my pleasure to speak with you today. here is a review of our financial results for q1 2022 and guidance for q2 2022.
the first quarter of 2022 marked the commencement of accounting for the warrants associated with the amazon agreement that was announced on february 4, 2022. the primary impact of this accounting is that the reported revenues will diverge from cash flow, which is not impacted by the required revenue accounting. as a result, velodyne is expanding the financial information; it will report to provide more perspective on the company's underlying business performance by including a billings metric. billings represents the dollar value of products and services provided during the current period and invoiced to the customer.
for the first quarter of 2022, we are pleased to report total billings of $11.5 million at the top of our expectations. revenue, including the impact of the warranty accounting that i just discussed was $6.2 million and it was also at the top end of our guidance. this was the result of the exceptional work by our operations team to proactively procure components that enabled us to build sensors for our customers. providing more details, product revenue before it was offset by $5.3 million of contra revenue associated with the warrants was $9.7 million, compared to $13.7 million in q4 2021.
the decrease in product revenue is attributable to supply chain constraints that ted discussed previously, partially offset by asp changes implemented to help recover portion of our increased costs. during q1, we sold more than 2,350 sensors of which more than 240 were solid state. as a result of the asp changes discussed earlier, the weighted average selling price per sensor increased to $4,045 in the first quarter, compared to $2,738 in the fourth quarter, largely the result of product mixed sold and asp changes discussed above. we also guided for non-cash contra revenue related to the vesting of the amazon warrants to range between five and $7.5 million.
we recorded a charge of $5.3 million. license and services revenues was $1.8 million in q1, 2022. this compares to $3.9 million in q4 2021, which included an annual royalty true-up of approximately $2.4 million. as a result of these factors, non-gaap gross loss was $8.8 million in q1 2022, compared to non-gaap growth profit of $3.2 million in q4 2021.
non-gaap operating expenses were $35 million in q1 2022, almost flat compared to $35.2 million in q4 2021. both periods reflect our strategy to invest in our technology and future growth. our non-gaap net loss, including the $5.3 million contra revenue was $44 million or $0.22 per share in q1 2022, compared to $31.8 million or $0.16 per share in q4 2021. we end the quarter with $256.4 million in cash and short term investments, compared to $294.4 million at december 31, 2021.
turning to guidance, based on currently available information in reflecting measures taken, customer demand, and expected sensor shipments. we expect billings of 12 to $14 million product license and services revenue of 12 to $14 million, and non-cash contra revenue of 2.5 to $2 million related to the amazon warrants resulting in total revenues of 9.5 to $12 million. we continue to expect the number of sensor shifts and weighted average selling prices to fluctuate each quarter, based upon customers needs, market conditions and product mix. with that, i'll turn the call back to ted.
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
thank you, drew. in closing, i would like to express my appreciation to the entire velodyne team for helping us achieve the high end of our guided range. although we are still in the early stages of customer engagements, our system solutions approach integrating software and hardware is proving to be a major competitive advantage across all markets. we now have the organizational infrastructure and product development engine to successfully scale the company and provide our customers with full stack intelligent vision solutions to accelerate their development of autonomous systems.
our team looks forward to seeing investors in-person and virtually in may and june at conferences held by oppenheimer, needham, baird, and deutsche bank. finally, before i open the call to questions, as you have likely seen in the press release issued earlier today, drew will be transitioning the cfo position to mark weinswig. mark is a seasoned public company, cfo with more than 25 years of strategic and operational experience in technology companies, as well as extensive experience scaling new businesses. we are excited to have him join us for our next phase of growth.
i would like to thank drew for his service to velodyne. he helped set up the company for success by ensuring an ongoing strong financial position. operator, we will now open the call to questions.

operator
we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] the first question comes from raji gill with needham and company. please go ahead.
raji gill -- needham and company -- analyst
yeah. thank you for taking my questions. i appreciate it. i just wanted to get a little more clarity on the supply chain issues.
last quarter, the supply chain issues were pushing your sensor asps higher, and the units were lower because of higher component costs and that increased your pricing power. wondering how you're thinking about pricing trends for the remainder of 2022 because of those underlying components, the increasing cost of those components? and how do we expect those costs to trend into 2023?
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks for the question, raji. first of all, maybe i can just provide a little bit of background on the supply chain because there's really two separate components here. the first being the company's specific component with respect to our specific fpgas.
as you're aware, some of those were nearing end of life and we had to replace them and went through a design retrofit procedure to do that. that is on track and is scheduled to be complete by the end of this year. the second component is really the macro supply constraint issues that everybody is seeing across the industry. and we don't have a great deal of visibility into when those will subside, but a lot of our suppliers are saying that the macro supply constraints could last into 2023.
so, what's happening here is that we are in the process of doing those redesigns. we expect those to be completed by the end of this year. and once that's done, we expect to get into the more normal macroeconomic determine pricing environment. in the meantime, as we scramble to procure scarce components, we do expect that asps could continue to go up in order to offset the increased price of components.
but again, once we get into 2023 and we have those new designs, we expect that they will start to come back down.
raji gill -- needham and company -- analyst
appreciate it. for my follow-up, ted, you mentioned when you joined the company that priority no. 1 was to ramp lidar adoption in the industrial robotics market, while at the same time lower the cost for lidar for the passenger vehicles, i believe you'd mentioned kind of below $30. so, it seems like you're making a lot of progress on lidar adoption in kind of industrial robotics.
i'm curious, where are we with passenger vehicles? i know that's about a third or so of the volume. but have you got the asps, or do you have line of sight where you think the asps could go based on your kind of current cost structure? and just maybe touch a little bit upon what you're seeing on the industrial side as well? thank you.
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
yeah. we're getting really good traction in the industrial and robotics and intelligent infrastructure markets with the product portfolio that we have today. and we're really seeding that market across an enormously broad range of applications, some of which i discussed in the prepared remarks. so, as those designs start to go to production, we expect to see an inflection point where revenue will start to grow in the next one or two years in industrial robotics and infrastructure.
as far as automotive is concerned, as you know, there are two segments there. there's the autonomous vehicles where there's a very good product market fit with the products that we already have. and as you saw, 50% of our revenue in the second quarter came from the av segment, specifically robo taxis and autonomous shuttles. those are primarily prototype designs and are still some years away from full production.
but when they happen, velodyne will be there. with respect to passenger vehicles, as we've talked about in past calls, our discussions with oems and tier 1s in the automotive industry and we've talked to all of them. the feedback has been loud and clear that prices have to come down below $500, preferably in the $300 to $400 range. and we have designs in progress right now that we expect to be ready for production when those markets materialize, which is probably still two or three years away.
raji gill -- needham and company -- analyst
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] the next question comes from colin rusch with oppenheimer. please go ahead.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
thanks so much, guys. you know, within the industrials market, can you talk about the diversity of applications that you're in right now and how that's changing, including how many are going on indoor versus outdoor applications? thanks.
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
thanks, colin, for the question. there's really an enormous number of applications. as far as outdoor applications, we're seeing outdoor space monitoring, in parking lots and stadiums, community spaces. our iis solution, for example, is a great solution to monitor the safety of public spaces, as well as intersections and traffic systems to monitor traffic, make traffic flows more efficient, and also reduce congestion, greenhouse gases, and all that good stuff.
in addition, we see sidewalk delivery applications, truck docks, the applications are immense and it seems that they're growing every day. we continue to see mapping applications. we talked about defense at the last earnings call with the design win at kinetic. we see applications in agriculture, in mining, sending lidar into hazardous locations where people don't want to go.
so, that's just a quick few examples for outdoor applications. and then indoors, warehouses are the big ones. and then many others as well, including data centers, fulfillment centers, procurement centers the -- there's just an enormous range of applications in industrial and robotics.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
ok, great. thanks. and then on the cost side, at the manufacturing level, can you walk us through the key elements and cadence for implementation on the pieces that are going to get you to positive gross margins?
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
yeah. so, it's really a three-point plan as far as gross margins are concerned. the first component being to increase our asps through full system solutions, as we've talked about before, that provide the hardware sensor together with the software and the ml capabilities and analytics to help business obtain insights. so, we're not just giving a business, a point cloud, we're allowing them to actually derive business insights and analytics from our products.
so, that's number one. that's going to enable us to increase our asps and also eventually derive the recurring source of revenue through saas revenue. the second component is to reduce our bom costs through architectural innovation. we already talked about that with regard to the adas products we have in development.
and then third is manufacturing efficiencies to drive down product costs. and specifically, we're accelerating the transition to thailand to increase our operational efficiencies. and then in parallel with that, as mark talked about in the prepared remarks, we're realigning our cost structures with revenue, bringing down opex, and identifying a lot of opportunities for cost efficiency across the organization.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
that's super helpful. thanks, guys.
operator
the next question comes from sam peterman with craig-hallum capital group. please go ahead.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for taking my question. i wanted to ask on the product you exit. i think you said you exited the h800 with velarray.
i think you had a couple of other products based on that solid-state architecture, including the vella dev. so, curious, if you could give some more color around why the velarray was exited and then what that means for your other products that are based on that architecture, that would be great.
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
yeah. great question, sam. so, as i mentioned earlier, we're rationalizing our products and development and really investing our limited engineering resources on those products that have the greatest chance of success and that meet our requirements for profitability. the h800 was really one of our first solid-state sensors and we used it to test the market.
and we learned a great deal about what customers really want and need. and while h800 offered outstanding performance and power efficiency. we heard loud and clear from customers that they need much lower pricing. and we don't see anybody else out there.
we don't see any of our competitors who are able to hit the kind of price points that i alluded to earlier. and so, low cost really became one of the main pillars of our strategy. and as i talked about, we now have a really exciting next-generation product road map. and it makes more sense for us to invest our engineering resources on bringing those new products to market rather than looking backwards and trying to improve existing products.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
gotcha. that makes sense. thanks for the detail there. second question, just thinking about the guidance going forward, i'm assuming you're down a little bit quarter over quarter, and i'm assuming that's primarily on the product side rather than the licensing side.
is that correct? and can you talk about which end markets kind of you're seeing relative to strengthen versus relative weakness or any color there?
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
yeah. again, the strength is coming from industrial and robotics, as well as the intelligent infrastructure with continuing contributions from avs. and yeah, let me just emphasize that we're going into q3 with enormous demand and enormous backlog. and the only thing that's holding revenue growth back right now is supply.
and as i explained earlier, we are well underway in redesigning our pucks to use new fpgas, which we expect to get us out of this company-specific supply constrained by the end of the year.
operator
was there a follow-up, mr. peterman?
sam peterman -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
sorry, that's it for me. thank you.
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
ok. so, maybe i could just wrap up by bringing everybody back to the big picture and the main takeaways. we have got a great new strategy that we all feel good about. we've upgraded the management team with top talent.
we have a whole new board of directors with the right skills and experience to help take the company to the next level. the founders are off the board and out of the stock, eliminating an overhang of uncertainty for investors. we met our guidance, and we grew revenue sequentially in the second quarter. we're getting great customer traction in industrial, robotics, and intelligent infrastructure.
we have strong demand in backlog going into q3. we have some supply constraints, but our efforts to redesign our products are on track. we have a new game-changing product road map of high-performance, low-cost sensors, and solutions. and we have a detailed plan to increase gross margins to realign our cost structure with our revenue to accelerate the path to profitability.
and we have a $230 million cash balance in the bank to accomplish all these things. so, with that, i want to thank everybody for joining us today. we look forward to speaking to you in the weeks to come. have a good afternoon.

operator
good day, everyone, and welcome to the velodyne lidar second quarter 2022 financial results call. all participants will be in listen-only mode. please also note today's event is being recorded for replay purposes. [operator instructions] at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to mr.
jim fanucchi of darrow associates. sir, please go ahead.
jim fanucchi -- investor relations
thank you, operator. good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. with me today on the call today, are dr. ted tewksbury, velodyne's chief executive officer; and mark weinswig, chief financial officer.
on today's call, we will discuss velodyne's second-quarter financial results and provide an outlook for the third quarter. shortly after the market closed today, velodyne issued a press release announcing its second quarter 2022 financial results. velodyne also published an investor presentation, and you may access these documents in the investor relations section of velodynelidar.com. today's discussion includes forward-looking statements.
please refer to our press release and our sec filings, including our most recent 10-k and 10-q for a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. please also note, unless otherwise stated, all results and projections discussed in this call are non-gaap. management provides non-gaap metrics because it uses them for budget-planning purposes and for making operational and financial decisions and believes that providing these non-gaap financial measures to investors as a supplement to gaap financial measures, help investors evaluate velodyne's core operating and financial performance and business trends consistent with how management evaluates such performance and trends. in addition, management believes these measures facilitate comparisons with the core operating and financial results and business trends of competitors and other companies.
a full description and reconciliation of these non-gaap measures versus gaap is included in the company's press release issued today. now, i'd like to turn the call over to dr. ted tewksbury. 
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
thanks, jim, and thank you all for joining us today. our second quarter of 2022 was one of solid execution in the face of continuing supply chain headwinds. billings of $12.5 million and revenue of $11.5 million, both came in within our guidance range for the second consecutive quarter. demand for our products remained robust.
and thanks to the tireless efforts of our team, we were able to procure adequate quantities of critical components to meet the majority of our customers' requirements. i'd now like to share more about our second quarter business results, provide an update on the status of our transformation and discuss our outlook for q3. mark will then review the financial results in greater detail. velodyne continues to be one of the most diversified suppliers of lidar solutions with superior performance, power efficiency, and reliability as differentiators across key industries.
in q2, we saw increased customer traction across all three of our target markets; industrial and robotics, intelligent infrastructure, and autonomous vehicles, roughly half our sensors shipped into the industrial, robotics, and infrastructure markets. within industrial and robotics, our lidar-based solutions are being used across an increasingly diverse set of applications, including last-mile delivery robots, truck docks, cargo handling, and shipping. in the infrastructure, use cases include traffic systems, vehicle-to-infrastructure networks, and security, space, and asset monitoring. lastly, we are seeing demand for our solutions in virtual and augmented reality applications such as mapping, entertainment, and online interactions.
the other 50% of units shipped in the quarter were for l4 and l5 robo taxi and autonomous shuttle customers who depend on velodyne's sensors to power their systems. during the quarter, we also expanded our customer reach with several new multi-year agreements. we signed a sales agreement with boston dynamics, a global robotics market leader. they selected velodyne's high-performance sensors to enhance and extend the capabilities of their mobile autonomous robots.
our intelligent infrastructure solution or iis was deployed in helsinki, finland for traffic flow monitoring at multiple intersections to improve safety. along with delivering multimodal traffic counting and classification, our iis demonstrated its efficacy in detecting near-miss collision situations such as running red lights and jaywalking. this proliferation of nonautomotive use cases validates our thesis that the first wave of commercial lidar adoption will be dominated by industrial automation, robotics, and intelligent infrastructure. according to research firm, yole, these segments are estimated to be a $2.8 billion per year total available market by 2026.
as i enter my third full quarter as ceo of velodyne, i continue to be pleased with the progress we've made on the turnaround plan i announced in the february earnings call. to highlight just a few examples, we accelerated the outsourcing of manufacturing to our low-cost contract manufacturer in thailand with completion targeted for next year. this transition will significantly advance our efficiency in operations, allowing us to increase capacity, improve yields, reduce costs, and expand gross margins. we reprioritized and rationalized products in development by deploying our valuable technical resources on opportunities with attractive returns on investment and high contribution margins.
this process led to the discontinuation of some products in development, including the velarray h800. we defined our next-generation product road maps, encompassing highly differentiated sensors, software, and solutions that we expect to be introduced over the next 18 to 24 months. recently, we've implemented other changes that will enhance velodyne's governance and leadership, including the appointment of mark weinswig as our new chief financial officer, the addition of seasoned and highly experienced new board members that will help management take the company to the next level and the redistribution of stock ownership, including a dramatic reduction in founder ownership. from day one, i have emphasized the priority of scaling lidar into a profitable growing business, delivering attractive shareholder returns.
i discussed our strategy in detail in the past two earnings calls. and while it will take time to execute fully, we are making progress every day. as we look forward to the remainder of 2022 and 2023, we are taking steps to align our expense structure with our revenue expectations. in parallel, we will continue to invest in strategic, differentiated, high roi product categories that are essential to our long-term growth.
these actions are designed to deliver industry-leading smart vision solutions to our customers while accelerating time to breakeven. before handing the call over to mark, i want to offer some commentary around our guidance for the third quarter. we entered the third quarter with robust demand. however, based on information from our suppliers, we expect supply challenges will extend into 2023, making it difficult for us to fully support all of this demand.
our efforts to modify our sensors to utilize alternative sources is on track and will help us to partially mitigate these supply chain risks. combining all of these factors, we expect billings to be between $10 million and $12 million and revenue to be between $8 million and $11 million. the difference between billings and revenue is due to estimated noncash contra revenue related to the amazon warrants. our cost reduction initiatives, including the expanded use of outsourced manufacturers, improvements in operating efficiencies, and the growth of offshore design center capabilities will deliver incremental improvements in the third quarter of 2022 with the full benefit expected to be realized in the second half of 2023.
with that, it is my pleasure to welcome mark to this call.
mark weinswig -- chief financial officer
thank you, ted. good afternoon, everyone. i'm very excited about joining the velodyne team during this pivotal time, and i look forward to contributing to the next stage of velodyne's evolution. during my initial time with the company, i worked closely with the executive and finance teams to analyze opportunities to improve our results.
i believe there is room for significant improvement in our operating efficiencies. we have a healthy balance sheet with approximately $230 million in cash and equivalents, providing us with the capital to execute on our strategic plan. i want to echo ted's earlier comments that we would take the steps needed to reduce our cost structure and focus on profitable revenue growth in order to reach the goal of cash breakeven. now, turning to our q2 financial results.
total revenue was $11.5 million and included an approximately $1 million noncash impact from the amazon warrant accounting. total product revenue was $9.7 million. this compares with $4.4 million in the first quarter. in the first quarter, the accounting for the amazon warrants had a noncash impact of $5.3 million on our revenue.
license and service revenue was $1.9 million, compared with $1.8 million in the first quarter. billings were $12.5 million, compared with billings of $11.5 million in q1. billings while up were impacted by the continued supply chain constraints. gaap gross loss was $7.1 million.
this compares with $9.3 million in the first quarter. the second quarter was impacted by $2.2 million in losses from the discontinuation of a product line, as ted discussed previously. non-gaap gross loss was $4.2 million. this compares with a gross loss of $8.8 million in the prior quarter.
gaap operating expenses were $37.5 million, compared with $39.6 million in q1. non-gaap operating expenses were $31.8 million, compared with $35.1 million in the prior quarter. lower expenses were partially driven by cost containment strategies implemented during the quarter. i look forward to discussing more of our progress in future quarters.
gaap net loss was $44.3 million or $0.22 per share and compares with $49.1 million or $0.25 per share in the prior quarter. non-gaap net loss was $35.7 million or $0.18 per share, compared with $44 million or $0.22 per share in the first quarter. finally, moving on to the balance sheet. with approximately $230 million in cash and investments at the end of the quarter, our capital and liquidity remains healthy.
as we move through the year, i look forward to discussing the progress we are making in improving our financial performance as we balance the need to develop new products and invest in long-term growth, while streamlining our operations to reduce our cash burn. with that, i'll turn the call back to ted.
ted tewksbury -- chief executive officer
thank you, mark. every day, we see exciting new examples of lidar being used to make our communities safer, our supply chains more efficient, and our planet greener. with over 73,000 of our lidar sensors shipped to date into our three target markets; industrial and robotics, intelligent infrastructure, and automotive, velodyne is leading the way. we are working intensely to bring our next-generation products to market and expand our solutions into new industries and applications.
q2 was a quarter of progress, however, we know there is much more to do. we have completed a top to bottom analysis of the business and are investing in new programs to deliver the highest return on investment, while simultaneously implementing cost reductions to accelerate our time to breakeven. we believe our strong balance sheet provides us with the capital we need to execute these plans. in closing, i want to thank our stakeholders, including investors, customers, and suppliers for their continued support.
and most of all, i want to thank the velodyne team for their hard work in helping us to achieve our goals. operator, we will now open the call to questions.
