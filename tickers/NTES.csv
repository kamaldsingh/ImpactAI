thank you. [operator instructions] we will take our first question from the line of alex poon from morgan stanley.
alex poon -- morgan stanley -- analyst
[foreign speech]
i'll translate my questions. first question is regarding the lessons learned from covid-19 regarding the game business. many game genres have become very popular during this period, no matter it is mobile or shooting games and also casual games as well. so in terms of user acquisition, retention, game genre, development strategy, do we have some new thoughts, new ideas after this covid-19? my second question is regarding the music business. top line growth is very strong, how should we think about the product development and margin trend in 2020? thanks very much.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign speech]
charles zhaoxuan yang -- chief financial officer
alex, i will provide a brief translation of william's remarks. firstly, on games. during the pandemic, we have seen games becoming a sense event for family members staying together in-house so they have more time spent together as a family as a whole to get joy and excitement and some relief from game as a broad entertainment. it is also a boost to new game users during the past quarter. these will be obviously translated into our thinking of how to focus more on r&d self-development of games that can create a bonding opportunity for family members as a whole going forward. for the music, and william emphasized in fact, reemphasized from his prior remarks, that the ambition, the mission of netease cloud music platform is we want to create a vast environment to support development of china's independent musicians, people with talent who can express themselves and distribute their products to a group of music enthusiasts with passion, with the exploration of new diversified -- different genres of songs. and i think for the foreseeable future, that is our key focus of development.
you also asked about the margin trend. i think that as we continue to grow the scale and diversification of our music revenue stream possibilities, we will naturally benefit a lot from economies of scale with the enhancement of margin trend and i think on the margin trend we are also quite optimistic. i hope that answers your question, alex.

thank you very much. we will take our next question from alicia yap from citigroup. alicia yap, your line is open. please go ahead.
alicia yap -- citi -- analyst
okay, hi. thank you. good morning, william and charles. congrats on the results. thanks for taking my questions. my question is on your gaming business. as many other companies are seeing the normalizing trend of the gamers' traffic and activity post the lockdown lift off, how does that trend looking for netease games? and how should we think about the offsetting factor with your deferred revenue for the second quarter and also the lockdown in overseas that might benefit the overseas gaming closing? thank you.
charles zhaoxuan yang -- chief financial officer
okay. alicia, do you want to translate your question yourself?
alicia yap -- citi -- analyst
sure. [foreign speech]
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign speech]
charles zhaoxuan yang -- chief financial officer
i will provide a brief translation of william's remarks. so he commented alicia, i think your observation is right. however, that is a short-term volatility. i think across the board, as you mentioned, other game companies and us might be seeing. however, william emphasized that the growth engine of netease games is our ability to continuously produce in-house and launch new game titles as well as our ambition of becoming a more globalized game company with more exciting titles launched into overseas markets such as japan and hopefully very soon in the mainstream western market. with all that, we are not overly concerned about these short-term volatilities and we are very, very optimistic about the outlook of netease games growth driven by the diversification of new titles as well as diversification of new geographies.

we will take our next question from the line of natalie wu from china international capital corporation.
natalie wu -- china international capital corporation -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a very solid quarter. [foreign speech]
i will translate myself. so i have two questions. first one is regarding the pc game. so your pc game outperformed the industry despite a hold-off operation of the [indecipherable], which is quite encouraging. it would be great if management can share with us some thoughts of the future outlook for that segment. and second one is regarding harry potter. so just wondering if the game is ready, but still need time to get approval in domestic china market? will you decide to wait for the license or will you launch it firstly in overseas regions? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign speech]
charles zhaoxuan yang -- chief financial officer
okay. so yes, natalie, i will translate william's comments for everyone's broader benefit for the first question and i will answer the question on harry potter.
so firstly, what we observed is that during the global pandemic, pc and console games, in general have seen an increasing trend as more people are spending time at home. and it is not so much correlated to the internet cafe's operation as you can see from our game results because our pc games are legacy titles running for over a decade. in case of fwj, we see a record quarter since its debut almost 17 years ago. and we are very confident about the sustained gross billing popularity of our flagship pc games. for the time being, our main concentrated focus of new game development is tilted toward mobile games. so launch of new pc games will be opportunistic. we do not have a regular agenda like we regularly launch new mobile games. so that's to your first question.
second question, harry potter. we are very excited about harry potter. it is a strong ip globally and we are confident in our r&d ability to convert this ip into an exciting game title. i think it's too early to predict about the situation on regulatory approval in china. and when it comes to the stage when the game is ready for launch, whether we will do a global simultaneous launch or whether we will do overseas launch first followed by domestic upon the approval, both are possibilities and we will decide that later when the game is more advanced.
natalie wu -- china international capital corporation -- analyst

we will take our next question from shi jialong from nomura. your line is open, please go ahead.
shi jialong -- nomura -- analyst
yes, good morning management. thanks for taking my questions. first of all, congratulations on a very solid quarter. [foreign speech]
i have two questions. first question is about netease online gaming business. just wondering how much of netease online gaming revenue was contributed by overseas market in 1q? my second question is about netease music business, according to various media reports, it seems to me netease music has accelerated the purchase of licensed content since this year, including the recent licensing agreement with top global record labels as well as the exclusive purchase of some of the highly rated music shows. i was just wondering why it seems netease music became more aggressive on content purchase? thanks.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign speech]
charles zhaoxuan yang -- chief financial officer
jialong, first question. overseas, first quarter our overseas revenue accounts for slightly more than 10% of our total game revenue, consistent with our level of last year, but we are very confident to continue to grow and even very strongly to grow this revenue contribution from the overseas game market in the next three years to five years.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign speech]
charles zhaoxuan yang -- chief financial officer
i'll provide a quick translation of william's remarks. so first of all our dedication to support and promote independent musicians and native ips are not mutually exclusive with our deep respect and open minded, strong collaboration with music label companies. in fact, in the past, there are obstacles in the industry preventing us from purchasing music content and music ips directly from label companies. we are very, very active and indeed a collaboration with all these highly regarded label companies in an effort to acquire music ips, content copyright. and will utilize our efficiency and our massive user scale of the netease cloud music to distribute their music content to a group of music enthusiast lovers. and we also want to reiterate that we hope that the whole industry in china and all the players in china can spend more focus, effort and resources into promoting native ip, organic music from independent musicians because i think it is going to be a much bigger ambition for the entire industry to see the rising of chinese music, chinese musicians as a whole to play a much bigger role on the global audience, on the global stage.

okay. we will take our next question from the line of eddie leung from bank of america merrill lynch.
eddie leung -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning. [foreign speech] so my question is about the new game launch. historically, when we have a big year of a lot of new games to be launched, typically the marketing spending ratio would go up. so just wondering what could be the pattern this year? and whether there would be different ways to promote new games? thank you.
charles zhaoxuan yang -- chief financial officer
okay. yes. eddie, your question is -- ok. eddie, your question is on our outlook of marketing expenses. i want to reemphasize one point. netease games focuses a lot on self-developed in-house developed games. as such, we are always excited about our lineups of new games. whenever we consider promoting a new game, it is always a return driven exercise internally. depending on our projections of the game's performance and expectations of the gross billing, then we allocate marketing resources in a very sensible way. that is why i think in the prior quarters, i also made remarks that try not to look too much into the quarter-over-quarter fluctuations of the marketing spending dollars. in fact, if you look at my marketing dollars as a percentage of the overall revenue on the full year trend, last year, we controlled it at around 10%, a significant decrease from the prior two years. however, absolute dollars is not shrinking. that is because we are more sensible. we are more conscious about the return generation on my marketing dollars with more new game titles. yes, we are going to spend more marketing dollars, but we are even more optimistic that with effective promotion, the new games are going to generate even faster return for us at the top line. so on the financial planning aspect, netease remains prudent and sensible.
eddie leung -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. thank you charles.
operator
we will take our next question from the line of alex liu from china renaissance.
alex liu -- china renaissance -- analyst
[foreign speech] i'll translate myself. my first question is on the cash allocation. we have very good cash flow on our core business and also a very solid cash balance. just wondering, should we think about the enlarged stock repurchase program and perhaps further stock repurchase program as a more occurring practice down the road? and the second question is on the deferred revenue. deferred revenue balance was very strong this quarter and i was wondering if the management could give some color on this growth and whether it's due to the mix change between pc and mobile game. thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign speech]
charles zhaoxuan yang -- chief financial officer
okay. alex, for your first question, our treasury policy is always very prudent. we are one of the very, very few tech companies globally that pays a regular dividend. in fact, we've been paying a regular dividend since 2013 and we will continue to do so, returning value to our shareholders, especially long-term shareholders who has been supporting us in the journey of the growth over the last two decades. the stock buyback program is also a regular exercise for a couple of years. and when the situation requires and then within our ability, we can go back to the board, just like this time, seeking for the authorization of enhanced dollar amount for the overall stock buyback. so that is on the treasury cash management aspect.
for your deferred revenue, we don't further break down exactly on the composition, but i think you are right. in q1, if i remember correctly, it is probably another record quarter for both recognized revenue as well as deferred revenue. and again, largely, it's underpinned by the gross billings and the growth of both pc lines as well as mobile lines of games, largely consistent with what you are seeing in the year-over-year growth for the recognized revenue. youdao also contributed to a certain extent, of course, but then you can refer to youdao's public filing for the deferred revenue incremental portion.
alex liu -- china renaissance -- analyst
understood. thank you very much.

we will take our next question from the line of binnie wong from hsbc.
binnie wong -- hsbc -- analyst
thank you. good morning, william, charles and margaret. [foreign speech] i'll quickly translate myself. post the covid-19, do you think that it actually changes in terms of how we view our overseas games expansion trend? what are the new opportunities that we also see? and how do we see our target in the next three years to five years? how does that change or that remain the same? and then in terms of your upcoming game launches, which one do you think -- because these are all very highly anticipated, which one do you think that we probably will see launches soon? and then in terms of -- how do you see the significance of those? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign speech]
charles zhaoxuan yang -- chief financial officer
[foreign speech] so i will provide a brief translation of william's remarks. so firstly, how the pandemic situation globally would affect our thinking of game promotions, particularly in the overseas market. william's commented that generally speaking, the pandemic situation requires people to spend more time in house. so it is a structural tailwind for overall activities that happen at home, playing video games, watching drama, etc. and that, we think, is going to also benefit our game promotions because this content is having more user time, so to speak, on a global scale and we are not particularly concerned about the pandemic situation disrupting our plan, our original plan of game launches. especially for these mature overseas markets, users are more attracted and emphasize a lot on game quality. i think that is our biggest selling point. it is the quality of the netease games.
and second, you asked on the approval process and our expectation on the overseas games. it's really difficult for us to do a force ranking, which one is number 1, which one is number 2, because for all these projects since the inception of the project business planning, we think they are all great products, representing highest quality in their respective genre to target a trend to a very different segment of target users. so we are very excited. some of the games can be launched as early as the middle of this year and some might have to wait until the second half, later part of this year. and william draws also a closing remark that he himself personally, throughout and given the pandemic situation, he's actually been thinking and giving a lot of more thought in terms of how game content can be designed and developed and how game content can be distributed to fulfill a better social responsibility and value to families, to people around the globe.
binnie wong -- hsbc -- analyst
thank you. william and charles, that's very helpful.

we will take our next question from the line of thomas chong from jefferies. your line is open, please go ahead.
thomas chong -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks william, charles and margaret for taking the question. i have a question, back to the music business. given the fact that we have been also monetizing for the live streaming business models, can you comment about how we should think about the competition in the live streaming space as well as the competition with short form video? [foreign speech]
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign speech]
charles zhaoxuan yang -- chief financial officer
[foreign speech] so in the interest of time, i will provide a brief translation of william's remarks just now. so broadcasting is just one way of us thinking how we can monetize on our netease cloud music platform. it is not the only way and we will continue to explore different and innovative and diversified ways of monetization in a sensible and user appealing way. and -- but the essence of us, the biggest ambition and the mission of us doing the netease cloud music platform is that we want to contribute whenever we can within our ability to help promote and better enhance the chinese music industry as a whole. it might look very different from mature market in the western world, but we think chinese music market is huge with huge upside potential and it could allow multiple players to develop its respective differentiated competitiveness, advantage and edge in collectively making china's online music industry a better and a more promising industry.

charles zhaoxuan yang -- chief financial officer
thank you margaret, and thank you everyone for participating in today's call. before we begin, i would like to remind everyone that all percentages are based on renminbi.
like every company around the globe, we started the year with a great deal of uncertainty amid one of the world's worst health crisis. i am pleased to say that we have worked very hard to address the effects of the pandemic, providing help where we can and making the appropriate adjustments to our businesses to ensure the safety of our netease family. we believe many companies inside and outside of china will overcome this pandemic and come out strong.
we had a good quarter, increasing our net revenues by 18% to rmb17.1 billion and our net income from continuing operations attributable to our shareholders was up by 30% to rmb3.6 billion, both on a year-over-year basis. for our online games, net revenues reached rmb13.5 billion in the first quarter on the back of our existing titles stellar performances, growing 14% year-over-year even though 1q 2019 was itself a very strong quarter for our game services a year ago.
our legacy pc titles such as the fantasy westward journey and new westward journey online ii continued their strong performances in the first quarter with new expansion packs launched for the chinese new year holidays, introducing a series of new content. quarterly revenues for these games broke new records, hitting another all-time high since their debuts almost two decades ago. momentum for legacy mobile games was also strong as we continued to supply this large and sustainable user base with continual content updates. take our fantasy westward journey mobile game as an example, where we introduced a brand new character, which quickly gained popularity and was a strong driver for gross billings. while we continue to dominate the mmo genre, many of our recent titles and categories that are relatively new for us have also shown remarkable success and sustainability, providing us with steady revenue streams in what is now a very diverse game portfolio. invincible, onmyoji, identity v and life-after, launched in 2015, '16, '18 [phonetic] and '18, respectively, serve as good examples of our superior game longevity within different game genres.
invincible, our 2015 launch, hit another quarter of record high gross billings and active users. we are pleased to see the game's strong traction in the slg market. after more than five years of successful operations with invincible, we have accumulated a solid slg fan base and extensive expertise in this field. we look forward to developing more innovative games to delight our users in this engaging and thought provoking genre. onmyoji continues to show remarkable longevity as we consistently introduced new characters. these additions are resonating well with new game players, further solidifying the reach of onmyoji as a leading acg game. as the first of our younger ips that we have created in-house, our goal for onmyoji is to have an even larger and deeper impact on the vibrant community of young users. in addition to onmyoji: the card game, the collectible card game we launched last year, and the upcoming simulation game, onmyoji: yokai koya planned for later this year, we have more exciting new games in store based on the onmyoji ip. later today, this evening, beijing time, at our may 20 game day event, we will introduce two new onmyoji spin-off games in brand new genres.
launched in 2018, identity v and life-after are also a few of our newer titles, attracting a large base of young fans and starting to demonstrate sustained longevity. celebrating its second anniversary in april with a series of content updates, identity v reached a milestone of 200 million registered users, attracting players with its characteristic art style and innovative game play. with life-after, since its initial phase of stabilization, gross billings have been picking up steadily over the past few months as we launched a couple of highly popular expansion packs, introducing a series of new themes and innovative game play. we believe that life-after will be another one of our titles that resonates with fans for many years to come. in terms of new titles, fantasy westward journey 3d was launched at the end of 2019 and delivered a stable performance in the first quarter, further expanding the reach of the fwj franchise as a whole and captivating both returning fans as well as a new audience. in april, we launched dawn of isles in china, previously known as age of isle. as our newest mmorpg featuring sandbox game play, the game topped the ios download chart soon after its launch and was featured by the ios app store.
in overseas markets, we continue to gain market share in japan. knives out and identity v remain at the forefront of japan's top grossing games chart and the user bases for both games are growing at a strong pace. the success of these games has helped us to gain a much better understanding of japanese users and their preferences, allowing us to better tailor our games for the japanese market. we have integrated this successful experience and know how into the design of other netease games, enhancing our ability to deliver popular titles to global audience. at the end of 2019, we began operating invincible in japan ourselves. with our proficiency in operating this game domestically, along with our newly acquired understanding of japanese user preferences, we saw a steady increase in invincible's revenue in the first quarter.
now turning to our game pipelines. many of the games under development have the potential to achieve mass audience appeal, transcending geographies and spanning multiple genres. we have a number of these exciting new releases planned for 2020, which we expect to help us gain more brand recognition in the broader global markets, particularly in the us and european markets. as announced two days ago, eve echoes is ready for its global launch in august. additionally, other exciting upcoming titles include fantasy westward journey h5 version, king of hunters, pes club manager, onmyoji: yokai koya, ghost world chronicle, revelation mobile game, harry potter: magic awakened, diablo immortal, pokemon quest and marvel duel.
now for our education business. youdao started the year off on a strong note with healthy gains across many of its primary financial metrics. total net revenues accelerated by 140% year-over-year to rmb541 million and operating cash flow turned positive for the first time. we are seeing an increasing adoption rate of online education due in large part to the structural effects of the pandemic. online courses generated gross billings of rmb519 million, up 287% year-over-year, primarily due to continued enhancement to our course content and product. to match the needs of newly enrolled students during the pandemic, youdao quickly developed and refined new product, helping students receive the most effective teaching online, especially for those taking entrance exams this year. in line with the growing enrollment, we carefully crafted a few more products, including junior high school math, high school english courses, which received wide popularity. we also expanded our education team to over 1,000 instructors and teaching assistants who are well-trained and incentivized to give our students the most tailored and personal support they need.
during the quarter, we further enhanced our technology offering. with the launch of ai essay assessment in our dictionary app, a feature that automatically grade and offer suggestions to improve english writing. going forward, youdao will continue to build up its largely scalable business model and provide users with effective educational experiences empowered by great content and technology. for our cloud music business, we are also growing and proud to have celebrated netease cloud music's 7th anniversary in april. revenue from our cloud music platform continued to accelerate with high speed, achieving triple digit growth year-over-year in the first quarter and record-high membership revenue. live streaming revenue is also growing at a rapid pace. in the first quarter, we released several online live events that were particularly [indecipherable] during the pandemic outbreak and helped to support our independent musician and their ability to distribute. these include the bedroom live music festival [indecipherable] where well known musicians performed at home via live streaming and indie live, a high quality broadcast of independent brands -- bands' live shows. while we maintain a competitive edge in our regional music with now over 160,000 independent musicians on our platform, we are also looking to provide music from all over the globe to expand our music library. in march, we added popular japanese music to our platform through our distribution agreement with studio ghibli, one of the most acclaimed animation studios in the world. further adding to our catalog of songs, we recently signed a strategic partnership with rock records, one of the largest record labels in china. all in all, as with all of our businesses, innovation is key. along these lines, our music platform's largest progression includes a newly launched karaoke offering for our young people. moving ahead, we will continue to make sensible investments in content and innovation to remain relevant and competitive in the exciting world of music.
turning our focus to yanxuan. after a short four years, we have developed a distinct and recognizable brand with a number of notable, self developed products that appeal to a wide range of consumers. in particular, yanxuan has made a name for itself with distinctive offerings in housing, personal care and food categories. during the first quarter, we upgraded our membership offering to a pro membership to include more benefits, attracting a considerable new constituency. new memberships rose by 138% year-over-year, owning to our innovative marketing approaches such as collaborating with top live streaming celebrities. meanwhile, our inventory has been managed to a healthy level as we continuously optimize our procurement and reduce obsolete inventory.
overall, we had a strong start to 2020. our primary business lines grew during the first quarter and we are pleased to have advanced our mission to bring inspiring leading products and services to our growing community of followers. we will press forward as we have done for the past two decades, with our eyes on the long-term and plans to reach incremental gains along the way. this concludes william's prepared remarks.
i will now provide a brief review of our 2020 first quarter financial results. given the limited time on today's call, i will be presenting some abbreviated financial highlights. we encourage you to read through our press release issued earlier today for further details.
total net revenues for the first quarter were rmb17.1 billion or $2.4 billion, representing 18% increase year-over-year. net revenue from online game services were rmb13.5 billion, up 14% year-over-year. this increase was primarily driven by the strong performance of our flagship titles in fwj franchises, new westward journey ii as well as blizzard's world of warcraft. mobile games accounted for approximately 70% of net revenues from our online games in the first quarter. net revenues from youdao also increased 140% year-over-year in the first quarter, reaching rmb541 million, primarily due to the increased net revenues from online courses with a rapid increase in k12 paid enrollment and sales of intelligent learning devices. net revenues from innovative businesses and others were rmb3 billion for the first quarter, up 28% year-over-year, mainly due to increased contribution from netease cloud music and cc live streaming.
overall gross margin was 55% in the first quarter. gp margin for our online game services for the first quarter was 64.1%. our gross margin for online games is generally stable, fluctuating quarter-to-quarter within a narrow bandwidth based on the revenue mix of mobile and pc as well as self developed and licensed games. youdao's gross margin expanded sharply to 43.5% in the first quarter, a vast improvement from 29.8% in the last quarter. this was primarily driven by the achievement of economies of scale and better faculty compensation structure. gross margin for innovative businesses and others for the first quarter was 15.8%, up from 5.7% year-over-year. the improvement comes primarily from significantly increased revenue from our netease cloud music business.
for the first quarter, total operating expenses were rmb4.9 billion. our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue was 10.9% compared with 13.7% in the prior quarter. the quarter-over-quarter decrease was a result of less spending in online game promotion and cloud music during this quarter. r&d expenses were rmb2.1 billion, up 5% year-over-year. we remain committed to investing in innovative content creation and product development, which is what's defining us as a technology company. the effective tax rate was 22% for the first quarter, relatively flat with the prior period and down from 31% in the first quarter of 2019.
non-gaap net income from continuing operations attributable to our shareholders for the first quarter was rmb4.2 billion or $595 million, representing increase of 15% quarter-over-quarter and nearly 26% year-over-year. our non-gaap diluted earnings per ads from continuing operations were rmb32.17 or $4.54 for the first quarter of 2020. our cash position remains strong. as of 31 -- as of march 31, 2020 our total cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current time deposits and short-term investment balance totaled rmb79.3 billion compared with rmb74.4 billion as of the end of last year.
in accordance with our dividend policy, we are pleased to report that our board of directors has approved a dividend of $1.16 per ads for this quarter. this represents a regular dividend paying stream since 2013. on february 26, 2020, we announced the board approval for a new share repurchase program for up to $1 billion of our outstanding ads and we announced an amendment to such program earlier today to increase the total authorized repurchase amount from the original $1 billion to $2 billion. as of march 31, 2020, approximately 1.1 billion ads has been repurchased for a total consideration of $342 million.

[operator instructions] we will take our first questions from the line of alex poon from morgan stanley.
alex poon -- morgan stanley -- analyst
[foreign language] i'll translate my question. my first question is related to your progress in japan. in the last couple of years, the progress has been very great. the grossing ranking has done very well.
can you share with us what's your next milestone? what's your next goal in japan mobile game market? and my second question is related to harry porter launch. what's the launch strategy for the game? is it a global launch together with china and overseas? and if we have to think about the potential of the grossing of overseas versus china which side would be stronger?
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
charles yang -- chief financial officer
ok. alex and for the audience, for everyone's convenience, i'll quickly translate william's remarks. and apologies for the technical glitch just now. firstly, regarding our objective for the japanese market, it's a very important market for our global initiatives, and we've achieved a small milestone there over the last couple of years.
but we still think there's huge upside potential for us to further cultivate into the japanese market. for instance, we are committed to even diversify more offerings, more genres of games into that important market. with regards to harry potter, this is a highly anticipated game. we focus a lot more on the product itself, on the possible user reactions and feedbacks and the likeness of this product.
whether it's a simultaneous launch for china plus global market or at a different pace, we don't think that's the top priority for us. the good thing is that we've got approval already. so we have the flexibility. but for us, the focus is really on the product and making sure users are happy with the product when we are fully prepared.
so far, the progress has been very well on track. operator, next question please.
operator
ok. we will take our next questions, alicia yap. your line is open. please go ahead.

[foreign language] so my first question is actually regarding the margins. so with the newly signed contract with umg, how will that change the gross margin and cost profile for the new, innovative business and assuming you may have to pay an upfront fee on that? so -- and also, with more contracts and all that, how should that change in terms of the potential monetization? second question quickly is on the sales and marketing.
so it seems like this quarter, the spend is a bit higher than previous quarter. so wonder if this is one-off or it will be a new norm for the rest of the second half. [foreign language]
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
charles yang -- chief financial officer
alicia, and for quick translation of william's remarks, we've added comments from my side. so first of all, william commented that the multiple year, in nature, this changes the sublicensing formatting for direct partnership. so in essence, it's not really changing the margin trend or on the business side. the big, positive impact from direct partnership is that beyond music content subscription revenues, that we are now in a direct partnership to possibly explore other formats of monetization with a record label provider, and that gives us more confidence that netease cloud music would explore and try out more interesting and innovative ways of monetization potential which, in the longer term, will lead to a much more healthy user experience on the platform which then naturally would result in a much more healthy financial profile of netease cloud music.
for your second question, specifically on selling and marketing expenses, yes, like in my earlier comment, this is -- represent the increased absolute dollars primarily for two reasons. one is the selling and marketing effort for new game launches, in particular the fantasy westward journey h5 game, and also partly due to the summer promotion initiative of youdao spending which is again kind of a seasonal -- seasonality for the overall online education industry. however, if you look from different aspects, this quarter, selling and marketing represented about 12.8% of my overall top line revenue. of course, there are some gaps of spending first and repeated, sustainable revenue growth into the coming quarters.
all in all, this percentage level represents a very prudent and disciplined level comparing to our historical level on an annualized basis in the last three years. hopefully, that answers your question, alicia.
alicia yap -- citi -- analyst
ok. yes, thank you.
operator
we will take our next questions from the line of alex yao from j.p. morgan. your line is open. please go ahead.
alex yao -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
[foreign language] i have two questions. the first one is to follow up alicia's question on music monetization. william, you mentioned that you guys are considering to diversify the music monetization. so in addition to the current subscription-based monetization model, what are the monetization model that you guys are trying or contemplating? so that's the first question.
the second question is regarding the international gaming expansion strategy. you guys have quite a number of gaming titles with a very famous of western ip. those games are very suitable for global including both domestic and international, publishing. so given the current geopolitical tension between china and the u.s., especially what's going on between u.s.
government and some of the china internet companies, would you reconsider your international gaming strategy? let me stop here.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
charles yang -- chief financial officer
[foreign language] so alex, i'll provide a brief translation of william's remarks. for the first question on the possible monetization format around netease cloud music, obviously that would require some innovation. there are certain monetization formats that's been proven, but what's more interesting is what are the other more innovative ways that the online music streaming industry can further explore. we are very confident on that front because that's our dna, content development innovation.
and the one commitment that's unchanged is that we are dedicated to invest more resources and capability into native content, into supporting independent musicians to create a more healthy and sustainable industry trend for china's music industry by and large. second question. we recognize the complexity around the current background of geopolitical uncertainty. but what we believe as a content developer is that high-quality content, great game content is universally appealing.
this is universal. and we are committed to remain highly selective and serious in developing good game content not only for chinese users but for the global audience. we think as long as we are committed and focused on content development and universally appealing content goes beyond geopolitical complexity. operator, next question please.
operator
ok. we will take our next question from the line of eddie leung from merrill lynch. your line is open. please go ahead.
eddie leung -- merrill lynch -- analyst
[foreign language] so i have two questions. the first one is about the cloud music pieces. how do you think about the positioning of the soc media companies in the online music market in the long term? it seems like some of these soc media companies have been adding musical-related video contents to their platforms. so just i wonder whether they might become competitors in the long term.
and then secondly is about the performance of your legacy hit gains, some of them still generating pretty good revenue and even seeing some growth. so in general, i would like to know whether it's more driven by paying user growth or arpu growth. thank you. [foreign language]
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
charles yang -- chief financial officer
[foreign language] eddie, i will provide a brief translation of william's remarks. firstly, on your question, we believe short-format video and music actually are very synergistic verticals. however, they are fundamentally different because usually, for short-format video, firstly it is chopped. it's usually less than a minute, whereby a full complete song typically require three, four minutes of listening.
so -- and also, short-format video usually takes a highlight part where that's particularly strong. and as a predominantly ugc content platform, it's highly dependent on the music or the background music, whereas the product itself doesn't require so much of a professional touch. on the other hand, on the music platform, it's mostly pgc or professional content creation, and it's a much longer format. so short-format video is a very, very conducive channel to promote a high-quality music content.
however, if you are a -- a user is a true music enthusiast who wants to enjoy the full length of the song or the kind of a music-oriented touch, then a short-format video cannot replace the importance and relevance of the music platform. that's how we look at the relationship of the 2. we do not think it is a replacement per se. secondly, on the game growth, william's remark is that if it does seem that the spending habits or the structural changes is that more users are willing to pay now, pay for high-quality content, pay for a better experience in the game, that would mean as a whole the number of overall paying users is on the increasing trend.
at the same time, for games, at least for certain genres of the games, you would also note a very distinct polarization of the spending pattern. some people are more like a kind of a subscriber, right? they spend not so much, but they spend consistently whereby some users spend a lot more on certain games. and typically, for these types of games, they are more picky, they are more selective on the highest quality of the games, the best in-game experience. so by and large, we think our number of users are going to grow.
arpu may not necessarily grow at the same noticeable trend. however, if our content is relevant and represents the highest quality of the respective genre, we have the potential to grow both the arpu as well as the number of users in our -- on our products. operator, next question please.
operator
ok. we will take our next questions from the line of thomas chong from jefferies. your line is open. please go ahead.
thomas chong -- jefferies -- analyst
[foreign language] thanks management for taking my questions and congratulations on a very strong set of results. i have a question about our overseas game strategies. given that we have ip licensing, we have our strong in-house development as well as we get the cash proceeds coming from our hong kong listing, so how would we think about our overseas strategies in terms of m&a, ip licensing as well as in-house development? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
charles yang -- chief financial officer
thomas, i'll provide a brief translation. so we -- actually, with the hong kong ipo, it doesn't really change our mentality or approach toward a content-focused global initiative. we are always very active and open minded on all the strategies you mentioned. actually, there's no forced ranking in terms of priorities.
it licensing represents a very, very critical element of our global initiative because that showcase is the involvement of our content creation capability, operation, publishing capability. at the same time, self-development remains the core of our competence. m&a, we are very optimistic, but we are also highly open minded and active particularly in genres that's supplementary to our core in-house r&d capability.
thomas chong -- jefferies -- analyst
[foreign language] and then friends, william and charles, i have a follow-up question. it's about the paying ratio and arpu. if we try to compare japan versus china, should we expect china is heading toward the japan level in the long run? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
charles yang -- chief financial officer
ok. thomas, i'll provide again a translation of william's remarks. so first of all, it is very common that different geographies, different economies demonstrate different kind of consumer behavior. but on the longer-term trend, we do think that the chinese consumers' willingness to spend and the ability to spend is on the rising trend.
one -- for instance, one small example. if you look at today, the cost of a movie ticket in china is already comparable to a movie -- a cinema movie ticket spending in the states. just a decade ago, there's a huge gap, right? for some of us who can recall, there's a huge gap which means chinese consumers are more willing to pay on entertainment. as chinese economy further advance, people are more willing to pay a broad format of entertainment to enrich their lifestyle.
we think that trend is on the rise. operator, i think in the interest of time, let us wrap up this call.
operator
ok. due to time limit, that concludes today's questions-and-answer session. at this time, i will turn the conference back to margaret shi for any additional closing remarks.
margaret shi -- investor relations director

charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you margaret, and thank you everyone for participating in today's call. before we begin, i would like to remind everyone that all percentages are based on renminbi. this is our very first earnings call as a public company on both nasdaq and the hong kong stock exchange. with the support of our shareholders, this past june, we celebrated our 20th anniversary on nasdaq and completed our listing on the hong kong stock exchange.
this dual listing reminds us of our commitment to shareholders, both domestically and overseas, of our deep responsibility to continue creating value for our growing base of global stakeholders. i'm pleased to report a solid second quarter among challenging macro backdrop with healthy gains across each of our primary business lines. once again, we saw steady performances from our flagship titles and franchises and rapid growth from youdao and netease cloud music. in total, we grew our net revenues year over year by nearly 26% to rmb 18.2 billion for this quarter, and our net income from continuing operations attributable to our shareholders grew year over year by 35% to rmb 4.5 billion.
our online games was up 21% in the second quarter year over year, reaching net revenue of rmb 13.8 billion driven by the impressive strength of our existing titles. our flagship, fantasy westward journey series and westward journey series, continued their strong performance in the second quarter as two of the largest and longest-running game ips in china. both games consistently attract a loyal cult. adding to the success of our fantasy westward journey franchise, we introduced fantasy westward journey h5 in june, a more casual and light version of the legacy ip.
this new addition has captivated an untapped audience, enlarging the user base of our fantasy westward journey franchise even further. while we continue to grow and strengthen our legacy franchises, many of our titles that are launched in more recent years have also shown remarkable success and sustainability. for our pc game, justice, celebrating its two-year anniversary, we introduced a new character in conjunction with an expansion pack in june. we are very pleased to see its popularity, propelling strong gross billings as well as record high numbers of both new and returning players.
similarly, our slg title, invincible, hit another quarter of record high revenue with strong user engagement in the second quarter. the expertise we have accumulated in slgs over the past five years with this popular title is invaluable. we are carrying on some of this expertise into building other highly anticipated slg games in our pipeline for china and for the global market. these include titles such as the lord of the rings, rise to war and infinite lagrange.
onmyoji also shows remarkable longevity as we continually introduce new characters. to further enlarge the reach of this ip, we are expanding our portfolio of offerings in the onmyoji family. next month, we target to launch on onmyoji yokai koya, a simulation game that has been long anticipated by the onmyoji community. two other new spinoff games are also in the making, onmyoji idol project, another simulation game, and project world, an onmyoji role-playing game.
with more and more experience in diverse game genres, we have also tapped into more diverse and larger user pools. many of these games are very popular among younger generations and are showing great longevity as well includes the lifeafter and identity v. take identity v as an example. this popular and young ip has gained strong traction with generation z users, and we are regularly enriching this ip through a variety of initiatives including esports tournaments, ip collaboration and offline activities that cater to this popular base of loyal users.
recently, we launched crossover characters through our collaboration with detective conan, a japanese anime series which quickly started trending in social media outlets, sparking enthusiastic discussion among young generations, highlighting the dynamic nature of our games. moving on to licensed games. the strong performance of blizzard entertainment's world of warcraft carried on well, achieving a record number of peak concurrent users in the first half of this year. beyond our progress in the domestic market, we have also made multiple headway with our international initiatives.
our overseas online game net revenues hit a new record high in the second quarter, propelled by robust performances from knives out and lifeafter in japan. for example, our collaboration with the tokyo ghoul anime series for knives out was a huge success with the game topping the ios grossing chart for nearly a whole week. earlier today, we launched eve echoes, a next-gen sandbox mmo mobile game that has been long awaited by the user community. in addition to the success of our existing games, we have many exciting games in our pipeline with upcoming titles that include onmyoji yokai koya, the lord of the rings, rise to war, harry potter: magic awakened, for all time, revelation mobile game, ghost world chronicle, nightmare breaker, infinite lagrange, diablo immortal and pokã©mon quest.
as for our education business, youdao continues to scale at a rapid pace. total net revenue rose 93% year over year to rmb 623 million with positive operating cash flow again in this quarter. gross billings for youdao's online classes tripled year over year to rmb 542 million driven by strong retention and larger-scale marketing in the k-12 segment which increased its gross billings by 229% year over year. in addition to strong contributions from junior high school math and physics, we saw more courses growing popular in the second quarter including high school chinese and primary school math.
to better prepare for the new enrollment during the summer months, youdao has significantly built up its servicing capabilities, increasing its total number of instructors and tutors to 179 and 2,699, respectively. as we frequently upgrade our course development system, we are building more personalized and stratified services for students with different grades, increasing their in-class interactions. during the quarter, net revenues of youdao's learning devices reached rmb 86 million, up 250% year over year. through continued investment in product and technology innovation, we released dictionary pen 2.0 pro version with more functionality as well as japanese and korean languages in the past june.
the product became the top-selling product of its category on e-commerce platforms during the june 18 event. looking ahead, we are well poised to continue youdao's growth trajectory, supported by our strong technology and teaching capabilities. and thus, we further amplify our marketing efforts to further bolster our student base for the second half of this year. for netease cloud music, we continued to see triple-digit revenue growth in the second quarter year over year, with both membership and live streaming striking new highs.
we are very pleased to have secured a multiyear licensing agreement with universal music group. this direct partnership further strengthens netease cloud music as a go-to platform for high-quality international music and marks a great step forward for china's music industry as a whole. we are very committed to bringing the richest content to chinese users by introducing exciting global music and incubating independent musicians. in the second quarter, we launched numerous paid live shows for independent bands, giving them more options to stream online during this uncertain time.
also in this quarter, we launched yinjie, our karaoke app which allows one-click remix capability for limitless creative possibilities when singing on our app. our users can connect through songs and common music interest and share their mood when recording. these fun and easy, customizable features greatly appeal to our younger users. additionally, our annual subscription service is now available for members of alibaba's customer loyalty 88 vip program, one of the major collaborations after alibaba's investment in netease cloud music last year.
and we are working together to explore more possibilities for future synergies. turning to yanxuan. we continued to optimize our operating efficiency in the second quarter in terms of product development, supply chain and user experience. during this quarter, we introduced a number of popular products, significantly reduced inventory turnover days and further expanded our pro membership, who typically represent the most core and sticky users of our yanxuan brand.
as a private label, one of our key strategic goals is to increase brand awareness and marketing appeal to a broader audience in china. during the second quarter, netease and yanxuan executive hosted two live broadcasting shows in which we introduced the yanxuan products, and they were all sold out instantaneously. we also entered in new partnerships with top live streamers and kols which led to a rapid growth in sales through live streaming platforms. netease is best known for our content creation capabilities.
this rings true across our different business segments. as we look to the second half of this year, we are more confident and committed than ever to further expanding our reach and bringing relevant, exciting, new products and services to netease players, fans and followers around the world. games in particular, with the introduction of exciting, new titles and our global initiatives, we are expected to lead our next wave of expansion as we continue to build value for all of our stakeholders. this concludes william's remarks.
i will now provide a brief overview for our 2020 second quarter financial results. given the limited time on today's call, i will be presenting some abbreviated financial highlights. we encourage you to read through our press release issued earlier today for further details. total net revenues for the second quarter was rmb 18.2 billion or $2.6 billion, representing 26% increase year over year.
net revenues from online game services were rmb 13.8 billion, up 21% year over year. the increase was primarily driven by our flagship titles including fantasy westward journey 3d, invincible and the fantasy westward journey mobile game as well as blizzard's world of warcraft. mobile games accounted for approximately 72% of net revenues from our online games services in the second quarter. net revenues from youdao also increased 93% year over year in the second quarter, reaching rmb 623 million primarily due to the increased net revenues from online courses and the record increase in k-12 paid student enrollment and increased sales of intelligent learning devices.
net revenues from innovative businesses and others were rmb 3.7 billion for the quarter, up 39% year over year mainly due to the increased contribution from netease cloud music platform. overall, gross margin was 53.8% in the second quarter. gross margin for our online game services for the second quarter was 63.8%. our gross margin for online games is generally stable, fluctuating quarter to quarter within a narrow band based on the revenue mix of mobile and pc as well as self-developed and licensed games.
gross margin for youdao for the second quarter of 2020 was 45.2% compared to 32.9% for the second quarter of 2019. the margin improvement trend was primarily attributable to greater economies of scale and continued optimization over the cost structure. gross margin for innovative businesses and others was 18.5%, compared to 15.8% and 15.5% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of last year. the increase was due to primarily increased revenues from netease cloud music.
for the second quarter, total operating expenses were rmb 5.6 million. our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue were 12.8%. this quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly due to increased marketing related to new games as well as youdao's summer promotion spending which is typical in the online education space. r&d expenses were rmb 2.4 billion.
we remain committed to investing in innovative content creation and product development. this is what defines us as a technology company. as a percentage of net revenue, r&d expenses represent 13.2% of the total revenue compared to 13.5% for the same quarter last year. we've increased absolute dollar spend in the operating expenses.
we are prudently maintaining a disciplined level of total operating expenses to the overall top line revenue. we are very confident to spend these dollars wisely to further grow the sustainable revenue growth into the near future. other income was rmb 1.5 billion for the second quarter of 2020. year over year increase was mainly due to gains from fair value changes of our investment holdings and government incentives recognized in this quarter.
effective tax rate was 18.6% for the second quarter. non-gaap net income from continuing operations attributable to our shareholders for the second quarter of the year totaled rmb 5.2 billion or $739.7 million, representing an increase of 24% quarter over quarter and nearly 33% year over year. our non-gaap diluted earnings per ads from continuing operations were rmb 39.82 or $5.64 for the second quarter of 2020. our cash position remains strong.

[operator instructions] we will take our first question from the line of jialong shi from nomura.
jialong shi -- nomura instintet -- analyst
good evening, management. thanks for taking my question. let me ask my question first in chinese. [foreign language] how much of native's android version of mobile game revenue is contributed by third-party app stores? for this part of revenue, what is the average revenue share charged by third-party android channels? we heard from media, one of netease online gaming peers was trying to negotiate for a lower revenue share paid to the third-party app stores.
just wonder if netease has also started to talk with your channel partners about this revenue share. and if you did, how's the progress so far?
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
i'll help translating. the china has probably obviously the highest revenue-sharing ratio among all the market around the world, up to as high as 50%. it's true. a few of our native games enjoys a more favorable sharing around 30%, such as fwj, and so we think the way we are seeing in china right now is unhealthy.
and it's probably unsustainable because it's about 20% higher than how much apple is charging the content providers. and we see we'd like to see with the chinese apple partners to be more in sync with our international -- with the international peers to be charging the content providers a more reasonable rate. and we want to work very closely with our channel partners to create a healthy environment for the gaming industry.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
and jialong, to supplement your earlier part of the question. on our channel split, on the ballpark, roughly half of our game revenues were generated through ios, which, again, is only a very, very few game content providers in china can have such a high percentage contribution from ios channels, roughly one-third is coming from android channels and the remainder coming from our official channels. that's a ballpark split of the channel split.
jialong shi -- nomura instintet -- analyst
thanks for the color. 
margaret shi -- investor relations director
thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
ok. operator, the next question, please.
operator
ok. we will take our next question from the line of alex poon from morgan stanley. the line is open. please go ahead.
alex poon -- morgan stanley -- analyst
[foreign language] i'll translate myself. back in 2019, we had a revenue target -- overseas revenue target of 30%. in the following three to five years and because of covid-19, the growth, especially outside of china, has accelerated a lot. and so wondering if there is any change to this target -- revenue mix target.
would it come earlier than expected? and then secondly is i want -- i hope to get some thoughts around casual games versus hardcore games outside of china. what's -- which one do you think would be better to achieve the growth and the rois compared to the china market?
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
2021 will definitely be an important year for netease in terms of internationalization. we have a number of games we're making, such as harry potter and infinite lagrange, which are expected to be launched during the year, and we hope to see fruitful results from those games. thank you. thank you, alex.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
and, alex, on your second question -- second part of the question on our strategy of thinking of overseas game introduction. we are not betting on our future on one or two genres, but rather, we think with our stronger and getting more diversified r&d capability, we want to see multiple genres of games being introduced to different geographies and different users. so shooting game, like knives out, has been proven successful in japan. slg games, like infinite lagrange and the lord of the rings, we are confident that we can leverage our domestic success into the international market, as well as games like harry porter, which is a more casual card rpg game and others.
so i think what we want to do is to have multiple genres targeting multiple geographies and catering to multiple user needs. that is our overall direction for internationalization.
margaret shi -- investor relations director
thank you, alex. next question.
operator
we will take our next question from the line of alicia yap from citi.
alicia yap -- citi -- analyst
hi. yeah. thank you. [foreign language] my question is related to the overall growth driver for the cloud music for 2021.
was that growth mainly driven by the subscription revenue ramp or to be driven by the online advertising revenue or even the live streaming could be growing faster. and then a small related questions on the cny 1 billion video content investment initiative recently, could management share the rationale behind? and do you expect this initiative to actually revise the online advertising revenue or even further push the netease media business growth? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
yes. i'll help translating. so alicia, you're right. our -- the three main forms of monetization for music is membership, advertising and live streaming.
and one of the key focuses for music, going forward, will continue to be about creating our own content, helping independent musicians to create original content on our platforms. so in that sense, memberships will definitely be one of the key drivers to our monetization growth. in terms of radio, what was noticed is that music is about listening. but what we've noticed in the industry in china and globally is that the consumers' habits have evolved from the listening to watching, which is why short-form video platforms have become extremely popular in the regions.
yes. so when we think about making short- to mid-form video, we want to leverage our existing know-how. for example, we're interested in making short- to mid-form video centered around the games or centered around knowledge. so we have this -- we actually have one project within netease called netease information world.
so we -- during the chinese new year, we realized -- we noticed that the play time on our videos have actually increased one to two times compared to previously. so going forward, we'll continue to work on creating content on short- to medium-term mid-form video content centered around our key businesses, games, music, etc. thank you.
alicia yap -- citi -- analyst
thank you. 
margaret shi -- investor relations director
thank you, alicia. next question, please.
operator
we will take our next question from the line of alex yao from j.p. morgan.
alex yao -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
[foreign language] so my question is regarding your view on the pc gaming market. how do you think about the future outlook for this market in both domestic china market, as well as the rest of the world? and then how do you position yourself in such industry? do you still allocate new r&d resource in the pc gaming development? or you just want to strategically maintain the current pc portfolio? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
yes. the outcome from both william and junxiong our -- the mastermind behind many key titles in netease. so yes, that's something that we do care very much about pc because of unique specifications that the pc games can have and the user experience that pc games can deliver to our gamers that we'll probably continue down this road. so on one hand, we'll continue to maintain our existing titles on pcs, and we'll continue to develop new pc titles, too.
in may, we're actually going to launch a game called nightmare breaker, [inaudible] which has actually the license, is a very unique and creative pc game. and also, around the middle of the year, we are going to create -- we are going to probably going to launch another pc game called [inaudible]. and this is a competitive [inaudible] it's made by the [inaudible] standards. and william wanted to add that, in addition to our self-developed games, we actually run lots of very, very popular pc game from blizzard, such as overwatch, world of warcraft, starcraft, to name a few.
so we'll probably have the richest collection of pc games in china. and so pc will continue to be an important part of our game strategy. thank you. next question, please.
operator
we will take our next question from the line of thomas chong from jefferies. your line is open.
thomas chong -- jeff
[foreign language] thanks management for taking my questions. and the first question is regarding overseas game operations. will we consider accelerating the pace through the use of m&a or in-house development? and then my follow-up -- another question is about the regulations. can management share about their thoughts regarding the regulatory environment in online games, live streaming and music? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
in terms of the overseas expansion, we're interested in both and talked about these self-developing games and also through m&a. in terms of the self-development side, there's a number of things -- there's number of ways we can do it. for example, harry potter, this is leveraging the use of a very famous u.k. ip and using our own internal r&d to develop things for the global markets.
on m&a side, yes, we are obviously very interested in achieving greater success through collaborations with different partners around the world. we've actually -- we've always been active in -- invested in good content globally. thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
and, thomas, on your second question asking for the regulatory environment for game broadcasting and music. well, in general, we see that this is becoming more and more popular format of entertainment. so e-sports has been now qualified at the asian games, and there are rumors that it can even potentially be eligible for olympic games. it is a kind of sports for the young people, so game live streaming is important.
netease cc live streaming is building on our unique edge of self-created game content, and it is developed -- it's also been growing quite healthy and sustainably. music, obviously, is becoming an increasingly important entertainment content, and it is not only restricted to the enjoyment of our ears by listening. but just, as william previously mentioned, watching is becoming even more popular and trendy format of enjoying music as a format of entertainment content. so we think everything takes on it's -- a progressive way of developing.
but in general, the regulatory environment is also more and more encouraging for innovation and catering to the user preferences and behavior in general. so we are very confident, and we have our own plans of investing ourselves into these areas.

we will take our next question from the line of kenneth fong from crã©dit suisse.
kenneth fong -- credit suisse
[foreign language] i will translate myself. i want to ask about the pace and is there approximately timing of the launch of the few key ip, including diablo immortal, pokã©mon, as well as harry potter? would that be like spread across different quarters to avoid competition? or we will just launch it right when they are ready? thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, kenneth. for our pipeline, first of all, we are very confident and excited about our lineups for 2021, including, just now, william and junxiong just introduced a couple of exciting pc games. on the mobile side, as you have all noticed, harry porter, diablo immortal and pokã©mon now all have already received their license approvals, and all these games are developed with the intention for a global launch. so now that we have got the approval for the china part, as to the exact timing point of these game launches, we do not rush our producers and our studios.
if we are confident that these high-quality games are developed and designed for a long-anticipated longevity, then we are not overly concerned about whether launching this game in this particular month or the next. but all in all, i think we have more confidence now, given that the license approval has been obtained, that many of these highly anticipated games will be introduced to the gamer community within this year, some might be potentially as early as the first half of this year.

charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, margaret, and thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call. before we begin, i would like to remind everyone that all percentages are based on renminbi. we closed 2020 with a solid set of results in the fourth quarter, centered around content creation and user experience. each of our key business segments showed impressive resilience and delivered sustainable growth during the year.
we generated total net revenue of rmb 73.7 billion for the whole year, up 24% year over year, and rmb 19.8 billion in net revenues for the fourth quarter, up 26% year over year. 2020 was a challenging year for many businesses around the world. it was not a time to stand alone and survive but the time to work together and thrive. while collins dictionary has declared the word lockdown as the word of the year, we believe the word breakthrough also defined for life and career of many in the past year.
we are grateful for the initiatives our employees take to care for the impacted, to respond quickly and act responsibly, to help both of our company and the broader community overcome these hurdles. in doing so, we are proud to have weathered the obstacles, growing each of our businesses in a meaningful way, supporting our business partners to stay safe and strong and generating sustainable returns to our stakeholders. we are also proud to have achieved a few milestones in 2020 as we celebrated our 20th anniversary on nasdaq and completed our listing on the hong kong stock exchange. we are delighted to have seen a positive reaction from the market, especially after our dual listing in hong kong, a market that is closer to our roots.
turning to our q4 results. during the quarter, the popularity of our online games business continued with steady performances from our existing titles. net revenues from our online game services were up 15% year over year, reaching rmb 13.4 billion. our legacy titles, such as fantasy westward journey and westward journey online series, continue to resonate with players.
fwj online and new westward journey online ii once again reached record revenues in 2020, further strengthening their position as two of the china's biggest mmo titles. on the mobile side, during very effective celebrations, fwj mobile games and wwj mobile games once again reached the no. 1 and no. 2 position, respectively, on china's ios games top grossing chart.
other games launched in more recent years are also enjoying an impressive player traction with highly active core user bases. for example, life-after and invincible. following its launch in 2018, life-after has become an iconic title since reaching its initial phase of stabilization in 2019. gross billings of life-after regained its growth momentum in 2020 as we launched a couple of highly popular expansion packs, bringing avid players a series of new themes and innovative gameplay.
similarly, our slg title, invincible, remained steady in 2020 with strong user engagement in its own right amid increasing competitive marketing spend. celebrating its fifth year anniversary in october, invincible once again reached the no. 5 position on china's ios top game grossing chart. based on onmyoji, one of our flagship titles, our ip strategy has paved a smooth road for creating various ip-based, pan-entertainment productions.
as of today, the estimated value of onmyoji ip exceeds usd 10 billion, according to iresearch. since its initial blockbuster launch in 2016, we have been seamlessly growing this important ip. to date, we've introduced three onmyoji spin-off games in mobile, card and simulation genre. we have two more new spin-off games in the making, project: world, an rpg game; and onmyoji idol project, another simulation game.
on the overseas front, we continue to make solid progress. for the past four consecutive years, revenue contribution from overseas market has been growing continuously as a proportion of our overall games revenue. some of the key drivers include titles, such as knives out, life-after and identify v, all of which had a record year in 2020. japan is a key hub for the global games industry.
we deeply value these creative minds, and our success in japan has allowed us to work more closely with local partners. initial momentum in this arena includes our established collaboration with the pokã©mon company and a series of ip collaborations between knives out and other famous ip such as eva and attack on titan. we have also been more active in attracting and collaborating with local japanese r&d talent, complementary to our own, as well as opened up our own sakura studio, which focuses on building next-generation console games. 2021 is a super exciting year for us with a number of strong titles ready for launch.
we started this year with revelation mobile game, the long-anticipated mobile adaptation of its pc version, capturing both returning fans and brand-new mmo players, including a large group of female and younger players. revelation mobile game quickly became a top-ranking title on china's ios grossing chart following its launch. additionally, in january, we brought to market yu-gi-oh! duel links, a competitive car game on mobile, calling on the nostalgia of a generation of yu-gi-oh! fans. the mobile game topped china's ios downloads chart soon after its launch.
catering to the local preference, we optimized the range of items for the chinese market, including a new mode and select each new design, which are proving quite popular among our players. harry potter: magic awakened marks another game that has been long anticipated by our player community. we hope the hard work poured into making this game will do it the justice that this global ip command. featuring a blend of strategy rpg elements, players will become a hogwarts freshman.
this diversified wizard partner learns spells, gain magic knowledge and experience amazing wizardry life. we will also be bringing our next-generation slg titles, infinite lagrange and the lord of the rings: rise to war to players around the globe. infinite lagrange is a space-themed slg, where players can explore an uncharted galaxy, command and build space crafts, involve themselves in strategic battles and plan the development of their own space stations. the lord of the rings: rise to war is based on the famous trilogy.
set in a multilayered fantasy world, the game will recreate a visually stunning and completely faithful renditions with iconic characters and locations from the original masterpiece. with these two games, we look forward to extending our success in slg from china to overseas markets, where we see greater potential for this thought-provoking genre. in addition, we had a handful of other exciting titles in our pipeline, all have received license approval in china. these include elysium of legends, nightmare breaker, ghost world chronicle, diablo immortal and pokã©mon quest.
as we further enrich our game portfolio, we have been gradually broadening our skill sets in different areas of our r&d team, particularly over the past few years. our sophisticated r&d infrastructure, user-centric corporate culture and passion for games attract all kinds of talent joining us from both china and overseas. we believe our team's artistry and drive will bring to life even more great titles across diverse genres, expanding our success beyond our mmorpg world and newer successes in rpg and slg and so on. we are relentless in our drive to invest in and empower our people.
this year, we were once again the proud recipient of the atd excellence in practice award, one of the most recognized awards in the global talent development industry. to leverage the creativity of our young producers even more, we are working to further reform our games' project initiation and review mechanism to encourage more innovative ideas and give young producers more autonomy to bring their vision to fruition. in summary, 2020 has been a strong year for our online games business and for the industry. despite a high base, we are excited to see what 2021 will bring.
we look forward to introducing more titles to our users in the coming years in china and globally. turning on to our education business. youdao has witnessed the tremendous growth potential of china's online education industry over the past year. faced with an influx of need across the country, we feel more responsible than ever to ensure our students receive the best quality teaching and most effective learning possible.
youdao closed the year with an impressive quarter. total net revenue for youdao in the fourth quarter were rmb 1.1 billion, representing a 170% increase year over year. gross billings from youdao's online courses in the fourth quarter increased by 223% year over year to rmb 1.1 billion, driven by rapid growth across each segment. growth from our k-12 segment continues to lead the way, reaching a record rmb 767 million in gross billings, up 355% year over year, with k-12 paid enrollment expanding to over 659,000.
despite intense marketwide competition for user acquisition during the summer, youdao's advertising strategy promoted healthy results and was roi driven. we made sure that our unit economics and marketing spend were positive, and our advertising content was conducted responsibly for our users and our investors. in the fourth quarter, we achieved another quarter of positive operating cash flow of rmb 129 million. to meet our growth needs and ensure our teaching quality, we continue to expand our high-quality servicing team, which now comprises 240 instructors and over 3,700 tutors.
learning devices is another component of youdao that gives us a competitive edge, with a mission to make learning more efficient. they have proven to be very popular among users, generating total net revenues from learning products of rmb 237 million in the fourth quarter, a significant increase of 254% year over year. in december, we released our new dictionary pen 3.0, which features two exclusive new experiences. the tap and check function and the interactive reading function.
through the support of advanced ai technology and cooperation with multiple authorized publishing houses, it keeps learning options fresh and progressive. moving through 2021, we will continue in this vein and invest in content offerings and technology to bring our students optimal learning experiences and realize sustainable growth with compelling smart education products and services. in february, youdao raised usd 232 million through a follow-on offering. we are determined to extend youdao's competitive edge in this highly promising intelligent learning segment in china.
on to our music capabilities. netease cloud music has been in operation since 2013. based on our passion for music and our understanding of music lovers, we created a unique product and community to give our users an unprecedented music experience. seven years later, we now have more than 200,000 independent musicians and over 800 million registered users, while over 90% of them are post-90s or even younger.
in our newly launched version 8.0, we focused on bringing our young users elevated personalized experiences to express themselves. it extends the playlist-mode capabilities to videos and podcasts and offers new karaoke functions in the app. on the content side, we have witnessed some important changes in the industry. for the third time, we reached a direct nonexclusive agreement with umg.
under the new agreement framework, we can give our users wider range of benefits and choices. we further enriched our content library during the year, reaching agreements with studio ghibli, rock records and bmg, among others. most importantly, we continued our efforts to invest in and cultivate independent musicians. in 2020, approximately one million original soundtracks, music tracks, were uploaded to our platform, and the total play time of all the music tracks on our platform exceeded 300 billion.
as one of china's most influential music streaming platforms for original music, we continue to empower independent musicians, giving them the tools and audience to help them create more hit songs. in terms of monetization, we have been setting up this effort since 2019 and continued its journey in last year. as a result, during the year, we saw strong growth in all three forms: membership, live broadcasting and advertising. given our somewhat fixed cost structure, we continue to see improvements in margins as we further scale up the music business.
for yanxuan, we have firmly established its position at our private-label consumer brand, targeting young professionals who are looking for trendy, high-quality and, at the same time, affordable living. centered around this notion, we have increasingly built up our brand recognition among these target consumers. we are developing products that revolve around their needs, particularly in household products, personal care, food and pet supply. during the year, we launched a number of super-popular products with annual sales exceeding rmb 100 million.
this product popularity furthers our confidence in our design capabilities and understanding of the user needs. with the right content and product offerings, we were able to attract an increasing number of membership subscriptions in 2020. one of our main focuses moving forward is to continue improving the benefit of shopping experience we offer to these loyal customers. all in all, despite the difficulties the world has faced in 2020, we are grateful to have achieved continued growth and are standing strong in the new year.
with a solid ground regained across our online games, online education, online music and e-commerce businesses, we are poised to build on this growth in 2021. our focus on content creation and elevating users' experiences with netease products and services remains at our core. we continue to innovate, diversify and expand our reach to generate value for our users and investor communities. this concludes william's comments.
i will now provide a brief overview of our 2020 full year and fourth-quarter financial results. given the limited time on today's call, i will be presenting some abbreviated financial highlights. we encourage you to read through our press release issued earlier today for more details. total net revenues for the year were rmb 73.7 billion or usd 11.3 billion, representing a 24% increase year over year.

youdao's net revenues reached rmb 3.2 billion for 2020, up 143% year over year. on a quarterly basis, net revenue increased 170% to rmb 1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, driven by fast growth of both youdao online courses and sales of intelligent learning devices. net revenues from innovative businesses and others were rmb 15.9 billion for the full year, up 38% year over year and up 41% year over year in the fourth quarter to reach rmb 5.3 billion. this is mainly due to the increased contribution from netease cloud music, netease pc live streaming and yanxuan.
our total gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was 50.2% with the breakdown as follows: gp margin for our online gaming services was 63.1%. as a reminder, this number is generally stable with some narrow fluctuation based on the revenue mix of mobile and pc, as well as self-developed and licensed games. gross margin for youdao for the fourth quarter was 47.5%, compared to 29.8% in the same period of last year. the significant growth was primarily attributable to improved economies of scale, continuous optimization of our faculty compensation structure.
gross profit margin for innovative businesses and others was 18%, compared with 20.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019. while the margins for netease cloud music and yanxuan have improved year over year, the impact was offset by the decrease in gp margin from netease cc live streaming, which covered a longer period of the annual celebration event in 2020 compared with 2019. additionally, gross profit margin of innovative businesses and others also fluctuate based on the revenue mix of this line item. for the fourth quarter, total operating expenses were rmb 6.9 billion, 35% of the total revenue.
our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue was 15.6%, down from 18.5% in the prior quarter. the quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly due to lower marketing costs related to youdao. excluding youdao, our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 12.2%, compared with 12.9% in the prior quarter, which is relatively stable. r&d expenses were rmb 3 billion, up 9% from the previous quarter.
we remain committed to investing in content creation and product development, which is core to our future revenue growth. on a full-year basis, r&d expenses as a percentage of full-year net revenue were 14.1%, compared with 14.2% in 2019. other income loss was rmb 1.5 billion for the fourth quarter, which included a net investment loss of rmb 272 million and a net foreign exchange loss of rmb 1.8 billion due to the u.s. dollar's exchange rate continued depreciation against the rmb.
the net investment loss and the net fx loss both mainly booked loss in nature and most of them did not impact our cash flow. on a full-year basis, total net foreign exchange loss for 2020 were rmb 3.1 billion, compared with a net gain of rmb 25 million in 2019. the effective tax rate was 37.2% for the fourth quarter and 19.8% for the full year of 2020. the effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the company regarding the tax obligations and benefits applicable to it in each quarter.
non-gaap net income from continuing operations attributable to our shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2020 totaled rmb 1.6 billion or usd 244.9 million. our non-gaap diluted earnings per ads from continuing operations were rmb 2.34 or usd 0.36 for the fourth quarter of 2020. we would also like to point out, with the rapid growth of youdao, it is having a much more material impact on our netease group financials. for 2020, youdao generated total revenue of rmb 3.1 billion and a non-gaap net loss attributable to youdao's shareholders of rmb 1.7 billion, compared with net revenue of rmb 1.3 billion and non-gaap net loss of rmb 612 million in 2019.

operator, let's go to the q&a session.

[operator instructions] we will take our first question from the line of jialong shi from nomura.
jialong shi -- nomura instintet -- analyst
good evening, management. thanks for taking my question. let me ask my question first in chinese. [foreign language] how much of native's android version of mobile game revenue is contributed by third-party app stores? for this part of revenue, what is the average revenue share charged by third-party android channels? we heard from media, one of netease online gaming peers was trying to negotiate for a lower revenue share paid to the third-party app stores.
just wonder if netease has also started to talk with your channel partners about this revenue share. and if you did, how's the progress so far?
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
i'll help translating. the china has probably obviously the highest revenue-sharing ratio among all the market around the world, up to as high as 50%. it's true. a few of our native games enjoys a more favorable sharing around 30%, such as fwj, and so we think the way we are seeing in china right now is unhealthy.
and it's probably unsustainable because it's about 20% higher than how much apple is charging the content providers. and we see we'd like to see with the chinese apple partners to be more in sync with our international -- with the international peers to be charging the content providers a more reasonable rate. and we want to work very closely with our channel partners to create a healthy environment for the gaming industry.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
and jialong, to supplement your earlier part of the question. on our channel split, on the ballpark, roughly half of our game revenues were generated through ios, which, again, is only a very, very few game content providers in china can have such a high percentage contribution from ios channels, roughly one-third is coming from android channels and the remainder coming from our official channels. that's a ballpark split of the channel split.
jialong shi -- nomura instintet -- analyst
thanks for the color. 
margaret shi -- investor relations director
thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
ok. operator, the next question, please.
operator
ok. we will take our next question from the line of alex poon from morgan stanley. the line is open. please go ahead.
alex poon -- morgan stanley -- analyst
[foreign language] i'll translate myself. back in 2019, we had a revenue target -- overseas revenue target of 30%. in the following three to five years and because of covid-19, the growth, especially outside of china, has accelerated a lot. and so wondering if there is any change to this target -- revenue mix target.
would it come earlier than expected? and then secondly is i want -- i hope to get some thoughts around casual games versus hardcore games outside of china. what's -- which one do you think would be better to achieve the growth and the rois compared to the china market?
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
2021 will definitely be an important year for netease in terms of internationalization. we have a number of games we're making, such as harry potter and infinite lagrange, which are expected to be launched during the year, and we hope to see fruitful results from those games. thank you. thank you, alex.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
and, alex, on your second question -- second part of the question on our strategy of thinking of overseas game introduction. we are not betting on our future on one or two genres, but rather, we think with our stronger and getting more diversified r&d capability, we want to see multiple genres of games being introduced to different geographies and different users. so shooting game, like knives out, has been proven successful in japan. slg games, like infinite lagrange and the lord of the rings, we are confident that we can leverage our domestic success into the international market, as well as games like harry porter, which is a more casual card rpg game and others.
so i think what we want to do is to have multiple genres targeting multiple geographies and catering to multiple user needs. that is our overall direction for internationalization.
margaret shi -- investor relations director
thank you, alex. next question.
operator
we will take our next question from the line of alicia yap from citi.
alicia yap -- citi -- analyst
hi. yeah. thank you. [foreign language] my question is related to the overall growth driver for the cloud music for 2021.
was that growth mainly driven by the subscription revenue ramp or to be driven by the online advertising revenue or even the live streaming could be growing faster. and then a small related questions on the cny 1 billion video content investment initiative recently, could management share the rationale behind? and do you expect this initiative to actually revise the online advertising revenue or even further push the netease media business growth? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
yes. i'll help translating. so alicia, you're right. our -- the three main forms of monetization for music is membership, advertising and live streaming.
and one of the key focuses for music, going forward, will continue to be about creating our own content, helping independent musicians to create original content on our platforms. so in that sense, memberships will definitely be one of the key drivers to our monetization growth. in terms of radio, what was noticed is that music is about listening. but what we've noticed in the industry in china and globally is that the consumers' habits have evolved from the listening to watching, which is why short-form video platforms have become extremely popular in the regions.
yes. so when we think about making short- to mid-form video, we want to leverage our existing know-how. for example, we're interested in making short- to mid-form video centered around the games or centered around knowledge. so we have this -- we actually have one project within netease called netease information world.
so we -- during the chinese new year, we realized -- we noticed that the play time on our videos have actually increased one to two times compared to previously. so going forward, we'll continue to work on creating content on short- to medium-term mid-form video content centered around our key businesses, games, music, etc. thank you.
alicia yap -- citi -- analyst
thank you. 
margaret shi -- investor relations director
thank you, alicia. next question, please.
operator
we will take our next question from the line of alex yao from j.p. morgan.
alex yao -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
[foreign language] so my question is regarding your view on the pc gaming market. how do you think about the future outlook for this market in both domestic china market, as well as the rest of the world? and then how do you position yourself in such industry? do you still allocate new r&d resource in the pc gaming development? or you just want to strategically maintain the current pc portfolio? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
yes. the outcome from both william and junxiong our -- the mastermind behind many key titles in netease. so yes, that's something that we do care very much about pc because of unique specifications that the pc games can have and the user experience that pc games can deliver to our gamers that we'll probably continue down this road. so on one hand, we'll continue to maintain our existing titles on pcs, and we'll continue to develop new pc titles, too.
in may, we're actually going to launch a game called nightmare breaker, [inaudible] which has actually the license, is a very unique and creative pc game. and also, around the middle of the year, we are going to create -- we are going to probably going to launch another pc game called [inaudible]. and this is a competitive [inaudible] it's made by the [inaudible] standards. and william wanted to add that, in addition to our self-developed games, we actually run lots of very, very popular pc game from blizzard, such as overwatch, world of warcraft, starcraft, to name a few.
so we'll probably have the richest collection of pc games in china. and so pc will continue to be an important part of our game strategy. thank you. next question, please.
operator
we will take our next question from the line of thomas chong from jefferies. your line is open.
thomas chong -- jeff
[foreign language] thanks management for taking my questions. and the first question is regarding overseas game operations. will we consider accelerating the pace through the use of m&a or in-house development? and then my follow-up -- another question is about the regulations. can management share about their thoughts regarding the regulatory environment in online games, live streaming and music? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
in terms of the overseas expansion, we're interested in both and talked about these self-developing games and also through m&a. in terms of the self-development side, there's a number of things -- there's number of ways we can do it. for example, harry potter, this is leveraging the use of a very famous u.k. ip and using our own internal r&d to develop things for the global markets.
on m&a side, yes, we are obviously very interested in achieving greater success through collaborations with different partners around the world. we've actually -- we've always been active in -- invested in good content globally. thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
and, thomas, on your second question asking for the regulatory environment for game broadcasting and music. well, in general, we see that this is becoming more and more popular format of entertainment. so e-sports has been now qualified at the asian games, and there are rumors that it can even potentially be eligible for olympic games. it is a kind of sports for the young people, so game live streaming is important.
netease cc live streaming is building on our unique edge of self-created game content, and it is developed -- it's also been growing quite healthy and sustainably. music, obviously, is becoming an increasingly important entertainment content, and it is not only restricted to the enjoyment of our ears by listening. but just, as william previously mentioned, watching is becoming even more popular and trendy format of enjoying music as a format of entertainment content. so we think everything takes on it's -- a progressive way of developing.
but in general, the regulatory environment is also more and more encouraging for innovation and catering to the user preferences and behavior in general. so we are very confident, and we have our own plans of investing ourselves into these areas.

we will take our next question from the line of kenneth fong from crã©dit suisse.
kenneth fong -- credit suisse
[foreign language] i will translate myself. i want to ask about the pace and is there approximately timing of the launch of the few key ip, including diablo immortal, pokã©mon, as well as harry potter? would that be like spread across different quarters to avoid competition? or we will just launch it right when they are ready? thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, kenneth. for our pipeline, first of all, we are very confident and excited about our lineups for 2021, including, just now, william and junxiong just introduced a couple of exciting pc games. on the mobile side, as you have all noticed, harry porter, diablo immortal and pokã©mon now all have already received their license approvals, and all these games are developed with the intention for a global launch. so now that we have got the approval for the china part, as to the exact timing point of these game launches, we do not rush our producers and our studios.
if we are confident that these high-quality games are developed and designed for a long-anticipated longevity, then we are not overly concerned about whether launching this game in this particular month or the next. but all in all, i think we have more confidence now, given that the license approval has been obtained, that many of these highly anticipated games will be introduced to the gamer community within this year, some might be potentially as early as the first half of this year.
kenneth fong -- credit suisse

charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, margaret, and thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call. before we begin, i would like to remind everyone that all percentages are based on renminbi. we closed 2020 with a solid set of results in the fourth quarter, centered around content creation and user experience. each of our key business segments showed impressive resilience and delivered sustainable growth during the year.
we generated total net revenue of rmb 73.7 billion for the whole year, up 24% year over year, and rmb 19.8 billion in net revenues for the fourth quarter, up 26% year over year. 2020 was a challenging year for many businesses around the world. it was not a time to stand alone and survive but the time to work together and thrive. while collins dictionary has declared the word lockdown as the word of the year, we believe the word breakthrough also defined for life and career of many in the past year.
we are grateful for the initiatives our employees take to care for the impacted, to respond quickly and act responsibly, to help both of our company and the broader community overcome these hurdles. in doing so, we are proud to have weathered the obstacles, growing each of our businesses in a meaningful way, supporting our business partners to stay safe and strong and generating sustainable returns to our stakeholders. we are also proud to have achieved a few milestones in 2020 as we celebrated our 20th anniversary on nasdaq and completed our listing on the hong kong stock exchange. we are delighted to have seen a positive reaction from the market, especially after our dual listing in hong kong, a market that is closer to our roots.
turning to our q4 results. during the quarter, the popularity of our online games business continued with steady performances from our existing titles. net revenues from our online game services were up 15% year over year, reaching rmb 13.4 billion. our legacy titles, such as fantasy westward journey and westward journey online series, continue to resonate with players.
fwj online and new westward journey online ii once again reached record revenues in 2020, further strengthening their position as two of the china's biggest mmo titles. on the mobile side, during very effective celebrations, fwj mobile games and wwj mobile games once again reached the no. 1 and no. 2 position, respectively, on china's ios games top grossing chart.
other games launched in more recent years are also enjoying an impressive player traction with highly active core user bases. for example, life-after and invincible. following its launch in 2018, life-after has become an iconic title since reaching its initial phase of stabilization in 2019. gross billings of life-after regained its growth momentum in 2020 as we launched a couple of highly popular expansion packs, bringing avid players a series of new themes and innovative gameplay.
similarly, our slg title, invincible, remained steady in 2020 with strong user engagement in its own right amid increasing competitive marketing spend. celebrating its fifth year anniversary in october, invincible once again reached the no. 5 position on china's ios top game grossing chart. based on onmyoji, one of our flagship titles, our ip strategy has paved a smooth road for creating various ip-based, pan-entertainment productions.
as of today, the estimated value of onmyoji ip exceeds usd 10 billion, according to iresearch. since its initial blockbuster launch in 2016, we have been seamlessly growing this important ip. to date, we've introduced three onmyoji spin-off games in mobile, card and simulation genre. we have two more new spin-off games in the making, project: world, an rpg game; and onmyoji idol project, another simulation game.
on the overseas front, we continue to make solid progress. for the past four consecutive years, revenue contribution from overseas market has been growing continuously as a proportion of our overall games revenue. some of the key drivers include titles, such as knives out, life-after and identify v, all of which had a record year in 2020. japan is a key hub for the global games industry.
we deeply value these creative minds, and our success in japan has allowed us to work more closely with local partners. initial momentum in this arena includes our established collaboration with the pokã©mon company and a series of ip collaborations between knives out and other famous ip such as eva and attack on titan. we have also been more active in attracting and collaborating with local japanese r&d talent, complementary to our own, as well as opened up our own sakura studio, which focuses on building next-generation console games. 2021 is a super exciting year for us with a number of strong titles ready for launch.
we started this year with revelation mobile game, the long-anticipated mobile adaptation of its pc version, capturing both returning fans and brand-new mmo players, including a large group of female and younger players. revelation mobile game quickly became a top-ranking title on china's ios grossing chart following its launch. additionally, in january, we brought to market yu-gi-oh! duel links, a competitive car game on mobile, calling on the nostalgia of a generation of yu-gi-oh! fans. the mobile game topped china's ios downloads chart soon after its launch.
catering to the local preference, we optimized the range of items for the chinese market, including a new mode and select each new design, which are proving quite popular among our players. harry potter: magic awakened marks another game that has been long anticipated by our player community. we hope the hard work poured into making this game will do it the justice that this global ip command. featuring a blend of strategy rpg elements, players will become a hogwarts freshman.
this diversified wizard partner learns spells, gain magic knowledge and experience amazing wizardry life. we will also be bringing our next-generation slg titles, infinite lagrange and the lord of the rings: rise to war to players around the globe. infinite lagrange is a space-themed slg, where players can explore an uncharted galaxy, command and build space crafts, involve themselves in strategic battles and plan the development of their own space stations. the lord of the rings: rise to war is based on the famous trilogy.
set in a multilayered fantasy world, the game will recreate a visually stunning and completely faithful renditions with iconic characters and locations from the original masterpiece. with these two games, we look forward to extending our success in slg from china to overseas markets, where we see greater potential for this thought-provoking genre. in addition, we had a handful of other exciting titles in our pipeline, all have received license approval in china. these include elysium of legends, nightmare breaker, ghost world chronicle, diablo immortal and pokã©mon quest.
as we further enrich our game portfolio, we have been gradually broadening our skill sets in different areas of our r&d team, particularly over the past few years. our sophisticated r&d infrastructure, user-centric corporate culture and passion for games attract all kinds of talent joining us from both china and overseas. we believe our team's artistry and drive will bring to life even more great titles across diverse genres, expanding our success beyond our mmorpg world and newer successes in rpg and slg and so on. we are relentless in our drive to invest in and empower our people.
this year, we were once again the proud recipient of the atd excellence in practice award, one of the most recognized awards in the global talent development industry. to leverage the creativity of our young producers even more, we are working to further reform our games' project initiation and review mechanism to encourage more innovative ideas and give young producers more autonomy to bring their vision to fruition. in summary, 2020 has been a strong year for our online games business and for the industry. despite a high base, we are excited to see what 2021 will bring.
we look forward to introducing more titles to our users in the coming years in china and globally. turning on to our education business. youdao has witnessed the tremendous growth potential of china's online education industry over the past year. faced with an influx of need across the country, we feel more responsible than ever to ensure our students receive the best quality teaching and most effective learning possible.
youdao closed the year with an impressive quarter. total net revenue for youdao in the fourth quarter were rmb 1.1 billion, representing a 170% increase year over year. gross billings from youdao's online courses in the fourth quarter increased by 223% year over year to rmb 1.1 billion, driven by rapid growth across each segment. growth from our k-12 segment continues to lead the way, reaching a record rmb 767 million in gross billings, up 355% year over year, with k-12 paid enrollment expanding to over 659,000.
despite intense marketwide competition for user acquisition during the summer, youdao's advertising strategy promoted healthy results and was roi driven. we made sure that our unit economics and marketing spend were positive, and our advertising content was conducted responsibly for our users and our investors. in the fourth quarter, we achieved another quarter of positive operating cash flow of rmb 129 million. to meet our growth needs and ensure our teaching quality, we continue to expand our high-quality servicing team, which now comprises 240 instructors and over 3,700 tutors.
learning devices is another component of youdao that gives us a competitive edge, with a mission to make learning more efficient. they have proven to be very popular among users, generating total net revenues from learning products of rmb 237 million in the fourth quarter, a significant increase of 254% year over year. in december, we released our new dictionary pen 3.0, which features two exclusive new experiences. the tap and check function and the interactive reading function.

on to our music capabilities. netease cloud music has been in operation since 2013. based on our passion for music and our understanding of music lovers, we created a unique product and community to give our users an unprecedented music experience. seven years later, we now have more than 200,000 independent musicians and over 800 million registered users, while over 90% of them are post-90s or even younger.
in our newly launched version 8.0, we focused on bringing our young users elevated personalized experiences to express themselves. it extends the playlist-mode capabilities to videos and podcasts and offers new karaoke functions in the app. on the content side, we have witnessed some important changes in the industry. for the third time, we reached a direct nonexclusive agreement with umg.
under the new agreement framework, we can give our users wider range of benefits and choices. we further enriched our content library during the year, reaching agreements with studio ghibli, rock records and bmg, among others. most importantly, we continued our efforts to invest in and cultivate independent musicians. in 2020, approximately one million original soundtracks, music tracks, were uploaded to our platform, and the total play time of all the music tracks on our platform exceeded 300 billion.
as one of china's most influential music streaming platforms for original music, we continue to empower independent musicians, giving them the tools and audience to help them create more hit songs. in terms of monetization, we have been setting up this effort since 2019 and continued its journey in last year. as a result, during the year, we saw strong growth in all three forms: membership, live broadcasting and advertising. given our somewhat fixed cost structure, we continue to see improvements in margins as we further scale up the music business.
for yanxuan, we have firmly established its position at our private-label consumer brand, targeting young professionals who are looking for trendy, high-quality and, at the same time, affordable living. centered around this notion, we have increasingly built up our brand recognition among these target consumers. we are developing products that revolve around their needs, particularly in household products, personal care, food and pet supply. during the year, we launched a number of super-popular products with annual sales exceeding rmb 100 million.
this product popularity furthers our confidence in our design capabilities and understanding of the user needs. with the right content and product offerings, we were able to attract an increasing number of membership subscriptions in 2020. one of our main focuses moving forward is to continue improving the benefit of shopping experience we offer to these loyal customers. all in all, despite the difficulties the world has faced in 2020, we are grateful to have achieved continued growth and are standing strong in the new year.
with a solid ground regained across our online games, online education, online music and e-commerce businesses, we are poised to build on this growth in 2021. our focus on content creation and elevating users' experiences with netease products and services remains at our core. we continue to innovate, diversify and expand our reach to generate value for our users and investor communities. this concludes william's comments.
i will now provide a brief overview of our 2020 full year and fourth-quarter financial results. given the limited time on today's call, i will be presenting some abbreviated financial highlights. we encourage you to read through our press release issued earlier today for more details. total net revenues for the year were rmb 73.7 billion or usd 11.3 billion, representing a 24% increase year over year.
net revenues for the fourth quarter were rmb 19.8 billion or usd 3 billion, representing a 26% increase year over year. for 2020, our net revenues from online game services were rmb 54.6 billion, up 18% from 2019, and rmb 13.4 billion for the fourth quarter, up 15% year over year. year-over-year increases were primarily due to the increased revenue contribution from fantasy westward journey h5, sky, life-after and invincible, as well as pc client games, such as fantasy westward journey online in the fourth quarter. net revenues from our mobile games accounted for approximately 72.4% of net revenues from online games in the fourth quarter.
youdao's net revenues reached rmb 3.2 billion for 2020, up 143% year over year. on a quarterly basis, net revenue increased 170% to rmb 1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, driven by fast growth of both youdao online courses and sales of intelligent learning devices. net revenues from innovative businesses and others were rmb 15.9 billion for the full year, up 38% year over year and up 41% year over year in the fourth quarter to reach rmb 5.3 billion. this is mainly due to the increased contribution from netease cloud music, netease pc live streaming and yanxuan.
our total gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was 50.2% with the breakdown as follows: gp margin for our online gaming services was 63.1%. as a reminder, this number is generally stable with some narrow fluctuation based on the revenue mix of mobile and pc, as well as self-developed and licensed games. gross margin for youdao for the fourth quarter was 47.5%, compared to 29.8% in the same period of last year. the significant growth was primarily attributable to improved economies of scale, continuous optimization of our faculty compensation structure.
gross profit margin for innovative businesses and others was 18%, compared with 20.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019. while the margins for netease cloud music and yanxuan have improved year over year, the impact was offset by the decrease in gp margin from netease cc live streaming, which covered a longer period of the annual celebration event in 2020 compared with 2019. additionally, gross profit margin of innovative businesses and others also fluctuate based on the revenue mix of this line item. for the fourth quarter, total operating expenses were rmb 6.9 billion, 35% of the total revenue.
our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue was 15.6%, down from 18.5% in the prior quarter. the quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly due to lower marketing costs related to youdao. excluding youdao, our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 12.2%, compared with 12.9% in the prior quarter, which is relatively stable. r&d expenses were rmb 3 billion, up 9% from the previous quarter.
we remain committed to investing in content creation and product development, which is core to our future revenue growth. on a full-year basis, r&d expenses as a percentage of full-year net revenue were 14.1%, compared with 14.2% in 2019. other income loss was rmb 1.5 billion for the fourth quarter, which included a net investment loss of rmb 272 million and a net foreign exchange loss of rmb 1.8 billion due to the u.s. dollar's exchange rate continued depreciation against the rmb.
the net investment loss and the net fx loss both mainly booked loss in nature and most of them did not impact our cash flow. on a full-year basis, total net foreign exchange loss for 2020 were rmb 3.1 billion, compared with a net gain of rmb 25 million in 2019. the effective tax rate was 37.2% for the fourth quarter and 19.8% for the full year of 2020. the effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the company regarding the tax obligations and benefits applicable to it in each quarter.
non-gaap net income from continuing operations attributable to our shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2020 totaled rmb 1.6 billion or usd 244.9 million. our non-gaap diluted earnings per ads from continuing operations were rmb 2.34 or usd 0.36 for the fourth quarter of 2020. we would also like to point out, with the rapid growth of youdao, it is having a much more material impact on our netease group financials. for 2020, youdao generated total revenue of rmb 3.1 billion and a non-gaap net loss attributable to youdao's shareholders of rmb 1.7 billion, compared with net revenue of rmb 1.3 billion and non-gaap net loss of rmb 612 million in 2019.
our cash position remains strong. as of end of 2020, our total cash and cash equivalents, current and noncurrent client deposits and short-term investment balance totaled rmb 100.1 billion, compared with rmb 74.4 billion as of the end of 2019. in accordance with our dividend policy, we are pleased to report that our board of directors has approved a dividend of usd 0.012 per share or usd 0.06 per ads. as a reminder, we changed our ads ratio on october 1 from one ads for every 25 ordinary shares to one ads for every five ordinary shares.
and finally, under our current share repurchase program for up to usd 2 billion, as of december 31, 2020, approximately 21.1 million ads has been repurchased under this program for a total cost of usd 1.6 billion. on february 25, 2021, our board announced the approval of a new share repurchase program for up to usd 2.2 billion of our outstanding ads and ordinary shares for the next 24 months, beginning on march 2, 2021. thank you for your attention. we would like now to open the call to your questions.

operator
thank you, sir. [operator instructions] we'll take our first question from alex poon with morgan stanley.
alex poon -- morgan stanley -- analyst
[foreign language] my question is regarding the press release. we have mentioned these big titles, harry potter, lord of the rings, diablo immortal will be coming in the next few months -- in the coming months. so i'd like to understand about the launch schedule and details around these three big titles. thank you very much.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, alex. i'll answer your question directly in english. we do have very, very strong visibility and confidence for a rich pipeline, including highly anticipated games like harry potter, lord of the rings, diablo immortal, and a few others that i mentioned just now. and many of these games have already obtained the license approvals already from the regulators.
most of these games will be launched in the second half of this year. in fact, two days later, on our annual gala game day, may 20 event, we will be disclosing more details, existing games, as well as some of the exciting new titles. i would encourage you and the investor community to join our event online to get more details just in two days' time. so a little bit more patience, please. 
alex poon -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you, charles. [foreign language]
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from jialong shi with nomura.
jialong shi -- nomura -- analyst
thanks. good evening, management. thanks for taking my question. i will ask my question first in chinese.
i will translate myself later. [foreign language] so, i will translate my questions. in recent years, there have been some independent game studios which were able to launch very successful self-developed titles. just like netease, these new game studios also published their games on their own instead of going through third-party publishers.
so my question is, do you think in china's mobile gaming space, the competition is becoming more intense? and if that is the case, how does netease plan to cope with the challenges from these small but quite competitive game studios?
charles yang -- chief financial officer
[foreign language] ok.
margaret shi -- investor relations director
you -- the companies that you mentioned have had great success in the recent years. it means that the overall environment for creativity, especially in games, is very good in china. netease, we have been a business for over 20 years. we will continue to innovate to thrive.
and we are happy, you know, with -- for the success that the smaller gaming companies have achieved. and we will, you know -- and we will continue to rise and continue to exceed. thank you. thank you.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from thomas chong with jefferies.
thomas chong -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, management. thanks for taking my questions. can you comment about our online user strategies, in particular, subscription and live streaming? and any thoughts about the long-form audio strategies? [foreign language]
charles yang -- chief financial officer
yeah. thomas, do you want to translate your question in english? ok. thomas, i will answer your question directly in english. yes, there are -- as we've been mentioning in the past couple of quarters, there are plenty of possibilities in terms of product innovation, in terms of monetization streams that centered around this music vertical.
and we are very encouraged to see strong continued and robust growth in both subscription, live streaming, advertising, and new possibilities as we continue to innovate and try out. so right now, netease cloud music, despite the fact that it's been eight years old now, it is still in its relatively early nascent stage. so lots of possibilities. revenue growth in the multiple formats that you mentioned have all been very strong.
and specifically, you asked about long format audio. that's a very important vertical. in fact, we are a forerunner and the pioneer in this particular long-format audio. majority of our live streaming revenues actually come from long-format audio.
and there are more players that's been following suit and coming into this vertical. it has just proven one more time that how the potential upside of this vertical. and i think netease cloud music, just like many other product lines under the netease brand umbrella, will focus on unique product features powered by product innovations, targets specifically to this vibrant, younger generation of music enthusiasts. with that, we are actually very confident on multiple fronts both in terms of product features, as well as monetization potential.
thomas?
margaret shi -- investor relations director
thank you. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you. thank you, ma'am. [operator instructions] we'll take our next question from eddie leung with bank of america.
eddie leung -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
[foreign language] so my question is actually a bit of a follow-up on the game industry. so number one, congratulations on the continuous success of fantasy westward journey and westward journey series. but it seems to be interesting to observe that globally, no matter whether it's a successful pc mobile or console game developers, it seems to be relying, to some extent, new versions or new games on some of the old ips. while actually some of the new companies are able to come up with big iconic ips.
so just wondering, as a leading global game company, you know, how we think about this kind of like issue. and is there any indication when we developed our game strategy? thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
yeah. we do not entirely agree with your comments. we think, obviously, you know, it's important for new companies to create new ip, new titles. well, we think more importantly, it's the longtime -- long-term operation of good flagship titles.
as from netease's perspective, we will continue to do what we are doing. over the past years, we've launched a number of very great, you know, innovative, industry-leading titles, including onmyoji, justice, and naraka: bladepoint to name a few. so we think -- we will continue to do what we are doing and to create a new game, as well as maintaining a long-term stability of our existing title. thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
and, eddie, just to add one more point. as you can witness in the past couple of quarters when there are fewer new game launched in a particular quarter or two, netease's financial performance has been steady. it is again something we talked earlier in the past. netease is a very, very unique combination of continuous innovation to come up with new titles, as well as the operational know-how to extend the longevity and effective monetization of the old titles.
it is because of this combination that we are able to deliver very steady and gradually improving financial profile for over two decades. 
eddie leung -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i guess that's very true. [foreign language] thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we'll take our next question from alicia yap with citi. 
alicia yap -- citigroup -- analyst
hi. [foreign language] thank you for taking my questions. my question is related to the cloud music. so with netease now currently signing directly with all the three major music label, would that change the overall attractiveness of the content selection for user? and also, would that help on driving the music subscription growth? any material change on the gross margin impact? and also, can management elaborate the music strategy into the iot partnership? any interest that you are or extending the partnership with the oem? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language] 
margaret shi -- investor relations director
as the streaming platform or social committee for music enthusiasts, you know, netease cloud music is actively -- have always been actively seeking partnerships with content providers or label companies in order to help them promote their music in china. that's answered the first question. and in terms of iot or furnishing -- or home furnishing, again, this is another important growth area for netease cloud music. thank you.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from elsie cheng with goldman sachs. 
elsie cheng -- goldman sachs -- analyst
[foreign language] good evening, william, [inaudible], and margaret. my first question is about international games. we noticed that there were a lot of coming titles for this year, and it seems that for different international markets, we actually have different genres. that's the first of the key points to touch base with the audiences over there.
so just want to follow up a little bit more here that when we think of different international markets, do we actually have the sort of differentiated competitive strategy? and then, you know, if you have any further like a detailed color on how we're positioning ourselves, that will be great. and then the second question is innovative businesses. and we noticed the seasonal fluctuation in contribution to the revenue of the innovative businesses. fourth quarter could be a good -- yeah, sorry, the quarter where, you know, maybe e-commerce is contributing more, and then first quarter is low.
i just want to understand a bit more. so, you know, in terms of the growth curve of the two major lines. one is e-commerce, one is the cloud music. how would we describe the growth curve and where they are currently on that growth curve for this two? and in the long term, do we have any targets for them to sort of potentially become another major growth driver for the company? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language] 
margaret shi -- investor relations director
yes. we do have -- we have noticed that, you know, there are -- because they're different culture and different devices that's used by users in -- at -- in different parts of the world, we need very different products targeted to particular regions and countries that resonate with the users there. you know, and then we are confident we will figure this out. for example, in japan, we have -- we already have a number of very successful titles, including knives out, identity v, lifeafter.
recently, we have launched a new pc game, naraka: bladepoint on team, and that has been performing -- that has resonated very well with the users this during the testing phase. it's a melee combat type of game based on oriental chinese martial arts, and we will really supply -- we are -- and we're very pleased to see that it has responded well by global users. thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
and, elsie, for your second question, i'll answer that directly in english. our new -- newer businesses, whether it's online education, online music, netease yanxuan, all of them are in relatively younger phase comparing to our game businesses. so by and large, we think these younger business verticals have a very promising growth trajectory. they should grow faster than main game view in general.
when you look at each quarter, however, different views might experience different seasonality. for instance, q1 is a traditional peak season for game performance specifically because of the chinese new year, whereas it's a relatively low season, for instance, for e-commerce. likewise, education also witnessed a strong seasonality in the different semester courses throughout the calendar year. so all in all, don't be overly concerned about a quarterly fluctuation.
but generally speaking, when you look at on the annual trends basis, for instance, my innovative businesses and others line, as well as my youdao, in 2020, both lines has been growing very strong and much faster than my online game services. what we want to achieve down the road eventually is that all of our deeply incubated and cultivated verticals will have very a robust and sustainable growth. and as they continue to grow and emerge, what we want to appeal to the users is what netease holds in common a premium product and services offerings with elevated user experience. that is the corporate dna in common across the board.
ok. operator, next question, please.

operator
good day, and welcome to the netease 2021 first-quarter earnings conference call. today's conference is being recorded. at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to margaret shi, ir director of netease. please go ahead. 
margaret shi -- investor relations director
thank you, operator. please note, the discussion today will contain forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of the company and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability as established by the u.s. private securities litigation reform act. such statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors.
some of these risks are beyond the company's control and could cause actual results to differ materially from those mentioned in today's press release and this discussion. a general discussion of the risk factors that could cause netease business and financial results are included in certain filings of the company with the securities and exchange commission, including its annual report on form 20-f and the announcement of the filings on the website of hong kong stock exchange. the company does not undertake any obligation to update this forward-looking information, except as required by law. during today's call, management will also discuss certain non-gaap financial measures for comparison purposes only.

william ding, our chief executive officer; and mr. charles yang, our chief financial officer. i will now turn the call over to charles, who will read the prepared remarks on behalf of william. 
charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, margaret. and thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call. before we begin, i would like to remind everyone that all percentages are based on renminbi. we began the year with a record quarter exceeding rmb20 billion in revenue for the first time and net income attributable to the company's shareholders increased 25% year over year to rmb4.4 billion.
our games business also reached a new record of our rmb15 billion in net revenues, up 11% year over year in the first quarter despite a higher comparable base last year. in q1, our flagship titles continued to demonstrate strong growth after nearly two decades of operation with revenues from fantasy westward journey online and westward journey online mobile, all growing at double-digit rates year over year. tianxia iii is another exemplary case. it is one of the rare instances where a legacy pc mmorpg game has regained growth after reaching maturity.
leveraging our growing knowledge in more recent successes in both mmo and non-mmo genres, we added some casual flavors to this legacy mmorpg, giving our players a fresh feel and creating new content for users to consume and enjoy. we also crafted an in-game event at the end of last year, which quickly generated strong interest and discussion in the players' circle, leading to a large inflow of returning users who rejoin the game. other games in the spotlight during the first quarter included life-after, onmyoji, identity v, and invincible. life-after has remained an iconic title with strong appeal among young users.
the new collaboration with the movie godzilla vs. kong in the first quarter was well-received by players as they fought off doomsday monsters. onmyoji also showed remarkable longevity remaining at the forefront of china's ios top-grossing chart. during the first quarter, we wrote out a highly anticipated ip collaboration with demon slayer, a classic japanese anime, further strengthening up onmyoji's position as a top acg game in china.
celebrating its third-year anniversary in april, identity v continues to draw the attention of young players bringing them a thrilling competitive experience with a distinctive gothic art style. between january to may, we hosted our annual global championship tournament, call of the abyss, with its finale being set in guangzhou, attracting close to 2 million game players globally to participate in this event. invincible remains steady in the first quarter with strong user engagement holding unwavering loyalty from its fan community. despite numerous invincible-like games popping up in the market, invincible has proven to be a trendsetting pioneer in this game genre.
this also echoes well with our corporate dna in product innovation. in terms of new games, we have launched a few new ones since the beginning of this year. we started with revelation mobile game in january. as we discussed last quarter, this is our self-developed rpg game based on our flagship pc title capturing both returning fans and brand new mmo players.
we then launched elysium of legends in march, our self-developed card rpg game that brings together legendary figures in chinese history. shortly after these releases, those games reached the top of the ios download chart in china. on the licensed front, in january, we introduced yu-gi-oh! duel links, a competitive card game based on the most nostalgic ip that we licensed from konami. and more recently in may, we brought the highly anticipated casual game pokemon quest through our domestic audience, featuring cute-shaped pokemon.
the game invites players could befriend and create their pokemon team to tap and battle through tumblecube island. shortly after its release, pokemon quest quickly climbed to the top of the ios downloads chart in china. in the overseas market, we continued our efforts to expand our offerings while maintaining the steady operation of our existing titles. knives out, once again, reached the no.
1 spot on japan's ios top-grossing chart a couple of times during the first quarter. following a collaboration with well-known japanese ip, the promised neverland, in february, identity v was also crowned no. 2 on japan's ios top-grossing chart. the success of these games has helped us to gain a much better understanding of japanese users and their preferences, allowing us to be more sophisticated in localization efforts.
for instance, we found that japanese users greatly value the sense of occasion. users want to feel the grandness and ceremonial appeal in each game event, take knives out as an example. knives out day, the widely anticipated annual celebration officially recognized by the japanese anniversary association since 2019 marked the start of the game's annual carnival on may the 5th, which includes the biggest youth sports championship tournament in japan as well as other exciting activities. we invited all of our users, brought millions of them online on that day and the event has become one of the top-trending topics on twitter in japan for the past two years.
with a couple of titles gaining popularity and recognition already in the overseas markets today, we are hopeful that our upcoming releases will bring the next generation of games to the world stage and to further expand our footprint in more regions particularly in the u.s. and europe. in april, we launched infinite lagrange in europe. similar to invincible, we expect infinite lagrange, our first globally targeted slg game, to ramp up its revenue gradually and show a similar upwards trend and longevity with time.
this game will be next available in the u.s. and other overseas markets over the coming months. as our very first next-gen slg, we have it under development for a number of years. we hope that this title will extend our success in slg into overseas markets.
the highly anticipated harry potter: magic awakened is also on track to meet eager audiences. we are thrilled to bring this game to wizard fans soon, taking players around the world on a magical adventure. earlier this month, we announced that we join hands with our polish partner,11 bit studios, to develop and publish the mobile version of the world-renowned ip, frostpunk, globally. later this year, players will be able to access this elaborately crafted post-apocalypse social survival game on mobile platforms.
in addition, we have a handful of other exciting titles in our pipeline. adding to those we just mentioned, our pipeline also includes the lord of the rings: rise to war, nightmare breaker, diablo immortal, and ghost world chronicle. for more details on these titles, please join our annual product launch event on may 20th, two days later, which will be hosted online this year and will have a dedicated english section for our global game players and business partners for the first time. we are proud of our world-class r&d infrastructure, which has been pivotal in maintaining a competitive edge in this market and delivering long-term value.
the most important element is our people. with that in mind, we encourage our talent to share and exchange ideas with industry veterans worldwide. we just hosted the 2021 netease game developers summit in april with a three-day forum covering topics like game design, arts, and technology. the event brought together our internal developers as well as external industrial partners including gurus in the western game industry and developers community to share their vast game development philosophies and experiences, sparking wide attention from developers, game players, and many others in the industry.
now turning to our education business, youdao achieved strong and sustainable growth in the first quarter. total net revenues from youdao increased by 147% year over year to rmb1.3 billion. and overall gross margin significantly improved to 57%, reaching a new record since its ipo back in 2019. gross billings from the youdao k-12 segment were up 130% year over year despite a high base last year due to the outbreak of covid-19.
k-12 paid student enrollment double year over year to 306,000. in order to match the growing scale and ensure the optimum teaching quality, we continue to strengthen our servicing team, which comprises 197 instructors and over 4,000 well-trained tutors by the end of the first quarter. given that different syllabus is used in different parts of china, one of the most important agenda for us is to ensure localized content for courses we offer. we took our junior high school chinese as the pilot case.
during the past spring semester, we launched up to 31 versions of junior high school chinese, meeting the needs of students in 31 different provinces. the localized courses have turned out to be very effective and very welcomed by our students. net revenue of youdao's learning devices also continued a year-over-year growth of 280%. in march, we introduced a dictionary pen 3.0 pro version, further supporting bilingual translation of chinese and korean languages to meet the demand of a wider range of language learners.
youdao also further integrated the functions of our dictionary pen and youdao dictionary app, making the offline-online transition even more efficient and effortless. looking and heading to 2021, we are confident that youdao will continue to grow its position as a leading provider of intelligent learning services and products, and our diversified business models, products, and technologies will give us the upper hand in the evolving after-school tutoring and test market. for our cloud music business, we have come a long way. celebrating its eighth-year anniversary last month, we are proud to say that we have sought and created new possibilities for music in this digital era.
our platform, which features a vast and highly interactive content community has become a widely recognized household name that is seen as a cultural emblem among, particularly, the post-90s or younger generation. with a large base of young music lovers on our platform, we are more willing to explore and discover music. we have been the creative outlet and a natural stage for independent musicians to shine. we strongly believe independent artists as a crucial driving force for the music industry and our platform uniquely positions us to nurture them in the modern era.
in april, we held our annual signature event, the indie music artists ceremony for the third time, celebrating the past year of their music and encouraging independent musicians to continue creating their remarkable work. in addition to our original music, we want to continue bringing together a library of new, unique, and influential music pieces from around the world and providing music fans with the ultimate audio experience. we have just announced a direct digital distribution partnership with sony music entertainment, one of the world's three largest recording companies. following you umg, this is the second direct licensing arrangement we have signed with the big three labels and we are proud to see these positive changes happening in the music industry in china.
moving on to yanxuan, as a private-label consumer brand, we further strengthened our brand appeal among the young middle class, developing products that revolve around their need. centered around this notion and along with yanxuan's fifth-year anniversary, we developed a new value proposition ""live the way you like"" through a promotion intended to express the voice of the new middle class. this campaign resonated strongly with its intended audience, sparking lively discussions. during the last year, we rolled out a range of highly popular yanxuan products, which have sold well since their introduction.
our strategy to incubate more hit products has paved a smooth path for us to strengthen yanxuan's product portfolio. we recently introduced a number of new-style products such as our proprietary laundry pods, wireless earbuds, bathroom fragrance, which quickly became top-selling products on multiple platforms, and some of the most recognized products in those emerging categories. we see potential in many of our proprietary products and we are working to introduce a greater number of signature products this year. additionally, we continued to optimize our operating efficiency in the first quarter.
during the quarter, both our inventory turnover days and the fulfillment efficiency were improving. in summary, we are off to a strong start in 2021. our game portfolio is getting ready for exciting new titles for both domestic and global players, while our existing games continue to hold strong. our online education, music, and e-commerce businesses are each on solid footing as well.
premium and diverse content creation across our businesses continues to be our primary objective as we move forward, entering a new phase of growth and generating additional value for all of our users and stakeholders. this concludes william's comments. i will now provide a very brief overview of our first-quarter 2021 financial results. given the limited time on today's call, i will be presenting some abbreviated financial highlights.
we encourage you to read through our press release issued earlier today for further details. total net revenues for the first quarter were rmb20.5 billion or us$3.1 billion, representing a 20% increase year over year. our net revenues from online game services were rmb15 billion, up 11% year over year. this year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased revenue contribution from the newly launched revelation mobile game, fantasy westward journey h5, as well as pc games such as fantasy westward journey online.
net revenues from our mobile games accounted for approximately 73% of net revenues from online game services in the first quarter. youdao's net revenues reached rmb1.3 billion, up 148% year over year, driven by the fast growth of both its online courses and sales of intelligent learning devices. net revenues from innovative businesses and others were rmb4.2 billion for the first quarter, up 40% year over year, mainly due to increased contribution from netease cloud music, as well as yanxuan and cc live streaming. our total gross profit margin was 53.9% in the first quarter with a breakdown as follows.
gp margin for our online game services was 64.6%. as a reminder, this number is generally stable with some narrow fluctuation based on the revenue mix of mobile and pc titles, as well as self-developed and licensed games. gross margin for youdao was 57.3%, compared with 43.5% in the same period of last year. the significant growth was primarily attributable to the improved gross margin from learning services due to the economies of scale and the continuous optimization effort of its cost structure.
it is also due to the substantial sales growth of the smart learning hardware such as youdao dictionary pen, which carries a higher gross margin than other hardware product lines. gp margin for innovative businesses and others was 14.4%, compared with 15.8% in the first quarter of last year. while the margins for netease cloud music and yanxuan have improved year over year significantly, the impact was partially offset by the decrease in gp margin from the rest of the business segment in this line. for the first quarter, total operating expenses were rmb6.8 billion, representing 33% of the total net revenues.
our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue were 13.5% in the quarter. excluding youdao, our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue was below 10%, lower than the previous quarters. as a reminder, fluctuation in selling and marketing as a percentage of revenue largely depends on the number of new games' launches in a particular quarter, the genre they are in, and the most suitable marketing plans adopted for each new game launches. r&d expenses were rmb3.1 billion, largely stable from the previous quarter.
we remain committed to investing in content creation and product development, which is core to our revenue growth. as a percentage of net revenue, r&d expenses were 14.9%, compared with 15.3% last quarter. effective tax rate in this quarter was 22%. the effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the company regarding the tax obligations and benefits applicable to it in each quarter.
non-gaap net income attributable to our shareholders for the first quarter totaled rmb5.1 billion or us$776 million. our non-gaap basic earnings per ads were rmb7.58 or us$1.16. our cash position remains strong. as of the quarter-end, our total cash and cash equivalents, current and noncurrent time deposits, and short-term investment balance totaled rmb106 billion, compared with rmb100 billion as of the year-end last year.
in accordance with our dividend policy, we are very pleased to report that our board of directors has approved a dividend of us$0.06 per share or us$0.3 per ads. lastly, under the share repurchase program approved by our board, approximately 3 million ads have been repurchased in the first quarter for a total cost of approximately us$330 million. thank you for your attention. we would like now to open the call to your questions.
operator, please go ahead to q&a.

thank you, sir. [operator instructions] we'll take our first question from alex poon with morgan stanley.
alex poon -- morgan stanley -- analyst
[foreign language] my question is regarding the press release. we have mentioned these big titles, harry potter, lord of the rings, diablo immortal will be coming in the next few months -- in the coming months. so i'd like to understand about the launch schedule and details around these three big titles. thank you very much.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, alex. i'll answer your question directly in english. we do have very, very strong visibility and confidence for a rich pipeline, including highly anticipated games like harry potter, lord of the rings, diablo immortal, and a few others that i mentioned just now. and many of these games have already obtained the license approvals already from the regulators.
most of these games will be launched in the second half of this year. in fact, two days later, on our annual gala game day, may 20 event, we will be disclosing more details, existing games, as well as some of the exciting new titles. i would encourage you and the investor community to join our event online to get more details just in two days' time. so a little bit more patience, please. 
alex poon -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you, charles. [foreign language]
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from jialong shi with nomura.
jialong shi -- nomura -- analyst
thanks. good evening, management. thanks for taking my question. i will ask my question first in chinese.
i will translate myself later. [foreign language] so, i will translate my questions. in recent years, there have been some independent game studios which were able to launch very successful self-developed titles. just like netease, these new game studios also published their games on their own instead of going through third-party publishers.
so my question is, do you think in china's mobile gaming space, the competition is becoming more intense? and if that is the case, how does netease plan to cope with the challenges from these small but quite competitive game studios?
charles yang -- chief financial officer
[foreign language] ok.
margaret shi -- investor relations director
you -- the companies that you mentioned have had great success in the recent years. it means that the overall environment for creativity, especially in games, is very good in china. netease, we have been a business for over 20 years. we will continue to innovate to thrive.
and we are happy, you know, with -- for the success that the smaller gaming companies have achieved. and we will, you know -- and we will continue to rise and continue to exceed. thank you. thank you.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from thomas chong with jefferies.
thomas chong -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, management. thanks for taking my questions. can you comment about our online user strategies, in particular, subscription and live streaming? and any thoughts about the long-form audio strategies? [foreign language]
charles yang -- chief financial officer
yeah. thomas, do you want to translate your question in english? ok. thomas, i will answer your question directly in english. yes, there are -- as we've been mentioning in the past couple of quarters, there are plenty of possibilities in terms of product innovation, in terms of monetization streams that centered around this music vertical.
and we are very encouraged to see strong continued and robust growth in both subscription, live streaming, advertising, and new possibilities as we continue to innovate and try out. so right now, netease cloud music, despite the fact that it's been eight years old now, it is still in its relatively early nascent stage. so lots of possibilities. revenue growth in the multiple formats that you mentioned have all been very strong.
and specifically, you asked about long format audio. that's a very important vertical. in fact, we are a forerunner and the pioneer in this particular long-format audio. majority of our live streaming revenues actually come from long-format audio.
and there are more players that's been following suit and coming into this vertical. it has just proven one more time that how the potential upside of this vertical. and i think netease cloud music, just like many other product lines under the netease brand umbrella, will focus on unique product features powered by product innovations, targets specifically to this vibrant, younger generation of music enthusiasts. with that, we are actually very confident on multiple fronts both in terms of product features, as well as monetization potential.
thomas?
margaret shi -- investor relations director
thank you. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you. thank you, ma'am. [operator instructions] we'll take our next question from eddie leung with bank of america.
eddie leung -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
[foreign language] so my question is actually a bit of a follow-up on the game industry. so number one, congratulations on the continuous success of fantasy westward journey and westward journey series. but it seems to be interesting to observe that globally, no matter whether it's a successful pc mobile or console game developers, it seems to be relying, to some extent, new versions or new games on some of the old ips. while actually some of the new companies are able to come up with big iconic ips.
so just wondering, as a leading global game company, you know, how we think about this kind of like issue. and is there any indication when we developed our game strategy? thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
yeah. we do not entirely agree with your comments. we think, obviously, you know, it's important for new companies to create new ip, new titles. well, we think more importantly, it's the longtime -- long-term operation of good flagship titles.
as from netease's perspective, we will continue to do what we are doing. over the past years, we've launched a number of very great, you know, innovative, industry-leading titles, including onmyoji, justice, and naraka: bladepoint to name a few. so we think -- we will continue to do what we are doing and to create a new game, as well as maintaining a long-term stability of our existing title. thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
and, eddie, just to add one more point. as you can witness in the past couple of quarters when there are fewer new game launched in a particular quarter or two, netease's financial performance has been steady. it is again something we talked earlier in the past. netease is a very, very unique combination of continuous innovation to come up with new titles, as well as the operational know-how to extend the longevity and effective monetization of the old titles.
it is because of this combination that we are able to deliver very steady and gradually improving financial profile for over two decades. 
eddie leung -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i guess that's very true. [foreign language] thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we'll take our next question from alicia yap with citi. 
alicia yap -- citigroup -- analyst
hi. [foreign language] thank you for taking my questions. my question is related to the cloud music. so with netease now currently signing directly with all the three major music label, would that change the overall attractiveness of the content selection for user? and also, would that help on driving the music subscription growth? any material change on the gross margin impact? and also, can management elaborate the music strategy into the iot partnership? any interest that you are or extending the partnership with the oem? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language] 
margaret shi -- investor relations director
as the streaming platform or social committee for music enthusiasts, you know, netease cloud music is actively -- have always been actively seeking partnerships with content providers or label companies in order to help them promote their music in china. that's answered the first question. and in terms of iot or furnishing -- or home furnishing, again, this is another important growth area for netease cloud music. thank you.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from elsie cheng with goldman sachs. 
elsie cheng -- goldman sachs -- analyst
[foreign language] good evening, william, [inaudible], and margaret. my first question is about international games. we noticed that there were a lot of coming titles for this year, and it seems that for different international markets, we actually have different genres. that's the first of the key points to touch base with the audiences over there.
so just want to follow up a little bit more here that when we think of different international markets, do we actually have the sort of differentiated competitive strategy? and then, you know, if you have any further like a detailed color on how we're positioning ourselves, that will be great. and then the second question is innovative businesses. and we noticed the seasonal fluctuation in contribution to the revenue of the innovative businesses. fourth quarter could be a good -- yeah, sorry, the quarter where, you know, maybe e-commerce is contributing more, and then first quarter is low.
i just want to understand a bit more. so, you know, in terms of the growth curve of the two major lines. one is e-commerce, one is the cloud music. how would we describe the growth curve and where they are currently on that growth curve for this two? and in the long term, do we have any targets for them to sort of potentially become another major growth driver for the company? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language] 
margaret shi -- investor relations director
yes. we do have -- we have noticed that, you know, there are -- because they're different culture and different devices that's used by users in -- at -- in different parts of the world, we need very different products targeted to particular regions and countries that resonate with the users there. you know, and then we are confident we will figure this out. for example, in japan, we have -- we already have a number of very successful titles, including knives out, identity v, lifeafter.
recently, we have launched a new pc game, naraka: bladepoint on team, and that has been performing -- that has resonated very well with the users this during the testing phase. it's a melee combat type of game based on oriental chinese martial arts, and we will really supply -- we are -- and we're very pleased to see that it has responded well by global users. thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
and, elsie, for your second question, i'll answer that directly in english. our new -- newer businesses, whether it's online education, online music, netease yanxuan, all of them are in relatively younger phase comparing to our game businesses. so by and large, we think these younger business verticals have a very promising growth trajectory. they should grow faster than main game view in general.
when you look at each quarter, however, different views might experience different seasonality. for instance, q1 is a traditional peak season for game performance specifically because of the chinese new year, whereas it's a relatively low season, for instance, for e-commerce. likewise, education also witnessed a strong seasonality in the different semester courses throughout the calendar year. so all in all, don't be overly concerned about a quarterly fluctuation.
but generally speaking, when you look at on the annual trends basis, for instance, my innovative businesses and others line, as well as my youdao, in 2020, both lines has been growing very strong and much faster than my online game services. what we want to achieve down the road eventually is that all of our deeply incubated and cultivated verticals will have very a robust and sustainable growth. and as they continue to grow and emerge, what we want to appeal to the users is what netease holds in common a premium product and services offerings with elevated user experience. that is the corporate dna in common across the board.
ok. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you, sir. [operator instructions] it appears there are no further questions at this time. i'd like to turn the call back to the management for closing remarks.
margaret shi -- investor relations director

thank you, margaret. and thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call. before we begin, i would like to remind everyone that all percentages are based on renminbi. we began the year with a record quarter exceeding rmb20 billion in revenue for the first time and net income attributable to the company's shareholders increased 25% year over year to rmb4.4 billion.
our games business also reached a new record of our rmb15 billion in net revenues, up 11% year over year in the first quarter despite a higher comparable base last year. in q1, our flagship titles continued to demonstrate strong growth after nearly two decades of operation with revenues from fantasy westward journey online and westward journey online mobile, all growing at double-digit rates year over year. tianxia iii is another exemplary case. it is one of the rare instances where a legacy pc mmorpg game has regained growth after reaching maturity.
leveraging our growing knowledge in more recent successes in both mmo and non-mmo genres, we added some casual flavors to this legacy mmorpg, giving our players a fresh feel and creating new content for users to consume and enjoy. we also crafted an in-game event at the end of last year, which quickly generated strong interest and discussion in the players' circle, leading to a large inflow of returning users who rejoin the game. other games in the spotlight during the first quarter included life-after, onmyoji, identity v, and invincible. life-after has remained an iconic title with strong appeal among young users.
the new collaboration with the movie godzilla vs. kong in the first quarter was well-received by players as they fought off doomsday monsters. onmyoji also showed remarkable longevity remaining at the forefront of china's ios top-grossing chart. during the first quarter, we wrote out a highly anticipated ip collaboration with demon slayer, a classic japanese anime, further strengthening up onmyoji's position as a top acg game in china.
celebrating its third-year anniversary in april, identity v continues to draw the attention of young players bringing them a thrilling competitive experience with a distinctive gothic art style. between january to may, we hosted our annual global championship tournament, call of the abyss, with its finale being set in guangzhou, attracting close to 2 million game players globally to participate in this event. invincible remains steady in the first quarter with strong user engagement holding unwavering loyalty from its fan community. despite numerous invincible-like games popping up in the market, invincible has proven to be a trendsetting pioneer in this game genre.
this also echoes well with our corporate dna in product innovation. in terms of new games, we have launched a few new ones since the beginning of this year. we started with revelation mobile game in january. as we discussed last quarter, this is our self-developed rpg game based on our flagship pc title capturing both returning fans and brand new mmo players.
we then launched elysium of legends in march, our self-developed card rpg game that brings together legendary figures in chinese history. shortly after these releases, those games reached the top of the ios download chart in china. on the licensed front, in january, we introduced yu-gi-oh! duel links, a competitive card game based on the most nostalgic ip that we licensed from konami. and more recently in may, we brought the highly anticipated casual game pokemon quest through our domestic audience, featuring cute-shaped pokemon.
the game invites players could befriend and create their pokemon team to tap and battle through tumblecube island. shortly after its release, pokemon quest quickly climbed to the top of the ios downloads chart in china. in the overseas market, we continued our efforts to expand our offerings while maintaining the steady operation of our existing titles. knives out, once again, reached the no.
1 spot on japan's ios top-grossing chart a couple of times during the first quarter. following a collaboration with well-known japanese ip, the promised neverland, in february, identity v was also crowned no. 2 on japan's ios top-grossing chart. the success of these games has helped us to gain a much better understanding of japanese users and their preferences, allowing us to be more sophisticated in localization efforts.
for instance, we found that japanese users greatly value the sense of occasion. users want to feel the grandness and ceremonial appeal in each game event, take knives out as an example. knives out day, the widely anticipated annual celebration officially recognized by the japanese anniversary association since 2019 marked the start of the game's annual carnival on may the 5th, which includes the biggest youth sports championship tournament in japan as well as other exciting activities. we invited all of our users, brought millions of them online on that day and the event has become one of the top-trending topics on twitter in japan for the past two years.
with a couple of titles gaining popularity and recognition already in the overseas markets today, we are hopeful that our upcoming releases will bring the next generation of games to the world stage and to further expand our footprint in more regions particularly in the u.s. and europe. in april, we launched infinite lagrange in europe. similar to invincible, we expect infinite lagrange, our first globally targeted slg game, to ramp up its revenue gradually and show a similar upwards trend and longevity with time.
this game will be next available in the u.s. and other overseas markets over the coming months. as our very first next-gen slg, we have it under development for a number of years. we hope that this title will extend our success in slg into overseas markets.
the highly anticipated harry potter: magic awakened is also on track to meet eager audiences. we are thrilled to bring this game to wizard fans soon, taking players around the world on a magical adventure. earlier this month, we announced that we join hands with our polish partner,11 bit studios, to develop and publish the mobile version of the world-renowned ip, frostpunk, globally. later this year, players will be able to access this elaborately crafted post-apocalypse social survival game on mobile platforms.
in addition, we have a handful of other exciting titles in our pipeline. adding to those we just mentioned, our pipeline also includes the lord of the rings: rise to war, nightmare breaker, diablo immortal, and ghost world chronicle. for more details on these titles, please join our annual product launch event on may 20th, two days later, which will be hosted online this year and will have a dedicated english section for our global game players and business partners for the first time. we are proud of our world-class r&d infrastructure, which has been pivotal in maintaining a competitive edge in this market and delivering long-term value.
the most important element is our people. with that in mind, we encourage our talent to share and exchange ideas with industry veterans worldwide. we just hosted the 2021 netease game developers summit in april with a three-day forum covering topics like game design, arts, and technology. the event brought together our internal developers as well as external industrial partners including gurus in the western game industry and developers community to share their vast game development philosophies and experiences, sparking wide attention from developers, game players, and many others in the industry.
now turning to our education business, youdao achieved strong and sustainable growth in the first quarter. total net revenues from youdao increased by 147% year over year to rmb1.3 billion. and overall gross margin significantly improved to 57%, reaching a new record since its ipo back in 2019. gross billings from the youdao k-12 segment were up 130% year over year despite a high base last year due to the outbreak of covid-19.
k-12 paid student enrollment double year over year to 306,000. in order to match the growing scale and ensure the optimum teaching quality, we continue to strengthen our servicing team, which comprises 197 instructors and over 4,000 well-trained tutors by the end of the first quarter. given that different syllabus is used in different parts of china, one of the most important agenda for us is to ensure localized content for courses we offer. we took our junior high school chinese as the pilot case.
during the past spring semester, we launched up to 31 versions of junior high school chinese, meeting the needs of students in 31 different provinces. the localized courses have turned out to be very effective and very welcomed by our students. net revenue of youdao's learning devices also continued a year-over-year growth of 280%. in march, we introduced a dictionary pen 3.0 pro version, further supporting bilingual translation of chinese and korean languages to meet the demand of a wider range of language learners.
youdao also further integrated the functions of our dictionary pen and youdao dictionary app, making the offline-online transition even more efficient and effortless. looking and heading to 2021, we are confident that youdao will continue to grow its position as a leading provider of intelligent learning services and products, and our diversified business models, products, and technologies will give us the upper hand in the evolving after-school tutoring and test market. for our cloud music business, we have come a long way. celebrating its eighth-year anniversary last month, we are proud to say that we have sought and created new possibilities for music in this digital era.
our platform, which features a vast and highly interactive content community has become a widely recognized household name that is seen as a cultural emblem among, particularly, the post-90s or younger generation. with a large base of young music lovers on our platform, we are more willing to explore and discover music. we have been the creative outlet and a natural stage for independent musicians to shine. we strongly believe independent artists as a crucial driving force for the music industry and our platform uniquely positions us to nurture them in the modern era.
in april, we held our annual signature event, the indie music artists ceremony for the third time, celebrating the past year of their music and encouraging independent musicians to continue creating their remarkable work. in addition to our original music, we want to continue bringing together a library of new, unique, and influential music pieces from around the world and providing music fans with the ultimate audio experience. we have just announced a direct digital distribution partnership with sony music entertainment, one of the world's three largest recording companies. following you umg, this is the second direct licensing arrangement we have signed with the big three labels and we are proud to see these positive changes happening in the music industry in china.
moving on to yanxuan, as a private-label consumer brand, we further strengthened our brand appeal among the young middle class, developing products that revolve around their need. centered around this notion and along with yanxuan's fifth-year anniversary, we developed a new value proposition ""live the way you like"" through a promotion intended to express the voice of the new middle class. this campaign resonated strongly with its intended audience, sparking lively discussions. during the last year, we rolled out a range of highly popular yanxuan products, which have sold well since their introduction.
our strategy to incubate more hit products has paved a smooth path for us to strengthen yanxuan's product portfolio. we recently introduced a number of new-style products such as our proprietary laundry pods, wireless earbuds, bathroom fragrance, which quickly became top-selling products on multiple platforms, and some of the most recognized products in those emerging categories. we see potential in many of our proprietary products and we are working to introduce a greater number of signature products this year. additionally, we continued to optimize our operating efficiency in the first quarter.
during the quarter, both our inventory turnover days and the fulfillment efficiency were improving. in summary, we are off to a strong start in 2021. our game portfolio is getting ready for exciting new titles for both domestic and global players, while our existing games continue to hold strong. our online education, music, and e-commerce businesses are each on solid footing as well.
premium and diverse content creation across our businesses continues to be our primary objective as we move forward, entering a new phase of growth and generating additional value for all of our users and stakeholders. this concludes william's comments. i will now provide a very brief overview of our first-quarter 2021 financial results. given the limited time on today's call, i will be presenting some abbreviated financial highlights.
we encourage you to read through our press release issued earlier today for further details. total net revenues for the first quarter were rmb20.5 billion or us$3.1 billion, representing a 20% increase year over year. our net revenues from online game services were rmb15 billion, up 11% year over year. this year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased revenue contribution from the newly launched revelation mobile game, fantasy westward journey h5, as well as pc games such as fantasy westward journey online.
net revenues from our mobile games accounted for approximately 73% of net revenues from online game services in the first quarter. youdao's net revenues reached rmb1.3 billion, up 148% year over year, driven by the fast growth of both its online courses and sales of intelligent learning devices. net revenues from innovative businesses and others were rmb4.2 billion for the first quarter, up 40% year over year, mainly due to increased contribution from netease cloud music, as well as yanxuan and cc live streaming. our total gross profit margin was 53.9% in the first quarter with a breakdown as follows.
gp margin for our online game services was 64.6%. as a reminder, this number is generally stable with some narrow fluctuation based on the revenue mix of mobile and pc titles, as well as self-developed and licensed games. gross margin for youdao was 57.3%, compared with 43.5% in the same period of last year. the significant growth was primarily attributable to the improved gross margin from learning services due to the economies of scale and the continuous optimization effort of its cost structure.
it is also due to the substantial sales growth of the smart learning hardware such as youdao dictionary pen, which carries a higher gross margin than other hardware product lines. gp margin for innovative businesses and others was 14.4%, compared with 15.8% in the first quarter of last year. while the margins for netease cloud music and yanxuan have improved year over year significantly, the impact was partially offset by the decrease in gp margin from the rest of the business segment in this line. for the first quarter, total operating expenses were rmb6.8 billion, representing 33% of the total net revenues.
our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue were 13.5% in the quarter. excluding youdao, our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue was below 10%, lower than the previous quarters. as a reminder, fluctuation in selling and marketing as a percentage of revenue largely depends on the number of new games' launches in a particular quarter, the genre they are in, and the most suitable marketing plans adopted for each new game launches. r&d expenses were rmb3.1 billion, largely stable from the previous quarter.
we remain committed to investing in content creation and product development, which is core to our revenue growth. as a percentage of net revenue, r&d expenses were 14.9%, compared with 15.3% last quarter. effective tax rate in this quarter was 22%. the effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the company regarding the tax obligations and benefits applicable to it in each quarter.
non-gaap net income attributable to our shareholders for the first quarter totaled rmb5.1 billion or us$776 million. our non-gaap basic earnings per ads were rmb7.58 or us$1.16. our cash position remains strong. as of the quarter-end, our total cash and cash equivalents, current and noncurrent time deposits, and short-term investment balance totaled rmb106 billion, compared with rmb100 billion as of the year-end last year.
in accordance with our dividend policy, we are very pleased to report that our board of directors has approved a dividend of us$0.06 per share or us$0.3 per ads. lastly, under the share repurchase program approved by our board, approximately 3 million ads have been repurchased in the first quarter for a total cost of approximately us$330 million. thank you for your attention. we would like now to open the call to your questions.
operator, please go ahead to q&a.

thank you, sir. [operator instructions] we'll take our first question from alex poon with morgan stanley.
alex poon -- morgan stanley -- analyst
[foreign language] my question is regarding the press release. we have mentioned these big titles, harry potter, lord of the rings, diablo immortal will be coming in the next few months -- in the coming months. so i'd like to understand about the launch schedule and details around these three big titles. thank you very much.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, alex. i'll answer your question directly in english. we do have very, very strong visibility and confidence for a rich pipeline, including highly anticipated games like harry potter, lord of the rings, diablo immortal, and a few others that i mentioned just now. and many of these games have already obtained the license approvals already from the regulators.
most of these games will be launched in the second half of this year. in fact, two days later, on our annual gala game day, may 20 event, we will be disclosing more details, existing games, as well as some of the exciting new titles. i would encourage you and the investor community to join our event online to get more details just in two days' time. so a little bit more patience, please. 
alex poon -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you, charles. [foreign language]
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from jialong shi with nomura.
jialong shi -- nomura -- analyst
thanks. good evening, management. thanks for taking my question. i will ask my question first in chinese.
i will translate myself later. [foreign language] so, i will translate my questions. in recent years, there have been some independent game studios which were able to launch very successful self-developed titles. just like netease, these new game studios also published their games on their own instead of going through third-party publishers.
so my question is, do you think in china's mobile gaming space, the competition is becoming more intense? and if that is the case, how does netease plan to cope with the challenges from these small but quite competitive game studios?
charles yang -- chief financial officer
[foreign language] ok.
margaret shi -- investor relations director
you -- the companies that you mentioned have had great success in the recent years. it means that the overall environment for creativity, especially in games, is very good in china. netease, we have been a business for over 20 years. we will continue to innovate to thrive.
and we are happy, you know, with -- for the success that the smaller gaming companies have achieved. and we will, you know -- and we will continue to rise and continue to exceed. thank you. thank you.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from thomas chong with jefferies.
thomas chong -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, management. thanks for taking my questions. can you comment about our online user strategies, in particular, subscription and live streaming? and any thoughts about the long-form audio strategies? [foreign language]
charles yang -- chief financial officer
yeah. thomas, do you want to translate your question in english? ok. thomas, i will answer your question directly in english. yes, there are -- as we've been mentioning in the past couple of quarters, there are plenty of possibilities in terms of product innovation, in terms of monetization streams that centered around this music vertical.
and we are very encouraged to see strong continued and robust growth in both subscription, live streaming, advertising, and new possibilities as we continue to innovate and try out. so right now, netease cloud music, despite the fact that it's been eight years old now, it is still in its relatively early nascent stage. so lots of possibilities. revenue growth in the multiple formats that you mentioned have all been very strong.
and specifically, you asked about long format audio. that's a very important vertical. in fact, we are a forerunner and the pioneer in this particular long-format audio. majority of our live streaming revenues actually come from long-format audio.
and there are more players that's been following suit and coming into this vertical. it has just proven one more time that how the potential upside of this vertical. and i think netease cloud music, just like many other product lines under the netease brand umbrella, will focus on unique product features powered by product innovations, targets specifically to this vibrant, younger generation of music enthusiasts. with that, we are actually very confident on multiple fronts both in terms of product features, as well as monetization potential.
thomas?
margaret shi -- investor relations director
thank you. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you. thank you, ma'am. [operator instructions] we'll take our next question from eddie leung with bank of america.
eddie leung -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
[foreign language] so my question is actually a bit of a follow-up on the game industry. so number one, congratulations on the continuous success of fantasy westward journey and westward journey series. but it seems to be interesting to observe that globally, no matter whether it's a successful pc mobile or console game developers, it seems to be relying, to some extent, new versions or new games on some of the old ips. while actually some of the new companies are able to come up with big iconic ips.
so just wondering, as a leading global game company, you know, how we think about this kind of like issue. and is there any indication when we developed our game strategy? thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
yeah. we do not entirely agree with your comments. we think, obviously, you know, it's important for new companies to create new ip, new titles. well, we think more importantly, it's the longtime -- long-term operation of good flagship titles.
as from netease's perspective, we will continue to do what we are doing. over the past years, we've launched a number of very great, you know, innovative, industry-leading titles, including onmyoji, justice, and naraka: bladepoint to name a few. so we think -- we will continue to do what we are doing and to create a new game, as well as maintaining a long-term stability of our existing title. thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
and, eddie, just to add one more point. as you can witness in the past couple of quarters when there are fewer new game launched in a particular quarter or two, netease's financial performance has been steady. it is again something we talked earlier in the past. netease is a very, very unique combination of continuous innovation to come up with new titles, as well as the operational know-how to extend the longevity and effective monetization of the old titles.
it is because of this combination that we are able to deliver very steady and gradually improving financial profile for over two decades. 
eddie leung -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i guess that's very true. [foreign language] thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we'll take our next question from alicia yap with citi. 
alicia yap -- citigroup -- analyst
hi. [foreign language] thank you for taking my questions. my question is related to the cloud music. so with netease now currently signing directly with all the three major music label, would that change the overall attractiveness of the content selection for user? and also, would that help on driving the music subscription growth? any material change on the gross margin impact? and also, can management elaborate the music strategy into the iot partnership? any interest that you are or extending the partnership with the oem? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language] 
margaret shi -- investor relations director
as the streaming platform or social committee for music enthusiasts, you know, netease cloud music is actively -- have always been actively seeking partnerships with content providers or label companies in order to help them promote their music in china. that's answered the first question. and in terms of iot or furnishing -- or home furnishing, again, this is another important growth area for netease cloud music. thank you.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from elsie cheng with goldman sachs. 
elsie cheng -- goldman sachs -- analyst
[foreign language] good evening, william, [inaudible], and margaret. my first question is about international games. we noticed that there were a lot of coming titles for this year, and it seems that for different international markets, we actually have different genres. that's the first of the key points to touch base with the audiences over there.
so just want to follow up a little bit more here that when we think of different international markets, do we actually have the sort of differentiated competitive strategy? and then, you know, if you have any further like a detailed color on how we're positioning ourselves, that will be great. and then the second question is innovative businesses. and we noticed the seasonal fluctuation in contribution to the revenue of the innovative businesses. fourth quarter could be a good -- yeah, sorry, the quarter where, you know, maybe e-commerce is contributing more, and then first quarter is low.
i just want to understand a bit more. so, you know, in terms of the growth curve of the two major lines. one is e-commerce, one is the cloud music. how would we describe the growth curve and where they are currently on that growth curve for this two? and in the long term, do we have any targets for them to sort of potentially become another major growth driver for the company? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language] 
margaret shi -- investor relations director
yes. we do have -- we have noticed that, you know, there are -- because they're different culture and different devices that's used by users in -- at -- in different parts of the world, we need very different products targeted to particular regions and countries that resonate with the users there. you know, and then we are confident we will figure this out. for example, in japan, we have -- we already have a number of very successful titles, including knives out, identity v, lifeafter.
recently, we have launched a new pc game, naraka: bladepoint on team, and that has been performing -- that has resonated very well with the users this during the testing phase. it's a melee combat type of game based on oriental chinese martial arts, and we will really supply -- we are -- and we're very pleased to see that it has responded well by global users. thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
and, elsie, for your second question, i'll answer that directly in english. our new -- newer businesses, whether it's online education, online music, netease yanxuan, all of them are in relatively younger phase comparing to our game businesses. so by and large, we think these younger business verticals have a very promising growth trajectory. they should grow faster than main game view in general.
when you look at each quarter, however, different views might experience different seasonality. for instance, q1 is a traditional peak season for game performance specifically because of the chinese new year, whereas it's a relatively low season, for instance, for e-commerce. likewise, education also witnessed a strong seasonality in the different semester courses throughout the calendar year. so all in all, don't be overly concerned about a quarterly fluctuation.
but generally speaking, when you look at on the annual trends basis, for instance, my innovative businesses and others line, as well as my youdao, in 2020, both lines has been growing very strong and much faster than my online game services. what we want to achieve down the road eventually is that all of our deeply incubated and cultivated verticals will have very a robust and sustainable growth. and as they continue to grow and emerge, what we want to appeal to the users is what netease holds in common a premium product and services offerings with elevated user experience. that is the corporate dna in common across the board.
ok. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you, sir. [operator instructions] it appears there are no further questions at this time. i'd like to turn the call back to the management for closing remarks.
margaret shi -- investor relations director
thank you once again for joining us today. if you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us directly on cpg relations -- investor relations. have a great day.

william ding, our chief executive officer; and mr. charles yang, our chief financial officer. i will now turn the call over to charles, who will read the prepared remarks on behalf of william. 
charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, margaret. and thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call. before we begin, i would like to remind everyone that all percentages are based on renminbi. we began the year with a record quarter exceeding rmb20 billion in revenue for the first time and net income attributable to the company's shareholders increased 25% year over year to rmb4.4 billion.
our games business also reached a new record of our rmb15 billion in net revenues, up 11% year over year in the first quarter despite a higher comparable base last year. in q1, our flagship titles continued to demonstrate strong growth after nearly two decades of operation with revenues from fantasy westward journey online and westward journey online mobile, all growing at double-digit rates year over year. tianxia iii is another exemplary case. it is one of the rare instances where a legacy pc mmorpg game has regained growth after reaching maturity.
leveraging our growing knowledge in more recent successes in both mmo and non-mmo genres, we added some casual flavors to this legacy mmorpg, giving our players a fresh feel and creating new content for users to consume and enjoy. we also crafted an in-game event at the end of last year, which quickly generated strong interest and discussion in the players' circle, leading to a large inflow of returning users who rejoin the game. other games in the spotlight during the first quarter included life-after, onmyoji, identity v, and invincible. life-after has remained an iconic title with strong appeal among young users.
the new collaboration with the movie godzilla vs. kong in the first quarter was well-received by players as they fought off doomsday monsters. onmyoji also showed remarkable longevity remaining at the forefront of china's ios top-grossing chart. during the first quarter, we wrote out a highly anticipated ip collaboration with demon slayer, a classic japanese anime, further strengthening up onmyoji's position as a top acg game in china.
celebrating its third-year anniversary in april, identity v continues to draw the attention of young players bringing them a thrilling competitive experience with a distinctive gothic art style. between january to may, we hosted our annual global championship tournament, call of the abyss, with its finale being set in guangzhou, attracting close to 2 million game players globally to participate in this event. invincible remains steady in the first quarter with strong user engagement holding unwavering loyalty from its fan community. despite numerous invincible-like games popping up in the market, invincible has proven to be a trendsetting pioneer in this game genre.
this also echoes well with our corporate dna in product innovation. in terms of new games, we have launched a few new ones since the beginning of this year. we started with revelation mobile game in january. as we discussed last quarter, this is our self-developed rpg game based on our flagship pc title capturing both returning fans and brand new mmo players.
we then launched elysium of legends in march, our self-developed card rpg game that brings together legendary figures in chinese history. shortly after these releases, those games reached the top of the ios download chart in china. on the licensed front, in january, we introduced yu-gi-oh! duel links, a competitive card game based on the most nostalgic ip that we licensed from konami. and more recently in may, we brought the highly anticipated casual game pokemon quest through our domestic audience, featuring cute-shaped pokemon.
the game invites players could befriend and create their pokemon team to tap and battle through tumblecube island. shortly after its release, pokemon quest quickly climbed to the top of the ios downloads chart in china. in the overseas market, we continued our efforts to expand our offerings while maintaining the steady operation of our existing titles. knives out, once again, reached the no.
1 spot on japan's ios top-grossing chart a couple of times during the first quarter. following a collaboration with well-known japanese ip, the promised neverland, in february, identity v was also crowned no. 2 on japan's ios top-grossing chart. the success of these games has helped us to gain a much better understanding of japanese users and their preferences, allowing us to be more sophisticated in localization efforts.
for instance, we found that japanese users greatly value the sense of occasion. users want to feel the grandness and ceremonial appeal in each game event, take knives out as an example. knives out day, the widely anticipated annual celebration officially recognized by the japanese anniversary association since 2019 marked the start of the game's annual carnival on may the 5th, which includes the biggest youth sports championship tournament in japan as well as other exciting activities. we invited all of our users, brought millions of them online on that day and the event has become one of the top-trending topics on twitter in japan for the past two years.
with a couple of titles gaining popularity and recognition already in the overseas markets today, we are hopeful that our upcoming releases will bring the next generation of games to the world stage and to further expand our footprint in more regions particularly in the u.s. and europe. in april, we launched infinite lagrange in europe. similar to invincible, we expect infinite lagrange, our first globally targeted slg game, to ramp up its revenue gradually and show a similar upwards trend and longevity with time.
this game will be next available in the u.s. and other overseas markets over the coming months. as our very first next-gen slg, we have it under development for a number of years. we hope that this title will extend our success in slg into overseas markets.
the highly anticipated harry potter: magic awakened is also on track to meet eager audiences. we are thrilled to bring this game to wizard fans soon, taking players around the world on a magical adventure. earlier this month, we announced that we join hands with our polish partner,11 bit studios, to develop and publish the mobile version of the world-renowned ip, frostpunk, globally. later this year, players will be able to access this elaborately crafted post-apocalypse social survival game on mobile platforms.
in addition, we have a handful of other exciting titles in our pipeline. adding to those we just mentioned, our pipeline also includes the lord of the rings: rise to war, nightmare breaker, diablo immortal, and ghost world chronicle. for more details on these titles, please join our annual product launch event on may 20th, two days later, which will be hosted online this year and will have a dedicated english section for our global game players and business partners for the first time. we are proud of our world-class r&d infrastructure, which has been pivotal in maintaining a competitive edge in this market and delivering long-term value.
the most important element is our people. with that in mind, we encourage our talent to share and exchange ideas with industry veterans worldwide. we just hosted the 2021 netease game developers summit in april with a three-day forum covering topics like game design, arts, and technology. the event brought together our internal developers as well as external industrial partners including gurus in the western game industry and developers community to share their vast game development philosophies and experiences, sparking wide attention from developers, game players, and many others in the industry.
now turning to our education business, youdao achieved strong and sustainable growth in the first quarter. total net revenues from youdao increased by 147% year over year to rmb1.3 billion. and overall gross margin significantly improved to 57%, reaching a new record since its ipo back in 2019. gross billings from the youdao k-12 segment were up 130% year over year despite a high base last year due to the outbreak of covid-19.
k-12 paid student enrollment double year over year to 306,000. in order to match the growing scale and ensure the optimum teaching quality, we continue to strengthen our servicing team, which comprises 197 instructors and over 4,000 well-trained tutors by the end of the first quarter. given that different syllabus is used in different parts of china, one of the most important agenda for us is to ensure localized content for courses we offer. we took our junior high school chinese as the pilot case.
during the past spring semester, we launched up to 31 versions of junior high school chinese, meeting the needs of students in 31 different provinces. the localized courses have turned out to be very effective and very welcomed by our students. net revenue of youdao's learning devices also continued a year-over-year growth of 280%. in march, we introduced a dictionary pen 3.0 pro version, further supporting bilingual translation of chinese and korean languages to meet the demand of a wider range of language learners.
youdao also further integrated the functions of our dictionary pen and youdao dictionary app, making the offline-online transition even more efficient and effortless. looking and heading to 2021, we are confident that youdao will continue to grow its position as a leading provider of intelligent learning services and products, and our diversified business models, products, and technologies will give us the upper hand in the evolving after-school tutoring and test market. for our cloud music business, we have come a long way. celebrating its eighth-year anniversary last month, we are proud to say that we have sought and created new possibilities for music in this digital era.
our platform, which features a vast and highly interactive content community has become a widely recognized household name that is seen as a cultural emblem among, particularly, the post-90s or younger generation. with a large base of young music lovers on our platform, we are more willing to explore and discover music. we have been the creative outlet and a natural stage for independent musicians to shine. we strongly believe independent artists as a crucial driving force for the music industry and our platform uniquely positions us to nurture them in the modern era.
in april, we held our annual signature event, the indie music artists ceremony for the third time, celebrating the past year of their music and encouraging independent musicians to continue creating their remarkable work. in addition to our original music, we want to continue bringing together a library of new, unique, and influential music pieces from around the world and providing music fans with the ultimate audio experience. we have just announced a direct digital distribution partnership with sony music entertainment, one of the world's three largest recording companies. following you umg, this is the second direct licensing arrangement we have signed with the big three labels and we are proud to see these positive changes happening in the music industry in china.
moving on to yanxuan, as a private-label consumer brand, we further strengthened our brand appeal among the young middle class, developing products that revolve around their need. centered around this notion and along with yanxuan's fifth-year anniversary, we developed a new value proposition ""live the way you like"" through a promotion intended to express the voice of the new middle class. this campaign resonated strongly with its intended audience, sparking lively discussions. during the last year, we rolled out a range of highly popular yanxuan products, which have sold well since their introduction.
our strategy to incubate more hit products has paved a smooth path for us to strengthen yanxuan's product portfolio. we recently introduced a number of new-style products such as our proprietary laundry pods, wireless earbuds, bathroom fragrance, which quickly became top-selling products on multiple platforms, and some of the most recognized products in those emerging categories. we see potential in many of our proprietary products and we are working to introduce a greater number of signature products this year. additionally, we continued to optimize our operating efficiency in the first quarter.
during the quarter, both our inventory turnover days and the fulfillment efficiency were improving. in summary, we are off to a strong start in 2021. our game portfolio is getting ready for exciting new titles for both domestic and global players, while our existing games continue to hold strong. our online education, music, and e-commerce businesses are each on solid footing as well.
premium and diverse content creation across our businesses continues to be our primary objective as we move forward, entering a new phase of growth and generating additional value for all of our users and stakeholders. this concludes william's comments. i will now provide a very brief overview of our first-quarter 2021 financial results. given the limited time on today's call, i will be presenting some abbreviated financial highlights.
we encourage you to read through our press release issued earlier today for further details. total net revenues for the first quarter were rmb20.5 billion or us$3.1 billion, representing a 20% increase year over year. our net revenues from online game services were rmb15 billion, up 11% year over year. this year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased revenue contribution from the newly launched revelation mobile game, fantasy westward journey h5, as well as pc games such as fantasy westward journey online.
net revenues from our mobile games accounted for approximately 73% of net revenues from online game services in the first quarter. youdao's net revenues reached rmb1.3 billion, up 148% year over year, driven by the fast growth of both its online courses and sales of intelligent learning devices. net revenues from innovative businesses and others were rmb4.2 billion for the first quarter, up 40% year over year, mainly due to increased contribution from netease cloud music, as well as yanxuan and cc live streaming. our total gross profit margin was 53.9% in the first quarter with a breakdown as follows.
gp margin for our online game services was 64.6%. as a reminder, this number is generally stable with some narrow fluctuation based on the revenue mix of mobile and pc titles, as well as self-developed and licensed games. gross margin for youdao was 57.3%, compared with 43.5% in the same period of last year. the significant growth was primarily attributable to the improved gross margin from learning services due to the economies of scale and the continuous optimization effort of its cost structure.
it is also due to the substantial sales growth of the smart learning hardware such as youdao dictionary pen, which carries a higher gross margin than other hardware product lines. gp margin for innovative businesses and others was 14.4%, compared with 15.8% in the first quarter of last year. while the margins for netease cloud music and yanxuan have improved year over year significantly, the impact was partially offset by the decrease in gp margin from the rest of the business segment in this line. for the first quarter, total operating expenses were rmb6.8 billion, representing 33% of the total net revenues.
our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue were 13.5% in the quarter. excluding youdao, our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue was below 10%, lower than the previous quarters. as a reminder, fluctuation in selling and marketing as a percentage of revenue largely depends on the number of new games' launches in a particular quarter, the genre they are in, and the most suitable marketing plans adopted for each new game launches. r&d expenses were rmb3.1 billion, largely stable from the previous quarter.
we remain committed to investing in content creation and product development, which is core to our revenue growth. as a percentage of net revenue, r&d expenses were 14.9%, compared with 15.3% last quarter. effective tax rate in this quarter was 22%. the effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the company regarding the tax obligations and benefits applicable to it in each quarter.
non-gaap net income attributable to our shareholders for the first quarter totaled rmb5.1 billion or us$776 million. our non-gaap basic earnings per ads were rmb7.58 or us$1.16. our cash position remains strong. as of the quarter-end, our total cash and cash equivalents, current and noncurrent time deposits, and short-term investment balance totaled rmb106 billion, compared with rmb100 billion as of the year-end last year.
in accordance with our dividend policy, we are very pleased to report that our board of directors has approved a dividend of us$0.06 per share or us$0.3 per ads. lastly, under the share repurchase program approved by our board, approximately 3 million ads have been repurchased in the first quarter for a total cost of approximately us$330 million. thank you for your attention. we would like now to open the call to your questions.
operator, please go ahead to q&a.

thank you, sir. [operator instructions] we'll take our first question from alex poon with morgan stanley.
alex poon -- morgan stanley -- analyst
[foreign language] my question is regarding the press release. we have mentioned these big titles, harry potter, lord of the rings, diablo immortal will be coming in the next few months -- in the coming months. so i'd like to understand about the launch schedule and details around these three big titles. thank you very much.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, alex. i'll answer your question directly in english. we do have very, very strong visibility and confidence for a rich pipeline, including highly anticipated games like harry potter, lord of the rings, diablo immortal, and a few others that i mentioned just now. and many of these games have already obtained the license approvals already from the regulators.
most of these games will be launched in the second half of this year. in fact, two days later, on our annual gala game day, may 20 event, we will be disclosing more details, existing games, as well as some of the exciting new titles. i would encourage you and the investor community to join our event online to get more details just in two days' time. so a little bit more patience, please. 
alex poon -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you, charles. [foreign language]
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from jialong shi with nomura.
jialong shi -- nomura -- analyst
thanks. good evening, management. thanks for taking my question. i will ask my question first in chinese.
i will translate myself later. [foreign language] so, i will translate my questions. in recent years, there have been some independent game studios which were able to launch very successful self-developed titles. just like netease, these new game studios also published their games on their own instead of going through third-party publishers.
so my question is, do you think in china's mobile gaming space, the competition is becoming more intense? and if that is the case, how does netease plan to cope with the challenges from these small but quite competitive game studios?
charles yang -- chief financial officer
[foreign language] ok.
margaret shi -- investor relations director
you -- the companies that you mentioned have had great success in the recent years. it means that the overall environment for creativity, especially in games, is very good in china. netease, we have been a business for over 20 years. we will continue to innovate to thrive.
and we are happy, you know, with -- for the success that the smaller gaming companies have achieved. and we will, you know -- and we will continue to rise and continue to exceed. thank you. thank you.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from thomas chong with jefferies.
thomas chong -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, management. thanks for taking my questions. can you comment about our online user strategies, in particular, subscription and live streaming? and any thoughts about the long-form audio strategies? [foreign language]
charles yang -- chief financial officer
yeah. thomas, do you want to translate your question in english? ok. thomas, i will answer your question directly in english. yes, there are -- as we've been mentioning in the past couple of quarters, there are plenty of possibilities in terms of product innovation, in terms of monetization streams that centered around this music vertical.
and we are very encouraged to see strong continued and robust growth in both subscription, live streaming, advertising, and new possibilities as we continue to innovate and try out. so right now, netease cloud music, despite the fact that it's been eight years old now, it is still in its relatively early nascent stage. so lots of possibilities. revenue growth in the multiple formats that you mentioned have all been very strong.
and specifically, you asked about long format audio. that's a very important vertical. in fact, we are a forerunner and the pioneer in this particular long-format audio. majority of our live streaming revenues actually come from long-format audio.
and there are more players that's been following suit and coming into this vertical. it has just proven one more time that how the potential upside of this vertical. and i think netease cloud music, just like many other product lines under the netease brand umbrella, will focus on unique product features powered by product innovations, targets specifically to this vibrant, younger generation of music enthusiasts. with that, we are actually very confident on multiple fronts both in terms of product features, as well as monetization potential.
thomas?
margaret shi -- investor relations director
thank you. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you. thank you, ma'am. [operator instructions] we'll take our next question from eddie leung with bank of america.
eddie leung -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
[foreign language] so my question is actually a bit of a follow-up on the game industry. so number one, congratulations on the continuous success of fantasy westward journey and westward journey series. but it seems to be interesting to observe that globally, no matter whether it's a successful pc mobile or console game developers, it seems to be relying, to some extent, new versions or new games on some of the old ips. while actually some of the new companies are able to come up with big iconic ips.
so just wondering, as a leading global game company, you know, how we think about this kind of like issue. and is there any indication when we developed our game strategy? thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
yeah. we do not entirely agree with your comments. we think, obviously, you know, it's important for new companies to create new ip, new titles. well, we think more importantly, it's the longtime -- long-term operation of good flagship titles.
as from netease's perspective, we will continue to do what we are doing. over the past years, we've launched a number of very great, you know, innovative, industry-leading titles, including onmyoji, justice, and naraka: bladepoint to name a few. so we think -- we will continue to do what we are doing and to create a new game, as well as maintaining a long-term stability of our existing title. thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
and, eddie, just to add one more point. as you can witness in the past couple of quarters when there are fewer new game launched in a particular quarter or two, netease's financial performance has been steady. it is again something we talked earlier in the past. netease is a very, very unique combination of continuous innovation to come up with new titles, as well as the operational know-how to extend the longevity and effective monetization of the old titles.
it is because of this combination that we are able to deliver very steady and gradually improving financial profile for over two decades. 
eddie leung -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i guess that's very true. [foreign language] thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we'll take our next question from alicia yap with citi. 
alicia yap -- citigroup -- analyst
hi. [foreign language] thank you for taking my questions. my question is related to the cloud music. so with netease now currently signing directly with all the three major music label, would that change the overall attractiveness of the content selection for user? and also, would that help on driving the music subscription growth? any material change on the gross margin impact? and also, can management elaborate the music strategy into the iot partnership? any interest that you are or extending the partnership with the oem? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language] 
margaret shi -- investor relations director
as the streaming platform or social committee for music enthusiasts, you know, netease cloud music is actively -- have always been actively seeking partnerships with content providers or label companies in order to help them promote their music in china. that's answered the first question. and in terms of iot or furnishing -- or home furnishing, again, this is another important growth area for netease cloud music. thank you.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from elsie cheng with goldman sachs. 
elsie cheng -- goldman sachs -- analyst
[foreign language] good evening, william, [inaudible], and margaret. my first question is about international games. we noticed that there were a lot of coming titles for this year, and it seems that for different international markets, we actually have different genres. that's the first of the key points to touch base with the audiences over there.
so just want to follow up a little bit more here that when we think of different international markets, do we actually have the sort of differentiated competitive strategy? and then, you know, if you have any further like a detailed color on how we're positioning ourselves, that will be great. and then the second question is innovative businesses. and we noticed the seasonal fluctuation in contribution to the revenue of the innovative businesses. fourth quarter could be a good -- yeah, sorry, the quarter where, you know, maybe e-commerce is contributing more, and then first quarter is low.
i just want to understand a bit more. so, you know, in terms of the growth curve of the two major lines. one is e-commerce, one is the cloud music. how would we describe the growth curve and where they are currently on that growth curve for this two? and in the long term, do we have any targets for them to sort of potentially become another major growth driver for the company? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language] 
margaret shi -- investor relations director
yes. we do have -- we have noticed that, you know, there are -- because they're different culture and different devices that's used by users in -- at -- in different parts of the world, we need very different products targeted to particular regions and countries that resonate with the users there. you know, and then we are confident we will figure this out. for example, in japan, we have -- we already have a number of very successful titles, including knives out, identity v, lifeafter.
recently, we have launched a new pc game, naraka: bladepoint on team, and that has been performing -- that has resonated very well with the users this during the testing phase. it's a melee combat type of game based on oriental chinese martial arts, and we will really supply -- we are -- and we're very pleased to see that it has responded well by global users. thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
and, elsie, for your second question, i'll answer that directly in english. our new -- newer businesses, whether it's online education, online music, netease yanxuan, all of them are in relatively younger phase comparing to our game businesses. so by and large, we think these younger business verticals have a very promising growth trajectory. they should grow faster than main game view in general.
when you look at each quarter, however, different views might experience different seasonality. for instance, q1 is a traditional peak season for game performance specifically because of the chinese new year, whereas it's a relatively low season, for instance, for e-commerce. likewise, education also witnessed a strong seasonality in the different semester courses throughout the calendar year. so all in all, don't be overly concerned about a quarterly fluctuation.
but generally speaking, when you look at on the annual trends basis, for instance, my innovative businesses and others line, as well as my youdao, in 2020, both lines has been growing very strong and much faster than my online game services. what we want to achieve down the road eventually is that all of our deeply incubated and cultivated verticals will have very a robust and sustainable growth. and as they continue to grow and emerge, what we want to appeal to the users is what netease holds in common a premium product and services offerings with elevated user experience. that is the corporate dna in common across the board.
ok. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you, sir. [operator instructions] it appears there are no further questions at this time. i'd like to turn the call back to the management for closing remarks.
margaret shi -- investor relations director
thank you once again for joining us today. if you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us directly on cpg relations -- investor relations. have a great day.

operator
good day, and welcome to the netease 2021 first-quarter earnings conference call. today's conference is being recorded. at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to margaret shi, ir director of netease. please go ahead.

william ding, our chief executive officer; and mr. charles yang, our chief financial officer. i will now turn the call over to charles, who will read the prepared remarks on behalf of william. 
charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, margaret. and thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call. before we begin, i would like to remind everyone that all percentages are based on renminbi. we began the year with a record quarter exceeding rmb20 billion in revenue for the first time and net income attributable to the company's shareholders increased 25% year over year to rmb4.4 billion.
our games business also reached a new record of our rmb15 billion in net revenues, up 11% year over year in the first quarter despite a higher comparable base last year. in q1, our flagship titles continued to demonstrate strong growth after nearly two decades of operation with revenues from fantasy westward journey online and westward journey online mobile, all growing at double-digit rates year over year. tianxia iii is another exemplary case. it is one of the rare instances where a legacy pc mmorpg game has regained growth after reaching maturity.
leveraging our growing knowledge in more recent successes in both mmo and non-mmo genres, we added some casual flavors to this legacy mmorpg, giving our players a fresh feel and creating new content for users to consume and enjoy. we also crafted an in-game event at the end of last year, which quickly generated strong interest and discussion in the players' circle, leading to a large inflow of returning users who rejoin the game. other games in the spotlight during the first quarter included life-after, onmyoji, identity v, and invincible. life-after has remained an iconic title with strong appeal among young users.
the new collaboration with the movie godzilla vs. kong in the first quarter was well-received by players as they fought off doomsday monsters. onmyoji also showed remarkable longevity remaining at the forefront of china's ios top-grossing chart. during the first quarter, we wrote out a highly anticipated ip collaboration with demon slayer, a classic japanese anime, further strengthening up onmyoji's position as a top acg game in china.
celebrating its third-year anniversary in april, identity v continues to draw the attention of young players bringing them a thrilling competitive experience with a distinctive gothic art style. between january to may, we hosted our annual global championship tournament, call of the abyss, with its finale being set in guangzhou, attracting close to 2 million game players globally to participate in this event. invincible remains steady in the first quarter with strong user engagement holding unwavering loyalty from its fan community. despite numerous invincible-like games popping up in the market, invincible has proven to be a trendsetting pioneer in this game genre.
this also echoes well with our corporate dna in product innovation. in terms of new games, we have launched a few new ones since the beginning of this year. we started with revelation mobile game in january. as we discussed last quarter, this is our self-developed rpg game based on our flagship pc title capturing both returning fans and brand new mmo players.
we then launched elysium of legends in march, our self-developed card rpg game that brings together legendary figures in chinese history. shortly after these releases, those games reached the top of the ios download chart in china. on the licensed front, in january, we introduced yu-gi-oh! duel links, a competitive card game based on the most nostalgic ip that we licensed from konami. and more recently in may, we brought the highly anticipated casual game pokemon quest through our domestic audience, featuring cute-shaped pokemon.
the game invites players could befriend and create their pokemon team to tap and battle through tumblecube island. shortly after its release, pokemon quest quickly climbed to the top of the ios downloads chart in china. in the overseas market, we continued our efforts to expand our offerings while maintaining the steady operation of our existing titles. knives out, once again, reached the no.
1 spot on japan's ios top-grossing chart a couple of times during the first quarter. following a collaboration with well-known japanese ip, the promised neverland, in february, identity v was also crowned no. 2 on japan's ios top-grossing chart. the success of these games has helped us to gain a much better understanding of japanese users and their preferences, allowing us to be more sophisticated in localization efforts.
for instance, we found that japanese users greatly value the sense of occasion. users want to feel the grandness and ceremonial appeal in each game event, take knives out as an example. knives out day, the widely anticipated annual celebration officially recognized by the japanese anniversary association since 2019 marked the start of the game's annual carnival on may the 5th, which includes the biggest youth sports championship tournament in japan as well as other exciting activities. we invited all of our users, brought millions of them online on that day and the event has become one of the top-trending topics on twitter in japan for the past two years.
with a couple of titles gaining popularity and recognition already in the overseas markets today, we are hopeful that our upcoming releases will bring the next generation of games to the world stage and to further expand our footprint in more regions particularly in the u.s. and europe. in april, we launched infinite lagrange in europe. similar to invincible, we expect infinite lagrange, our first globally targeted slg game, to ramp up its revenue gradually and show a similar upwards trend and longevity with time.
this game will be next available in the u.s. and other overseas markets over the coming months. as our very first next-gen slg, we have it under development for a number of years. we hope that this title will extend our success in slg into overseas markets.
the highly anticipated harry potter: magic awakened is also on track to meet eager audiences. we are thrilled to bring this game to wizard fans soon, taking players around the world on a magical adventure. earlier this month, we announced that we join hands with our polish partner,11 bit studios, to develop and publish the mobile version of the world-renowned ip, frostpunk, globally. later this year, players will be able to access this elaborately crafted post-apocalypse social survival game on mobile platforms.
in addition, we have a handful of other exciting titles in our pipeline. adding to those we just mentioned, our pipeline also includes the lord of the rings: rise to war, nightmare breaker, diablo immortal, and ghost world chronicle. for more details on these titles, please join our annual product launch event on may 20th, two days later, which will be hosted online this year and will have a dedicated english section for our global game players and business partners for the first time. we are proud of our world-class r&d infrastructure, which has been pivotal in maintaining a competitive edge in this market and delivering long-term value.
the most important element is our people. with that in mind, we encourage our talent to share and exchange ideas with industry veterans worldwide. we just hosted the 2021 netease game developers summit in april with a three-day forum covering topics like game design, arts, and technology. the event brought together our internal developers as well as external industrial partners including gurus in the western game industry and developers community to share their vast game development philosophies and experiences, sparking wide attention from developers, game players, and many others in the industry.
now turning to our education business, youdao achieved strong and sustainable growth in the first quarter. total net revenues from youdao increased by 147% year over year to rmb1.3 billion. and overall gross margin significantly improved to 57%, reaching a new record since its ipo back in 2019. gross billings from the youdao k-12 segment were up 130% year over year despite a high base last year due to the outbreak of covid-19.
k-12 paid student enrollment double year over year to 306,000. in order to match the growing scale and ensure the optimum teaching quality, we continue to strengthen our servicing team, which comprises 197 instructors and over 4,000 well-trained tutors by the end of the first quarter. given that different syllabus is used in different parts of china, one of the most important agenda for us is to ensure localized content for courses we offer. we took our junior high school chinese as the pilot case.
during the past spring semester, we launched up to 31 versions of junior high school chinese, meeting the needs of students in 31 different provinces. the localized courses have turned out to be very effective and very welcomed by our students. net revenue of youdao's learning devices also continued a year-over-year growth of 280%. in march, we introduced a dictionary pen 3.0 pro version, further supporting bilingual translation of chinese and korean languages to meet the demand of a wider range of language learners.
youdao also further integrated the functions of our dictionary pen and youdao dictionary app, making the offline-online transition even more efficient and effortless. looking and heading to 2021, we are confident that youdao will continue to grow its position as a leading provider of intelligent learning services and products, and our diversified business models, products, and technologies will give us the upper hand in the evolving after-school tutoring and test market. for our cloud music business, we have come a long way. celebrating its eighth-year anniversary last month, we are proud to say that we have sought and created new possibilities for music in this digital era.
our platform, which features a vast and highly interactive content community has become a widely recognized household name that is seen as a cultural emblem among, particularly, the post-90s or younger generation. with a large base of young music lovers on our platform, we are more willing to explore and discover music. we have been the creative outlet and a natural stage for independent musicians to shine. we strongly believe independent artists as a crucial driving force for the music industry and our platform uniquely positions us to nurture them in the modern era.
in april, we held our annual signature event, the indie music artists ceremony for the third time, celebrating the past year of their music and encouraging independent musicians to continue creating their remarkable work. in addition to our original music, we want to continue bringing together a library of new, unique, and influential music pieces from around the world and providing music fans with the ultimate audio experience. we have just announced a direct digital distribution partnership with sony music entertainment, one of the world's three largest recording companies. following you umg, this is the second direct licensing arrangement we have signed with the big three labels and we are proud to see these positive changes happening in the music industry in china.
moving on to yanxuan, as a private-label consumer brand, we further strengthened our brand appeal among the young middle class, developing products that revolve around their need. centered around this notion and along with yanxuan's fifth-year anniversary, we developed a new value proposition ""live the way you like"" through a promotion intended to express the voice of the new middle class. this campaign resonated strongly with its intended audience, sparking lively discussions. during the last year, we rolled out a range of highly popular yanxuan products, which have sold well since their introduction.
our strategy to incubate more hit products has paved a smooth path for us to strengthen yanxuan's product portfolio. we recently introduced a number of new-style products such as our proprietary laundry pods, wireless earbuds, bathroom fragrance, which quickly became top-selling products on multiple platforms, and some of the most recognized products in those emerging categories. we see potential in many of our proprietary products and we are working to introduce a greater number of signature products this year. additionally, we continued to optimize our operating efficiency in the first quarter.
during the quarter, both our inventory turnover days and the fulfillment efficiency were improving. in summary, we are off to a strong start in 2021. our game portfolio is getting ready for exciting new titles for both domestic and global players, while our existing games continue to hold strong. our online education, music, and e-commerce businesses are each on solid footing as well.
premium and diverse content creation across our businesses continues to be our primary objective as we move forward, entering a new phase of growth and generating additional value for all of our users and stakeholders. this concludes william's comments. i will now provide a very brief overview of our first-quarter 2021 financial results. given the limited time on today's call, i will be presenting some abbreviated financial highlights.
we encourage you to read through our press release issued earlier today for further details. total net revenues for the first quarter were rmb20.5 billion or us$3.1 billion, representing a 20% increase year over year. our net revenues from online game services were rmb15 billion, up 11% year over year. this year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased revenue contribution from the newly launched revelation mobile game, fantasy westward journey h5, as well as pc games such as fantasy westward journey online.
net revenues from our mobile games accounted for approximately 73% of net revenues from online game services in the first quarter. youdao's net revenues reached rmb1.3 billion, up 148% year over year, driven by the fast growth of both its online courses and sales of intelligent learning devices. net revenues from innovative businesses and others were rmb4.2 billion for the first quarter, up 40% year over year, mainly due to increased contribution from netease cloud music, as well as yanxuan and cc live streaming. our total gross profit margin was 53.9% in the first quarter with a breakdown as follows.
gp margin for our online game services was 64.6%. as a reminder, this number is generally stable with some narrow fluctuation based on the revenue mix of mobile and pc titles, as well as self-developed and licensed games. gross margin for youdao was 57.3%, compared with 43.5% in the same period of last year. the significant growth was primarily attributable to the improved gross margin from learning services due to the economies of scale and the continuous optimization effort of its cost structure.
it is also due to the substantial sales growth of the smart learning hardware such as youdao dictionary pen, which carries a higher gross margin than other hardware product lines. gp margin for innovative businesses and others was 14.4%, compared with 15.8% in the first quarter of last year. while the margins for netease cloud music and yanxuan have improved year over year significantly, the impact was partially offset by the decrease in gp margin from the rest of the business segment in this line. for the first quarter, total operating expenses were rmb6.8 billion, representing 33% of the total net revenues.
our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue were 13.5% in the quarter. excluding youdao, our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue was below 10%, lower than the previous quarters. as a reminder, fluctuation in selling and marketing as a percentage of revenue largely depends on the number of new games' launches in a particular quarter, the genre they are in, and the most suitable marketing plans adopted for each new game launches. r&d expenses were rmb3.1 billion, largely stable from the previous quarter.
we remain committed to investing in content creation and product development, which is core to our revenue growth. as a percentage of net revenue, r&d expenses were 14.9%, compared with 15.3% last quarter. effective tax rate in this quarter was 22%. the effective tax rate represents certain estimates by the company regarding the tax obligations and benefits applicable to it in each quarter.
non-gaap net income attributable to our shareholders for the first quarter totaled rmb5.1 billion or us$776 million. our non-gaap basic earnings per ads were rmb7.58 or us$1.16. our cash position remains strong. as of the quarter-end, our total cash and cash equivalents, current and noncurrent time deposits, and short-term investment balance totaled rmb106 billion, compared with rmb100 billion as of the year-end last year.
in accordance with our dividend policy, we are very pleased to report that our board of directors has approved a dividend of us$0.06 per share or us$0.3 per ads. lastly, under the share repurchase program approved by our board, approximately 3 million ads have been repurchased in the first quarter for a total cost of approximately us$330 million. thank you for your attention. we would like now to open the call to your questions.

[operator instructions] and we will now take the first question from alex yao from jpmorgan. please go ahead.
alex yao -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
[foreign language]thank you, management, for taking my question. i have a question on teenager in-game indulgence and the new policy introduction. can you share with us your policies on teenager in-game indulgence protection? and also how should we think about the impact of the recently introduced new policy that minors cannot play a game during the weekend? they can only play the game at a specific time, i.e. 8 pm to 9 pm from friday to sunday.
what's -- how should we think about the financial and the operational impact to your gaming business? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
yes. i'm sure many of you have read on the news about the new anti-addiction protection measures that the government has issued on teenagers underage kids. there are some very prudent requirements such as only three hours a week is allowed to play games. as one of the largest gaming companies in china, we're in full support of this decision.
over the past years, we have noticed there are certain games around the industry that has had a negative impact on children. and then -- so we think that the new requirements, the new regulations will keep teenagers away from away from games for as far as possible. so we want companies in this industry together to support this regulation requirement. and also, financially, we would like to share with you that less than 1% of our revenue actually comes from under-aged children.
thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
yeah, alex, just to clarify, when we say less than 1%, the -- we are defining minors at age below 18. different companies might have disclosed different data but according to china law, minors [foreign language] definition is for people below the age of 18. for that category of population, it accounts for less than 1% of our total games gross billing financial implication.
margaret shi -- investor relations director
thank you. next?
operator
and we will now take our next question from kenneth fong from credit suisse. please go ahead.
kenneth fong -- credit suisse -- analyst
[foreign language]thank you for taking my question. i have two questions. one is the new regulation for online game boost, particularly to limit the exposure for the underage. while the short-term financial impact will be limited, how should we think about clearer cultivation going forward, and will that limit the longer-term or medium-term potential for games growth? the second question is with no more exclusivity for the music copyrights, how should we think about our direction, pace as well as investment in the music copyright and content going forward? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
yes. on the first question, we think that the healthy wholesome growth of our children is a top priority for the nation, for the government. and as a company, we need to think about our social responsibility. we need to think about -- think long-term and for the greatness of the society so we are interested in -- in making positive high-quality games that appeal to adults and appeal to the audience around the globe.
well, we are not as interested in making a profit in -- through minors. and to answer your second question, as you might have just noticed that tme has just announced the -- made announcements about relinquishing the exclusivity, and we certainly hope that is a sincere announcement from tme, it's not a decision. they are not going to be saying one thing and do another. here, we want to appeal to the opportunity to appeal to every -- to the label companies and every stakeholder and partners in the industry to co-create a wholesome, balanced news industry.
and netease with ultimate sincerity and sufficient funding, we want to work together with -- as one in this industry.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
i would also like to add that we are very thankful for the right decision that the regulatory bodies have made relating to the antitrust regulations and policies. the antitrust policy sends a very clear and positive, and very exciting signal to the entire industry, which is widely anticipated and warmly welcomed by users. thank you.
kenneth fong -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you.
margaret shi -- investor relations director
thank you, kenneth. next question.
operator
and we will now take the next question from alex poon from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
alex poon -- morgan stanley -- analyst
[foreign language]i'll translate myself. my question is related to the strong game pipeline in the second half, including lord of the rings, naraka bladepoint, harry potter, and nightmare breaker, etc. all of these games are very strong titles. how should we think about the game revenue growth and the contribution from these games, especially starting in fourth quarter? thank you very much.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, alex. i'll answer your question directly in english.as you may know, naraka bladepoint was already launched in the summer and we have made another major breakthrough on steam platform. this -- again, this is not only a new genre game but also a new achievement. i think very excited to witness.
next month is going to be busy. harry potter, lord of the rings, and a few other games are all set to launch in september with a few others in the later half of this year. the one thing though, i want to reiterate is that netease -- here at netease, we always emphasize on the quality of the games, the longevity of the games, and the user appreciation and receptivity of these games. we are not so much interested in the financial ups and downs in one particular quarter or two, but rather we are very confident that our relentless effort in launching these new games will continue to diversify our game genre offerings, continue to advance our global expansion initiatives, as well as gaining more market share across different categories of the games.
and to echo what william commented earlier on, we really think the open secret of winning the heart of the gamers is through the quality and the content, rather than any other tricks or measures. so, alex, hopefully, that answers your question.
alex poon -- morgan stanley -- analyst
[foreign language] charles, thank you.
operator
and we will now take the next question from natalie wu from haitong international. please go ahead.
natalie wu -- haitong international -- analyst
[foreign language]thanks, mr. ding, charles, and margaret for taking my question and congratulations on another solid quarter. so my question is regarding the game naraka. so just wondering what's management's expectation for the game? regarding the revenue model, what kind of the revenue will come from -- what percentage of the revenue will come from the copy-based and item-based revenue model.
and then also how should we see the longevity of this game? and will there be more derivative versions of another genre of naraka coming out in the future? and also, will this success have any potential shift on our strategic focus and investment in the future? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
thank you. thank you, natalie. they also come from two points. yes, so the game right now, we've got the mix of copy-based sales and also in-game purchase.
as of today, the items -- the in-game items that we've created have been very attractive to our players, which have caused a very encouraging sale of in-game items.so today, our in-game purchases actually contribute more than the copy-based sales. going forward, we'll continue to create more in-game items and functions that appeal to our worldwide users. in terms of longevity, we have a long-term plan for this game. today, we actually host -- we have arranged a number of very exciting esports campaigns in china and abroad.
we'll continue to introduce and launch new characters, new gameplays to keep the content interesting to our users. so we are very confident with the longevity of this game. in terms of the strategy going onto different formats of entertainment, we're actually going to launch this game on consoles around christmas time and we also have a team working on the mobile version of this game. and at the same time, we have -- we host equal campaigns around the world to keep creating various -- to keep the interest high around the game and that will keep creating viral discussions of the game.
so that's -- so we have a very holistic plan for naraka bladepoint. thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
and, natalie, to your last part of the question, whether we -- whether there is any inspiration for our overall games strategy.i think the breakthrough achieved by naraka bladepoint, it gives us extra confidence in terms of diversification, not only in game genres, but also in different distribution platforms. for instance, naraka bladepoint is a very successful game that has tapped into the global, particularly the western gamer community, via steam platform. i think that gives us more experience and know-hows of developing and publishing future games, especially toward the global market. ok.
operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you. we will now take our next question from thomas chong, from jefferies. please go ahead.
thomas chong -- jefferies -- analyst
[foreign language]thanks, management, for taking my questions. my first question is about harry potter. given the game is going to be launched worldwide, just want to get a sense of our expectation for this game in the domestic market versus the overseas market. any color about our marketing strategy, the way that we attract users? any strategy can be shared, i would be grateful.
and then my second question is about the recent for regulatory and requirements. given the government is having stringent measures about the fandom culture in china and more regulations on the live streaming these days, just want to get a sense about -- how the fandom culture will affect our music business and also our live-streaming outlook? thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, thomas. i will answer your first question on harry potter directly in english. and william will comment on your second question. for harry potter, it is set to launch in the greater china area on the 9th of september, which is about nine days from now, highly anticipated.
given the strong popularity and global appeal of the harry potter ip, we're very confident that the high-quality game will be a huge success, both domestically and in the international market. with this game launch, we are hopeful that it can further reinforce the netease game brand image among the global gamer community. that's the answer to your first question.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
yeah. so we are actually in support of the recent regulations on the entertainment industry. for netease cloud music that we think the main impact for us is somewhat minimal because for us the priority, the strategic goal, is about creating original music.so our focus is about helping independent musicians to create music, and those talented individuals in china. thank you.
thomas chong -- jefferies -- analyst

charles yang -- chief financial officer
operator, next question, please. thank you, thomas.
operator
thank you. we will now take the next question from eddie leung, from bank of america merrill lynch. please go ahead.
eddie leung -- bank of america meriill lynch -- analyst
[foreign language]we have two questions. the first one is on the tax rate. we understand that certain internet companies couldn't get the approval for -- to enjoy a preferential tax rate of key software subsidiaries recently. so just wonder if netease would see any impact to the tax rate? and then secondly, regarding the overseas game markets, so we expect netease to set up more overseas studios.
and if so, any more color on the future plan? thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
ok. thank you, eddie. well, in the interest of time, let me answer your two questions directly in english. firstly, on the tax rate, this is, in fact, not a new development in our 20-f issued earlier this year.
we have already disclosed that there will be certain tax policy changes as announced by the tax bureau earlier this year. certain industries, including e-commerce, games, etc., are no longer eligible for the key software qualification. as a result, we can no longer enjoy the 10% preferential tax rate. however, specifically for netease, for game businesses, we are still entitled to the high tag of qualification, which grants us a 15% preferential tax rate.
net-net, we believe these tax rate changes will have, roughly speaking, about 3% implication to us.so 2020, our overall effective tax rate is around 19%. i think this year, for 2021, at full-year level, our tax rate will be somewhere in the low 20 level pool. secondly, for our overseas gaming expansion, we've previously announced our ambition to achieve at least 30% of our game gross billing contributed from the overseas market in three to five years' time. we are very well on track to achieve that.
naraka bladepoint is a matter of big, exciting achievements that we have achieved this year. for the overseas market, we are now very proactively setting up overseas studios in canada, in japan, and in europe. our -- the format of our collaboration -- or rather the format or strategies for us to tap into the international market can be very diversified, doesn't necessarily require us to set up our own stand-alone studios. we are also very active in collaborating with world-class players around the world, supplementing each other's strengths.
in some cases, jointly develop or co-develop hit gains that's targeting for the global gamer community. i think netease remains very open-minded, very practical, and very, very active in this regard.
eddie leung -- bank of america meriill lynch -- analyst
[foreign language]
charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, eddie. operator, in the interest of time, let us conclude the call today. thank you all very much.

charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, margareth, and thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call. before we begin, i would like to remind everyone that all percentages are calculated based on renminbi. our growth momentum continued in the second quarter with total net revenues of rmb 20.5 billion, representing an increase of 13% year over year. but for our online games, in the second quarter, total revenue was rmb 14.5 billion, up 5% year over year despite a high comparable base in 2020.
our pc and mobile games remained our dual growth engines for online games. on the pc side, naraka bladepoint, our next-generation battle royale game is one of the hottest games in the market. first launched in china in july, followed by the global launch in august 12th, naraka bladepoint quickly became the best weekly seller on steam, winning the enthusiasm of chinese and overseas players, and marking a new breakthrough for us in the global market. with captivating gameplay and state-of-the-art graphics, naraka bladepoint's debut was very well received among hardcore players in western markets.
we will continue this positive trend by introducing more content from different cultures around the world and start to work on other formats of the game, including console games and mobile versions as we look to tap into these large market opportunities in china and abroad. our legacy flagship pc titles, particularly fwj, new westward journey online, and tianxia continue to show remarkable longevity with strong year-over-year growth for nearly two decades of operation. we have created a strong and sophisticated social community within each game and we continue to keep our users engaged with regular introduction of high-quality expansion packs. this type of longevity has also been extended to the mobile side.
fantasy westward journey mobile game, westward journey online mobile game and their spin-offs continue to demonstrate strong performances during the second quarter. touching on some highlights from a few other mobile games this quarter, lifeafter remains an iconic title, holding strong appeal with young users. we introduced a major annual expansion pack, the revenant in august, offering players a new category of characters, new maps, and more gameplay options. these innovations allow our gamers to explore the doomsday world in an unprecedented and exciting way, bringing lifeafter back to the top of china's ios download chart.
onmyoji arena, our mobile game based on our proprietary onmyoji ip, has progressively built strong appeal among the young generation of players. leveraging our strength in art design, onmyoji arena has impressed users with its widely acclaimed skin art across various themes, including chinese traditional culture, cyberpunk, and japanese anime. some of these game designs have even become high trending topics, bringing us a continuous stream of new players. onmyoji, the original flagship game is another netease game that continues to shine and frequently leads china's ios top grossing chart.
during the second quarter, we rolled out a new version that's greatly enriched the onmyoji world. the update features a fascinating new storyline and two popular new characters that thrilled our player community, again fortifying onmyoji spending as a hot agc theme game in china. during the second quarter and more recently, we have also expanded our offerings in new genres as we continue to diversify our game portfolio. we launched ace racer in july, our very first self-developed racing game.
leveraging our industry-leading art and graphics capabilities, ace racer featured track designs based on real urban landscapes of chinese cities, such as [inaudible] and [inaudible]. shortly after its release, ace racer tops the ios download chart and reached the top ten on china's ios grossing chart. two weeks ago, infinite lagrange our space-themed slg game made a strong debut in china, climbing up into a top 3, third -- top 30 title on the ios grossing chart in less than a week. as a new game of this genre, we introduced to the chinese market after invincible.
we hope infinite lagrange will also earn the respect of game players and a good share of the slg market through its content innovation. other new games that we recently launched in china include pokã©mon quest, marvel super war. these games further enrich our dynamic domestic game portfolio genres, and many of them quickly reached the top of the ios downloads chart following their releases. moving to overseas market, we are very excited to see our gains keep reaching new milestones outside of china.
over three years ago, knives out made its name in japan and became one of the highest-grossing games ever made by a chinese game developer to go overseas. knives out has held its leading position and continues to take its place in the upper echelons of japan's ios top grossing chart, particularly when following various collaborations with well-known local japanese ips, such as eva and one punch. today, naraka bladepoint has emerged as our next breakthrough on the international stage, which further boosts our global expansion asset by opening the door to the mainstream western market. on steam alone, naraka bladepoint has achieved the milestone of 100,000 peak concurrent users.
and the number will be even higher when we include players who played a game on our official channels. as one of our global initiatives, naraka bladepoint start off with chinese martial art culture and then substantially broadens this concept to eastern fantasy by introducing universal elements more familiar to western players, such as new characters like persian warriors and new weapons such as muskets and canons. these elaborate designs have greatly helped fuel strong mind share among hardcore player community in the western market. furthermore, for harry potter: magic awakened, one of the market's most anticipated titles, we closed the final round of beta testing in june with very encouraging user feedback.
it is now set for launch on september 9th across chinese mainland, hong kong, macau, and taiwan. and will be successively launched to various other regions, globally. we look forward to seeing eager global players become hogwarts freshmen, meet diversified wizard partners, learn spells, gain magic knowledge and experience the amazing life of wizardry. the lord of the rings: rise to war is another exciting title coming soon.
pre-registration for this game has been available since august 25th. with engaging and thought-provoking gameplay as well as the strong appeal of the lord of the rings ip, we see great potential for this release and look forward to impressing players with its global launch, which is now confirmed to be on september 23rd. for diablo immortal, in july, we had our first beta testing in china, and we are very excited about the strong feedback from the user community. we will keep working to bring our worldwide players engaging game experiences.
the list goes on. we have a handful of other exciting titles in our pipeline as well. a few other pre-announced names include nightmare breaker, a pc game, and ghost world chronicle. our mission to create world-class games for players has never wavered.
we are relentlessly scaling new highs in terms of game development technology. our game engine is one of the key assets within our r&d infrastructure. recently, we've made a significant step forward with one of our flagship game engines, messiah, in which we are planning to have implemented the world's first high-quality real-time global illumination algorithm in our mobile devices. this is a major breakthrough with our in-house engine technology, helping us to greatly speed up the pace of our artistic development and bringing world-class visual effects into our games.
turning to youdao, our next revenues in the second quarter were rmb 1.3 billion, representing a 108% growth year over year. as an intelligent learning company, youdao is and has always been committed to enhancing its competitiveness for the young generations through advanced technology. in line with evolving national guidelines, our aim is to explore new strategic opportunities in non-academic businesses, such as steam courses, adult learning, and smart learning hardware devices. in the second quarter, we further expanded our steam course offering.
for example, net's revenues from youdao go, youdao [inaudible], increased by nearly 180% quarter over quarter. and we launched more advanced level courses to further meet our users' growing learning needs. back in march, with an eye toward the growth opportunities in adult education sector, we established a dedicated division on adult education by integrating our youdao premium courses for adults, china university mooc, and netease cloud classroom. in terms of premium courses for adults, its net revenue is accounted for around 22% of total net revenues in the second quarter.
meanwhile, we launched an upgraded version of our practical english course to provide adult users with more immersive and effective learning experiences. in addition, 137 courses on the china university mooc platform have been certified by the ministry of education as recommended courses for academic studies and continued career development. learning devices remain another major revenue source for youdao with a mission to improve learning efficiency. this segment generated net revenues of rmb 206 million in the second quarter, increasing 139% year over year.
we also introduced a new version of our dictionary pen, youdao dictionary pen k3, designed to be more friendly to elementary school and pre-k kids more affordable and supportive of learning arithmetic in addition to english and chinese. with that said, we expect youdao to be somewhat less affected by the recent regulations as it has other high-growth businesses in addition to existing k-12 [inaudible] after-school tutoring classes, whose revenues accounted for around 41% of youdao's total revenue in the second quarter. looking ahead, youdao will continue to strictly comply with national guidelines and we are confident in youdao's future development as youdao has one of the most talented r&d and teaching skill sets in the industry. looking at our cloud music business, we have successfully maintained our user gross momentum over the past quarters despite an industrywide slowdown.
while dau over mau ratio remained above 30% in the second quarter, owing to our advanced social networking functions and promotion like vip program in second quarter, our membership paying ratio almost doubled year over year. in terms of margin, we continue to see improvements with our cloud music business as it increases its scale. in the past quarter, netease cloud music achieved positive gross margin for the first time ever, marking a new milestone with our music operations. we believe that our ongoing top-line growth in this segment will position us to continue driving margin expansion over time.
we keep our users engaged through constant innovation and product improvement. earlier this year, we gave our price-winning function, listen together, another new touch, allowing users to listen to music together not only with friends but also with other users, providing additional social networking opportunities. furthermore, our newly launched function, playlist sharing, [foreign language] has been very well received by our users, allowing multiple users to co-create and manage playlists at the same time. on the content side, we are pleased to see the changes that the music industry is currently undergoing, which pave the way for strong and sustainable growth over the long term.

for cloud music, both membership and the streaming revenues maintained solid growth momentum driven by robust paying user expansion. overall, total gross profit margin was 54.5% with a breakdown as follows: the gross profit margin for game services was 66.1%. as a reminder, this number is generally stable, with some narrow saturation based on the revenue mix of pc versus mobile games as well as self-developed and licensed games. gross margin for youdao was 52.3%, compared with 45.2% in the same period of last year.
the significant year-over-year growth was mainly attributable to the improved learning services gross margin, which was due to improved economies of scale and continuous optimization of its faculty compensation structure. substantial sales, growth of smart learning hardware such as youdao dictionary pen 3.0 also contributed to these gains, as this line carries a higher gp margin than another product line. the gross profit margin for innovative businesses and others was 19.3%, compared with 18.5% last year. the improvement was mostly driven by netease cloud music as its gross margin turned positive for the first time during the quarter.
for the second quarter, post-operating expenses were rmb 7.4 billion or 36% of our total net revenue. our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue were 14.7%. if we exclude youdao, our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue were 10.6%, compared with 10.7% in the second quarter of last year. r&d expenses were rmb 3.4 billion, largely stable from the previous quarter.

non-gaap net income attributable to our shareholders for the second quarter totaled rmb 4.2 billion or usd 655 million. our non-gaap basic earnings for ads were usd 0.89 or 0.20 per share. our cash position remains strong. as of june 30th, our total cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current time deposits, and short-term investment balance totaled rmb 1.8 billion, compared with rmb 100 billion as of the end of last year.

[operator instructions] and we will now take the first question from alex yao from jpmorgan. please go ahead.
alex yao -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
[foreign language]thank you, management, for taking my question. i have a question on teenager in-game indulgence and the new policy introduction. can you share with us your policies on teenager in-game indulgence protection? and also how should we think about the impact of the recently introduced new policy that minors cannot play a game during the weekend? they can only play the game at a specific time, i.e. 8 pm to 9 pm from friday to sunday.
what's -- how should we think about the financial and the operational impact to your gaming business? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
yes. i'm sure many of you have read on the news about the new anti-addiction protection measures that the government has issued on teenagers underage kids. there are some very prudent requirements such as only three hours a week is allowed to play games. as one of the largest gaming companies in china, we're in full support of this decision.
over the past years, we have noticed there are certain games around the industry that has had a negative impact on children. and then -- so we think that the new requirements, the new regulations will keep teenagers away from away from games for as far as possible. so we want companies in this industry together to support this regulation requirement. and also, financially, we would like to share with you that less than 1% of our revenue actually comes from under-aged children.
thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
yeah, alex, just to clarify, when we say less than 1%, the -- we are defining minors at age below 18. different companies might have disclosed different data but according to china law, minors [foreign language] definition is for people below the age of 18. for that category of population, it accounts for less than 1% of our total games gross billing financial implication.
margaret shi -- investor relations director
thank you. next?
operator
and we will now take our next question from kenneth fong from credit suisse. please go ahead.
kenneth fong -- credit suisse -- analyst
[foreign language]thank you for taking my question. i have two questions. one is the new regulation for online game boost, particularly to limit the exposure for the underage. while the short-term financial impact will be limited, how should we think about clearer cultivation going forward, and will that limit the longer-term or medium-term potential for games growth? the second question is with no more exclusivity for the music copyrights, how should we think about our direction, pace as well as investment in the music copyright and content going forward? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
yes. on the first question, we think that the healthy wholesome growth of our children is a top priority for the nation, for the government. and as a company, we need to think about our social responsibility. we need to think about -- think long-term and for the greatness of the society so we are interested in -- in making positive high-quality games that appeal to adults and appeal to the audience around the globe.
well, we are not as interested in making a profit in -- through minors. and to answer your second question, as you might have just noticed that tme has just announced the -- made announcements about relinquishing the exclusivity, and we certainly hope that is a sincere announcement from tme, it's not a decision. they are not going to be saying one thing and do another. here, we want to appeal to the opportunity to appeal to every -- to the label companies and every stakeholder and partners in the industry to co-create a wholesome, balanced news industry.
and netease with ultimate sincerity and sufficient funding, we want to work together with -- as one in this industry.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
i would also like to add that we are very thankful for the right decision that the regulatory bodies have made relating to the antitrust regulations and policies. the antitrust policy sends a very clear and positive, and very exciting signal to the entire industry, which is widely anticipated and warmly welcomed by users. thank you.
kenneth fong -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you.
margaret shi -- investor relations director
thank you, kenneth. next question.
operator
and we will now take the next question from alex poon from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
alex poon -- morgan stanley -- analyst
[foreign language]i'll translate myself. my question is related to the strong game pipeline in the second half, including lord of the rings, naraka bladepoint, harry potter, and nightmare breaker, etc. all of these games are very strong titles. how should we think about the game revenue growth and the contribution from these games, especially starting in fourth quarter? thank you very much.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, alex. i'll answer your question directly in english.as you may know, naraka bladepoint was already launched in the summer and we have made another major breakthrough on steam platform. this -- again, this is not only a new genre game but also a new achievement. i think very excited to witness.
next month is going to be busy. harry potter, lord of the rings, and a few other games are all set to launch in september with a few others in the later half of this year. the one thing though, i want to reiterate is that netease -- here at netease, we always emphasize on the quality of the games, the longevity of the games, and the user appreciation and receptivity of these games. we are not so much interested in the financial ups and downs in one particular quarter or two, but rather we are very confident that our relentless effort in launching these new games will continue to diversify our game genre offerings, continue to advance our global expansion initiatives, as well as gaining more market share across different categories of the games.
and to echo what william commented earlier on, we really think the open secret of winning the heart of the gamers is through the quality and the content, rather than any other tricks or measures. so, alex, hopefully, that answers your question.
alex poon -- morgan stanley -- analyst
[foreign language] charles, thank you.
operator
and we will now take the next question from natalie wu from haitong international. please go ahead.
natalie wu -- haitong international -- analyst
[foreign language]thanks, mr. ding, charles, and margaret for taking my question and congratulations on another solid quarter. so my question is regarding the game naraka. so just wondering what's management's expectation for the game? regarding the revenue model, what kind of the revenue will come from -- what percentage of the revenue will come from the copy-based and item-based revenue model.
and then also how should we see the longevity of this game? and will there be more derivative versions of another genre of naraka coming out in the future? and also, will this success have any potential shift on our strategic focus and investment in the future? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
thank you. thank you, natalie. they also come from two points. yes, so the game right now, we've got the mix of copy-based sales and also in-game purchase.
as of today, the items -- the in-game items that we've created have been very attractive to our players, which have caused a very encouraging sale of in-game items.so today, our in-game purchases actually contribute more than the copy-based sales. going forward, we'll continue to create more in-game items and functions that appeal to our worldwide users. in terms of longevity, we have a long-term plan for this game. today, we actually host -- we have arranged a number of very exciting esports campaigns in china and abroad.
we'll continue to introduce and launch new characters, new gameplays to keep the content interesting to our users. so we are very confident with the longevity of this game. in terms of the strategy going onto different formats of entertainment, we're actually going to launch this game on consoles around christmas time and we also have a team working on the mobile version of this game. and at the same time, we have -- we host equal campaigns around the world to keep creating various -- to keep the interest high around the game and that will keep creating viral discussions of the game.
so that's -- so we have a very holistic plan for naraka bladepoint. thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
and, natalie, to your last part of the question, whether we -- whether there is any inspiration for our overall games strategy.i think the breakthrough achieved by naraka bladepoint, it gives us extra confidence in terms of diversification, not only in game genres, but also in different distribution platforms. for instance, naraka bladepoint is a very successful game that has tapped into the global, particularly the western gamer community, via steam platform. i think that gives us more experience and know-hows of developing and publishing future games, especially toward the global market. ok.
operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you. we will now take our next question from thomas chong, from jefferies. please go ahead.
thomas chong -- jefferies -- analyst
[foreign language]thanks, management, for taking my questions. my first question is about harry potter. given the game is going to be launched worldwide, just want to get a sense of our expectation for this game in the domestic market versus the overseas market. any color about our marketing strategy, the way that we attract users? any strategy can be shared, i would be grateful.
and then my second question is about the recent for regulatory and requirements. given the government is having stringent measures about the fandom culture in china and more regulations on the live streaming these days, just want to get a sense about -- how the fandom culture will affect our music business and also our live-streaming outlook? thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, thomas. i will answer your first question on harry potter directly in english. and william will comment on your second question. for harry potter, it is set to launch in the greater china area on the 9th of september, which is about nine days from now, highly anticipated.
given the strong popularity and global appeal of the harry potter ip, we're very confident that the high-quality game will be a huge success, both domestically and in the international market. with this game launch, we are hopeful that it can further reinforce the netease game brand image among the global gamer community. that's the answer to your first question.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
yeah. so we are actually in support of the recent regulations on the entertainment industry. for netease cloud music that we think the main impact for us is somewhat minimal because for us the priority, the strategic goal, is about creating original music.so our focus is about helping independent musicians to create music, and those talented individuals in china. thank you.
thomas chong -- jefferies -- analyst

charles yang -- chief financial officer
operator, next question, please. thank you, thomas.
operator
thank you. we will now take the next question from eddie leung, from bank of america merrill lynch. please go ahead.
eddie leung -- bank of america meriill lynch -- analyst
[foreign language]we have two questions. the first one is on the tax rate. we understand that certain internet companies couldn't get the approval for -- to enjoy a preferential tax rate of key software subsidiaries recently. so just wonder if netease would see any impact to the tax rate? and then secondly, regarding the overseas game markets, so we expect netease to set up more overseas studios.
and if so, any more color on the future plan? thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
ok. thank you, eddie. well, in the interest of time, let me answer your two questions directly in english. firstly, on the tax rate, this is, in fact, not a new development in our 20-f issued earlier this year.
we have already disclosed that there will be certain tax policy changes as announced by the tax bureau earlier this year. certain industries, including e-commerce, games, etc., are no longer eligible for the key software qualification. as a result, we can no longer enjoy the 10% preferential tax rate. however, specifically for netease, for game businesses, we are still entitled to the high tag of qualification, which grants us a 15% preferential tax rate.
net-net, we believe these tax rate changes will have, roughly speaking, about 3% implication to us.so 2020, our overall effective tax rate is around 19%. i think this year, for 2021, at full-year level, our tax rate will be somewhere in the low 20 level pool. secondly, for our overseas gaming expansion, we've previously announced our ambition to achieve at least 30% of our game gross billing contributed from the overseas market in three to five years' time. we are very well on track to achieve that.
naraka bladepoint is a matter of big, exciting achievements that we have achieved this year. for the overseas market, we are now very proactively setting up overseas studios in canada, in japan, and in europe. our -- the format of our collaboration -- or rather the format or strategies for us to tap into the international market can be very diversified, doesn't necessarily require us to set up our own stand-alone studios. we are also very active in collaborating with world-class players around the world, supplementing each other's strengths.
in some cases, jointly develop or co-develop hit gains that's targeting for the global gamer community. i think netease remains very open-minded, very practical, and very, very active in this regard.
eddie leung -- bank of america meriill lynch -- analyst
[foreign language]
charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, eddie. operator, in the interest of time, let us conclude the call today. thank you all very much.

charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, margareth, and thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call. before we begin, i would like to remind everyone that all percentages are calculated based on renminbi. our growth momentum continued in the second quarter with total net revenues of rmb 20.5 billion, representing an increase of 13% year over year. but for our online games, in the second quarter, total revenue was rmb 14.5 billion, up 5% year over year despite a high comparable base in 2020.
our pc and mobile games remained our dual growth engines for online games. on the pc side, naraka bladepoint, our next-generation battle royale game is one of the hottest games in the market. first launched in china in july, followed by the global launch in august 12th, naraka bladepoint quickly became the best weekly seller on steam, winning the enthusiasm of chinese and overseas players, and marking a new breakthrough for us in the global market. with captivating gameplay and state-of-the-art graphics, naraka bladepoint's debut was very well received among hardcore players in western markets.
we will continue this positive trend by introducing more content from different cultures around the world and start to work on other formats of the game, including console games and mobile versions as we look to tap into these large market opportunities in china and abroad. our legacy flagship pc titles, particularly fwj, new westward journey online, and tianxia continue to show remarkable longevity with strong year-over-year growth for nearly two decades of operation. we have created a strong and sophisticated social community within each game and we continue to keep our users engaged with regular introduction of high-quality expansion packs. this type of longevity has also been extended to the mobile side.
fantasy westward journey mobile game, westward journey online mobile game and their spin-offs continue to demonstrate strong performances during the second quarter. touching on some highlights from a few other mobile games this quarter, lifeafter remains an iconic title, holding strong appeal with young users. we introduced a major annual expansion pack, the revenant in august, offering players a new category of characters, new maps, and more gameplay options. these innovations allow our gamers to explore the doomsday world in an unprecedented and exciting way, bringing lifeafter back to the top of china's ios download chart.
onmyoji arena, our mobile game based on our proprietary onmyoji ip, has progressively built strong appeal among the young generation of players. leveraging our strength in art design, onmyoji arena has impressed users with its widely acclaimed skin art across various themes, including chinese traditional culture, cyberpunk, and japanese anime. some of these game designs have even become high trending topics, bringing us a continuous stream of new players. onmyoji, the original flagship game is another netease game that continues to shine and frequently leads china's ios top grossing chart.
during the second quarter, we rolled out a new version that's greatly enriched the onmyoji world. the update features a fascinating new storyline and two popular new characters that thrilled our player community, again fortifying onmyoji spending as a hot agc theme game in china. during the second quarter and more recently, we have also expanded our offerings in new genres as we continue to diversify our game portfolio. we launched ace racer in july, our very first self-developed racing game.
leveraging our industry-leading art and graphics capabilities, ace racer featured track designs based on real urban landscapes of chinese cities, such as [inaudible] and [inaudible]. shortly after its release, ace racer tops the ios download chart and reached the top ten on china's ios grossing chart. two weeks ago, infinite lagrange our space-themed slg game made a strong debut in china, climbing up into a top 3, third -- top 30 title on the ios grossing chart in less than a week. as a new game of this genre, we introduced to the chinese market after invincible.
we hope infinite lagrange will also earn the respect of game players and a good share of the slg market through its content innovation. other new games that we recently launched in china include pokémon quest, marvel super war. these games further enrich our dynamic domestic game portfolio genres, and many of them quickly reached the top of the ios downloads chart following their releases. moving to overseas market, we are very excited to see our gains keep reaching new milestones outside of china.
over three years ago, knives out made its name in japan and became one of the highest-grossing games ever made by a chinese game developer to go overseas. knives out has held its leading position and continues to take its place in the upper echelons of japan's ios top grossing chart, particularly when following various collaborations with well-known local japanese ips, such as eva and one punch. today, naraka bladepoint has emerged as our next breakthrough on the international stage, which further boosts our global expansion asset by opening the door to the mainstream western market. on steam alone, naraka bladepoint has achieved the milestone of 100,000 peak concurrent users.
and the number will be even higher when we include players who played a game on our official channels. as one of our global initiatives, naraka bladepoint start off with chinese martial art culture and then substantially broadens this concept to eastern fantasy by introducing universal elements more familiar to western players, such as new characters like persian warriors and new weapons such as muskets and canons. these elaborate designs have greatly helped fuel strong mind share among hardcore player community in the western market. furthermore, for harry potter: magic awakened, one of the market's most anticipated titles, we closed the final round of beta testing in june with very encouraging user feedback.
it is now set for launch on september 9th across chinese mainland, hong kong, macau, and taiwan. and will be successively launched to various other regions, globally. we look forward to seeing eager global players become hogwarts freshmen, meet diversified wizard partners, learn spells, gain magic knowledge and experience the amazing life of wizardry. the lord of the rings: rise to war is another exciting title coming soon.

the list goes on. we have a handful of other exciting titles in our pipeline as well. a few other pre-announced names include nightmare breaker, a pc game, and ghost world chronicle. our mission to create world-class games for players has never wavered.
we are relentlessly scaling new highs in terms of game development technology. our game engine is one of the key assets within our r&d infrastructure. recently, we've made a significant step forward with one of our flagship game engines, messiah, in which we are planning to have implemented the world's first high-quality real-time global illumination algorithm in our mobile devices. this is a major breakthrough with our in-house engine technology, helping us to greatly speed up the pace of our artistic development and bringing world-class visual effects into our games.
turning to youdao, our next revenues in the second quarter were rmb 1.3 billion, representing a 108% growth year over year. as an intelligent learning company, youdao is and has always been committed to enhancing its competitiveness for the young generations through advanced technology. in line with evolving national guidelines, our aim is to explore new strategic opportunities in non-academic businesses, such as steam courses, adult learning, and smart learning hardware devices. in the second quarter, we further expanded our steam course offering.
for example, net's revenues from youdao go, youdao [inaudible], increased by nearly 180% quarter over quarter. and we launched more advanced level courses to further meet our users' growing learning needs. back in march, with an eye toward the growth opportunities in adult education sector, we established a dedicated division on adult education by integrating our youdao premium courses for adults, china university mooc, and netease cloud classroom. in terms of premium courses for adults, its net revenue is accounted for around 22% of total net revenues in the second quarter.
meanwhile, we launched an upgraded version of our practical english course to provide adult users with more immersive and effective learning experiences. in addition, 137 courses on the china university mooc platform have been certified by the ministry of education as recommended courses for academic studies and continued career development. learning devices remain another major revenue source for youdao with a mission to improve learning efficiency. this segment generated net revenues of rmb 206 million in the second quarter, increasing 139% year over year.
we also introduced a new version of our dictionary pen, youdao dictionary pen k3, designed to be more friendly to elementary school and pre-k kids more affordable and supportive of learning arithmetic in addition to english and chinese. with that said, we expect youdao to be somewhat less affected by the recent regulations as it has other high-growth businesses in addition to existing k-12 [inaudible] after-school tutoring classes, whose revenues accounted for around 41% of youdao's total revenue in the second quarter. looking ahead, youdao will continue to strictly comply with national guidelines and we are confident in youdao's future development as youdao has one of the most talented r&d and teaching skill sets in the industry. looking at our cloud music business, we have successfully maintained our user gross momentum over the past quarters despite an industrywide slowdown.
while dau over mau ratio remained above 30% in the second quarter, owing to our advanced social networking functions and promotion like vip program in second quarter, our membership paying ratio almost doubled year over year. in terms of margin, we continue to see improvements with our cloud music business as it increases its scale. in the past quarter, netease cloud music achieved positive gross margin for the first time ever, marking a new milestone with our music operations. we believe that our ongoing top-line growth in this segment will position us to continue driving margin expansion over time.
we keep our users engaged through constant innovation and product improvement. earlier this year, we gave our price-winning function, listen together, another new touch, allowing users to listen to music together not only with friends but also with other users, providing additional social networking opportunities. furthermore, our newly launched function, playlist sharing, [foreign language] has been very well received by our users, allowing multiple users to co-create and manage playlists at the same time. on the content side, we are pleased to see the changes that the music industry is currently undergoing, which pave the way for strong and sustainable growth over the long term.

we intend to launch harry potter to some overseas market as early as first half of next year. and given the huge fan base of the harry potter ip worldwide and particularly encouraged by the very strong performance of harry potter in china, we are hopeful that this game would become a worldwide transition. the publishing right is a commercial arrangement between netease time warner. for some of the markets, netease will be in charge of publishing whereby majority of the overseas market publishing will belong to time warner.

we will now take our next question from alicia yap from citi. please go ahead.
alicia yap -- citi -- analyst
[foreign language] my question is related to netease cloud music. so how do you see the overall competitive landscape and also the time spend dilution from the shop video platform? do you worry if the leading show video platform like doing that could enter more aggressively in the online us content that could actually put some some threat to cloud music over time and also affect the user time spend on cloud music? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
alicia. so yes, we do observe that at least in short term, short format video or other general video format has taken and some of the user time spent. that not only in music, but also in games in other forms of entertainment. but what's the major difference between music and the video is that music creates a resonance between users.
it creates that immersive experience for users. so video, if you after with on video, you probably don't want to watch it again. but for music, you tend to want to listen to it over and over again if it's a cute of music that you love. for your second question on potential new competitors, new entrants to the market.
our view is that this is a very open market we will very much welcome others to join and help those independent musicians in china to realize there. thank you.

we will now take our next question from natalie wu from haitong international. please go ahead.
natalie wu -- haitong international -- analyst
thank you. [foreign language] so my question is regarding naraka: bladepoint. just want to get an update of the copy based discount revenue contribution versus in game purchase revenue contribution at a point of 6 million copies worldwide? and also for each part, how should we understand the deferral treatment in terms of the revenue recognition? also, if management can share with us some thoughts on the longevity of this game. that will be great.
thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
ok. actually, in the interest of time, i'll answer that question directly in english. so firstly, on your question on revenue recognition. so both for the comp sales as well as the intact, we adopt the revenue deferral treatment over an expected lifespan.
so this is consistent with our revenue recognition treatment of other pc and mobile games. obviously, with the games being launched a few months back now the more the gross billings will come more and more from the in-app purchases, which we are very confident that naraka: bladepoint just like many of our other netease flagship titles will have a very time-proven longevity. we think a combination of stellar global sales record for copies as well as our longevity through operations through content update. this will create a unique model for the global pc games in terms of proving the longevity and sustainability of the gross billion over the longer term.
hopefully, that answers your question. 
natalie wu -- haitong international -- analyst
yes, very clear. thank you, charles.

we will now take our next question from kenneth fong from credit suisse. please go ahead.
kenneth fong -- credit suisse -- analyst
[foreign language] thank you management for taking my question. i have a question on netease cloud music. note that we have obtained the copyright authorization from employer entertainment recently and also the big 3. so how should we think about the pace of signing up new copyrights and impact and benefit on our content cost and the margin going forward?
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
over the last few years, the messages in china has not been perfect, which is why the industry players in music industry has been paying a much more expensive price to the label companies than anywhere else in the world, as everybody has seen on july 24, the authorities have gave guidelines to certain companies, asked them to give up exclusive rights. so i think overall, we would like to see is that we'd like to see to be able to pay a fair price to the labor companies across the world. and we are confident under the right direction. from authorities, the chinese china music industry will continue to converge into -- in the same -- in the right direction.
and secondly, we think that every music company in china should really be focusing on helping independent musicians to create good music, to create to relay positive messages. as a socially responsible company, netease cloud music having making those preparation and that is our agenda and that is our goal. thank you.

we will now take our next question from thomas chong from jefferies. please go ahead.
thomas chong -- jefferies -- analyst
[foreign language] my questions and congratulations on a very strong set of results. my question is about our m&a strategies as well as the use of cash. in addition, can management share about the course in terms of the trend in operating expenses?
charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, thomas. i'll answer your question directly in english. so firstly, for our m&a strategy, netease has always been a very -- we are always very focused in our core pillars of businesses: games, online music, online education, private label brand, yanxuan. so our business development will be concentrated in our major verticals.
and we obviously prefer and for the past two decades or so, we've been growing organically. but we also remain highly active to explore opportunistic opportunities to deploy m&a to further supplement our growth. so that's always been our consistent approach toward m&a. in terms of the cash proceeds used, again, we invest most of the cash into ourselves into our talent acquisition and retention into our content creation and it takes patience and it takes commitment.
for instance, a major title of next blockbuster game can easily take a few years with big budgets to develop. i think this is also one of our competitive edge that as a major game a powerhouse that we can afford and we can be determined to focus on what we are really good at and what we really want to create. opex trend is, i think netease has been listed for over 21 years and we've always had a very consistent approach into expense management. we focus greatly roi return given our strong cash balance sheet, we are not shy to spend money.
however, we never burn cash for the sake of spending money whenever we spend money in terms of selling marketing into r&d, it is ultimately roi driven that we want to make sure that the money we spend today may not necessarily give us the topline return within the same quarter, but we will be handsomely rewarded. as such, we expect that we maintain a prudent yet healthy level of selling marketing on the r&d front. we are committed to spend more. that is also encouraged by the authorities.
and i think that is also what a long-term sustainable technology company should do. thomas, that's the answer to your question.
thomas chong -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you and congratulations on a strong quarter again.

eddie leung -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
[foreign language] i should do the translation myself. i have a follow-up question on your pipeline for the overseas game market. we understand that a good game should be public across different regions, but there are also cultural and regulatory differences. so just wondering besides working with overseas studios, if your chinese studios will also be involved in game projects defined specifically for the overseas markets?
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
this answer comes from jon. so our china-based team, their main focus is on the chinese themed games that they know well for the chinese-speaking countries, but secondly, we also -- we have been putting a lot of energy and resources in games that targeted for the global launch. so for those games, we think about gameplay, the world view and all the details in a global manner. and for those types of games is typically joint developed by our china-based team and some of our overseas games, for example, montreal.
and certainly, we also the -- certainly, we also have games that have been developed solely by the overseas team. who will be working on games that buy them and have targeted in the markets that they know the most well in. so altogether, we hope to introduce to the global audience, more and more exciting games to play. thank you.

william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- investor relations director
metaverse is indeed the new buzz word everywhere today. but -- but on the other hand, i think nobody has actually had first-time experience in what it is. but at netease, we are technologically ready. we know how to accumulate the relevant know-how, the relevant skill sets when that day comes.
so i think when that they eventually comes, we'll probably be one of the fastest runner in the metaverse space.

we'll take our next question from alex poon from morgan stanley.
alex poon -- morgan stanley -- analyst
[foreign language] thanks for management for taking my question. i have two questions. first question its related to our legacy titles. recently macro environment has not been very good and consumption advertising has not been doing well.
and does this weaker macro environment affect our legacy titles, especially those high-paying users? and also there have been some daily limits on the loots box, some games does this change affect our growth of our legacy titles? the second question is related to the status of lord of rings and the roblox-like platform that we discussed before in december. is there any chance that these two games will come out in asia in first half? thank you very much.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language] so alex for your first question, is that the from what we are seeing our legacy titles are actually growing very well throughout last year. and i think you, what you mentioned about the price draw, yes actually has very little impact on us, because we've been very conservative in terms of how we monetize, and for games like fwj if you remember, is actually a time-based type of game. so a second question, lord of rings, we to release that game in, in hong kong, macau and taiwan. and for your third question we are going to have -- we are actually developing some of the ugc-oriented games.
and then so some of them will be introduced to the players.

as this line carries a higher gross margin than other product lines. gp margin for netease cloud music was positive at 4.1% versus a negative margin of 7.1% in the year-ago period. this is our third consecutive quarter of positive gross margin. the significant increase was primarily due to the strong top-line growth as well as improved cost control measures.

looking at the fourth quarter selling marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 13.5%, compared with 14.1% in the prior quarter to quarter over quarter decrease was mainly due to decrease marketing spending related to youdao. r&d expenses were rmb3.8 billion, largely stable from the previous quarter, we remain committed to investing content creation and product development, which is core to our revenue growth into the sustainable future. the effective tax rate was 19.6% for the full year and 14.2% for the fourth quarter. as a reminder, the effective tax rate is presented on an accrual basis and the tax credit defer from each of our entities at different time periods, depending on applicable policy and our operation results.

ok. so for convenience, i will answer these questions directly in english. when we think of our overseas games increased contribution, obviously, we are in a ramp-up phase. but as we grow more diversified titles across different geographies, like i mentioned in previous quarters, the margin profile shouldn't be very different between domestic game and overseas game in a steady state.
but rather, it is more correlated to the gross billing. so we are very confident in the next three to five years' time as we continue to expand the scale and presence in the overseas market when we have multiple hit titles that universally are appealing to the users, those games are going to demonstrate very, very strong and similar margin profiles as what we have been experiencing with some of our very long-lasting legacy titles here in china. now, your second question regarding our publishing capability. as you may have noticed that netease remains very determined in major markets such as japan.
and for some titles, even in the west market, we strive to learn and control our own publishing capability. that is something we have to gradually build up and learn as we become a truly global game company. you may have noticed that we've successfully self-published games like knives out, identity v in japan. we are going to publish harry potter: magic awakened in japan.
we are globally publishing lord of the rings. i think, going forward, with more content partners, with more ip partners, and with more self-developed or co-developed titles, our global publishing capability, particularly in major markets will be further strengthened. operator, next question, please.
operator
ok. we will take our next question from the line of jialong shi from nomura. your line is open. please go ahead.
jialong shi -- nomura -- analyst
[foreign language] thanks for taking my question. your game deferred revenue rose by 1% sequentially in 1q even though you did not launch any new titles in the first quarter. could you give us some color what were the factors that have contributed to this recovery in your deferred game revenue? i just wonder if this recovery has anything -- had anything to do with the lockdown?
charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, jialong. i'll answer this financial question directly in english. so by the way, we rephrased deferred revenue into contract liabilities just to be more precise and accurate under the accounting literature. so yes, as you may have noticed, our contract liabilities increased slightly for games, if you exclude youdao from that.
it's largely attributable to our strong q1 growth -- q1 performance of pc games. as you may know, chinese new year period is typically a seasonality peak for pc games. and fantasy westward journey, by the way, after almost two decades of operation, have recorded a new record-high quarterly gross billing and quarterly revenue in the first quarter. world of warcraft also performed fairly strong in the first quarter, contributing to our strong game contract liabilities that's been recorded in the first quarter.
that's the main reason. operator, next question, please.
operator
ok. thank you. we will take our next question from the line from felix liu from ubs. your line is open.
please go ahead.
felix liu -- ubs -- analyst
[foreign language] thank you. let me translate myself. my first question is on diablo immortal. first, congratulations on the launch.
could you share any expectations on revenue or user metrics for this game? and which overseas markets will netease be responsible for distribution? and any thoughts or color on the long-term collaboration with microsoft and activision blizzard post the game launch? my second question is on yanxuan, more specifically about the covid-19 impact to the yanxuan business in the second quarter and potential turning point? thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
ok. thank you, felix. i'll answer your questions directly in english. so first of all, diablo immortal, while under the partnership agreement, we are a co-developer.
so we got a codeveloper's share of pie from its global revenue. in terms of publishing, netease is responsible for the games publishing in mainland china, whereby blizzard is responsible for its publishing in rest of the world. you may have noticed that we also have very close partnership -- business partnership with microsoft because we've been the exclusive partner for minecraft for multiple years. with the announced acquisition of activision blizzard by microsoft, we are very, very looking forward to a future strengthened partnership between netease and the broad microsoft franchise, because we are a premium content provider.
they obviously have very, very excellent first-party studios as well as xbox distribution platform. so there are multiple areas that we can explore potential partnership down the road. to your second question on yanxuan, we will have yanxuan's ceo, [inaudible], to answer your question.

margaret shi -- director, investor relations
so it's in certain regions. and we do think that our fulfillment and the logistics system has been impacted somewhat by the pandemic. and since the end of march, the fulfillment time has been a lot longer than before. but the good news is that since may, we've seen a much more meaningful improvement and progress.
and we think that progress is still ongoing. thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
operator, next question, please.
operator
we will take our next question from the line of lincoln kong from goldman sachs. your line is open. please go ahead.
lincoln kong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
[foreign language] hi. thanks for taking my question. the question is about the overseas game market and our monetization strategy for international games. as we noted, strong engagement of dbt mobile in japan, but relatively small grossing.
so we think that those international games monetization matter is evenly distributed within their product life cycle. if so, how should we think about those future high-profile international titles in the second half, especially harry potter in japan? and related to that, how do we view the outlook for the japanese mobile game market this year, especially year-to-date grossing seems to be a little weaker than expected? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- director, investor relations
yes. it's true that overseas markets are completely different from the china market. in china, majority of the revenue -- games revenue comes from mobile games, whereas for overseas, we have console, we have pc and we have mobile. so for different type of games, there's very different amortization pattern.
and for different countries, amortization is different as well. and all of that, it shouldn't be a big challenge for netease. we have decades of experience in gaming r&d. so we should quickly find a way to satisfy users and players in different countries, on different types of devices.
thank you. next question, please.
operator
ok. we will take our next question from the line of natalie wu from haitong international. your line is open. please go ahead.
natalie wu -- haitong international securities -- analyst
[foreign language] thanks management for taking my question and congratulations for a very strong quarter. my question is regarding the pandemic impact on our game business. just wondering, can you comment on the impact of pandemic opening up in overseas markets on your games business? because some of your peers noted that the weakness coming due to that fact. just wondering if you also experienced that kind of the situation.
and in the meanwhile, in terms of the domestic market, did you see increasing time and value spend on your games during the domestic lockdowns? thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
hi, natalie. it's charles. in the interest of time, let me answer your question directly in english. so the covid situation has been lasting since -- it's been more than two years.
frankly speaking, i think everyone is a victim of this covid situation. game industry or broadly speaking, entertainment industry is probably a little bit more fortunate that we are less severely impacted by the covid than many of the other businesses. when -- frankly speaking, we do not observe any weakness from our overseas market right now because we are fairly, fairly new. and in our early stage of executing our ambitious global strategy, as we continue to launch more games, we feel pretty confident about our growth, particularly in the second half of this year when many of our exciting highly anticipated games will be unveiled to the international game audience.
now, speaking of the domestic market, for the past quarter, chinese new year period is, like i said, a strong seasonality for pc games, but we are not seeing really any meaningful so-called enhanced arpu or timing spend on mobile. mobile stayed relatively, i would say, stable. so you are not really seeing any kind of highs and lows of obvious seasonalities or one-off implications caused by the lockdown. i think our game development philosophy is fairly consistent and straightforward.
there's a lot of these macro situations that's beyond anyone's control. what we could do is that try to observe the shifting user experience preferences and try to cater to their shifting preferences by diligently and regularly roll out content update through innovation, through fresh gameplays, etc. i think that is kind of an open secret we've been adopting and operating for the last two decades. from pc screens to mobile screens, through good economies and bad economies, i think that's something -- if anything that we have learned from the covid or from our past two decades of experience is that remain user-focused and content focused, then we won't go too wrong off the track.
operator, maybe we have time for one last question.
operator
ok. thank you. we will take our next question from the line of thomas chong from jefferies. your line is open.
thomas chong -- jefferies -- analyst
[foreign language] thanks for taking my question. may i ask a question about the regulatory environment for the online gaming sector after the resumption of the [inaudible] approval. should we expect any new regulations or anything that may be released in the future? and on that front, how should we think about the outlook for the domestic gaming sector in coming years in terms of the growth momentum? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
[foreign language]
william ding -- chief executive officer

margaret shi -- director, investor relations
so we're quite optimistic with the growth of the chinese gaming market. it's a very popular form of entertainment among the younger generation. so as you've seen, you see in april, there's been a batch of new license approval. and i think that going forward, the policy will remain that it supports gaming content that could be beneficial and educational to the gamers and game players.
thank you. thank you. thank you very much. i think that that will end our call.
operator?

ok. thank you.

charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, margaret, and thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call. before we begin, i would like to remind everyone that all percentages are based on rmb. we kicked off 2022 with a solid quarter, advancing each of our business lines, with total revenues coming in at rmb 23.6 billion, up nearly 15% year over year, and our net operating profit increased 29% year over year to rmb 5.5 billion. online games revenues were rmb 17.3 billion, growing by 15% year over year.
our flagship titles continue to impress with their remarkable longevity and strength. in the first quarter, revenue from fantasy westward journey online and new westwood journey online ii continued to grow steadily, demonstrating netease's core competence in operating franchise ips over an impressive duration and longevity of about 20 years. with immersive festive activities and engaging new expansion packs during the chinese new year period, we are thrilled that these epic games remain as attractive and appealing to the players as ever. we are actively growing many other long-lasting franchises in addition to these legacy titles, keeping our content fresh with years of perseverance and dedicated craftsmanship.
take lifeafter as an example, our open world doomsday survival game, first introduced in 2018 continues to lead its category with its distinctive survival game play. since its operation of more than three years ago, we've been frequently rolling out big updates for lifeafter on an almost quarterly basis, refreshing players' appetite with numerous content updates. in the first quarter, the spring festival version of lifeafter brought the game to the forefront once again on china's ios top grossing chart. in terms of newly launched titles, nearly one year since its launch, naraka: bladepoint maintains strong engagement levels with fast-paced content updates, including new gameplay, heroes and weapons.
adding to our regular update schedule, we are prepping for a significant update, including the first new map to bring new excitement to the whole player community in the second half of this year. featuring unchained melee combat, naraka: bladepoint was a huge breakthrough for us in esports and has become one of the most popular games on live streaming platforms in china. to round out the games ecosystem, we established a multi-tiered tournament system consisting of scrimmages, regional tournaments and a world championship catering to different player groups including the general public as well as professional teams across different regions. in january, we concluded the first world championship tournament, the game's highest level of competition, which attracted considerable attention from esports fans worldwide and brought global players in an exciting visual feast.
we are also seeing growing momentum with infinite lagrange, similar to our original slg game invincible, this next-generation slg title has begun to show healthy sustainable growth trend in the first quarter. as the game advances, we are steadily gaining more confidence in our ability to extend the success of slg games to an even broader demographic. in april, we launched dead by daylight mobile in asia, co-developed with behavior and published by us. dead by daylight mobile is the mobile version of the famous asymmetrical battle arena game, bringing players unrivaled asymmetrical competitive experiences on mobile platforms.
soon after its debut, dead by daylight mobile tops the ios download chart in both japan and thailand, with very strong user engagement. in the second half of the year, we plan to bring to the world more exciting titles, which we hope to thrill our growing global community. in particular, we are extremely excited to have diablo immortal slated for release on the second of june in most global markets. and last friday, at our annual game day event, we announced that the china launch of diablo immortal is now confirmed for june 23rd.
as one of the gamer communities most anticipated titles this year, diablo immortal marks one of the most ambitious game release in the diablo franchise's 25-year history and will bring fans and new players an uncompromised aaa gaming experience. preregistration has been exceptional, with more than 35 million people preparing for the battles to come worldwide, including 15 million in china and counting. diablo immortal supports both cross-play and cross-progression, allowing global players to join the fight with each other regardless of platform while being able to seamlessly transition between mobile and pc gameplay. we consider the debut of diablo immortal a huge opportunity to show the world, particularly western gamer community, about netease's strong r&d capability.
we take a very global view of our online gaming business, and diablo immortal truly embodies the sort of worldwide appeal that we hope to possess. next in the pipeline, we will be introducing naraka: bladepoint on console. the development is well on track, and we are definitely excited about its prospects and to welcome console players to our global naraka: bladepoint community. equally exciting is our planned global market launch of harry potter: magic awakened, which captivated the chinese market since last september.
while we are putting great effort into the global vision, we are also simultaneously working intensively to update the game in china, regularly rolling out new cards, costumes and gameplay to add even more fun. our rich pipeline goes far beyond these titles, and we continue to initiate new projects on schedule. as usual, we held our 2022 annual game product launch event last friday on may 20th, revealing the latest information about other exciting titles in the pipeline, including the mobile versions of justice and naraka: bladepoint; eggy party, a casual game; roar of war; vive le football; and mission zero. we encourage you to read through our press release about this event or watch last friday's event replay to get more comprehensive information.
in 2022, we have made more solid progress in globalization. we have always been relentless in our drive to invest in and empower our people, and we are incredibly excited to have more global talents joining us. after years of strategic planning, we now have a number of first-party overseas studios across japan and north america, each of them being led by top industry veterans who are using their creativity to forge their best titles on netease's platform. for example, our three japanese studios aim to bring -- aim to build great console games for both the japanese and the global audience.
earlier this month, we also launched our first u.s. studio, jackalope games led by industry veterans, jack emmert, who has decades of experience in mmo game development. our idea is to persistently unleash talent potential by enabling them to focus on core mechanics and storylines with creative autonomy, while offering them solid technical support in areas such as coding and art design. going forward, we hope the world will see more of netease's relevance on aaa releases in the global market, either through self-development, investments or publishing.
now turning to our education business. netease youdao achieved a solid and sustainable performance in the first quarter after disposing of its academic after-school tutoring businesses, with total net revenues of rmb 1.2 billion and gross margin of 53.1%. smart learning devices remain the key driver of youdao's future growth. in the first quarter, youdao continued to extend its technology offering by launching improved content, features, and new products.
net revenues from youdao smart devices segment reached rmb 253 million, representing an increase of 25% year over year. through partnership with education practices in 11 additional regions, we have added original songs to the youdao listening pod based on various versions of the english learning textbooks. in early april, we introduced a new product named youdao smart light, youdao [inaudible], which integrates ai learning features into a desk lamp. powered by our robust ai algorithms, it allows users to schedule a plan before they study, look up meanings and translations of words and sentences in chinese and english during their study time, adding spec and review their homework after they finished studies.
by clicking the screen to conduct research, the device helps students develop more independent learning habits and significantly improve their learning efficiency while protecting their eyes. looking toward growth opportunities in the steam education sector, we have worked hard to optimize the functions and user experience for different courses. as a result, for example, gross billings from youdao chess class increased over 170% quarter over quarter. in addition to content upgrades, we have also built a learning community on the youdao board game academy app.
on this platform, students of go, chess and chinese chess classes can interact and compete with ai or their peers of similar levels in a fun and engaging way. to complete the cycle of learning, testing, and grading, youdao has applied to become an official online testing and certification site for various board game associations in china to make the skill certification process easier for our students. looking ahead to the remainder of 2022, youdao will remain focused on upgrading its diversified portfolio of products and services, and we have confidence in its future development powered by its sophisticated r&d capabilities and persistent drive to empower education with our technology. with netease cloud music, we maintained steady momentum in the first quarter.
mau for our online services were 182 million, largely stable both year over year and quarter over quarter. we also continue to improve our monetization capabilities, growing our net revenues by 39% year over year to rmb 2.1 billion, driven by healthy membership growth and robust social entertainment services. our membership paying ratio reached 20%, compared with 13% in the same period last year. we made enhancements to our content and introduced more product feature innovations to improve the user experience, which helps us drive paying user growth.
additionally, gross margins more than doubled quarter over quarter in the first quarter, reaching over 12% as we continue to optimize our content cost structure. on the new features front, we introduced our innovative harry potter magic radio, a joint collaboration with netease games team, which allows users and gamers to enjoy harry potter-themed podcast content within the game. while we continue to add unique products and capabilities that help redefine our community's music experience, we are also improving our brand awareness and influence with content-oriented and event-driven campaigns. we offer a full spectrum of varied content as the demands of our useful user base are increasingly diverse and personalized.
by the end of march 2022, our content library consists of more than 90 million music tracks, including music from established labels as well as independent artists. we are attracting independent music talent at a notable rate. and by the end of the first quarter, we have more than 450,000 registered independent artists on our platform. to help independent artists create and promote their music as well as realized commercial value, we continue to nurture music talent with invaluable tools such as support programs, traffic referrals, fan interactions and multiple monetization methods.
moving on to yanxuan. april marked its sixth year anniversary. over the course of the last six years, we have built yanxuan into an exciting private label consumer lifestyle brand. we have established a strong supply chain system and can accurately profile user preferences with our leading algorithms.
through diversified channels, yanxuan has launched a number of popular products such as cat food, bathroom fragrance and ergonomic chairs. as we move ahead, yanxuan will continue to focus on pets, home cleaning, bedding, and other categories that we excel in, while we continue to launch our regional design products and bring consumers products that facilitate more chilled and pleasant lifestyle. above all else, netease is always a content company with deep-rooted internet dna. our ability to innovate, create and leverage our proprietary technology forms a cohesive layer across our different business lines, whether it be games, education or music.

in march, netease group distributed 1 million copies of anti-pandemic gift packages to cater to people's entertainment, work, and consumption needs. more recently, leveraging the advantage of our supply chain, yanxuan mobilized 50 pounds of fresh vegetables from our fresh food suppliers for people in covid-affected shanghai areas. additionally, leveraging the power of music as an inspiring and uniting cause, we distributed another 5 million cloud music vimeo memberships for free to the people in shanghai and nearing province, with the goal of using music to comfort and inspire those impacted by the pandemic. this concludes william's comments.
i will now provide a brief review of our 2022 first quarter financial results. given the limited time on today's call, i will be presenting some abbreviated financial highlights. we encourage you to read through our press release issued earlier today for further details. total net revenues for the first quarter were rmb 23.6 billion, or $3.7 billion, representing a 15% increase year over year.
net revenues from online game services were rmb 17.3 billion, up 15% year over year. the additional growth was primarily due to the increased revenue contribution from the launch of new games such as naraka: bladepoint and harry potter: magic awakened. net revenues from our mobile games accounted for approximately 67% of total games revenue. youdao's net revenues were rmb 1.2 billion, compared with rmb 1.3 billion last year same quarter.
youdao discontinued its after-school tutoring services for academic subjects under china's compulsory education system, k9, since the fourth quarter of last year per regulatory requirement. if we exclude discontinued business, q1's apple-to-apple revenue stayed relatively stable compared with last year. on the other hand, the smart devices business maintained steady growth trajectory, with net revenues up 25% year over year. net revenues from cloud music were rmb 2.1 billion, up 39% year over year.
the increase was primarily due to increased revenues from membership subscription and social entertainment services. net revenues for innovative businesses and others were rmb 3 billion, up nearly 12% year over year due to business development and seasonality impact of various lines. our total gross profit margin was 54.5% in the first quarter, up slightly compared with 53.9% in the first quarter of last year. gp margin for our online game services remained stable at 65.1%.
as a reminder, this number is generally stable with some narrow fluctuations based on the revenue mix of mobile and pc titles as well as self-developed and licensed games. gp margin for youdao was 53.1%, compared with 57.3% in the same period of the last year. the decline was mainly due to the lower revenue proportion from youdao's learning services, which carry a relatively higher margin. gp margin for cloud music excelled in this quarter, climbing to 12.2% versus 4.1% in the preceding quarter and a negative margin of 3.1% in the same period last year.
the significant margin improvement primarily resulted from strong top-line growth, as well as improved content cost control. additionally, this marks our fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth gp margin for cloud music. gross profit margin for innovative businesses and others was 23.3%, flattish compared with 24.1% in the first quarter of last year. total operating expenses for the first quarter were rmb 7.3 billion or 31% of our total net revenues.
if you look at our costs in more detail, our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 12%, compared with 13% last year. the change was mainly due to less marketing spending related to youdao. if we exclude youdao, our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue were 11%, compared with 10% last year, mainly due to increased spending on certain games' promotions in the first quarter. our r&d expenses were rmb 3.4 billion or 14% as a percentage of net revenues.
we remain committed to investing in content creation and product development, which is core to our revenue growth. other income was rmb 28 million for the first quarter. the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year decrease resulted from the fact that we had certain publicly traded securities in our current investments, and the prices of such securities declined meaningfully in the first quarter. we are required under u.s.
gaap to reflect for these fair value changes. the effective tax rate was 22% for the first quarter. as a reminder, the effective tax rate is presented on an accrual basis, and the tax rate differ from each of our entities depending on the applicable policies and our operational results. our non-gaap net income attributable to our shareholders for the first quarter of 2022 totaled rmb 5.1 billion or $807 million.
non-gaap basic earnings per ads was $1.23 or $0.25 per share. our cash position remains strong. as of the quarter end, our total cash, cash equivalents, current and noncurrent time deposits, and short-term investment balance totaled rmb 107 billion, compared with rmb 103 billion as of the year-end of last year. in accordance with our latest revised dividend policy, our board of directors have approved a dividend of $0.0644 per share or $0.322 per ads.
lastly, under our share repurchase program, approximately 20.1 million ads have been repurchased as of the first quarter end for a total cost of approximately $1.9 billion. thank you for your attention. we would like now to open the call to your questions. operator, please go ahead to the q&a.

ok. thank you. [operator instructions] we will take our first question from the line of alicia yap from citigroup. your line is open.
please go ahead.

hello. hi. yeah. thank you.
can you hear me? ok.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
hi, alicia. yes, alicia.
alicia yap -- citi -- analyst
[foreign language] my question is on your overseas studio. so given your recent establishment of the overseas studio in the u.s. and japan, could you share some color with us regarding your hiring plans, your games development plans, and also how you are viewing the overseas talent and future games growth and growth outlook? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- director, investor relations
ok. thank you, alicia. so we -- the overseas market and the overseas profit development is of utter importance to us. so right now, about 80% of our r&d resources is in china and something between 10% to 20% is in overseas market.
and going forward, we think that we'll probably see a 40% to 60% split, having 40% of the r&d resources in overseas markets. we are working very diligently and actively with overseas development teams to codevelop some games content. internally, we have a plan, we have a clear goal of how we want to achieve the revenue split between overseas market and the china market. and then hopefully, both the china market and overseas markets will account for a meaningful portion of our revenue.

yang bai -- cicc -- analyst
[technical difficulty]
operator
are you on speakerphone? because your line is breaking.
margaret shi -- director, investor relations
[foreign language] so his first question is about the impact of overseas games market, how that would affect our profitability for games business. and his second question was in terms of -- in addition to japanese market, where other regions we're thinking of publishing ourselves?
charles yang -- chief financial officer
ok. so for convenience, i will answer these questions directly in english. when we think of our overseas games increased contribution, obviously, we are in a ramp-up phase. but as we grow more diversified titles across different geographies, like i mentioned in previous quarters, the margin profile shouldn't be very different between domestic game and overseas game in a steady state.
but rather, it is more correlated to the gross billing. so we are very confident in the next three to five years' time as we continue to expand the scale and presence in the overseas market when we have multiple hit titles that universally are appealing to the users, those games are going to demonstrate very, very strong and similar margin profiles as what we have been experiencing with some of our very long-lasting legacy titles here in china. now, your second question regarding our publishing capability. as you may have noticed that netease remains very determined in major markets such as japan.
and for some titles, even in the west market, we strive to learn and control our own publishing capability. that is something we have to gradually build up and learn as we become a truly global game company. you may have noticed that we've successfully self-published games like knives out, identity v in japan. we are going to publish harry potter: magic awakened in japan.
we are globally publishing lord of the rings. i think, going forward, with more content partners, with more ip partners, and with more self-developed or co-developed titles, our global publishing capability, particularly in major markets will be further strengthened. operator, next question, please.
operator
ok. we will take our next question from the line of jialong shi from nomura. your line is open. please go ahead.
jialong shi -- nomura -- analyst
[foreign language] thanks for taking my question. your game deferred revenue rose by 1% sequentially in 1q even though you did not launch any new titles in the first quarter. could you give us some color what were the factors that have contributed to this recovery in your deferred game revenue? i just wonder if this recovery has anything -- had anything to do with the lockdown?
charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, jialong. i'll answer this financial question directly in english. so by the way, we rephrased deferred revenue into contract liabilities just to be more precise and accurate under the accounting literature. so yes, as you may have noticed, our contract liabilities increased slightly for games, if you exclude youdao from that.
it's largely attributable to our strong q1 growth -- q1 performance of pc games. as you may know, chinese new year period is typically a seasonality peak for pc games. and fantasy westward journey, by the way, after almost two decades of operation, have recorded a new record-high quarterly gross billing and quarterly revenue in the first quarter. world of warcraft also performed fairly strong in the first quarter, contributing to our strong game contract liabilities that's been recorded in the first quarter.
that's the main reason. operator, next question, please.

[foreign language] thank you. let me translate myself. my first question is on diablo immortal. first, congratulations on the launch.
could you share any expectations on revenue or user metrics for this game? and which overseas markets will netease be responsible for distribution? and any thoughts or color on the long-term collaboration with microsoft and activision blizzard post the game launch? my second question is on yanxuan, more specifically about the covid-19 impact to the yanxuan business in the second quarter and potential turning point? thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
ok. thank you, felix. i'll answer your questions directly in english. so first of all, diablo immortal, while under the partnership agreement, we are a co-developer.
so we got a codeveloper's share of pie from its global revenue. in terms of publishing, netease is responsible for the games publishing in mainland china, whereby blizzard is responsible for its publishing in rest of the world. you may have noticed that we also have very close partnership -- business partnership with microsoft because we've been the exclusive partner for minecraft for multiple years. with the announced acquisition of activision blizzard by microsoft, we are very, very looking forward to a future strengthened partnership between netease and the broad microsoft franchise, because we are a premium content provider.
they obviously have very, very excellent first-party studios as well as xbox distribution platform. so there are multiple areas that we can explore potential partnership down the road. to your second question on yanxuan, we will have yanxuan's ceo, [inaudible], to answer your question.

margaret shi -- director, investor relations
so it's in certain regions. and we do think that our fulfillment and the logistics system has been impacted somewhat by the pandemic. and since the end of march, the fulfillment time has been a lot longer than before. but the good news is that since may, we've seen a much more meaningful improvement and progress.
and we think that progress is still ongoing. thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
operator, next question, please.
operator
we will take our next question from the line of lincoln kong from goldman sachs. your line is open. please go ahead.
lincoln kong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
[foreign language] hi. thanks for taking my question. the question is about the overseas game market and our monetization strategy for international games. as we noted, strong engagement of dbt mobile in japan, but relatively small grossing.
so we think that those international games monetization matter is evenly distributed within their product life cycle. if so, how should we think about those future high-profile international titles in the second half, especially harry potter in japan? and related to that, how do we view the outlook for the japanese mobile game market this year, especially year-to-date grossing seems to be a little weaker than expected? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- director, investor relations
yes. it's true that overseas markets are completely different from the china market. in china, majority of the revenue -- games revenue comes from mobile games, whereas for overseas, we have console, we have pc and we have mobile. so for different type of games, there's very different amortization pattern.
and for different countries, amortization is different as well. and all of that, it shouldn't be a big challenge for netease. we have decades of experience in gaming r&d. so we should quickly find a way to satisfy users and players in different countries, on different types of devices.
thank you. next question, please.
operator
ok. we will take our next question from the line of natalie wu from haitong international. your line is open. please go ahead.
natalie wu -- haitong international securities -- analyst
[foreign language] thanks management for taking my question and congratulations for a very strong quarter. my question is regarding the pandemic impact on our game business. just wondering, can you comment on the impact of pandemic opening up in overseas markets on your games business? because some of your peers noted that the weakness coming due to that fact. just wondering if you also experienced that kind of the situation.
and in the meanwhile, in terms of the domestic market, did you see increasing time and value spend on your games during the domestic lockdowns? thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
hi, natalie. it's charles. in the interest of time, let me answer your question directly in english. so the covid situation has been lasting since -- it's been more than two years.
frankly speaking, i think everyone is a victim of this covid situation. game industry or broadly speaking, entertainment industry is probably a little bit more fortunate that we are less severely impacted by the covid than many of the other businesses. when -- frankly speaking, we do not observe any weakness from our overseas market right now because we are fairly, fairly new. and in our early stage of executing our ambitious global strategy, as we continue to launch more games, we feel pretty confident about our growth, particularly in the second half of this year when many of our exciting highly anticipated games will be unveiled to the international game audience.
now, speaking of the domestic market, for the past quarter, chinese new year period is, like i said, a strong seasonality for pc games, but we are not seeing really any meaningful so-called enhanced arpu or timing spend on mobile. mobile stayed relatively, i would say, stable. so you are not really seeing any kind of highs and lows of obvious seasonalities or one-off implications caused by the lockdown. i think our game development philosophy is fairly consistent and straightforward.
there's a lot of these macro situations that's beyond anyone's control. what we could do is that try to observe the shifting user experience preferences and try to cater to their shifting preferences by diligently and regularly roll out content update through innovation, through fresh gameplays, etc. i think that is kind of an open secret we've been adopting and operating for the last two decades. from pc screens to mobile screens, through good economies and bad economies, i think that's something -- if anything that we have learned from the covid or from our past two decades of experience is that remain user-focused and content focused, then we won't go too wrong off the track.
operator, maybe we have time for one last question.
operator
ok. thank you. we will take our next question from the line of thomas chong from jefferies. your line is open.
thomas chong -- jefferies -- analyst
[foreign language] thanks for taking my question. may i ask a question about the regulatory environment for the online gaming sector after the resumption of the [inaudible] approval. should we expect any new regulations or anything that may be released in the future? and on that front, how should we think about the outlook for the domestic gaming sector in coming years in terms of the growth momentum? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
unknown speaker
[foreign language]
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- director, investor relations
so we're quite optimistic with the growth of the chinese gaming market. it's a very popular form of entertainment among the younger generation. so as you've seen, you see in april, there's been a batch of new license approval. and i think that going forward, the policy will remain that it supports gaming content that could be beneficial and educational to the gamers and game players.
thank you. thank you. thank you very much. i think that that will end our call.
operator?

ok. thank you.

charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, margaret, and thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call. before we begin, i would like to remind everyone that all percentages are based on rmb. we kicked off 2022 with a solid quarter, advancing each of our business lines, with total revenues coming in at rmb 23.6 billion, up nearly 15% year over year, and our net operating profit increased 29% year over year to rmb 5.5 billion. online games revenues were rmb 17.3 billion, growing by 15% year over year.
our flagship titles continue to impress with their remarkable longevity and strength. in the first quarter, revenue from fantasy westward journey online and new westwood journey online ii continued to grow steadily, demonstrating netease's core competence in operating franchise ips over an impressive duration and longevity of about 20 years. with immersive festive activities and engaging new expansion packs during the chinese new year period, we are thrilled that these epic games remain as attractive and appealing to the players as ever. we are actively growing many other long-lasting franchises in addition to these legacy titles, keeping our content fresh with years of perseverance and dedicated craftsmanship.
take lifeafter as an example, our open world doomsday survival game, first introduced in 2018 continues to lead its category with its distinctive survival game play. since its operation of more than three years ago, we've been frequently rolling out big updates for lifeafter on an almost quarterly basis, refreshing players' appetite with numerous content updates. in the first quarter, the spring festival version of lifeafter brought the game to the forefront once again on china's ios top grossing chart. in terms of newly launched titles, nearly one year since its launch, naraka: bladepoint maintains strong engagement levels with fast-paced content updates, including new gameplay, heroes and weapons.
adding to our regular update schedule, we are prepping for a significant update, including the first new map to bring new excitement to the whole player community in the second half of this year. featuring unchained melee combat, naraka: bladepoint was a huge breakthrough for us in esports and has become one of the most popular games on live streaming platforms in china. to round out the games ecosystem, we established a multi-tiered tournament system consisting of scrimmages, regional tournaments and a world championship catering to different player groups including the general public as well as professional teams across different regions. in january, we concluded the first world championship tournament, the game's highest level of competition, which attracted considerable attention from esports fans worldwide and brought global players in an exciting visual feast.
we are also seeing growing momentum with infinite lagrange, similar to our original slg game invincible, this next-generation slg title has begun to show healthy sustainable growth trend in the first quarter. as the game advances, we are steadily gaining more confidence in our ability to extend the success of slg games to an even broader demographic. in april, we launched dead by daylight mobile in asia, co-developed with behavior and published by us. dead by daylight mobile is the mobile version of the famous asymmetrical battle arena game, bringing players unrivaled asymmetrical competitive experiences on mobile platforms.
soon after its debut, dead by daylight mobile tops the ios download chart in both japan and thailand, with very strong user engagement. in the second half of the year, we plan to bring to the world more exciting titles, which we hope to thrill our growing global community. in particular, we are extremely excited to have diablo immortal slated for release on the second of june in most global markets. and last friday, at our annual game day event, we announced that the china launch of diablo immortal is now confirmed for june 23rd.
as one of the gamer communities most anticipated titles this year, diablo immortal marks one of the most ambitious game release in the diablo franchise's 25-year history and will bring fans and new players an uncompromised aaa gaming experience. preregistration has been exceptional, with more than 35 million people preparing for the battles to come worldwide, including 15 million in china and counting. diablo immortal supports both cross-play and cross-progression, allowing global players to join the fight with each other regardless of platform while being able to seamlessly transition between mobile and pc gameplay. we consider the debut of diablo immortal a huge opportunity to show the world, particularly western gamer community, about netease's strong r&d capability.
we take a very global view of our online gaming business, and diablo immortal truly embodies the sort of worldwide appeal that we hope to possess. next in the pipeline, we will be introducing naraka: bladepoint on console. the development is well on track, and we are definitely excited about its prospects and to welcome console players to our global naraka: bladepoint community. equally exciting is our planned global market launch of harry potter: magic awakened, which captivated the chinese market since last september.
while we are putting great effort into the global vision, we are also simultaneously working intensively to update the game in china, regularly rolling out new cards, costumes and gameplay to add even more fun. our rich pipeline goes far beyond these titles, and we continue to initiate new projects on schedule. as usual, we held our 2022 annual game product launch event last friday on may 20th, revealing the latest information about other exciting titles in the pipeline, including the mobile versions of justice and naraka: bladepoint; eggy party, a casual game; roar of war; vive le football; and mission zero. we encourage you to read through our press release about this event or watch last friday's event replay to get more comprehensive information.
in 2022, we have made more solid progress in globalization. we have always been relentless in our drive to invest in and empower our people, and we are incredibly excited to have more global talents joining us. after years of strategic planning, we now have a number of first-party overseas studios across japan and north america, each of them being led by top industry veterans who are using their creativity to forge their best titles on netease's platform. for example, our three japanese studios aim to bring -- aim to build great console games for both the japanese and the global audience.
earlier this month, we also launched our first u.s. studio, jackalope games led by industry veterans, jack emmert, who has decades of experience in mmo game development. our idea is to persistently unleash talent potential by enabling them to focus on core mechanics and storylines with creative autonomy, while offering them solid technical support in areas such as coding and art design. going forward, we hope the world will see more of netease's relevance on aaa releases in the global market, either through self-development, investments or publishing.
now turning to our education business. netease youdao achieved a solid and sustainable performance in the first quarter after disposing of its academic after-school tutoring businesses, with total net revenues of rmb 1.2 billion and gross margin of 53.1%. smart learning devices remain the key driver of youdao's future growth. in the first quarter, youdao continued to extend its technology offering by launching improved content, features, and new products.
net revenues from youdao smart devices segment reached rmb 253 million, representing an increase of 25% year over year. through partnership with education practices in 11 additional regions, we have added original songs to the youdao listening pod based on various versions of the english learning textbooks. in early april, we introduced a new product named youdao smart light, youdao [inaudible], which integrates ai learning features into a desk lamp. powered by our robust ai algorithms, it allows users to schedule a plan before they study, look up meanings and translations of words and sentences in chinese and english during their study time, adding spec and review their homework after they finished studies.
by clicking the screen to conduct research, the device helps students develop more independent learning habits and significantly improve their learning efficiency while protecting their eyes. looking toward growth opportunities in the steam education sector, we have worked hard to optimize the functions and user experience for different courses. as a result, for example, gross billings from youdao chess class increased over 170% quarter over quarter. in addition to content upgrades, we have also built a learning community on the youdao board game academy app.
on this platform, students of go, chess and chinese chess classes can interact and compete with ai or their peers of similar levels in a fun and engaging way. to complete the cycle of learning, testing, and grading, youdao has applied to become an official online testing and certification site for various board game associations in china to make the skill certification process easier for our students. looking ahead to the remainder of 2022, youdao will remain focused on upgrading its diversified portfolio of products and services, and we have confidence in its future development powered by its sophisticated r&d capabilities and persistent drive to empower education with our technology. with netease cloud music, we maintained steady momentum in the first quarter.
mau for our online services were 182 million, largely stable both year over year and quarter over quarter. we also continue to improve our monetization capabilities, growing our net revenues by 39% year over year to rmb 2.1 billion, driven by healthy membership growth and robust social entertainment services. our membership paying ratio reached 20%, compared with 13% in the same period last year. we made enhancements to our content and introduced more product feature innovations to improve the user experience, which helps us drive paying user growth.
additionally, gross margins more than doubled quarter over quarter in the first quarter, reaching over 12% as we continue to optimize our content cost structure. on the new features front, we introduced our innovative harry potter magic radio, a joint collaboration with netease games team, which allows users and gamers to enjoy harry potter-themed podcast content within the game. while we continue to add unique products and capabilities that help redefine our community's music experience, we are also improving our brand awareness and influence with content-oriented and event-driven campaigns. we offer a full spectrum of varied content as the demands of our useful user base are increasingly diverse and personalized.
by the end of march 2022, our content library consists of more than 90 million music tracks, including music from established labels as well as independent artists. we are attracting independent music talent at a notable rate. and by the end of the first quarter, we have more than 450,000 registered independent artists on our platform. to help independent artists create and promote their music as well as realized commercial value, we continue to nurture music talent with invaluable tools such as support programs, traffic referrals, fan interactions and multiple monetization methods.
moving on to yanxuan. april marked its sixth year anniversary. over the course of the last six years, we have built yanxuan into an exciting private label consumer lifestyle brand. we have established a strong supply chain system and can accurately profile user preferences with our leading algorithms.
through diversified channels, yanxuan has launched a number of popular products such as cat food, bathroom fragrance and ergonomic chairs. as we move ahead, yanxuan will continue to focus on pets, home cleaning, bedding, and other categories that we excel in, while we continue to launch our regional design products and bring consumers products that facilitate more chilled and pleasant lifestyle. above all else, netease is always a content company with deep-rooted internet dna. our ability to innovate, create and leverage our proprietary technology forms a cohesive layer across our different business lines, whether it be games, education or music.
within each of these areas of robust content, we are steadfast in our mission. dedicated to improve our content competitiveness, we will continue to invest and innovate to provide users with excellent products and services full of fun, technology, and surprises. at the forefront of each of our business lines is our commitment to social responsibility and charitable endeavors. with the recent pandemic cases in china, each of our businesses have utilized their resources to help the community we are serving.
in march, netease group distributed 1 million copies of anti-pandemic gift packages to cater to people's entertainment, work, and consumption needs. more recently, leveraging the advantage of our supply chain, yanxuan mobilized 50 pounds of fresh vegetables from our fresh food suppliers for people in covid-affected shanghai areas. additionally, leveraging the power of music as an inspiring and uniting cause, we distributed another 5 million cloud music vimeo memberships for free to the people in shanghai and nearing province, with the goal of using music to comfort and inspire those impacted by the pandemic. this concludes william's comments.
i will now provide a brief review of our 2022 first quarter financial results. given the limited time on today's call, i will be presenting some abbreviated financial highlights. we encourage you to read through our press release issued earlier today for further details. total net revenues for the first quarter were rmb 23.6 billion, or $3.7 billion, representing a 15% increase year over year.
net revenues from online game services were rmb 17.3 billion, up 15% year over year. the additional growth was primarily due to the increased revenue contribution from the launch of new games such as naraka: bladepoint and harry potter: magic awakened. net revenues from our mobile games accounted for approximately 67% of total games revenue. youdao's net revenues were rmb 1.2 billion, compared with rmb 1.3 billion last year same quarter.
youdao discontinued its after-school tutoring services for academic subjects under china's compulsory education system, k9, since the fourth quarter of last year per regulatory requirement. if we exclude discontinued business, q1's apple-to-apple revenue stayed relatively stable compared with last year. on the other hand, the smart devices business maintained steady growth trajectory, with net revenues up 25% year over year. net revenues from cloud music were rmb 2.1 billion, up 39% year over year.
the increase was primarily due to increased revenues from membership subscription and social entertainment services. net revenues for innovative businesses and others were rmb 3 billion, up nearly 12% year over year due to business development and seasonality impact of various lines. our total gross profit margin was 54.5% in the first quarter, up slightly compared with 53.9% in the first quarter of last year. gp margin for our online game services remained stable at 65.1%.
as a reminder, this number is generally stable with some narrow fluctuations based on the revenue mix of mobile and pc titles as well as self-developed and licensed games. gp margin for youdao was 53.1%, compared with 57.3% in the same period of the last year. the decline was mainly due to the lower revenue proportion from youdao's learning services, which carry a relatively higher margin. gp margin for cloud music excelled in this quarter, climbing to 12.2% versus 4.1% in the preceding quarter and a negative margin of 3.1% in the same period last year.
the significant margin improvement primarily resulted from strong top-line growth, as well as improved content cost control. additionally, this marks our fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth gp margin for cloud music. gross profit margin for innovative businesses and others was 23.3%, flattish compared with 24.1% in the first quarter of last year. total operating expenses for the first quarter were rmb 7.3 billion or 31% of our total net revenues.
if you look at our costs in more detail, our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 12%, compared with 13% last year. the change was mainly due to less marketing spending related to youdao. if we exclude youdao, our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue were 11%, compared with 10% last year, mainly due to increased spending on certain games' promotions in the first quarter. our r&d expenses were rmb 3.4 billion or 14% as a percentage of net revenues.
we remain committed to investing in content creation and product development, which is core to our revenue growth. other income was rmb 28 million for the first quarter. the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year decrease resulted from the fact that we had certain publicly traded securities in our current investments, and the prices of such securities declined meaningfully in the first quarter. we are required under u.s.
gaap to reflect for these fair value changes. the effective tax rate was 22% for the first quarter. as a reminder, the effective tax rate is presented on an accrual basis, and the tax rate differ from each of our entities depending on the applicable policies and our operational results. our non-gaap net income attributable to our shareholders for the first quarter of 2022 totaled rmb 5.1 billion or $807 million.
non-gaap basic earnings per ads was $1.23 or $0.25 per share. our cash position remains strong. as of the quarter end, our total cash, cash equivalents, current and noncurrent time deposits, and short-term investment balance totaled rmb 107 billion, compared with rmb 103 billion as of the year-end of last year. in accordance with our latest revised dividend policy, our board of directors have approved a dividend of $0.0644 per share or $0.322 per ads.
lastly, under our share repurchase program, approximately 20.1 million ads have been repurchased as of the first quarter end for a total cost of approximately $1.9 billion. thank you for your attention. we would like now to open the call to your questions. operator, please go ahead to the q&a.

thank you. [operator instructions] we will take our first question from the line of yang bai from cicc. please go ahead.
yang bai -- cicc -- analyst
[foreign language] ok. thank you, management. netease has continuously made efforts in the overseas market in recent years and has established several game developers overseas. what is our take on the pace of overseas investments in the future? also, could you perhaps share some colors on the products in development? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- director, investor relations
overseas market is of great importance for netease. and as everybody knows that in the past year, we've not received any license approval overall in china. so we have to make the strategic choice to shift some of our r&d resources to the global market, the european markets to the japanese or the asian markets. so everybody knows that we have a very strong track record in game production.
we have very high r&d efficiencies, and we are now working very closely with many overseas developers to find a product that will be welcomed by the global game players. we actually do have a lot of products under development. and hopefully, you will see some of them being introduced to the market very soon. on june 2, everybody saw the success of diablo that we have listed and i think it's been a very positive, very, very strong release of that game.
thank you.
operator
let's take our next questions from the line of thomas chong from jefferies.
thomas chong -- jefferies -- analyst
[foreign language] thanks management for taking my questions. we have seen internet companies highlighting about cost efficiencies, such as staff costs and marketing spending on the back of a global macro headwind these days. can management share the thought about the outlook, about the operating expenses in sales and marketing, r&d and g&a? thanks.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- director, investor relations
so it's not -- the question about cutting costs, the question is about optimization of cost. sometimes, throughout of development operation of our business, sometimes we do have -- we do cut costs in certain areas, but will also increase our investment spend in other areas. so netease will continue to optimize the way we spend the cost structure of the company. only just because the weakness in the macro, it doesn't necessarily mean that we have to take certain actions to address that.
netease, we think very long term, and we care about the sustainable long-term growth of the company.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
and thomas, it's charles. just to add a bit more. as you can see, we've always been very committed in r&d spending over the past couple of years, our head strong -- head count, total head count also remained relatively stable because for us, we think investing into talent, investing into technology is the key competence in us creating the world-class content.
margaret shi -- director, investor relations
thank you, thomas. next question, please.
operator
ok, thank you. we will take our next question from the line of kenneth fong from credit suisse.
kenneth fong -- credit suisse -- analyst
[foreign language] thank you, management for taking my question. what's management view on the domestic regulatory landscape and expectation on the banhao approval? with a likely lower number of banhao approved in the future, how will this change our game strategy, including genre ip investment, etc.?
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- director, investor relations
so i kind of mentioned that in the earlier question, one of the reasons we have to look abroad and be more active in expanding our user base overseas because of like banhao in china. and secondly, it kind of tells you -- tells us that we have to value or cherish the domestic market even more because banhao is a very precious resources now. so every banhao we get, we have to work putting more effort to make sure every game we develop is launched to the market will be popular, will be welcomed by the game players in china. thank you.
kenneth fong -- credit suisse -- analyst

operator
ok, thank you. we will take our next question from the line of lincoln kong from goldman sachs. your line is open. please go ahead.
lincoln kong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
[foreign language] so my question is about two game titles. first is on the infinite lagrange. so what's the reason behind this title is a popular trend in the recent months? and why we're seeing such a strong expanding mau growth? and second is on the naraka: bladepoint mobile. so from a longer-term perspective, how do we see the potential for the mobile game version? what's our differentiated strategy to penetrate those large dau based for battle royale game type and especially acquiring the market share from those competitors?
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- director, investor relations
the first question is on infinite lagrange. so our team actually has strong expertise in violent game for a very long period of time. so infinite lagrange has actually in operation for quite a while, we introduced a new version this year and the game player seems to have loved this new version, which means that the content was strong enough to attract a whole new -- whole brand-new set of game players and that gives us confidence that we will be able to continue to expand this category.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- director, investor relations
so yeah, sure. there are a number of large dau product in the market similar to naraka. the reason why we think naraka: bladepoint has been so successful is because the user experience it creates is very unique. experience such as combat experience, free movement in the game.
and the reason why in the past that in our competitors or other developers have not been able to create a game like naraka is because this game requires very hardcore and cutting-edge technology to deliver that type of user experience. so again, we are -- so we will continue to do various ways to give our users a continued good user experience. thank you.
lincoln kong -- goldman sachs -- analyst

operator
ok, thank you. we will take our next question from the line of alicia yap from citigroup. your line is open. please go ahead.
alicia yap -- citi -- analyst
hi. good morning. good evening. [foreign language] good evening, management.
thanks for taking my question. my question is related to the u.s. adr delisting risk. so whether management has any comments on your plans for the primary hong kong leasing? and if so, what is the rough time frame that we should expect that to happen? and then if management have any latest update that you could share with us regarding discussion status between china and u.s.
and whether the adr will indeed be delisted from the u.s. exchange? thank you.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
thank you, alicia, it's charles. let me answer your question directly in english. so firstly, we are very closely monitoring the situation. as everyone knows, this is a topic or rather this is a question that's beyond the control of an individual company.
it is more of a job political issue, but we remain cautiously optimistic that u.s. and china, the two largest countries in the world and the senior leadership, will find the common ground of interest. so we think a kind of a hard landing or decoupling between entirely the chinese companies. there are over 200 chinese companies listed in the u.s.
market. we really don't think a hard landing or decoupling would take place or rather be accelerated. what we could control, though, is that we are making very proactive preparation in the event or in a hypothetical scenario if that extreme situation happened, then netease will be prepared to continue being a listed a liquid asset. as many of you know, we are, in fact, the second chinese adr that is being dual listed in hong kong back in 2020, although we were -- we are currently a secondarily listed status on the hong kong stock exchange.
the conversion between secondary listing to primary listing is more of a technical paperwork or in a joking way, it's more of a lawyer's work there's no barrier or there's no roadblocks per se and the preparation work, some of them has been undergoing for a while by us. we think if the situation requires the conversion will be a very swift and smooth process.
alicia yap -- citi -- analyst
thank you, charles.

natalie wu -- haitong international securities -- analyst
[foreign language] let me translate myself quickly. so good evening. thanks, management for taking my question. congratulations on a very strong quarter.
my question is related with the recent world of warcraft mobile game rumor. just heard that collaboration has been halted. so i just wanted to make sure if this is an independent effect or should we be concerned regarding company's future relationship with blizzard, especially after the microsoft deal next year? and secondly, very quickly follow up with the infinite lagrange mobile game. i was just wondering if the majority of the recent incremental user of booking is generated through the back desk game publisher player initiatives? and if yes, how should we think of the related margin profile? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- director, investor relations
let me translate the answer to the first question. so natalie, like you said, the case on world of warcraft is the independent one. so our relationship with blizzard has been very good. and i keep seeing recently, we codeveloped and co-published diablo on world stage and achieved very positive results.
charles yang -- chief financial officer
yeah, natalie, for your second question on infinite lagrange, the answer is -- the short answer is that we -- from time to time, we continuously monitor and explore what we think are effective ways of user acquisition and marketing doing among many others is a conducive marketing channel for certain type of games, maybe not all. for infinite lagrange, it works for certain types of marketing spending. but all in all, when we look at overall margin profile of a game, obviously, we factor in a lot of considerations, marketing channels, marketing expense being one. but the success or rather the increasing popularity and success of infinite lagrange, i don't think it's only dependent on one single source of marketing channel.
it played a role, but i think more importantly, the success is underscored by the continuous expansion packs, in particular, the expansion packs that we released in the second quarter was particularly effective.
natalie wu -- haitong international securities -- analyst
got it. very clear. thank you.

diablo has achieved very prominent results on a worldwide stage. and it's a very strong mmo game, and like we've done with our -- many of our legacy games. we will continue to issue strong content, good expansion packs to serve our global game players as well. thank you.
next question, please.
operator
we will take our next question from the line of alex poon from morgan stanley.
alex poon -- morgan stanley -- analyst
[foreign language] my question -- i have two questions. my first question is related to the monetization design between overseas titles and domestic titles. when diablo was initially released, we saw some comments from u.s. gamers saying the game design is a bit over monetization.
so in future, when we design mobile games, are gamers going to get used to this kind of monetization? or we need to adjust our monetization system to be a little bit lighter? my second question is related to the performance of naraka: bladepoint on xbox after its release in june and the time line for ps5 and other platforms in the future? thank you.
william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- director, investor relations

william ding -- chief executive officer
[foreign language]
margaret shi -- director, investor relations

we encourage you to read through our press release issued earlier today for further details. total net revenues for the second quarter were rmb 23.2 billion or usd 3.5 billion, representing a 13% increase year over year. as we disclosed in our earnings release issued earlier today, beginning in the quarter, we've consolidated revenues from certain value-added game services with our online games operations and rename the category games and related value-added services. we think this is a better depiction of our game businesses ecosystem.
in addition to online games, we provide a range of tools and services to our users to enhance their overall gaming experience when they play our games such as the cc live streaming service a platform offering various live streaming content with a primary focus on gaming broadcasting and certain game-related merchandise sales. these revenues were previously included under our innovative businesses and others line item. and historical periods have also been adjusted accordingly. online game operations are still the primary component of this segment accounting for nearly 93% of our total games and related value-added services revenue.
the ratio is steady with the prior period and same period a year ago. total net revenues from our games and related vas were rmb 18.1 billion, up 15% year over year. the growth was primarily due to increased revenue contribution from the launch of new games such as naraka: bladepoint and harry potter: magic awakened and other exciting games such as fantasy westward journey online. net revenues from our mobile games accounted for approximately 66% of net revenue from the operation of online games.
youdao's net revenues were rmb 956 million compared with rmb 1.3 billion from the same quarter last year. the decline was mainly due to the conclusion of youdao's after-school tutoring services for academic subjects on the china's compulsory k-9 education system, which were previously included in its learning services back in 2021. net revenues from cloud music were rmb 2.2 billion, up nearly 30% year over year. the increase was mainly due to the increased revenues from membership subscription as well as social entertainment services.
net revenues for innovative businesses and others were nearly rmb 2 billion up 14% quarter over quarter, mainly due to increased contribution from yanxuan in the second quarter. our total gross profit margin rose to 55.9% in the second quarter up slightly compared with 54.5% in the second quarter of last year. gp margin for the games and related value-added services was 64.9% the majority of our gross profit in this segment is contributed by online games revenue. the contribution from related vas is relatively much smaller which carries a lower margin than online games.
therefore, even with adjustments to our line items, our games and related vas margin is generally stable with some narrow fluctuations based on the revenue mix of mobile and pc titles, self-developed, codeveloped as well as licensed games. gp margin for youdao was 42.8%, compared with 52.3% in the same period of last year. the decline was mainly due to the lower revenue proportion from youdao's learning services, resulting from the conclusion of the after-school tutoring businesses for k-9 academic subjects. gross profit margin for cloud music continues to improve in the second quarter, climbing to a 13% versus 4.1% a year ago.
the significant margin improvement primarily resulted from strong top-line growth as well as the improved efficiency of our content investment. gp margin for innovative businesses and others was 25.8% compared with 27.3% last year. the decline was mainly due to the result of decreased revenue from higher-margin advertising services. total operating expense for the second quarter were rmb 8 billion or 35% of our total net revenues.
if we look at our cost composition in more details, our selling and marketing expenses, as a percentage of total net revenue, compared with 17% for the same period last year. we remain committed to investing in content creation and product development. we are also seeing leverage in our r&d investment. our other income was rmb 785 million for the second quarter compared with rmb 28 million last quarter.
the quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly due to the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against rmb fluctuating over the last couple of periods. our effective tax rate for this quarter was 22%. as a general reminder, the effective tax rate is presented on an accrual basis and the tax credit deferred from each of our legal entities at different time periods depending on applicable policies and our operations.
our non-gaap net income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders for the second quarter totaled rmb 5.4 billion or usd 808 million. non-gaap basic earnings per ads from continuing operations for the quarter was usd 1.23 or usd 0.25 per share. this quarter, we also had rmb 625 million of net income from discontinued operations, which was related to the disposal of the kaola business. additionally, our cash position remains strong.
as of the quarter end, our net cash position was about rmb 88 billion, compared with rmb 86 billion as of the year-end last year. in accordance with our dividend policy, we are pleased to report that our board of directors has approved a dividend of usd 0.072 per share or usd 0.36 per ads. lastly, we continued to buy back shares during the period. under our share repurchase program for up to usd 3 billion, approximately 24 million ads has been repurchased as of june 30 year for a total cost of approximately usd 3 billion.
meanwhile, under netease youdao's purchase program for up to usd 50 million, approximately 1.7 million ads has been purchased for a total cost of about rmb 18 million as of june 30. in addition, netease purchased about million ordinary shares of cloud music for a total cost of usd 8 million during the second quarter. thank you for your attention. we would like now to open the call to your questions.
