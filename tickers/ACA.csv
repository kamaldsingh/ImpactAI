antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, gail. good morning and thank you for joining today's call to discuss arcosa's third quarter results and our business outlook. beginning with the key messages on slide four. first, our highest priority has been the safety of our employees as we continue to operate in the covid-19 environment. our businesses remain fully operational as essential services, and we continually update our protocols to meet or exceed cdc guidelines and ensure the safety of every one of our employees. we're grateful to our employees and our communities for the dedication during this challenging time. next, arcosa results continued to highlight the resilience of our business model and the repositioning of our company around infrastructure products. double digit growth in revenues and ebitda was led by strong performance of our construction products segment. we executed well in the third quarter despite a record hurricane season causing some revenue and profit headwinds, and ongoing challenges associated with the pandemic. new order activity was mostly positive. construction activity remained healthy and would have been stronger had weather events not been so prevalent. additionally, we booked $154 million in wind tower orders, and we have seen increased project-based wind tower inquiries. for utility structures, demand remains robust and our primary constraint remains production capacity. demand for traffic structures in our new florida business has exceeded our expectations. '
our mexico business received good orders for infrastructure projects. in the liquid barge market, utilization rates continue to be low for our customers, but conditions in the dry cargo market have improved, with higher grain volumes and freight rates and very attractive steel prices. even though we only received $18 million in new orders during the quarter, in the last few weeks, we have seen significant improvement in inquiries and have closed $32 million of additional barge orders for 2021. we're building a strong cash culture at arcosa. the impressive $93 million of free cash flow in the third quarter brings our year-to-date total to $170 million, as we focus on reducing our working capital and operating more efficiently. this cash culture is helping us deploy growth capital into attractive markets while maintaining low leverage. we still have opportunities to improve, especially in the inventory and accounts payable management, but i'm excited with the progress made to-date.
finally, we're pleased with the strategic investments we have made to grow our business, centered around construction products on engineered structures. our key accomplish was what the $87 million acquisition of strata materials, a leading producer of recycled and natural aggregates in the dallas-fort worth market that we closed in october. this transaction adds to the two smaller acquisitions we closed during the quarter. first, the telecom structure company we have previously disclosed and the natural aggregates bolt-on in texas. we paid around $53 million for these two acquisitions at very attractive multiples. slide eight is an overview of our third quarter performance. construction products followed by energy equipment were the key drivers of our 10% year-on-year revenue growth. ebitda growth and margin expansion were driven by cherry acquisition, as well as strong operating performances in our aggregates and barge businesses. scott will review the performance of our different segments.
and then, i will come back to discuss our business outlook. scott?
scott beasley -- chief financial officer
thank you, antonio, and good morning, everyone. i'll start on slide nine and review our segment results from the third quarter. construction products revenue grew 27% to $147 million. and adjusted ebitda increased 40% to $36.8 million. both revenue and ebitda were roughly even versus this year's record second quarter, despite an extraordinary number of major weather events in houston and the gulf coast that impacted construction activity and our operations in those areas. segment ebitda margin of 25.1% was up roughly 250 basis points from last year's third quarter, a result of strong execution by our operating teams. i'll give a few highlights from the quarter. our cherry business in houston performed well, despite major weather events. both recycled aggregates and natural aggregates have grown since last year, and we are expanding our reserve positions to continue growing in the attractive houston market. in our legacy natural aggregates business that serves construction markets, volumes were up at a healthy level versus last year as we supplied major infrastructure projects and the texas triangle experienced strong residential activity and benefited from several bolt-on acquisitions. we also improved margins significantly through operating efficiencies, lower maintenance costs, and lower fuel costs. our mix shift resulted in a lower asp, but gross profit per ton was up nicely. our aggregate plants in south and west texas serving the oil and gas markets, continued to be down versus last year, but were stable sequentially. we recorded an impairment charge of $800,000 as we right-sized our south texas footprint and redeployed equipment to more stable demand markets.
our overall volumes in aggregates were roughly flat versus last year, as we replaced more volatile oil and gas exposure with more stable construction market exposure. our specialty products business has also performed well, but has dealt with pockets of covid-related softness. our plaster product line has experienced strong demand in certain geographies, but softer demand in the northeast and west coast. lightweight aggregates revenue has also been lower this year, primarily from delayed or reduced demand in large non-residential construction projects. finally, revenue from our trench shoring product line was down slightly versus last year, but higher sequentially as customers gain confidence and resume more normal purchasing patterns. overall, our construction products team did an exceptional job executing in the quarter. and our strategy to deploy capital into this resilient sector has paid dividends in the midst of covid-related challenges. moving to energy equipment on slide 10. revenue grew 6% to $223 million. adjusted ebitda of $28.5 million was down from last year, but the margin of 12.8% was toward the top end of the 12% to 13% margin range that we expected at the beginning of the year. within our wind towers and utility structures revenue line, about half of the $22 million of revenue growth was from organic improvement. the other half was from our newly acquired traffic and telecom structures product lines, which both performed well during the quarter and were accretive to our segment margins. while demand remained healthy, adjusted ebitda and margins in our utility structures business were lower than we expected in the quarter due to operational challenges related to covid. we had lower production in two plants, due to higher commodity rates of covid-19 but we have since returned to more normal levels and believe we're past the major impact of these issues.
finally, while revenues were down year-over-year in our storage tanks business, we've seen improved demand in recent months. demand for our residential and commercial propane tanks has remained stable, and we have recently won several new orders for large infrastructure projects in mexico. turning to slide 11. transportation products revenue was even versus 2019 but improved margins in our barge business led to 38% adjusted ebitda growth. in the barge business, our revenues were up 28% due to increased dry barge deliveries. the team did a fantastic job driving operating efficiencies and controlling costs during the quarter, generating margins ahead of our expectations. all three of our plants delivered exceptional operating results. revenue and rail components declined year-over-year but was flat sequentially. new rail cargos continue to be weak across the industry but picked up a bit in q3, so we are hopeful that we have reached a low point in the cycle. we've been ebitda positive throughout the downturn and have had additional success in winning new orders for the more stable, maintenance and non-rail markets. we are optimistic about the business's growth prospects once the railcar market improves. on page 12, we show several additional financial items from the quarter. our corporate expenses of $17 million were higher than our normal $13 million run-rate due to $2.5 million of non-recurring legal expenses from a pre-spin-off manner as well as $1.4 million of acquisition and integration related expenses, including for the strata acquisition that we closed in october. turning to slide 13, our $93 million of free cash flow was a highlight of the quarter and reflects the strength of our growing cash culture across our businesses. $38 million of our free cash flow came from working capital improvements. our operating teams have been tightly focused on reducing receivables and inventory and extending our payable terms to industry norms.
the very strong cash flow we've had this year has helped fund more than $140 million worth of acquisitions since the end of the first quarter, while maintaining the same level of net debt to adjusted ebitda. we ended q1 with a 0.5 leverage ratio and we remain at roughly the same level, after the strata acquisition, still below our long-term target of two to 2.5 times. our balance sheet gives us a great deal of financial flexibility to continue to invest in a disciplined organic and acquisition growth that antonio will discuss in more detail.
i will now turn the call back over to antonio.
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, scott. let's turn to slide 15 for a discussion of our business outlook. starting with construction products. the overall outlook for this segment is positive, and i'll touch on three factors that underpin this outlook, attractive and market fundamentals, resiliency of margins, and a robust pipeline to deploy capital. first, infrastructure products -- infrastructure and residential markets have shown strong demand, which has offset softness in non-residential construction and covid-related capex deferrals from our customers. the majority of the aggregates business is located in high-growth geographies, particularly texas, where construction activity has remained robust. in the short term, lower state budgets could dampen infrastructure spending, but our federal stimulus plan including infrastructure investment could offer upside. we were pleased to see the one year extension of the fast act. second is margin resiliency. a large portion of the construction segment costs are variable, which allows the business to adjust their cost structures as demand fluctuates. in the markets where demand has softened because of covid, primarily lightweight aggregates and shoring products, we have been able to reduce our cost structure and maintain healthy margins. even with slowdowns in those businesses, we were able to increase segment margins by 250 basis points in the quarter. finally, we continue to be optimistic on our ability to deploy capital in aggregates and specialty materials, both organically and through acquisitions. an example of this disciplined capital allocation was the october acquisition of strata materials. the bulk of strata revenue comes from recycled aggregates, which is a key area of focus for us that started with the acquisition of cherry earlier this year.
the acquisition is an excellent strategic fit with our current footprint as it brings on six new locations in the dallas-fort worth market, including five recycled aggregates plant and one natural aggregate plant. with this acquisition, we will be able to offer our dfw customers both recycle and natural aggregates and accelerate our growth. we continue to build a pipeline of additional acquisitions with aggregates and specialty materials. turning to energy equipment. the utility structure market is extremely strong with demand outpacing our current production capacity. utility customers continue to implement grid hardening and reliability initiatives, as well as invest in renewable connections. to meet this increased demand, we have started delivering products from our plant in mexico, where we have invested roughly $20 million over the last year. we're very excited about the possibilities and the ramp up we expect to see over the next several quarters. our new acquisitions of traffic and telecom structures and concrete poles are doing well with strong backlogs and positive trends. we're in the beginning stages of this integration and have started to achieve early commercial and operational synergies. at the same time, our goal continues to be to grow by replicating these new product lines across our footprint. moving to our wind tower business. as we have discussed before, we expected the wind tower market to become project-based as a production tax rate phases out, and this is what we're seeing. we booked a $154 million of new wind tower orders in the third quarter, and we continue to see good project based inquiries. with these orders, we have good visibility for the 2021 production plans, supporting our theses of an orderly step down from ptc subsidies. as we have also discussed in the past, wind towers have gotten much larger. in 2021, we're scheduled to produce some of the larger wind towers in our [indecipherable] plant, which is not set up for those towers.
therefore, over the next few months, we will be investing in retooling that plant. as a result, we plan to reduce our production in the [indecipherable] plant during the fourth quarter to ramp up back in the middle of the first quarter. having to retool one of our plants due to improved demand for larger wind towers is a positive development for our wind tower business. but we expect this temporary shutdown to impact the fourth quarter results, probably $2 million or $3 million of additional expenses are lost profit. although, we remain optimistic about additional orders in the next few months, we expect 2021 to be a transition year for the industry, given the expiration of the ptc, and we do expect lower wind tower deliveries than 2020. if we look beyond next year, the fundamentals for the wind tower industry remain strong. turning to transportation, covid-19 has slowed the positive barge momentum that we experienced earlier this year, but we're still optimistic on the medium and long-term. long-term fundamentals for both dry and liquid barges remain quite strong, giving an aging fleet, the natural replacement cycle and higher grain movements. we're encouraged by the uptick in dry barge inquiries, but we expect that the liquid market will take longer to recover. given our conviction in the long-term fundamentals of the market, our main focus is to maintain our flexibility to efficiently ramp up production when more significant order activity resumes. we have taken steps to extend our backlog and slow down production at our three plants in anticipation of lower volumes next year. we have worked with customers to extend roughly $27 million in orders from q4 into 2021, which will reduce q4 results, but will allow us time -- which will allow us time for confidence to return for new orders to materialize. at the same time, we're working to promote new ways of utilizing barges to move additional cargo on the river system. containers have traditionally been moved by rail and truck but not -- but only a small percentage by inland barge.
we recently completed the design of a container-specific barge, which can move up over 50% more containers than traditional hopper barges. this improvement could generate significant cost reductions in container logistics by barge and create a strong incentive to invest in the needed infrastructure. over the next few months, we will be making two container barges and have worked with a couple of customers who will start testing this. this is a medium term project that we believe will have very attractive economic benefits for our customers, while at the same time generating significant environmental benefits as well. for our rail components business where demand has been weak, we continue to expand our products and customer base to non-rail markets and expect to benefit from an added volume while the railcar demand normalizes. finishing up on slide 18, in a few days, we will mark our second anniversary as an independent public company. in reviewing our overall performance in the first three years, three key takeaways come to mind. first, we have transformed our business repositioning around core infrastructure products that enhance our resiliency, reduce our cyclicality, and expand our potential for long-term sustainable growth. it has been accomplished through a combination of organic initiatives and more than $800 million of strategic acquisitions that we targeted for their attractive market characteristics, and alignment with esg initiatives. we have accomplished this transformation using very modest leverage, using our strong free cash flow. we continue to have the balance sheet capacity and appetite to pursue additional acquisitions. next, i would like to highlight that this transformation has progressed successfully, despite the backdrop of the economic slowdown of the last seven months that has impacted a number of our businesses.
the pandemic has made operating and competing deals more challenging, but we have continued to move forward, albeit at a slower pace than we would have liked. we remain committed to taking further steps toward our long-term strategic goal of simplifying our business. finally, and most important takeaway is that the fundamentals of our business remain strong. there is likely some volatility in front of us, giving us certainty covid creates, but the markets where we are focused have strong fundamentals with positive long-term sustainable growth. at arcosa, disciplined capital allocation is a key priority, and we expect to continue investing in those businesses that help us fulfill our long-term vision to grow in attractive markets with competitive advantages, reduce the complexity and cyclicality of our business, improve our long-term returns and integrate esg into our business. with only three years as an independent company, we're just getting started. there's still a lot to do, and we believe we have tremendous opportunities ahead of us and look forward to continuing to build our cost.
i would like to open the call for questions.

[operator instructions] and we will take our first question from julio romero with sidoti. please go ahead. your line is open.
julio romero -- sidoti -- analyst
hi, good morning i hope you all are well.
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
hi, julio. you too.
julio romero -- sidoti -- analyst
i wanted to ask about the barge business. you mentioned that orders in october were better than in 3q in total. what do you think is driving the uptick recently? and do you expect orders and inquiry activity to kind of remain at that same level in november and december, or maybe better than the pace in october?
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
yes. this is antonio, julio. let me give you some color on this. if you remember, we had a very good first quarter in orders and then after covid hit, i think, like most businesses, our customers started looking at their capex and trying to figure out how to conserve cash. and that's the first impact we saw people were trying to avoid large capex. and then, you had of course the uncertainty how much the merchandise was going to be moving on the river system. so, you have two different dynamics here. on the liquid barge, we said we have not seen an uptick in demand, we continue to see very slow inquiries. utilization rates are very, very low. so, that's why we're saying that it's going to take longer to recover. on the dry cargo side, you've seen a very healthy crop, you've seen china importing more grain, and they're still far away from the target that they have set. rates have gone up. the opening of the illinois river in october is going to help. so, i think there's a lot of positive signs for the dry cargo market. and if you remember, over the last five years, the dry cargo market has been the one that has replaced their barges more slowly. so, there's more potential for replacement in the dry side and in the liquid side. and that's why because of this uncertainty on the amount of orders that we will receive, and we are positive in the ones that we're receiving, we continue to see inquiries as of this morning. i think, that's why we said that our priority is to remain flexible in our production footprint, so that we can react when our customers need us to deliver these barges. because if you remember in 2018, when demand picked up, we were not ready and we were slow to ramp up, we need to ramp up much faster, and that's the forces we have going forward.
julio romero -- sidoti -- analyst
got it. and nice job on the cash flow in the quarter. i think, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about extending payables, working to extend payables to more of industry norm. so, can you just talk about that? and is days payable in that mid-30s range kind of where you expect to be in the future?
scott beasley -- chief financial officer
sure. julio, this is scott. i think, the biggest thing we've done is create a focus on cash culture, where everybody is very-focused on cash, when we spun off from our former parent company, that hadn't been a priority. and so, over the last two years, we've been trying to build the cultural foundation. we've seen a lot of success and we generated about $170 million of free cash flow this year, thus far, $93 million in the quarter. i'd say we've made the most progress in our accounts receivable. we have made progress in accounts payable, have room to go. and then, inventory remains probably the biggest opportunity, where it's a little harder to get, because it involves more full kind of operational redesigns but we think that we have opportunities in inventory too. so, across inventory and ap, i think, we still have room to improve working capital and we're optimistic that we can do that next year.
julio romero -- sidoti -- analyst
i appreciate the comprehensive answer. i'll hop back into queue.
scott beasley -- chief financial officer
thanks.
operator
and we will take our next question from bascome majors with susquehanna. please go ahead. your line is open.
bascome majors -- susquehanna -- analyst
yes. thanks for taking my questions. you made some preliminary commentary on next year in the wind tower business. i was hoping that we could pull it back a little more. and at least for those businesses, where you do have backlog and some visibility, just directionally think about what next year might look like, or at least start like from where we sit today.
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
sure. bascome, let me give you some color on -- we're still in october, almost the end of october. so, we still have ways to go. we haven't even done our budgeting. so, it's hard for me to give you a lot of color. but, i'll tell you where things are playing out and how i see our markets for 2021, just directionally. we're very, very positive on our construction segment. we will have strata for the full year; we will have all these small acquisitions that we did for the full year. and, we have organic growth. we've invested in the houston area, scott mentioned. we're investing around the dallas-fort worth area, we're investing around some of their operations. and the shoring business is looking better than -- we had a really bad year, it doesn't show in our numbers, because some of our businesses have done fantastic. but our lightweight aggregates that are showing progress did not do well in terms of revenue and growth. they kept their margins, and that's what we liked, but they did not have a good year. and they're struggling because of a lot of covid project delays, especially in the areas where they're located. so, i think, the construction segment, if you put all of those together, we're very positive about growing it in 2021 at a very healthy level. on the energy side, we have -- as we said, our utility structure continues to be strong, and we continue to see it as a very strong market for 2021. we will have our acquisitions for the full year next year, which will allow us to grow there. we have these projects to replicate these acquisitions in other areas.
so, you will see us deploy capital there. and, we have the new plant in mexico, which we will be ramping up and that plant should allow us to continue to grow volumes for 2020, we're also very optimistic there. the tank business in mexico should be relatively stable. and then, on the on the wind tower side, what i mentioned is that -- and we have said this probably since before we spun off. we expected 2021 to be a transition year as ptc expires. and my comment there has always been that i expect the industry in general to kind of go through this reinvention of being in an industry with no production tax credit. it's an industry that's been used to having it. i think, there are significant differences now. the technology is allowing wind towers to compete head to head without a ptc etc. but, it's still a big change for the industry. so, that's why we're saying we're very happy that this -- we've got the orders, we continue to receive inquiries. we're very optimistic about additional orders for 2021. we don't think that's it. but, we do expect that 2021 is going to be lower than 2020. if you remember, to deliver a tower -- to install a wind farm in 2021, you basically need to deliver the towers halfway through the year. so, that's why i think we have relatively good visibility. things can change, we can still get a orders, and we are operating our three plants, and we still have a plant in mexico that we're not using. so, i think there's opportunities.
i will tell you directionally, the two areas of big opportunities for changes are barges and wind towers, because that's where we have more -- a little more uncertainty in terms of how big the orders we can expect. but overall, we're very positive on the wind tower fundamentals for the long term. for 2021, we do expect a little slowdown. then on the transportation side, that's where we have the most volatility, let's say. i think, on the rail components, we are at the bottom. the business is performing very well at the bottom. it's generating positive ebitda, as scott said. and we saw some positive orders compared to the second quarter in the rail industry. we've grown our non-rail customers quite a bit and non-rail products quite a bit and we're very optimistic about the prospect of continuing to grow there. but, the rail industry is cyclical as you very well know. so, if the rail industry recovers, i think we have a very nice uptick in our business, because we've been able to cut our costs so much. and then, the barge industry, i think, we -- as i mentioned before in previous question, we're very optimistic on the dry cargo orders. we're keeping our plants flexible. liquid barges are different story. we are not so sure where that's going to go, how long it's going to take to recover, probably sometime in 2021. what i can tell you is that we will have the capacity to ramp up as orders materialize. and that's why i say that we are building this container barges in one of our plants that allows us to extend some of our plants operating for a longer period of time to allow time for those orders to materialize. hopefully, i gave you lots of information that hopefully-hopefully that's what you were expecting.
bascome majors -- susquehanna -- analyst
that's tremendously helpful. and i appreciate your candid discussion before you've gone and set your budget. one more and then i'll pass it on. i recall, with the nature of a tax free spin, there's some limitations, at least at the parent company with the irs and what you can do from a capital allocation standpoint, until you hit that two-year anniversary. with that two-year anniversary for arcosa as a spin-co, was anything restricted in the last two years? and starting next week, as you lap that, is there more optionality or opportunity on some things you can do with capital allocation next week that you couldn't do this week?
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
i'm not alone in the room, bascome. but, i'll tell you that the -- there were some limitations from the tax to allow the spin-off to be tax free. i will tell you that there were -- there's quite a bit of limitations. the biggest limitation we had was on the energy equipment segment, which is what's considered our main segment as we spun off, because of its size. but, there were some other limitations. what we mentioned in my remark -- prepared remarks is that we continue to be committed to simplifying the business, as we have discussed before. and i also mentioned that we have continued to move forward with our initiatives with the pandemic and everything. but, things have slowed down. and we didn't expect, for example, the drop in the rail market as fast as it did this year, starting last year and some of the things that have slowed us down in making some decisions. so, the comment i can tell you is that i think after november 1st, we -- a lot of limitations go away. but, that has not been the primary, let's say, bottleneck for us to do things. i think, it was there, but it was not the primary focus. i think, the business conditions have to be what drives us. and the business conditions have been relatively uncertain over the last year or so. but, we are still committed with what we said day one from the spin-off.
bascome majors -- susquehanna -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
and we will take our next question from stefanos crist with cjs securities. please go ahead. your line is open.
stefanos crist -- cjs securities -- analyst
good morning and thanks for taking my questions. first, you talked about operational challenges and utility structures business due to covid. could you go in a little more detail on what those challenges are, and maybe how long you expect those to linger?
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
sure. stefanos, this is antonio. let me give you some color. and, the challenges were mainly in the first half of the third quarter. they've been improving since then. but, two of our big plants were in communities where covid was -- covid cases were going pretty significantly. and we had to isolate a lot of people because of that. and, as you start isolating people, absenteeism goes up tremendously. and even though you don't realize it, but we try to operate in a very lean organization. so, we don't have a significant backup. if you send five people home in a certain area, you don't have people to substitute them. so, we really were -- two of our plants were basically brought to their knees for a few weeks. and since then, things have improved. so, those two plans have started to come back. and in september, they behaved much better than august and july. so, i think, we're moving ahead. and we are mostly out of the woods. so, things are starting to perform very well again. but, that's one of the examples of what covid can create for one of your plants, if something happens in the communities, mainly in the communities, and then they bring it into the plant. so, i think that was the case. but, it did impact us pretty significantly in our utility structure for the quarter. we are optimistic and we're very positive on the fourth quarter in our utility structure. and the good news is that these are not like hotel rooms where you don't sleep and it goes away. the orders are still there, the customers are still there, we need to deliver. so, that's probably the good news around it.
stefanos crist -- cjs securities -- analyst
thank you. that makes sense. and then, could you maybe give us a little more color on organic growth, in aggregates?
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so, scott mentioned we have invested quite a bit in increasing our reserve base around houston. houston still has a lot of potential for us. when we bought cherry, they had a very nice strategic plan laid out of how to expand toward the areas where houston is growing. so, houston has been one of our big -- organic areas. around dfw, again, we continue to expand and we bought -- we've gone through some land acquisition mainly, but more the bolt-on acquisitions have been -- those are inorganic but have helped us. when you start combining a few bolt-ons, you start generating synergies between them that we consider that part organic. and then, on the specialty materials, as scott said, i think, the highlight is our plaster business continues to grow. we saw a slowdown in the second quarter but it started to grow again. and we have nice organic opportunities there. so, overall, i would say that it's been around houston, dallas and some of the specialty materials.
stefanos crist -- cjs securities -- analyst
thank you. and i'll jump back in queue.
operator
we will move next with ian zaffino with oppenheimer.
ian zaffino -- oppenheimer -- analyst
scott, i don't know, if i heard actual organic growth number for the aggregates business. so, i wonder if you can maybe give that. and also maybe just -- can you talk about just the conversations you're having with customers. i guess, texas has a massive rainy day fund. is that large enough to maybe cover them for the next couple of years, or how do we think about it, as we look into next year, and maybe to some states, to have budget shortfalls, but then they also have a rainy day fund. so, if you could maybe give us some color there, have people in the industry are like thinking about this and what your customers are saying? thanks.
scott beasley -- chief financial officer
sure. ian, this is scott. i'll take those separately. so, on the organic growth rate in aggregates, we had roughly offsetting factors. so, the legacy businesses driven by strong construction market exposure was up, call it mid-single-digits in terms of volumes, that was offset by the oil and gas exposure that we had, primarily south texas and west texas. so, the two of those offset each other into roughly flat volumes. but, we talked about replacing the more volatile oil and gas exposure with more stable construction market exposure. so, we think that's a better mix, even the volumes are roughly flat. on your second question of texas fundamentals. i would agree with your premise that texas is in a very good fiscal position. so, when we look at indicators, there's a healthy state budget, there's a $9 billion rainy day fund that comptroller said is not expected to have to be used, but could be used, if needed to, for this fiscal year. you've seen healthy population growth, particularly as de-urbanization has increased in houston and dallas, and the outskirts have been a beneficiary of that. we've seen major improvement in housing starts, particularly in houston and dallas. and as antonio said, about two-thirds of our construction products exposure is in texas. and we're very bullish on the state and the fundamentals there.
ian zaffino -- oppenheimer -- analyst
okay. thanks. and then, just as a follow-up on the m&a front. you've been doing a lot of acquisitions. at the same time, the m&a market is relatively robust here. i mean, is this an opportunity to take advantage of anything inside the portfolio maybe to achieve the goals of making the business a little bit more, i guess, streamlined and a little bit more focused?
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
yes. ian, this is antonio. yes. as i said, we remain committed to that. so, there are opportunities. i think, there are opportunities to simplify the portfolio. and at the same time, we have really nice opportunities in the pipeline to deploy additional funds that we could get by simplifying. so, yes, i think, there are -- as i've said before and i am a firm believer, m&a has a life of its own. and sometimes it happens, when you least want it and sometimes it doesn't happen when you more want it. it's -- there's always -- you need to do that. and at some point, i'm sure we're going to have opportunities both on the buying side and the simplifying side. but, we remain committed to both and we made real appetite for both.

and we will take our next question from bill baldwin with baldwin anthony securities.
bill baldwin -- baldwin anthony securities -- analyst
thank you very much and thank you for taking my call. antonio, can you offer a little bit of insight into the utility structures market regarding -- how is split between your alliance customers or their alliance market and kind of the bid market? and where you see your most opportunity for arcosa's new business growth, say over the coming year or so?
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
yes. bill, i'll give you some color on that. historically, the business we have that we bought from -- in 2014, as part of trading is what mainly concentrated on alliance customers. and that has been the focus of the business. and i think, there's several -- and we took out three big opportunities. one is, expanding our alliance customers, and we've been focusing on that. we have great opportunities to expand those. and i think i'm very excited about what i'm seeing and talking to the team about expanding that part of the business. the second one, probably the biggest by far is the bid market, because we have historically participated very little. as we expand our capacity, i think, the bid market has to be part of our portfolio where we play and part of our priorities to deploy some of our capacity there. it offers great things, it offers our volume, but it's less reassuring. let's say, you have less visibility around it and therefore you have to be much more flexible in your manufacturing footprint to attack it. and that's what we're building. and then, the third piece of growth is expanding our product line to offer to both the alliance and the bid markets. and that's why we're expanding our bid -- our portfolio with these concrete poles, with distribution poles, with other kind of structures that they need. so, i think both markets are important. and if we add the additional product line to our opportunities, i think, we're very, very excited about our future there.
bill baldwin -- baldwin anthony securities -- analyst
thank you, antonio. that does offer some good insight. but, do you see the -- with the hurricanes being a negative obviously for a lot of operators, but do you see that as a impetus to demand for some of your utility tower products here, as you need to replace what's been destroyed?
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
yes...
bill baldwin -- baldwin anthony securities -- analyst
do you have meaningful market, i guess, is what i'm saying. is that going to be a source of demand here in 2021?
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
that's a really good question and something we don't talk enough about. but, it's -- weather events are becoming more and more prevalent. and there's a few of our businesses that are very well-positioned to be very relevant in the rebuilding. one is the utility structures and distribution poles, as you said. all the structures in general, the one that we bought in florida for traffic structures also gets additional volume. and also, our business around the gulf coast, cherry and some of our average business, there's significant demand that comes back when there's weather events, you have to rebuild in -- especially in houston, for example, the levees and all those things. there's significant demand that comes from those. we've been preparing for those. i mentioned in the last conference call, we're starting to import riprap from mexico to try to help our business. so, i think, we're optimistic. as i mentioned to bascome in his question around 2021, the ups and downs of all of our businesses, we're optimistic about 2021. and as weather events come, i think that's an additional, let's say, driver for our demand, some of our products.
bill baldwin -- baldwin anthony securities -- analyst
on your acquisitions and traffic structures and telecom structures, your objective is to replicate that and expand the footprint to i guess a more national marketplace. what are the main challenges, antonio? and taken those smaller, right now, where you have concentration in smaller markets and expanding that out to other markets in the country, what's the main challenges of doing that?
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
it's also a very good question. i think we -- the big challenge, if you look at the company is to create a different structure, as we look at the markets. commercial is a very different market. if you look at the traffic structure or the telecom structure, they're very different market from utility. the commercial face of the company has to be remained very-focused on each one of the markets. while the manufacturing piece is where we generate a lot of the synergies by putting these product through similar plant, has to be kind of a single source of manufacturing for the three markets. so, that's -- the next challenge is to introduce these new products into our plants, to generate the synergies, while at the same time keeping the focus on our customers and the focus on the commercial aspect, very focused.
bill baldwin -- baldwin anthony securities -- analyst
does it involve having to go out and acquire new customers as you go into these new markets? does it involve any kind of regulatory tests you have to pass for your products to go into different states and hotels? do you have any new customer challenges and/or regulatory challenges with expanding this business?
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
some of the plants, depending on the product line, some of the plants have to be certified for certain dots and some of the things. so, there are regulatory aspects that we have to follow. and that will take some time, but it's nothing that we cannot do and we're not used to doing. on the customer side, it's like everything else, we just have to put our suit on and get our briefcase and travel to see the customers and convince them that we're a good option and then prove that we are the best option.
bill baldwin -- baldwin anthony securities -- analyst
i bet you can do that. lastly, just -- you mentioned a number of times that storage business has large infrastructure projects in mexico. can you be more specific or offer color as to what the nature of those projects are?
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
well, as you know, there is some strategic projects that the mexican government is building. and those are large, specifically around the refining area, and there's been some opportunities there that we are starting to capture. we are not selling -- we do not sell directly to governments, we sell everything through construction companies, large epc. so, that's -- our main focus is serving the large epcs that serve the infrastructure market. so, we are not a direct seller to any specific project. we sell through large international epcs.
operator
we will move next with justin bergner with g.research.
justin bergner -- g.research -- analyst
i hopped on the call a bit late. so, i apologize if anything here is redundant. on the barge side of the business, you had positive comments about the outlook for dry barges, but it doesn't seem like that filtered through into orders in the quarter. and so, i guess, any color there would be helpful. and, what does the rising steel price mean, if anything, for that -- for the dry barge market?
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
so, justin, this is antonio. let me mention. the dry -- as we said in the prepared remarks, the quarter was very slow in orders. we received additional orders afterwards. and we continue to receive inquiries, as i said, even to this morning. so, we're more optimistic on the dry cargo market. we're still in the pandemic. so, i think, a lot of the customers have still some reservations around when to deploy their capital into additional capex. but, the dry cargo market has very specific dynamics that are positive. grain exports that's going to china, china buying more, rates are up, river reopening, a lot of positive things are happening there. over the last six months, we've had really positive steel prices, as you mentioned. when you look at the steel prices, we're going through a very interesting time, where the main -- when you hear steel prices are going up, it is mainly on the coil side. so, over the last six months, there's been a complete, i would say, a reverse trend of what traditionally has happened. plates have been historically more expensive than coil. and over the last six months, that has reversed. today, coil is the one that's going up, and plate has remained relatively flat. i personally believe that plates continue to be very -- very, very attractive prices at where we are today. and that's why we're saying that for us, steel prices continue to be a positive thing for barges. it still continues to go up and it reflects on the plate size, then of course, high steel prices are not good for barges because a significant portion of the cost of the barge. but overall, we're very positive on the dry cargo market. as you said, we don't have enough orders yet for 2021 to keep those at full capacity. that's why we said we're reducing our production. but, at the same time, we also said we're keeping our three plants open because we believe so strongly in the fundamentals of the market that we have to be ready when demand comes back.
justin bergner -- g.research -- analyst
okay. that makes sense. understood. shifting to energy equipment. again, if you've already answered this question or it's in your prepared remarks, just let me know and i'll go back and review the transcript. the orders seem predominantly weighted toward wind tower deliveries in 2021. i mean, i guess, it doesn't imply sort of as much orders on the utility structure side. is that just sort of idiosyncratic quarter-to-quarter behaviors? should i read anything into that?
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think, the -- let's say, the thing to remark is the wind towers. the utility structure continues to be very strong. i think, we had a good quarter for orders in the utility structure and the other small business we bought. one thing to remember in the utility structure is that a lot of the orders we received that i mentioned in the previous call to bill, from alliance customers, because they are blanket orders for the year and those have specifics. we cannot consider them part of the backlog. so, they become backlog, once we have enough details for us to consider them. so, on the utility structures, a large portion of the work we have committed for 2021, for example, is not considered in our backlog. and it will be considered as we define more specific with our customers, their needs, the timing, the pricing etc. so, on the wind tower side, it's the other way around. it's very specific. so, we can consider it part of the backlog, because it's very specific prices, timing, deliveries, etc.
justin bergner -- g.research -- analyst
okay, understood. and then, lastly, i guess, you've done a lot of m&a activity in the recent 12 months. and, are we in sort of a digest phase? is there more that you want to do in the near-term, or is there more you can get done before end of the year to take advantage of any tax-oriented sellers? any color there, if you haven't already addressed this question? sorry, if you have.
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
no. i think, we are -- the good news is that we've done a lot of m&a, mostly this year, the big one was cherry, and then the recent one from strata. and those are very similar businesses in locations that are relatively close. i'm never worried about our ability to digest these things, because we're not buying anything outside of our competency or outside of our normal reach, let's say. we're not buying something that we don't understand. so, i think, as long as you see us continuing to buy things that we understand and that we are focused on, i think, the sizes on the deals we've done are very digestible, and we are in good shape. of course, the more time we give our team to digest them, the better. but, we also see some opportunities to continue to do m&a. i wouldn't say that for the next few months you should expect something big, we need to digest strata and get that going and start pulling it out. but, we still have appetite for m&a.
justin bergner -- g.research -- analyst
okay. and if it looks like the tax regime is going to change sort of coming -- looking forward a week from now, do you think there's some bolt-on deals that would tax orient sellers that you might be able to get done before year-end? i'm just sort of curious to hear your perspective there as an industrial concern?
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
that's what we hope. i mean, we -- that's one of the things we've been discussing, how much especially small or medium sized private companies, we've seen some conversations from those sellers saying, look, i'd like to get it done before the end of the year. they might want that. but, of course, at the same time, we have to be very-disciplined and very, i would say, cautious about doing our due-diligence, and those are the things we need to be doing. but, i can tell you, we don't have a line of people outside waiting for us to do it before the end of the year. that's not the case.
justin bergner -- g.research -- analyst
and then, lastly there, are you seeing -- i mean, when you do these deals, who have you competed against to buy the companies, you're buying or the bolt-ons that you're buying, to the extent you have a reasonable sort of intuition there?
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we're all in the bolt-ons, it's more relationship-oriented where you develop a relationship with the seller, and i would say most of them, we've been the only company that we reach a fair price that we feel is fair for both sides and we all do it. when you go to the bigger companies, we have seen in some cases, some of the big names in the industry. but, as we go to the smaller and medium size, it's been mostly a handshake agreement that we come to and then we come to terms on pricing and then we move along together. i think, that's been the history. and the big deals, of course, you see big companies involved. when you go to smaller ones, it's more -- and that's why we like those things, because we don't -- prices don't get crazy.
operator
and we will move next with zane karimi [phonetic] with d.a. davidson.
zane karimi -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
juggling for a quick little follow-up color and apologies if this has already been covered, jumping on a little late as well. but, can you talk to the construction products group activity for the quarter? and specifically looking around the pricing and demand dynamics of how they may have shifted from the beginning of the quarter to the end?
scott beasley -- chief financial officer
sure. this is scott. so, i think the big headline from construction products in the quarter was our 250 basis-point improvement in margins. so, we talked a bit about volumes being up in our construction market exposure, down in oil and gas exposure, some softness related to covid in our lightweight aggregates, in our shoring businesses. but, we're most pleased with the margin improvement, despite some of those headwinds. aggregates, we had strong improvement from operating efficiencies, lower fuel costs and maintenance expenses. cherry was able to do very well despite weather events. and so, overall, it shows the resilience of the portfolio in the quarter when you have some softness to be able to improve margins like we did.

we have no further questions at this time. i would now like to turn the program back to ms. peck for any closing remarks.

antonio carrillo -- president & chief executive officer
thank you gail. good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss arcosa's fourth quarter and 2020 results and the outlook for 2021.
let me start with a few key messages on slide 4. first and foremost, we managed effectively through very difficult business conditions in 2020 and succeeded in posting record revenue and ebitda for the year along with strong free cash flow generation. this performance underscores the resilience of our business model and the strength of our portfolio of products, which we continue to reposition around core infrastructure products. these results could not have been possible without the tremendous effort of the arcosa team. the entire organization came together to enable us to stay operational throughout the worst days of the pandemic, while adhering to strict health and safety protocols.
it is important to look back at the covid case statistics across the country from october to january and to realize that the fourth quarter, we operated in an environment that was extremely -- with extremely high case counts and significant absenteeism due to quarantine protocols. there is no question that covid-19 had an impact on our business. but we're getting through it together and we're able to continue to grow organically and via acquisitions despite the challenges of 2020.
second, we continue to make progress building a strong cash culture. our 2020 free cash flow of $178 million marks another year of well over 100% conversion.
third, we took additional step toward repositioning arcosa around more stable infrastructure products. we did this through continued organic investments and acquisitions in our key growth businesses; construction products and engineered structures. as a result, we added to our resiliency and our portfolio significantly less cyclical than we were when we became an independent company in 2018.
for 2021, we are planning for a modest decline in year-over-year ebitda from our current portfolio of businesses excluding any upside from potential acquisitions. the underlying assumptions are for continued strength in our construction products and engineered structures business. we also see lower wind tower deliveries and a slow year in barge business resulting from low utilization rates in liquid barges and high steel prices impacting dry cargo barges. we plan to continue to use our strong balance sheet to invest in organic growth initiatives and in acquisitions in our growth markets. at the same time, we're focused on managing our operating expenses and our capital expenditures particularly in the businesses that are seeing pressure.
shifting to slide 9. you can see an overview of our fourth quarter results. our ebitda increased 6%, outpacing revenue growth for the quarter. we benefit from higher margins at cherry and improvements in our legacy aggregates business.
please turn to slide 10. for the full year, we achieved another year of double-digit revenue and ebitda growth, while expanding margins. our impressive 2020 performance was driven by accretive acquisitions and operational improvements in construction products and strong performance in our barge business.
i will now turn over the call to scott to discuss our segment performance and then i will return to update you on our outlook for the business. scott?
scott beasley -- chief financial officer
thank you, antonio and good morning, everyone. i'll start on slide 11 and review our segment results from the fourth quarter and the full year. in the fourth quarter, construction products revenue grew 46% to $149.1 million and adjusted ebitda increased 73% to $31 million. segment ebitda margin of 20.8% was up over 300 basis points from last year's fourth quarter, continuing a strong trend of margin improvement that we maintained all year.
a few highlights from the quarter. volumes in our legacy natural aggregates business were up significantly, driven by higher infrastructure-related work in texas and the benefit of several bolt-on acquisitions. we continued our trend of lower cost per ton through a combination of operating efficiencies, lower maintenance costs and lower fuel costs.
similar to the last several quarters, our mix shift resulted in lower asp, but gross profit per ton was up nicely from that mix shift and an improved cost structure. our two recycled aggregates platforms cherry in houston and strata in dallas performed well during the quarter, with healthy infrastructure and residential construction activity in those two key texas msas.
additionally, two of our businesses that were the most impacted by covid, specialty materials and trench shoring products both showed signs of stabilizing in the fourth quarter after being impacted by slowdowns in the second and third quarters.
lightweight aggregates volumes were up versus the fourth quarter of 2019. shoring products volumes were lower, but ebitda was flat as we were able to improve margins through cost reductions. we still have several markets that were weaker than in q4 of 2019 most notably, oil and gas, but we are optimistic that recent increases in oil prices and the small pickup in drilling activity could yield benefits later in 2021.
overall, our full year construction products growth was a 2020 highlight for arcosa. we achieved 50% adjusted ebitda growth through a combination of well-performing acquisitions and margin expansion in our legacy businesses from pricing growth and operating improvements. our full year segment margin of 23.3% was up almost 250 basis points even with covid-related downturns in several businesses.
the growth of our construction products segment has helped improve the resilience of our overall portfolio and will continue to be a focus of our capital deployment both organically and through acquisitions.
turning to engineered structures on slide 12. revenue in q4 was down slightly to $209 million and adjusted ebitda was down 16% to $23.3 million. our revenue decline was in line with our expectations as we idled one of our wind tower plants in the fourth quarter to retool for larger wind towers. that project has progressed well and we are ramping back up toward full production.
our 11.1% ebitda margin in the quarter was below our expected 12% to 13% range because of operating challenges in our utility structures business as we had roughly $2.5 million of start-up expenses at our reopened facility in mexico and covid-related impacts in several facilities. we are on a path to return to a 12% to 13% ebitda margin for the full year in 2021 with progressive improvement throughout the year as we ramp up our new plant.
demand across transmission, wind towers, telecom and traffic structures has remained strong with healthy levels of inquiries across all of those product lines. additionally, our storage tank product lines in the united states and mexico had very strong quarters led by healthy demand for residential and commercial propane tanks in q4.
for the full year of 2020, revenue in the segment was up 5% to $878 million and ebitda margin was at the high end of our 12% to 13% guidance range. so it was an overall positive year for these businesses. we expanded our product lines, grew revenue and reduced working capital significantly.
moving to transportation products on slide 13. both revenue and adjusted ebitda were lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 as we strategically extended our barge backlog to gain time for the barge market to recover.
in the fourth quarter, we also incurred a non-cash impairment charge of $4.5 million related to scrapping unusable barge manufacturing equipment that was purchased as part of a 2018 acquisition.
for the full year, revenue was flat and adjusted ebitda was up 22% to $78 million, despite weak demand from rail components all year. we have reduced our capacity and cost structure in each of these businesses, but may have to take additional actions if barge demand does not improve.
while we expect 2021 to be a down year in barge and roughly flat in rail components, the transportation products segment was a great source of cash to fund other growth projects across arcosa in 2020 and we expect it to be a healthy cash generator in 2021 as well.
turning to page 14. our free cash flow of $178 million was another highlight of our 2020 performance. it was the second straight year of free cash flow conversion well over 100% of net income and demonstrates our continued progress building a cash culture.
we made progress on receivables, payables and inventory throughout the year and reduced our working capital by roughly 20 days from the end of 2019. this excellent free cash flow has helped us fund disciplined growth, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet. we ended q4 with a 0.5 net debt-to-ebitda ratio, which gives us significant capacity to continue funding our growth strategy.
i'll finish with a few financial points on page 15. our q4 2020 corporate expenses were consistent with our normal run rate of $13 million to $14 million per quarter, after adding back $1.6 million of acquisition-related expenses, primarily from the strata acquisition. we expect a similar level of $13 million to $14 million per quarter of corporate expenses in 2021.
we had another net loss of $3.8 million in the quarter, related to a reconciliation between u.s. and mexico tax rates on foreign currency fluctuation throughout the year. this was offset by a lower tax rate, so the net impact on eps was insignificant. we finished the year with a tax rate of approximately 23% and expect a tax rate of 23% to 25% in 2021.
finally, we finished 2020 with capital expenditures of $82 million. we expect to increase that to a range of $100 million to $110 million in 2021, made up of roughly $80 million for maintenance capex, plus $20 million to $30 million of organic projects, primarily growth projects in aggregates and engineered structures.
two final notes on 2021. as we mentioned in yesterday's release, the february 2021 winter storm in texas and the broader southern united states will impact our q1 performance, as we lost more than one week of production across a significant part of our operating footprint.
the storms also created production issues in some steel mills and we are still evaluating the potential delays in our supply chain that this could create. in terms of our plants and operations, we did not suffer major damage and have restored operations in most of our footprint.
second, we expect q1 to be the lowest quarter of the year for us, as we deal with normal seasonality in our construction products businesses, plus the ramp-up we have described in engineered structures. we estimate that approximately 18% to 19% of our full year ebitda will be in the first quarter.
i will now turn the call back over to antonio for more on our 2021 outlook.
antonio carrillo -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, scott. before we go into our guidance and outlook i would like to take a moment to review with you our long-term strategy. if you remember, since we became an independent company, we defined construction products and engineered structures as the businesses where we were going to allocate capital for growth.
the growth capital would come from the rest of the arcosa businesses. over the last couple of years we have been able to allocate capital generated internally to reposition the portfolio completely.
as you can see on slide 17, arcosa is a completely different company than it was in 2018. as our aggregates and specialty materials revenue has more than doubled in the last few years, arcosa has become a more resilient less cyclical company.
as we look ahead into 2021, this strategy will not change. we will continue to allocate capital to construction products and engineered structures by generating cash in the rest of the businesses. we think 2021 will be a year where arcosa repositioning becomes even more apparent.
as you will see in our guidance in 2021, we expect a good year for our growth businesses construction products and engineered structures. on the other hand, we believe our barge business will still generate good cash flow and ebitda, but less than 2020.
what this means is that, instead of using cash flow coming from barge to support our growth, we will use our strong balance sheet. but this temporary delay in barge replacement will not slow down the transformation of arcosa.
now let's review our outlook on page 18. our 2021 guidance is for revenue of $1.78 billion to $1.9 billion and ebitda of $250 million to $270 million. while the upper end of the range represents stable year-over-year performance, this is really a story of growth for most of our business lines. the primary headwind is our barge business.
before covid, the fundamentals of the business showed the potential of a good recovery in the industry and we were actively booking strong orders. once the pandemic started, consumption of oil and oil derivatives collapsed and liquid barge utilization dropped. on the dry cargo side, fundamentals during the last year have continued to improve. however, high steel prices are preventing customer inquiries from converting into orders.
both the liquid and dry cargo replacement cycles remain fundamentally strong and we believe the slowdown will just take -- make the cycle stronger. therefore, 2021 will be a year where we focus on maintaining our manufacturing flexibility to be able to serve our customers once demand picks up. as a result, our guidance incorporates transportation segment adjusted ebitda of $35 million to $40 million in 2021 down from $78 million in 2020.
now to the business conditions. first our construction products segment continues to benefit from healthy demand. our operations are located in high-growth markets where demand has -- had strong -- has held strong throughout the pandemic. most notably, texas represents 60% of the segment's volumes. while we have observed softness in non-residential activity, infrastructure spending has been stable and residential construction has provided a boost in demand.
we're encouraged by the pickup in demand at some of our specialty materials business that were more impacted by covid as construction delays have subsided and customers have looked to replenish low inventory levels. while there is some covid-related uncertainty on the balance, demand has improved.
the potential for a new long-term highway bill with spending above fast act levels or a federal infrastructure bill would be additive to our segment at outlook. however, there is generally a lag for this type of stimulus to impact our results.
we continue to be pleased with the addition of our recycled aggregate offering cherry, which serves houston; and the recently acquired strata materials which serves dfw. we believe having the ability to offer our customers complementary sets of natural and recycled aggregates is a strategic advantage as environmentally friendly construction takes on greater prominence.
we're working to expand into other geographic markets and replicate our current success. in addition to growth, we have been able to improve margins. the margin expansion resulted from the addition of higher-margin acquisitions and operating improvements we have made across the group and highlights the excellent strategic fit and successful integration of our acquisitions. on that topic, our acquisition pipeline is robust and we continue to engage with aggregates and specialty materials companies that will expand our geographic presence and our portfolio of product offerings.
shifting to engineered structures. we have officially changed the name from energy equipment recognizing the diversified offerings in this segment following the acquisitions made in 2020. our outlook for this business segment is positive overall as demand remains strong for utility structures in light of the long-term investing in renewables grid hardening and other reliability initiatives.
also the traffic and telecom structure business we acquired last year have attractive long-term fundamentals supported by increased investment in the 5g rollout and healthy vot spending in southeast markets that we serve. we're excited about the opportunity to expand this offering in other areas of our manufacturing footprint. additionally, our storage tank production lines are seeing strong demand as they benefit from de-urbanization and strong residential construction.
turning to wind. we're pleased to see a one-year extension of the ptc approved in december providing the industry another year of partial credit through 2025. while we do not expect an impact on short-term demand from this extension it is still good news for the industry and should provide some additional medium-term demand.
as we mentioned in the past we expect wind tower volumes to be down in 2021 as the industry transitions away from 100% ptc. however, we are encouraged by recent improvements in inquiry activity and have received additional orders during the first quarter of 2021.
we have always had a positive long-term outlook for wind energy. and given the priorities of the new administration our outlook is even more positive than it was a few months ago. renewable energy is here to stay and will become even more important and arcosa is in a great position to grow with this trend.
now turning to transportation. this is a segment that faces the greatest headwinds in 2021 owing largely to the covid-led downturn in our barge business that we discussed before. however, we remain confident in our recovery as covid cases go down and vaccines increase. while we do not expect significant demand improvements in 2021 long-term fundamentals and replacement needs remain unchanged. therefore, short-term weakness means stronger replacement needs in the medium and long term.
shifting to components. demand continues to be impacted by soft railcar markets. but forecast suggests 2021 will mark a bottom and the rate of decline has slowed. our rail components business has continued to expand markets into the industrial sector and should see a rebound later in the year as the rail market improves.
turning to slide 19. you will see that taken together the fundamentals of all of our product offerings remain solid for the medium and long term and we see potential upside that could offset softness in some areas. as we reflect on 2020, three things are clear.
first, we continue to operate successfully despite a challenging operating environment and i'm extremely proud of how the arcosa team performed during 2020. second, we deployed capital into our growth business via organic initiatives and attractively priced acquisitions. with these initiatives we expanded our footprint and product lines and have created new growth platforms for arcosa.
third, our strategic repositioning into high growth less cyclical businesses have continued to take shape and add value. the main focus of our growth has been our construction products business, which has almost doubled its ebitda since the time of our separation.
as you can see from our 2020 results, this repositioning has made arcosa far more resilient to economic cycles than we were just a few years ago. in 2021, we will continue to allocate capital in line with our long-term plan to grow in attractive markets where we can have competitive advantages, reduce the complexity and cyclicality of our business improve our long-term returns and integrate esg into our business.
to that end, following up on the detailed esg update we published last august, we plan to publish our full year sustainability report in the first half of 2021, which will integrate the tcfd framework and supporting sasb metrics.
operator, i would like to open the call to questions.

operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from brent thielman from d.a. davidson. your line is open. please go ahead.
brent thielman -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great. thank you. antonio or scott, does the guidance imply you effectively don't see any kind of meaningful back half rebound in either barge or wind-related, i guess, earnings or revenue? and if not is that still possible, if we were to see orders accelerate here in the first half?
scott beasley -- chief financial officer
sure, brent. this is scott. i'll take that question. so let me give you a little a cadence-color on the cadence of 2021 and then get to your back half question. in construction products, we expect it to follow a normal seasonal trend where q1 would be the lowest meaningful step-up in q2 and q3, and then a bit of a step down in q4. that's likely to be even more pronounced this year because of the february winter storm in texas, but it will follow the normal seasonal pattern.
in engineered structures, we do expect a bit of a ramp-up throughout the year as we increased production out of the newly reopened facility. so q1 would be the lowest followed by a step-up in q2 through q4. we do have some unsold capacity in the fourth quarter, but we're encouraged by our inquiry levels across all the product lines and don't expect a problem filling out that capacity.
and then in transportation products, q1 likely will be the lowest because of our production schedule, but then relatively flat q2 through q4. we-there's the possibility of upside in the back half, if demand conditions improve significantly. that would require a meaningful step down in steel prices in the pretty short term, because of the lead time required to sell barges and then get them in the production schedule. so that's all incorporated in our guidance range. and the top end of the guidance range probably would suggest a quicker rebound in barge.
antonio carrillo -- president & chief executive officer
just to expand a little bit. i mentioned in my script that, we got some orders for wind towers in the first quarter and these are for this year. so there is still time for additional orders to materialize. our assumption is that there's not much happening this year in terms of additional barge and wind tower orders. there is still some time but i think we're building a model that shows our best expectations for the moment.
brent thielman -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. great. and then i guess the follow-up is on barge. just thinking about the business overall, i mean it would appear to me some of the fundamental drivers behind it are looking like they're improving and i would think that helps your customers at least over time. so i guess the question is do, we need to wait out these elevated through steel prices before we see some sort of recovery in orders? just be curious what your customers are telling you.
antonio carrillo -- president & chief executive officer
yes. i think that's the important piece of the conversation that you're just touching on. i think that's the key message. the key message we're seeing from our customers especially on the dry cargo side there is a significant need for new barges. the replacement cycle seems strong. agricultural prices have gone up. transportation margins have gone up. the prices of commodities have gone up. the size of the crop was very large.
so the fundamentals of the barge recovery cycle especially on the dry side are very strong. steel prices as you know 2020, everyone in the pandemic freaked out basically and slowed down production of steel. then the rebound came faster than anyone expected, especially in automotive and some other industries. that created a huge, huge demand for steel and prices just went through the roof. that's compounded with all this weather events that's hitting the steel mill.
so prices should stabilize sometime later this year probably in the summer late summer. and as that happens, i think we'll be able to sell some additional barges because they are needed. on the liquid side, the prices of oil have continued to improve and that should be really good for the industry. there's other things happening that are -- should help barge. the pipelines for example the cancellation of the pipeline could mean that there is more oil being moved in barges et cetera.
so i think once volumes come back that's the important piece. prices have come back, but volumes continue to be below 2019 levels. once volumes come back barge utilization should go up and then the replacement cycle starts. so that's why we mentioned in my script that our key for 2021 is stay flexible. we're going to take all the actions needed to reduce our cost structure, but we're going to try to stay flexible to respond to the additional demand when it comes back because we believe it's going to come back.
brent thielman -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
thank you.
operator
the next question comes from ian zaffino from oppenheimer. your line is open. please go ahead.
ian zaffino -- oppenheimer -- analyst
hey guys, thank you very much for taking my question. question would be on the growth capex. you touched upon it a little bit. can you give us a little bit more color on that? where is that going to be going? why are you doing it? and what should we really be expecting from that investment? and i have a follow-up. thanks.
antonio carrillo -- president & chief executive officer
sure. thank you, ian. let me give you some color on where we're seeing the growth capex. and the -- let's say the color on this growth capex is that, the good news for arcosa is that we have more projects than money to invest in terms of organic capex. we're being disciplined as we've always said in the capital allocation. and having several projects to invest means we can choose the best ones.
and these projects we're investing in, if you remember last year we bought a small telecom business and we bought also a concrete poll business to support our engineered structures product offerings. as we said at that time our goal is to expand those small business across some of our footprint.
and a lot of the capex we're investing in 2021 will go toward that so expanding our footprint for those new product offerings across our coast. we're also investing some in our construction segment specialty materials on our plaster plant. we are doing some investments there. but those are the two biggest projects where we're investing. as we've said the two growth areas for arcosa are engineered structures and construction products and that's where the capital is going.
ian zaffino -- oppenheimer -- analyst
okay great. and then as a follow-up i know you have a lot of exposure to texas in aggregates. you're trying to get the infrastructure bill winding its way through. can you remind us as far as texas expenditures, how much of these projects is driven by state level spend versus federal level spend, or what tends to be the mix? i'm just trying to get a sense of if we start to see incremental federal dollars how much of an uptick would that translate into to your texas exposure?
scott beasley -- chief financial officer
sure. ian, this is scott. thanks for the question. so in texas, texas actually has a lower amount of federal reimbursement than the national average. so it's more reliant on state spending. and that's good because the state fiscal health is very strong plus you have the upside from a potential federal infrastructure bill.
for example, texas lettings were up in 2020 versus 2019, which was one of the -- it was one of the stronger states. the american road and transportation builders association forecast for 2021 has texas as a stable and growing state. and then recently the state dot reconfirmed its 10-year, $75 billion unified transportation program. so, all signs at the state level are positive in texas. and then we could see some potential upside from a federal bill although, that would likely be a nine to 12-month lag time. so, more likely a 2022 impact for us.
ian zaffino -- oppenheimer -- analyst
got you. okay. thank you very much. good quarter. thanks for all the color and guidance. thank you.
antonio carrillo -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, ian.

the next question comes from stefanos crist from cjs securities. your line is open. please go ahead.
stefanos crist -- cjs securities -- analyst
antonio and scott, good morning.
antonio carrillo -- president & chief executive officer
good morning.
scott beasley -- chief financial officer
good morning.
stefanos crist -- cjs securities -- analyst
so the construction products segment isn't performing really well. can you give us a sense of the organic growth in the aggregates business?
scott beasley -- chief financial officer
sure, stef, this is scott. so the organic growth was very strong in aggregates. we said volumes up significantly so high single-digits. a lot of that was organic through improved infrastructure-related work in central and north texas. and then part of that growth was with several bolt-on acquisitions really more like organic where we've added single mines to expand our geographic footprint in the texas triangle. so, very healthy organic rate plus some nice bolt-on acquisitions.
antonio carrillo -- president & chief executive officer
the other piece that's important to remember stefanos is in 2019 if you compare the quarter -- fourth quarter of 2019 versus the fourth quarter of 2020 our -- we have good oil exposure in west texas and oklahoma. and we started to have significant volumes there in 2019 while in 2020, it's come down significantly. so those numbers sometimes create some cloudiness across the volumes. our volumes were actually stronger to -- if you look beyond that oil exposure.
stefanos crist -- cjs securities -- analyst
that's great. thank you. and just as a follow-up. antonio you mentioned 5g in the engineering structures. can you give us a little more detail on that? is that a current percentage of revenue? and where do you see that being in the next three to five years?
antonio carrillo -- president & chief executive officer
well, for us stefanos, we bought a small company in 2020, that company made very specific large sales structures and very regionally in oklahoma. so part of the capital that we're deploying this year is to expand those offerings in other parts of our footprint. we are in the learning stage, i would tell you. we are getting our feet wet on this product line. i think there's great opportunities. we are -- we have a really good management team and we are, let's say, throwing resource of this business to expand it.
i don't want to promise you a significant number over the next three to six months or a year. but i think the message i'd like for you to take is that we are very intrigued and very excited about the potential of the business. and i think there's great opportunities for us to expand. so that's -- it's -- think about it right now as just -- we're just getting started.
stefanos crist -- cjs securities -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from justin bergner from g.research. your line is open. please go ahead.
justin bergner -- g. research -- analyst
good morning, antonio. good morning, scott.
antonio carrillo -- president & chief executive officer
good morning.
scott beasley -- chief financial officer
good morning.
justin bergner -- g. research -- analyst
i guess to start just thinking about the guidance should i think about the entire revenue decline as coming from the barge business or maybe even greater than 100% of the revenue decline, given you have some inorganic contribution in the other businesses and sort of similarly for the ebitda?
scott beasley -- chief financial officer
sure justin. i'll take that. i think you're right. in terms of the revenue guidance essentially all of the decline, maybe even more than 100% of the decline we've guided to will be in transportation products. almost all of that is in barge just given the magnitude of the drop that we've talked about in barge. construction products we see healthy revenue and ebitda growth.
and then engineered structures likely given the organic projects that we've talked about plus some of the growth of the acquisitions we did in telecom and traffic, revenue flat to slightly up and then we'd expect ebitda in the same range that we had this year where a number of the organic growth projects would offset some potential headwinds in wind towers. so, you're right that the decline both in revenue and ebitda is almost all in transportation products.
justin bergner -- g. research -- analyst
okay, great. and the 12% to 13% adjusted ebitda margin range that you're guiding for in engineered structures, i realized that's just a 2021 range. but what would cause that to inflect higher or lower as we look out into later 2021 and in 2022 and beyond?
antonio carrillo -- president & chief executive officer
yes. so, justin this is antonio. i would like to give you some color on that. i think the business has performed really well. if you see how we've done over the last few years, it's improved pretty significantly. there's two big things there. one is wind towers. and wind towers is driven i would say by volume and by the conditions of the market. and in the last few years we've been very i would say aggressive in terms of focusing that those wind towers need to compete on a level-playing field with other countries. there were significant number of towers coming into the us market taking advantage of some still tariffs and trying -- and basically dumping towers into the us market.
so, one thing has to -- that has helped the margin and will help the margin in the future i think is making sure that the us competes head-to-head on a level-playing field with other countries. and we think that the conditions are here that that will happen.
also as the wind industry becomes more important that's our expectations over the next few years, demand should improve and that should also help us and that should help us keep good margins in wind tower. so, that's to me positive tailwinds for margin improvement over the next few years on the wind side.
on the utility side, i think volumes are good. i think demand is pretty robust. i think that's on our side. i think that's an internal thing that we have to continue to work. we have expanded capacity in mexico last year. we're going through the ramp-up. our utility structures business has been probably the most affected by covid in terms of number of cases and ramping up a facility in another country with new equipment, with technicians not being able to travel and those things have been probably the toughest piece for arcosa.
so, i think as we ramp up our business i think that's also positive for our margins in the future. so, i think you have a combination of outside markets that are robust and we have to execute. and that should take us to a current guidance that scott gave you. but i think there's good potential to continue to grow those margins in the future as we execute better.
justin bergner -- g. research -- analyst
okay, great. and then maybe just lastly. the ebitda hit from the weather in texas are we just talking about like a couple of million, or is it going to be more pronounced than that? just trying to think about how that might affect the guidance range you provided today.
scott beasley -- chief financial officer
sure justin. this is scott. i think the good news is that q1 is the slowest quarter of the year in construction products. and so taking a week out of production in the first quarter should have -- would have the lowest impact of any of the quarters. but we did lose a whole week across texas and a good chunk of the footprint. so it will likely be several million dollars plus.
we've restored operations we had no major damage but losing a week of production across most of the footprint will impact q1. and typically that volume is not caught up. there are other bottlenecks in the supply chain that contractors can add labor. the construction activity just gets pushed into the next quarter and then in the next year. so we've got a number of questions about whether that's -- that gets caught up within the quarter or in q2 and typically that's not how the impact of major weather events happens.
antonio carrillo -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. and ian, one-justin, sorry, just to complement. when you slow down -- when you shut down a plant, you have a double hit. you have a hit. basically you lose revenue and those things but you also lose the absorption of your cost structure. so it's normally not only a reduction in revenue, but also it impacts your margin.
the first quarter that scott gave on the -- in terms of the cadence of the guidance, we see of course the impact of the storms in texas. we have two ramp-ups happening in our illinois plant for our wind towers. we have the ramp-up in our plant in mexico for transmission towers.
and there is some potential for the steel delays that scott mentioned. some steel mills have had significant problems with the storms. so, i think we're confident that the first quarter is going to be a little rocky. but beyond that, we're very optimistic about the second third and fourth quarter.
justin bergner -- g. research -- analyst
great. thanks taking my questions.

our last question comes from leo romero from city & company [phonetic]. your line is open. please go ahead.
leo romero -- city & company -- analyst
yes. hi, good morning.
antonio carrillo -- president & chief executive officer
good morning.
scott beasley -- chief financial officer
good morning.
leo romero -- city & company -- analyst
could you maybe speak to demand trends for storage tanks in mexico? i know that's something that was improving sequentially in the third quarter. i think you called it steady in the prepared remarks. so just hoping to get some additional color to see is that's still improving or maybe more in line with third quarter demand?
antonio carrillo -- president & chief executive officer
sure. let me give you some color, because we have a pretty wide range of storage tanks in mexico. so i'll give you -- so we make everything from a barbecue cylinder to a huge sphere that you see in refineries or petrochemical plants. so, each one of them has their own different trends right now.
as you can imagine, with the cold weather, the demand for small storage propylene tanks have increased dramatically both in the us and mexico. no, it's normally -- it normally happens during the winter months. but this year has been especially strong and we've had a really good year in the us and really good year in terms of small propane tanks in mexico. so that's really good news.
on the larger side, the us is doing well. we have good demand for large tanks. in mexico as you know the economy is not doing well and investment is not happening. so large storage tanks are not that strong. we do have good let's say projects for the ones that are built on site those huge things you see in refineries and petrochemical plants. we have a few of those that are really good projects for 2021. but overall the majority of our revenue comes from small propylene tanker and that's done very, very well.
leo romero -- city & company -- analyst
okay. and i guess for my follow-up, could you give us an update on the container-specific barges you talked about last quarter? and an idea of the potential incremental sales as a result?
antonio carrillo -- president & chief executive officer
yes. so we-i'm glad you asked about that. we-the two-we're building two container barges right now. we've been very active in go investing customers and showing them the potential. the container barges will be done probably late in the spring this year and we'll start testing them with customers. we have a few customers that have been very intrigued by them and we will be testing them.
i don't think you should expect incremental revenue this year from them. this is a year of innovation and testing. but i'm very optimistic about the potential of those barges. and some customers have been very intrigued by them. so i think it's something that-as you know containers are a huge mode of transportation across the us and there's very little happening in the river. so building a container-specific barge i think the economics look really positive. and we hope it's successful.
leo romero -- city & company -- analyst

i would now like to turn the call over to antonio.
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, gail. good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss arcosa's first quarter results and our updated outlook for 2021, following the recently completed acquisition of stonepoint materials. our first quarter financial performance exceeded our expectations despite continued challenges related to covid-19 and the impact from winter storm yuri in february. these results speak to the strength and resilience of our portfolio of core infrastructure products and to the strategic investments we've made to reduce cyclicality, drive growth and enhance margins.
turning to slide 4, let me discuss a few key takeaways. our results were better than expected during the quarter, driven by strong construction products performance. in particular, the construction business has benefited from strong demand and construction activity. within engineered structures, our order activity for the utility, traffic, and telephone -- telecom structures business held strong throughout the quarter. the fundamental drivers for this business has remained very healthy given the investment in grid hardening, increased demand coming from renewable expansions, and the wireless build-out. the transportation segment continues to be impacted by the rail cycle and high steel prices.
however, we believe the rail cycle is reaching its lowest point and will start recovering. and once steel prices normalize, significant pent-up demand for barges will convert to new orders. in the meantime, we're taking steps to maintain manufacturing flexibility and at the same time, we're focusing on managing our costs.
in april, we completed the previously announced acquisition of stonepoint materials, a top 25 us platform that advances the repositioning of our culture. stonepoint is a premier asset that accelerates the growth and scale of our construction materials platform, having market-leading positions in attractive new geographies, more than four years of reserves, and an experienced team.
our short-term focus will be integrating stonepoint and building on this platform. still, we continue to seek out higher margin and higher growth opportunities to further expand our portfolio. to that end, we are pleased to have a robust pipeline and will continue to apply a rigorous analysis to every new project, organic and inorganic, and to evaluate whether that particular investment meets our strict requirements for long-term strategic value and return potential. our businesses must compete for capital to ensure that we invest in those opportunities with the highest long-term potential. also, as i will discuss later, we published our first full-year sustainability report underscoring our commitment to esg.
turning to slide 7. there is an overview of our results for the quarter. while revenue was down 10% year-to-year, this was consistent with our expectations. adjusted ebitda of $56.5 million was ahead of our forecast, even after a $4 million to $5 million negative impact from winter storm yuri. the storm increased our natural gas costs significantly and shut down many of our facilities for over a week. on the positive side, our construction segment performed better than expected during the quarter and helped us compensate for the effects of the storm.
i will now turn over the call to scott to discuss segment performance. and then i will return to update you on the outlook for the business. scott?
scott beasley -- arcosa, inc.
thank you, antonio, and good morning everyone. i'll start on slide 8 and review our segment results from the first quarter. construction products revenue grew 3% to $153.2 million and adjusted ebitda increased 2% to $32.9 million, despite the negative impacts from winter storm yuri. we estimate that the winter storm impacted construction products ebitda by roughly $3 million to $4 million, although dry weather in march helped us recover well. segment ebitda margin of 21.5% was flat versus last year, another noteworthy accomplishment given the february storm.
let me discuss a few highlights from the quarter. volumes in our legacy natural aggregates business were up organically and through bolt-on acquisitions, driven by higher infrastructure-related work in texas. we continued to drive our cost per ton lower, through operating efficiencies, lower maintenance costs, and lower fuel costs versus the first quarter of 2020. we continue to see nice price increases across our footprint, although a mix shift to a few lower asp plants resulted in a lower overall asp.
the primary headwinds in our aggregates business were oil and gas markets, which were stronger in q1 of 2020, but the overall performance in aggregates was excellent. the market for recycled aggregates also continues to be very healthy in both houston and dallas. margins were pressured in these businesses, given the impact of the storm, but end markets are healthy and we recovered well in march, as the weather improved.
finally, we're very encouraged that the two businesses that were most impacted by covid, lightweight aggregates and trench shoring products, have both recovered nicely and are now performing close to or above pre-pandemic levels.
our lightweight aggregates business was roughly flat with the pre-pandemic first quarter of 2020 and trench shoring ebitda was above the first quarter of 2020. the recovery in these businesses gives us confidence in the underlying health of our infrastructure markets and provides additional stability to our overall portfolio. we closed on stonepoint in april, so the acquisitions' contribution will begin in q2.
turning to engineered structures on slide 9. revenue in q1 declined moderately to $207 million, but was roughly flat sequentially with q4. adjusted ebitda was down year-over-year to $26.4 million. there were several unusual items in the quarter. we were helped by the sale of a non-operating facility that produced a $3.9 million gain, but we were impacted by several unplanned expenses from winter storm yuri. most notably, larger natural gas bills in several facilities. those bills increased our cost by approximately $1 million in the quarter.
our operating teams did an excellent job recovering from the storm and we were able to meet customer deliveries despite challenges throughout the supply chain, particularly for steel. our revenue decline was roughly in line with expectations. we continue to ramp up the wind tower plant that we took offline in q4 of last year, in order to retool for larger towers. we were near full production at the plant in march and it has started to contribute positive ebitda after several months of drag.
we also made progressive improvement on the reopening of our mexico utility structures facility, but it contributed to the year-over-year margin decline. our 12.8% adjusted ebitda margin in the quarter, once adjusted for these positives and negatives, was near the bottom end of our 12% to 13% range, but we continue to expect the 12% to 13% margin for the full year in 2021.
demand across transmission, wind towers, telecom, and traffic structures has remained strong, with healthy levels of inquiries across all of those product lines. the combined backlog for utility, wind, and related structures, increased to $379.5 million from $334 million at the end of 2020. additionally, our storage tank product lines in the united states and mexico continued to perform extremely well. we have been able to pass through higher steel prices and have also benefited from strong residential and commercial demand for propane tanks, driven by covid-related de-urbanization.
moving to transportation products on slide 10, our year-over-year results reflect cyclical downturns in both our barge and rail components businesses. revenue was down 31% and adjusted ebitda was down 53% as margins compressed from lower utilization in both businesses. the barge business received $16 million of orders in the quarter and backlog decreased to $133.2 million. high steel prices continue to pressure the conversion of inquiries into new orders, although we are confident in the eventual recovery that will likely be led by the dry barge market.
as we have noted on the last several calls, we have reduced our capacity and cost structure in barge and rail components. and we made the difficult decision to announce the planned idling of our louisiana barge facility, unless demand recovers in the near term. i'll note that both businesses continue to be ebitda-positive and we maintain our expectation for the segment to generate $35 million to $40 million of ebitda this year. ebitda will likely be near the low end of this range if steel prices do not moderate in the near term.
finishing on slide 11, in early april, we closed our inaugural bond offering of $400 million of eight-year unsecured senior notes to fund the stonepoint acquisition. we were able to price the offering with a 4.375% coupon, an attractive rate of long-term financing. we received public debt ratings of bb providing a strong access to capital and the flexibility to pursue our disciplined growth plans.
following the acquisition and offering, our net debt to adjusted ebitda stands at roughly 1.9 times, below our long-term target of 2.0 to 2.5 times. we had lower than expected free cash flow in q1, partially due to higher accounts receivable from delayed shipments due to winter storm uri, as well as strategic steel purchases. even with this usage of working capital in q1, we expect to be back to roughly working capital neutral for the full year.
i will now turn the call back over to antonio for more on our business outlook.
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, scott. as scott detailed, our results exceeded our expectations in the first quarter, despite continued covid-related market challenges and the negative impact from winter storm uri. before turning to our near-term outlook, slide 13 details the stonepoint acquisition that closed in april, which was an important addition for arcosa.
please turn to slide 14. as we look toward the remainder of 2021, our near-term view of our markets has not changed materially from the update we provided on our fourth quarter conference call in february. we continue to see robust and resilient construction activity in our key markets through texas and the gulf coast benefiting our construction products business.
i'm particularly excited about the growth opportunities from our acquisitions over the past 18 months, including cherry, strata, and stonepoint, which have significantly expanded our aggregates platform, adding complementary products and attractive new geographies. benefiting from favorable infrastructure spending trends in texas, our largest market, as well as on a national scale, the outlook for our construction products segment remains strong.
within our engineered structures segment, demand trends are positive. we received healthy orders for wind towers and utility structures during the quarter, as well as in our new offerings in traffic and telecom markets. we're also seeing steady demand and rising backlogs for storage tanks in both the us and mexico. while elevated steel prices remain a headwind in this segment, we will continue to stay focused on passing through price increases as much as possible.
from the demand point of view, i am encouraged by the levels of backlog and inquiry volumes overall that we are experiencing, which reflect continued interest in investment in renewable energy, grid hardening, and other power reliability initiatives. as we discussed last quarter, our transportation segment continues to face covid-related market challenges. utilization rates in the liquid barge market, while improving, remain low and high steel prices have impacted demand for dry cargo barges.
although steel components revenue declined year-over-year in the first quarter, revenue grew sequentially from the fourth quarter, suggesting this market may be turning the corner. in addition, we have expanded our products and customer base to non-rail markets, which should increase our operational leverage once the rail market demand normalizes. in this environment, we're taking steps to manage our expenses prudently and maintain manufacturing flexibility.
it's important to remember that ramping production at the barge plants up and down is something we know how to do very well. we remain confident in the medium and long-term fundamentals of our transportation products business. depressed demand now due to high steel prices and covid-related factors, should translate into a strong market once these conditions abate.
please turn to slide 15. our financial guidance for the year, the growth businesses were focused on building construction products and engineered structures are well-positioned for the future. and as i noted, we also expect a good recovery in the businesses that make up transportation products, once short-term conditions improve.
given the completion of the stonepoint acquisition on april 9, we're increasing our full-year revenue guidance. we now expect revenue to be between $1.88 billion and $2 billion, up from our prior guidance of $1.78 billion to $1.9 billion. we are also increasing our 2021 adjusted ebitda guidance. we now expect ebitda to be between $270 million and $290 million, up from our prior guidance range of $250 million to $270 million. we anticipate that stonepoint will contribute approximately $20 million in adjusted ebitda for the full 2021, representing about eight months of ownership. overall, these revised forecast positions us to meet or potentially exceed our 2020 results.
turning to slide 16. finally, i'd like to highlight some achievements we've made with respect to our environmental, social, and governance efforts, which represent a fundamental component of our long-term strategy. 2020 marked our first full year of esg disclosure and early in the process, we believe strongly in the long-term value that esg brings to our stakeholders and the communities in which we operate. to that end, last week, we published our first year sustainability report, which details the many ways in which arcosa prioritizes esg across the company.
at arcosa, there is no higher priority than employee health and safety, and i am pleased with the progress we've made in this area, following the 2019 launch of arc 100, our enhanced safety initiative. arcosa team members achieved a 56% reduction in the total recordable incident rate in 2020, demonstrating the impact of arc 100 on improving our safety culture.
from a sustainability standpoint, our plant operations take an active role in pursuing initiatives that promote environmental responsibility. last year, for example, arcosa achieved a 12% reduction in greenhouse gas emission intensity through a range of energy reduction investments across our facilities. in addition, we recorded a 16% reduction in municipal water intensity, due to our conservation efforts focused on water consumption and water recycling. our sustainability focus also plays a part in our capital allocation strategy. as we prioritize on building and expanding our growth businesses, we evaluate investments with an eye toward sustainability, as well as economic returns. our growing recycled aggregates business is a perfect example of how arcosa can enhance sustainability within our operations while generating above average margins and returns.
please turn to slide 18. in closing, our long-term vision remains unchanged. we will continue to pursue growth in attractive markets where we enjoy sustainable competitive advantages while reducing the complexity -- complexity and cyclicality of arcosa. in addition, we remain committed to improving our returns on capital and integrating environmental, social, and governance initiatives into our culture.
operator, i would like to open the call for questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] we will go with our first question from ian zaffino from oppenheimer.
ian zaffino -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thank you very much. want to ask you guys -- and i know it's a little early, but if we were to kind of focus on the infrastructure bill or were to bring to your business, can you maybe walk us through where you think it would help you, what we should expect and i believe, most of the projects are probably funded through year-end, so maybe it doesn't hit until 2022, but maybe discuss the timing as well, as far as what you anticipate? then i have a follow-up. thanks.
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
sure. ian good morning. this is antonio. let me take that one. the guidance that we gave and the optimism we're showing in our construction and our engineered structures business are not related to the infrastructure bill. we are very optimistic on the -- where the businesses are, with or without the bill, and just simply on seeing the conditions and the backlogs and the interest in the products that we're seeing, the health of the markets, the markets we see them as very healthy. now, having said so, if an infrastructure bill comes, i think when you read it, you can also track most of our products across the whole bill, so it would have very positive impacts across the organization.
but as you said most of these projects are things that take time to come through, to materialize, in many cases transmission lines to get permitted and projects to be developed. so i think you're right, i think 2022 probably mid-year '22 is where we would see some of this bill to start trickling down to where we can see it in our, in our backlogs, and in orders translate into actual orders. so, but overall we're positive with or without the bill, of course, the bill would help us in the medium term.
ian zaffino -- oppenheimer -- analyst
okay. thank you. and on the barge side, is there a magic number steel needs to decline, to the -- get orders back or maybe restart madisonville and then also oil and oil prices have improved, you know the market is getting better. has that translated or do you think that's going to translate into orders, how -- what are your customers telling you?
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so i don't think there is a magic number. but let me give you some of what we're seeing. we are seeing good inquiries on the dry cargo side. so there is an interest in barges and but if you think about the percentage of the cost of a barge that steel represents and that's why barge is such an important thing, steel is such an important component for barge, it's a huge percentage of the barge total cost. so, that's why there is two pieces to the steel question. one is, steel prices are too high, and i believe they are too high in every sense of -- we've been doing this for a long time, and i've never seen hot-rolled steel at this prices. and it's not only that they are high, they went up very, very fast.
but the other thing is, we're coming from a very low place, so if you look at a year ago, the prices of steel were less than half of where they are today. so, our customers have to, on one side, get away from the thought that we're going to get still at $500 again, because that's not going to happen. and on the other hand, steel mills have to come down from their expectation that people are going to buy anything at $1,300 a ton. that's not going to happen. so i think there is some movement on both sides that needs to happen.
having said so, and it will come down, it's just a matter of time. it always happens, this goes up and it will come down. these are cyclical markets and it will come down. is it going to be in three months or six months, i cannot tell you, but i'm optimistic that by the end of the year, we're going to see trends in a better direction.
on the demand side from our customers, i agree with you, i think oil prices have improved. when you look at the utilization rates from our customers, they are going up, they are still in the 80s [phonetic], but some of our customers just published results and they're saying they expect them to be in the 90s [phonetic] and that's what really drives demand for barges, when the utilization rates are very high, people need them. and our customers, they want to save some money on the barge, but they really want to make money on their own business, which is moving stuff now, if it's oil or grains or anything you want.
so, if demand improves like it's improving, at some point the steel price becomes a secondary issue and we believe demand will come back. and as we've talked over the last few years, there has been several years already where demand is too low and the replacement cycle has been delayed. so we expect significant pent-up demand, once these things abate. so, long answer to your question, but we're optimistic on steel prices coming down and the demand is there and will be there in the short term.
ian zaffino -- oppenheimer -- analyst
okay. one more would be, just kind of capital structure, and how are you thinking about that and i know, there is some pieces of the business that may not be with you in the long term, but i guess, those are sort of troughing out now. how are you thinking about maybe sources of liquidity and then also on the outflow side, any other acquisitions, i know you've been busy, but how are you kind of thinking about incremental deals? thanks.
scott beasley -- arcosa, inc.
yeah, sure. this is scott, ian. on the capital structure, we did our inaugural bond offering and feel very good about our balance sheet, we stood at 1.9 times net debt to adjusted ebitda after the offering and the acquisition that's still below our long-term target. so we do feel some headroom to make disciplined acquisitions if they come up. we feel equally good about our liquidity. by doing the offering, we are able to enhance our liquidity, so liquidity is not an issue. and the third part of your question was cash flow. we still expect to have very healthy free cash flow from our businesses that can fund both organic growth and then potential acquisition. so, even after this acquisition, we feel very good about our balance sheet and liquidity.
ian zaffino -- oppenheimer -- analyst
all right. thank you very much.
operator
and we will take our next question from brent thielman from d.a. davidson.. please go ahead.
brent thielman -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great, thank you. good morning. scott or antonio, i guess with respect to the guidance, has there been a change in what you expect from the barge business versus a couple of months ago?
scott beasley -- arcosa, inc.
sure. this is scott. yeah, i'd say, like i said in my prepared remarks, we gave the range of $35 million to $40 million of transportation ebitda for the full year, and given the steel prices have continued to move higher in the last eight weeks since we talked, we said we expect to be now at the low end of that range, closer to $35 million and $40 million. we do have some unsold capacity in some slots in the fourth quarter, if steel prices moderated in the near term, we'd be more optimistic about selling those slots, if they stay high, likely those production slots will go unfilled and wind up at the bottom end of that range. so it's really, as antonio said, we feel good about the underlying health of the markets and as demand continues to improve and the steel prices will eventually moderate, that business will recover, it just may not be in time for calendar year 2021.
brent thielman -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. but the range is still in play. okay. i guess the second question is on the engineered structures business, it doesn't look like steel prices are having a big effect, but maybe you could talk about any concerns on margins in the next couple of quarters, as that flows through, should we be worried about that?
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
yes. brent, it's antonio. on the engineered structures we have, across the company, let me explain to you the three types of businesses and how we treat steel. so, the first thing is, we do not speculate with steel, we don't buy steel expecting it to go up. and so, that's not our business, our business is on making stuff and providing good value to our customers. so, we have three types of business, starting with the simplest one, the tank business, which is a made-to-stock business. we buy -- we buy steel and we sell things into the market without having an idea of the price when we're selling.
so that's the business that you have to be careful because you have to adjust prices and pass them through to the customer really fast. and we've done that. as scott mentioned that in his remarks, that business has performed very well, we've been able to pass the steel prices to customers and there is significant demand for tanks right now, which is not normal. normally, tanks are not sold during this month, because they are winter products, but demand continues to go up and our backlog is very, very strong. so the market is allowing us to pass through the prices and we expect that to continue to be. so, we are not concerned about that.
the second type of business is contract business, where we have wind towers and barges are that type of business, where we buy steel tied to a contract. so we know what price of steel we have in order for a barge or a wind tower and we buy steel for that price and we pass it through to the customer and there is no uncertainty around it.
and then the third type of business is our utility structures. in that business, we also have contracts with customers and we can pass through the steel prices, but there is normally a lag. we have contracts that are three-month contracts depending on the type of the customer, three months, six months, or yearly contracts and there is a pricing mechanism and there can be some delay. and i think we have thousands of orders coming through every day and i think a little portion of the lower margins you are seeing is related to that. i expect that to continue to be the case where we have some hiccups here and there.
but the margin as scott said, we expect the margin to stay within that range of 12% to 13% for the remainder of the year. i think the first quarter was on the bottom end, but we are going to recover and we are -- we have healthy backlogs that should allow us to pass through that -- those price increases. so long answer again, but we are not very concerned, it's something we have to watch steel prices have risen very fast, so we just have to stay on top of it.
brent thielman -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
very good, thank you.
operator
we will take our next question from julio romero from sidoti.
julio romero -- sidoti -- analyst
hey, good morning, antonio. good morning, scott.
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
julio romero -- sidoti -- analyst
wanted to ask about the cash flow in the quarter. your payables continue to make progress. i think you ended days payable in the 40s, maybe if you could talk about what you did there? and then secondly, how should days payable and more broadly cash flow trend over the next few quarters?
scott beasley -- arcosa, inc.
sure. julio, this is scott. so for free cash flow in q1, it wasn't a great quarter. we did have ebitda above our expectations, we had capex in line with our expectations, but our challenge was on working capital, where we consumed about $40 million of cash in the quarter. you're right, we did make some good progress in payables and extending terms to what we call more industry norms. but, then we had challenges on both receivables and inventory. part of that was winter storm-related, so we had shipments that slipped later in q1 and therefore the receivables into q2. we don't expect any issue collecting those. and those will normalize over the course of q2.
part of our inventory build was steel-related, where we brought in some inventory in q1 ahead of price increases in april, but we'll continue to be very focused on working capital. we said, even with the $40 million drag in q1, we expect to be roughly working capital neutral by the end of the year. and so we expect to make part of that back up in q2, 3, and 4. so, by the end of the year, we'd be back to roughly neutral.
julio romero -- sidoti -- analyst
got it. and i guess my second question, i know this has been asked kind of, couple of different ways already, but in the barge business, in a scenario where steel remains elevated for a 12 month to 18 month period, i mean how do barge -- how does dry barge trend there? i mean do those inquiries, do people eventually give up and convert that into orders, or conversely, do inquiries go away, if you could just talk about a scenario where if the steel remains elevated, how dry barge orders play out? thank you.
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. julio, this is antonio. and we have received orders at this steel price. so it's -- we do, we do have orders coming in, they're just not very large. the first quarter for example was really bad for barge orders. most of the things that you saw in the order, in the numbers are components, not barges. but in the second quarter, we continue to receive orders late on that with a certain frequency. so, it's not completely dead. as i mentioned before, i think the big positive thing going on for us, is that markets are recovering.
what you have to watch for is the health of our customers. and as long as our customers are healthy, they're going to do the best thing for their business, and what their businesses focus is on moving these products across the river system. so, if our customers are healthy, and you see utilization improving, you see the grain markets being very healthy, you're seeing seed grain exports growing, that's going to be the most important decision-making point for them.
now, i think lower steel prices absolutely will help, but i think at some point, our customers will start making decisions with or without the price reductions, when will that be? i cannot tell you. but i'm -- i don't think this is a 18-month, let's say, dry spell for our barge business, when we had to completely shut down, but we'll keep an eye and we have flexibility, we can still lower our production rates, we have production capacity to ramp up in case these things improve also. so over the last few years, we've invested in our plants and we can ramp up and down production faster and better and i think we're in good shape. so i just hope steel prices moderate and we can start talking about how to increase capacity.
operator
we will take our next question from justin bergner from g.research. your line is open.
justin bergner -- g.research -- analyst
good morning, antonio. good morning, scott.
scott beasley -- arcosa, inc.
good morning.
justin bergner -- g.research -- analyst
so, in terms of the guidance, just to clarify some of the sort of small puts and takes, was the $3.9 million gain and sort of an equivalent amount of the winter storm headwinds, it looks like anticipated when you gave the guidance back end of february or are either of those elements new, as part of the revised guidance?
scott beasley -- arcosa, inc.
sure, justin. this is scott. i'd say neither were incorporated in the guidance that we gave in february, but they roughly offset each other. so in q1, we had about $4 million to $5 million of storm impact. we had the $4 million gain for the non-operating plant. so we still, that's one of the reasons we still feel like our full- year guidance range is intact, because they roughly offset each other.
justin bergner -- g.research -- analyst
okay, great. and then bigger picture, the deals that remain open to, are these more in the vein of bolt-ons, the stonepoint deal, or would you consider another deal at or near the size of stonepoint in the quarters ahead?
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
we are -- as scott mentioned, we have some room in our, in our leverage, but we don't have an enormous amount of room. so right now we don't have room to do another stonepoint size deal. so, we're going to remain disciplined. i think what you should expect to see is things that would enhance our current platforms that we've acquired over the last few years, that's what we're focusing on. stonepoint brought some ideas, cherry brought some ideas. so, that's what we're focusing on and it would be more bolt-on, there is some smaller and some bigger bolt-ons, but it would be some, let's say, additions to our platforms.
justin bergner -- g.research -- analyst
okay, great. and then just lastly, i know you were asked about infrastructure and it didn't seem like there was anything too surprising in the bill versus sort of whisper commentary we had heard beforehand, but is there any part of the bill or any part of your business where sort of the language or amounts in the draft proposal positively or negatively surprised, where you thought things would turn out?
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
no, i think we -- it was more or less, as you said it in line with everything we had heard or expected. probably the only thing we've seen some -- a more bullish language in short-term deployment of capital for some transmission lines for renewables, that's the only thing that has been probably more or expected. i'm not sure how that happens, how that translates into actual work and i think there's a lot of things behind it yet, but that's probably the only thing that was a little more bullish than we expected.
justin bergner -- g.research -- analyst
okay. are you referring to the doe loans in terms of the short-term [speech overlap] renewables?
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
justin bergner -- g.research -- analyst
okay. great. thanks and good luck for the rest of the year.
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
thank you very much.
operator
we will take our next question from stefanos christ from cjs securities.
stefanos christ -- cjs securities -- analyst
first, can we talk about the difference in the legacy natural aggregates versus the specialty materials and maybe why specialty was down year-over-year? is that just the geographic mix, or is there something else driving that?
scott beasley -- arcosa, inc.
yeah, sure. this is scott. the legacy business was up strongly, really in all three parts of the end market, where very strong infrastructure-driven work, strong residential demand, a lot of that's been driven by de-urbanization and then the non-residential demand has been strong too, with a lot of distribution center and data center work. so that's all been healthy. specialty products has a bit more building products focused and we've talked about, there was destocking throughout the supply chain last year, there were a number of construction delays throughout the supply chain. that was therefore impacted more by covid and has been slower to recover. we'd say the good news is, in q1, our lightweight business was at or above where it was in the pre-pandemic q1 of 2020. so, that gives us increased confidence that we're coming out of a lot of the worst covid impacts and that's one of the reasons we're particularly optimistic about this year.
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
stefanos, let me just add one thing. our specialty materials in the first quarter was, where we had the biggest impact from the storm in terms of natural gas prices. it's -- it was -- we have a plant that normally had a $30,000 bill and it went to hundreds of thousands. so it's -- we have a few of those and specialty materials is where we felt the biggest impact from the natural gas side.
stefanos christ -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it. thank you. i mean, just one more, back on barge, with steel prices so high and barge utilization low, are you seeing any customers scrapping their older barges?
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'm glad you asked that, because the good news is, i mean steel prices are going up but scrap prices are also very, very high. there has been times when we buy steel at the price to, you can buy scrap right now. so we are seeing scrap rates increase. last year was a year where there were more barge scrap than built. so, and it's been already a few years, so that's good, that's why we are saying that the pent-up demand for barges is accumulating, the replacement cycle is coming, it's been delayed by several factors. we were very bullish a couple of years ago, when we opened a plant because we see it coming, we just didn't expect covid to reduce the utilization so much, but -- and we didn't expect, of course, the steel prices to go like they are going. so, but these are temporary things and it's like everything we just have to wait a few quarters for this to pick up i think.
stefanos christ -- cjs securities -- analyst
perfect. thank you, antonio. and thank you, scott.
antonio carrillo -- president and chief executive officer

operator
good morning, and welcome to the arcosa, inc. second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. my name is grutchen, and i will be your conference call coordinator today. a copy of yesterday's press release and the slide presentation for this morning's call are posted on the company's investor relations website, www.ir.arcosa.com. [operator instructions] now i would like to turn the call over to your host, gail peck, cfo for arcosa. ms. peck, you may begin.
gail m. peck -- chief financial officer
good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining arcosa's second quarter 2021 earnings call. with me today is antonio carrillo, president and ceo. let me begin with some important reminders. today's comments and presentation slides contain financial measures that have not been prepared in accordance with gaap. reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures to the closest gaap measure are included in the appendix of the slide presentation. in addition, today's conference call contains forward-looking statements as defined by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. please refer to the company's sec filings for more information on these risks and uncertainties, including the press release we filed yesterday and our form 10-q expected to be filed later today. antonio will begin today's call with a discussion of our overall second quarter performance and the acquisition of southwest rock products that we were pleased to announce in yesterday's release. i would now like to turn the call over to antonio.
antonio carrillo -- president, chief executive officer & director
thank you, gail. good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. starting on slide 4. arcosa executed well in the second quarter, generating 3% revenue growth over the prior year and reporting adjusted ebitda in line with last year's record. despite the headwinds we faced in the quarter, our solid financial performance underscores the resilience of our business and the benefit of strategic investments we have made to expand our business into attractive new markets. let me discuss a few key takeaways from the quarter. the construction products business, which now represents more than 50% of our adjusted ebitda continues to benefit from strong activity and the outlook remains positive. the segment generated 17% growth in the second quarter adjusted ebitda even after the impact of excessive rainfall. we're managing our continued steel price inflation through proactive price increases across our operations. however, in our barge business and to a lesser extent, wind towers, high steel prices are limiting the conversion of inquiries into new orders weighing on our near-term expectations for these businesses. engineered structures continues to experience a healthy level of order activity, driven by three key trends: increased utility spending to improve the reliability of the electric grid; the connection of renewable energy sources to the power grid; and continued federal and safety investments in road infrastructure. finally, i'm excited to announce today our acquisition of southwest rock products. the transaction, which follows our purchase of stonepoint materials this past april exemplifies how we are successfully executing on our long-term strategy by evolving our portfolio toward higher margins, faster growth and less cyclical products. turning to slide 7. let's look at our consolidated results for the second quarter. revenue increased 3% from the prior year reflecting strength in our construction products and engineered structural segments, partially offset by continued softness in the transportation products segment. adjusted ebitda was approximately even compared to the record level in last year's second quarter, benefiting in part from the contribution from recent acquisitions in construction products and favorable product mix in engineered structures. second quarter adjusted net income declined 18%, primarily due to the increase in noncash expenses, specifically depreciation and amortization from recent acquisitions. please turn to slide 8. we're excited about the acquisition of southwest rock, a leading pure-play aggregates producer serving the greater metropolitan phoenix market. aggregates business of southwest rock scale and quality are scarce, and we couldn't be more pleased that their experienced team is joining arcosa. with five active sand and gravel locations and one hardrock quarry location, southwest rock produces approximately five million tons of aggregates annually and is backed by an attractive reserve profile. southwest rock expands our footprint into one of the fastest-growing construction markets in the u.s. and strengthens our position as a leading aggregate supplier.
the acquisition should take arcosa's production to over 35 million tons of aggregate and specialty materials, plus between three million and four million tons of recycled aggregates. from a financial perspective, southwest rock generated trailing 12 months revenue of approximately $36 million and adjusted ebitda of approximately $14 million as of may 31, 2021. given this high level of profitability, southwest adjusted ebitda margins are accretive to our construction products segment and to arcosa overall. importantly, the acquisition was sourced from stonepoint's pipeline of deals highlighting the advantages of our increased scale and the follow-on benefits this acquisition strategy can provide. turning to slide 9. we're particularly enthusiastic about the significant growth opportunity that southwest rock adds to our construction materials platform. as i've mentioned earlier, the phoenix metropolitan market is one of the fastest-growing construction markets in the nation, underpinned by robust large-scale investment needs to support population growth. in fact, arizona is ranked number `1 in infrastructure spending on highway contracts over the past five years underscoring the compelling growth opportunity for arcosa as we enter this market at scale. since becoming an independent public company almost three years ago, we have invested approximately $1.3 billion in strategic construction materials acquisitions that reposition arcosa to our higher growth and higher-margin infrastructure opportunities. having announced two sizable acquisitions, stonepoint and southwest rock already this year, we intend to focus our efforts over the next few quarters on integration, organic growth opportunities and simplifying arcosa's overall portfolio. i will now turn over the call to gail to discuss our segment performance, and then i will return to update you on our outlook for our business.

thank you, antonio. i'll start on slide 10 and review our segment results from the second quarter. construction products revenue grew 38% and adjusted ebitda increased 17%, led by the contribution from the stonepoint acquisition that closed in early april. segment ebitda margin was 22.1%, down from 26% a year ago. there were several factors driving the margin decline. as antonio noted, excessive rainfall in texas, our largest exposure and along the gulf coast, reduced segment adjusted ebitda by approximately $3 million to $4 million in the quarter. construction activity returned to healthy levels in june once the weather improved. we had strong shipment levels on days not impacted by wet weather, but overall, volumes were lower than expected due to rainfall. higher diesel costs also impacted margins for the quarter. lastly, the inclusion of stonepoint was also dilutive to margins as we now include their revenues on a gross basis, inclusive of pass-through freight in line with our legacy businesses. we experienced pricing gains across most markets supported by strengthening product demand and attractive fundamentals. midyear price increases have also been announced, which should provide further support heading into next year. our two businesses that were most impacted by covid, lightweight aggregates and trench shoring products generated strong results during the quarter with ebitda above year ago levels and demand tracking at a pre-pandemic pace. the integration of stonepoint is advancing well, and our synergy realization is progressing as planned. despite adverse weather in the second quarter, stonepoint is on track to meet our adjusted ebitda expectations for 2021. the integration into our legacy texas and louisiana footprint is well underway and nearly complete from an operational standpoint. a focus area going forward is systems integration as we move to consolidate our entire construction materials platform onto one common erp. turning to engineered structures on slide 11. we revenue increased 9% and adjusted ebitda increased 25% to $38 million. we were helped during the quarter by a $7.7 million resolution of a customer dispute from 2019 in our wind towers business. the associated towers were removed from our backlog in 2020, and we were pleased to reach a settlement agreement. we are currently building towers for this customer, and we maintain a good commercial relationship. without this benefit, our adjusted ebitda margin would have been 12.9%, in line with our overall expectations for the segment. we experienced higher sequential ebitda and margins in our utility structures business from improved mix our successful efforts to mitigate high steel prices and further progress on our mexico plant reopening. utility structure orders were healthy, leading to a book-to-bill above one during the quarter. we also saw favorable order trends in traffic structures, and we continue to see positive demand drivers for telecom structures, though order volumes were lower in the quarter. our wind tower business performed largely in line with our expectations. as antonio will discuss, order activity was muted as our customers delayed purchase decisions seeking more clarity on near-term fundamentals.
the combined backlog for utility, wind and related structures was $348.5 million at the end of the quarter, about flat with year ago levels. our storage tank product line in the u.s. and mexico continued to perform well with higher margins year-over-year as we benefited from strong residential and commercial demand for propane tanks. moving to transportation products on slide 12. both revenue and adjusted ebitda were significantly lower year-over-year, reflecting the cyclical downturns in both our barge and rail components businesses. revenue was down 47% and adjusted ebitda decreased 73% as margins compressed due to lower utilization in both businesses. steel prices continued to advance in the second quarter, suppressing new order volumes in our barge business. we received orders of $55 million, representing a book-to-bill of 1.1 times on a low level of revenues. pricing of new orders reflect weak market conditions with orders helping to provide a base level of production in 2022 to remain flexible and provide time for a recovery. our backlog was $139.4 million at the end of the quarter, with approximately $47 million scheduled for delivery in 2022. we are optimistic regarding our market recovery in our steel components business, and our recent results exhibit signs of troughing. the railcar oem had a second consecutive quarter of a book-to-bill above 1, and third-party expectations continue to point to higher north american railcar deliveries next year. as we wait for a much anticipated recovery, we have been successfully diversifying into new markets, attracting new customers and controlling cost to maintain positive ebitda. wrapping up on slide 13, i'll conclude with a few comments on our balance sheet, liquidity and free cash flow. as we discussed previously, we issued $400 million of low coupon long-term debt in april to fund the stonepoint acquisition. to fund yesterday's closing of southwest rock, we used cash on hand and $100 million of borrowing under our revolving credit facility. following the acquisition, our net debt to adjusted ebitda stands at roughly 2.4 times and within our long-term target of two to 2.5 times, even as our transportation products ebitda is cyclically depressed. as i noted, acquisition integration is a key focus area, and we will likely take a pause on additional acquisitions near term as we focus on completing those efforts. we continue to see attractive opportunities to deploy capital organically, and we are maintaining our capex guidance of $110 million to $120 million, which should cover any anticipated needs from southwest rock. post-acquisition, we have more than $300 million of available liquidity and no near-term debt maturities. as we maintain our cash-focused culture, we improved our working capital management by $41 million relative to the first quarter. this helped us return to a positive free cash flow position, generating $29 million in the quarter. i will now turn the call back over to antonio for more discussion on our business outlook.
antonio carrillo -- president, chief executive officer & director
thank you, gail. please turn to slide 15. as gail discussed, arcosa delivered solid q2 results, led by growth in our construction products and engineered structures businesses, despite the impact of abnormally wet weather in our largest market and continued softness in our transportation products segment. the outlook for construction products remains positive, driven by strong demand for aggregates in our key markets in texas as well as tennessee and solid recovery of our specialty materials and shoring products. an area of weakness we continue to see is pennsylvania, where we have some exposure to natural gas infrastructure spending. overall, we expect a strong second half for our construction products segment, reflecting continued positive market fundamentals favorable pricing and positive contribution from our two new recent acquisitions. in our engineered structures segment, we expect to see year-over-year growth in the second half of the year in most of our businesses. in utility structures, we are seeing strong demand as our customers direct capital spending toward electric grid hardening and reliability projects. department of transportation spending in florida and throughout the southeast remains favorable, leading to healthy order growth and rising customer demand for our traffic structures, while telecom customers continue to build out 5g networks. in our storage tank business, we are experiencing strong pricing power giving steady demand, primarily reflecting continued housing market growth and the trend toward the urbanization. in our wind tower business, we have seen a recent pause in new orders in light of growing uncertainties surrounding potential extension of the u.s. potential tax credit for new wind farm developments. high steel prices and a late june extension of the ptc for wind farms currently under construction have also contributed to the delay in customer decisions. as a result, our unsold production slots for the fourth quarter are expected to remain unfilled. given our positive view of the market beyond this anticipated short-term slowdown, we're working to extend some backlog into 2022 to allow time for the market to rebound. our main priorities during this period will be to prudently manage our costs while at the same time, preserve our manufacturing flexibility in order to serve our customers when the demand picks back up. the long-term fundamentals for wind energy remained positive and our leading manufacturing presence -- north american presence positions us well for the future. in our transportation products segment, market conditions remain challenging in our barge business, impacted by the covid-19-related downturn and high steel prices that have reduced order activity for both dry and liquid tank barges. in addition, to the idling of our louisiana plant in the third quarter, which we previously announced, we are extending our barge-related backlog into 2022 to maintain manufacturing continuity.
at the same time, given the slowdown in the market, we foresee significant pent-up demand. therefore, maintaining our manufacturing flexibility during this period will be critical to be able to serve the market as it recovers. for our steel components business serving north american railcar industry, we believe that 2021 is likely to mark the trough of the cycle. we're encouraged by the signs of improvement we have seen in this business, as new railcar orders are outpaced shipments in the second quarter. and we expect further growth in the second half of the year and into fiscal 2022. as we look longer term, there has been positive movement on the national infrastructure debate and the potential for increased stimulus. we're encouraged by the recent positive traction in the senate to advance a new infrastructure framework. we're also cautiously optimistic concerning the reauthorization of the fast act at higher spending levels. please turn to slide 16. turning now to our financial guidance for the year. our consolidated adjusted ebitda guidance of $270 million to $290 million for 2021 is unchanged, which keeps us in pace to meet or exceed last year's record performance, led by strength in construction products and engineered structures. on a more granular level, our new forecast includes the results of southwest rock from the date of the acquisition. it also includes a reduction in our full year adjusted ebitda outlook in the transportation products segment to approximately $25 million, down from $35 million to $40 million we previously expected. in summary, i'm pleased with the progress we're making in executing our long-term vision. at our investor day in 2018, we communicated the focus of arcosa would be to growing construction products segment and enhance our engineered structured business. we have executed on those strategies and our financial strength and reduced cyclicality show the results. through acquisitions and organic growth, we have significantly scaled our construction products business, strengthening our market position, broadening our capabilities and enhancing our growth potential while reducing overall cyclicality. southwest rock is an exciting addition to our aggregates business expanding our footprint into one of the fastest-growing metropolitan regions in the country. also, the outlook for the engineered structures business remains favorable, as arcosa retains a leading position supplying essential infrastructure to the renewable energy, utility, telecom and road construction markets. in short, we continue to advance on our long-term plan to grow in attractive markets with sustainable competitive advantages while reducing the cyclicality of our business and improving our returns. at the same time, we continue to work on our esg efforts. esg is becoming part of our culture. and as we evolve and learned, we should be able to accelerate our pace. as always, the health and safety of our employees continues to be the most important aspect of what we do every day. with the increased covid cases we have recently seen in some of the regions where we operate, we will continue to monitor the situation and follow the cdc guidelines in our operations. operator, i would like to open the call for questions.

[operator instructions] and we'll take our first question from ian zaffino from oppenheimer. your line is open, please go ahead.
ian alton zaffino -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
hi great, thank you very much. i just kind of wanted to ask you about the barge business on the steel side, is there a magic number steel needs to fall to that you think is going to improve the order flow? is it a matter of just seeing directionally that it's going down? does it need to fall below a threshold? how do you kind of think about that?
antonio carrillo -- president, chief executive officer & director
thank you, ian. let me try to give you some more color around this issue. so as you saw in the quarter, even at these levels, we sold barges. we had a nice barge order, a few large barge orders. and the problem at selling at these prices is that the margins are low. so i think that it's not about a magic number. every forecast that you see out there or most of the forecast that i've seen show price for steel slowing down sometime late this year or early next year. and what happens then is we have -- there's two pieces here. one is we have to make sure that i don't think prices will go down to $500 that we were seeing last year because the economy was shut down. but at the same time, i don't think the prices should stay at $1,700. there is a bunch of capacity coming online in 2022, both on the coil and the plate side. and that will lead us to believe that there's going to be a price reduction at some point in time. so i think two things need to happen. first, customers need to understand that we're not seeing $500 again in the near term. and second, the conditions -- there's two different markets here, the dry cargo barge market and the liquid cargo market. and they are different stages in their cycles. on the dry cargo side, everything looks very positive for significant orders to come back. there's been very low replacement of barges over the last four or five years. there is a lot of scrapping going on with high scrap prices at this moment. there's a lot of scrapping of barges happening. so everything seems to be pointing to a very robust comeback of that market. on the liquid side -- and the dry cargo didn't see a lot of impact from covid. grains continue to ship and everything happened well. on the liquid side, it's a little different story. they face two different problems. one is reduction in oil demand and oil derivatives. and at the same time, steel price is high. so i think, as you've seen, oil has continued to come back. we're still not at the levels where we were in 2019, but it's starting to come back. and then steel prices are still high. so i think that's going to take a little longer. so we expect a -- first a recovery on the dry cargo side and then on the liquid side. the good news is that we have a pretty strong backlog that will carry us through this time. this is not a -- i don't think this is a thing that will take years to solve itself. we know how to navigate these down cycles. we know how to manage our costs. and i think we're in a really good position as we've moved our portfolio to our construction products to withstand this slowdown. and then when it comes back, it's going to come back very strong. that's our expectation.
ian alton zaffino -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
okay. great. and then the second question would be -- and maybe just like a little bit of a 2-part question, but i wanted to ask you about guidance because unchanged here on the ebitda line, but then you're adding in stonepoint. so kind of help us understand maybe your outlook for aggregates is similar to what you were originally thinking? it seems that way, but also maybe you could unpack your comments about the fast act extension or maybe wrap that around an infrastructure bill discussion as well and how that would help the construction products business? thanks.
gail m. peck -- chief financial officer
yes. ian, this is gail. let me take the first part of that, maybe i'll turn it back over to antonio for the fast act implications. on the guidance topic, as you pointed out, we did maintain our guidance range of $270 million to $290 million of ebitda, essentially looking at it in total. there were some goes in and goes out that balanced out within the range. we're pleased to see the full year ebitda still tracking on pace with last year's strong results, and that's despite more than a $50 million headwind year-over-year that we're having from transportation products. some of the minuses clearly were the impact of steel continuing to press higher ahead of our expectations that's impacted our order decisions -- customers' orders decisions, as antonio said, on barge and wind tower customers. so leaving some production slots unfilled in the fourth quarter. adverse weather clearly impacted construction. we know weather is always a variable, but the rain we had this past quarter was excessive. but to your question, ian, the outlook for construction remains very much intact. we had a very strong june with -- when the weather is normal and dry. we're very pleased with what we're seeing. to the plus, we also had the wind tower settlement and then the earnings coming from southwest rock. but the net of all of these essentially, i think, is falling within the range, and we're very excited about keeping our guidance maintained.
antonio carrillo -- president, chief executive officer & director
and ian, the second piece, just to clarify also on the guidance. stonepoint was already in our guidance in the previous quarter. what we added was southwest rock, and you see the number in the presentation. it's summarizing $4 million to $5 million that we added to the guidance, but we subtracted the barge piece. so as gail said, we are very pleased with our construction segment. we had a very, very, very wet april, especially may in houston and in dallas, and that slowed us down. and we gave a number of $3 million to $4 million of impact for the quarter. but when the rain subsided and it became a more normal weather pattern, we saw incredible demand come back, and we have a very, very strong june with very strong margins. we saw pricing power to push through our costs. so we were very pleased with the rebound in june. and we see very strong backlogs and very strong demand in most of the regions where we operate. so the fast act, it has to be extended, and we expect it to be extended hopefully at a higher level. but what we're seeing both with the fast act and with the infrastructure packages have been discussed, i think those are really good things. but we are seeing very strong demand at the moment with or without them. so i'm very encouraged by what we're seeing in the market, and we're very happy with the performance of our construction products segment, especially also now that the other two pieces of the segment, which were shoring and specialty materials have recovered very well. we saw very nice pricing and very nice volumes for the quarter.
ian alton zaffino -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
ok perfect thank you very much.

we'll take our next question from brent thielman from d.a. davidson. your line is open, please go ahead.
brent edward thielman -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
hi good morning, antonio, it looks like you've been able to manage through this steel environment pretty well in the energy structures business. can we continue to expect this level of margin performance, i guess, ex the customer dispute into the second half and i guess going forward, i guess what i'm asking, is there any catch-up in higher steel prices or some of the supply chain constraints that might impact the segment going forward?
antonio carrillo -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. it's a really good question. i think we've been doing very well with it. as i -- i think in the previous call, i described our three types of businesses we have. and let me try to describe them again, each one has their own special circumstances. so we have -- i would tell you the one that we've been spending most of our time is our engineered structures, our transmission business when we have contracts with customers that allow us to pass through the cost, the additional cost of steel, but they allow us to do it normally in a -- with some delay. so there is some revisions that happen depending on the contract, monthly, quarterly, etc. so what you're seeing, we are already -- we have those impacts already in our margins today. so we've been absorbing part of that increase through the delay. so as we -- price of steel has continued to go up, but in much smaller numbers. so i think now we're at a relatively stable place in steel prices. so i think the margin should start normalizing, and we should start seeing probably some positive momentum in our utility structure business. the second part is the -- the second piece of the products that we produce is the ones that we make build-to-order. so those are our tanks. and on the tank side, as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're seeing very, very strong pricing power. there's a lot of demand for tanks. we are at a low -- normally during the summer, there's not a lot of demand for tanks, and we're seeing incredible demand. our backlogs are very strong, and pricing is very, very strong. so we're very happy with what we're seeing in our tank business. the third piece is wind towers and barges, which are contracted prices. so we normally sell the towers or the barges, and we have a contract of steel attached to it. and those -- there is a pass-through, and i'm not concerned about those margins related to the contracts. so i would tell you, if anything, we have some positive momentum on the utility structure and tanks, the other ones i'm not concerned about. i don't see any supply issues in terms of volumes. but remember that we have said in our remarks that we will -- we are pushing some of the wind tower and barge volume to 2022. so you will see some reduced volumes in the second half of the year to try to maintain our flexibility. and what you will see is the impact of that margin because of that, not because we're seeing -- we cannot manage our costs simply because the volume is going to come down a little bit there.
brent edward thielman -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
okay. i appreciate that. and then i guess the second question would be on the acquisition you just completed southwest. it looks like it produces exceptionally high margins, at least relative to the -- to your core construction products segment. is there something in particular they're doing or just a really strong environment in phoenix right now? any color there would be helpful.
antonio carrillo -- president, chief executive officer & director
sure. and i'll give you probably a bigger picture. we've mentioned in our calls before and the meetings with the analysts. the next stage for our growth that we developed probably 1.5 years ago, first stage was growing texas and adjacencies. and then we worked on this strategic plan to the -- metropolitan areas would be our next stages for growth, and that's why we came up with stonepoint. and arizona was in that list of metropolitan areas, we were very interested in. when we evaluate metropolitan areas, we go through a rigorous analysis of why we like them. and there's many things, including population growth and infrastructure spending, but also what's the competitive environment in that region. and those are the things that make the metropolitan areas have better or worse market conditions. i think arizona and phoenix specific in that region has all those things looking very positive. we like the mark. we like the population growth. we like the infrastructure spending. we like the competitive environment there. and all of those things are shown in the margin. and that's why when we look at our long-term strategy, we say we want to grow in attractive markets with competitive advantages, i think that's how they get reflected in the margin. so -- but we like phoenix. it has great conditions. and the margin is high. one of the things i would tell you is that as a public company when we come in, we normally add some costs because of simply our reporting and things. we will probably drive that margin a little down based on some -- adding a few additional controls over that operation. but it's not major, but it's something we normally see. but very attractive, very good acquisition, a great market.
brent edward thielman -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
ok, thank you.

we'll take our next question from julio romero from sidoti. your line is open, go ahead.
julio alberto romero -- sidoti & company, llc -- analyst
hi goodmorning antonio and gail. just wanted to follow up on the last question from brent there on the trailing 12-month margins for southwest rock. it looks really strong. and i don't know if you can speak to the -- i wanted to dig a little more on the kind of margins you expect southwest to contribute to arcosa. is there a ramp to get to 39%? is there upside to 39%? and just kind of help us understand what are normalized margins for southwest kind of once it's under the arcosa umbrella?
antonio carrillo -- president, chief executive officer & director
julio, this is antonio. as you know, we just closed on it yesterday was a -- it was a process that we started a few months ago. as i said in my remarks, this acquisition came -- was in the pipeline coming from stonepoint. so we bought stonepoint in april, and we're in august closing this one. so the margins have been relatively steady for them for the last several quarters. so it's not something that -- it's a unique circumstance. they performed very well over the last several, several quarters. they have different -- they have sand and gravel and they also have hard rock. but what i would like to offer to you that we're going to take the operation up and understand it well, understand what additional costs we're going to have to add to simply for control for our control environment and maybe come back to you with some additional color on the margins. we do not expect a significant reduction. but i would say that -- and we've seen that in dallas at some point in time when there is high demand, we can get to the 39%, 40%. but in the long term, i think the margin should be more in line with our peers. so they should be probably in the mid-30s in that region. i think the 39% would be the higher end of the range that i would give you for that operation.
julio alberto romero -- sidoti & company, llc -- analyst
great. thank you for the color there. and i guess my second question is just on barge, can you maybe give a little more granularity on the evolution of customer thinking about capital deployment for barges? i'm just -- yes, i would think there's a reasonable expectation that maybe still might even go up from here. so i just want to kind of ask about how customers are thinking? are some customers capitulating or some still holding out? and has that mix of customers accepting the new normal of steel versus holding out evolved at all in the last 6, nine months?
antonio carrillo -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. that's a good question. so as you can imagine, steel prices and the acceptance of steel price really has to do with our customers' business model. and let me give you a couple of examples. on the utility structures, our customers are able to pass that additional steel cost through their tariffs to the customers. in the case of barges, it's a different scenario. there's relatively established barge rates for the river system. and when you plug those barge rates in the river system that allows you to calculate how much you can pay for a barge. so -- and those are things that don't move overnight. so i think if the steel prices are staying at these levels over the medium and long term, which i don't believe they're going to stay at this level, but they're going to be higher than they were in the past. there needs to be some adjustment to the tariffs in the river system for them to be able to invest. and that should happen. it just takes longer time. and that's the mental aspect that they're going through. what how much can i pay for a barges based on the rates in the river at the moment? that's one. the other one is the demand side, how many barges are idle and how many barges are being used. on the dry cargo side, i would tell you, it's -- the river is busy. there's a lot of movement. of course, right now, it's not the main crop season, but it's going to get busy soon, and everything points out to be a very strong market coming from the grain side. the coal, believe it or not, the coal market has been busy with natural prices going up. there's a lot of coal movement happening. i don't expect the coal barge market to be at any point, growing. but it's not -- i wouldn't say it's a noise anymore. if you think about it, if you take out the barge, the coal barges from the equation, if you're really negative on them. the replacement cycle for the barges is several times what we've seen over the last few years. so there's been several years of very, very low dry cargo barges being built compared to what the market needs to be. so we are very encouraged, and that's what the customers are telling us. there's a need for barges, there's a need to replace those barges. we just need to make the numbers work for them. on the liquid side, i would say this is the same mentality. there's the rates in the river, but there's also the demand side and demand is coming back slowly. i would say the petrochemical is coming back very strong, but the oil side is a little slower. so that's a long answer to your question, but i think the mentality is, there is a need for the barges. we need to make the economics work, and they're trying to figure out what that numbers look like.
julio alberto romero -- sidoti & company, llc -- analyst

and we'll take our next question from stefanos crist from cjs. your line is open, please go ahead.
stefanos chambous crist -- cjs securities, inc. -- analyst
good morning and. congrats on the quarter. could you -- on aggregates, can you give us some more color on pricing and volume? and then what organic growth is built in your guidance?
gail m. peck -- chief financial officer
good morning. stefanos, this is gail. yes, sure, i'll take that one. on the volume side, clearly, we had the weather impact. so when weather was dry, our volume was tracking ahead of our expectations. i think as i mentioned earlier, we saw strong aggregates volume growth in june and unit profitability. so encouraged with the attractive fundamentals, encouraged with our ability to drive price in most markets. we had price increases early in the year, and we implemented additional midyear pricing increases. so good momentum on the pricing side, i'd say very much in line with the market and our peers on that front. so weather being the biggest impact on natural and recycled aggregates. really kind of moving away from aggregates for a bit, our specialty materials and trench shoring their more nationwide businesses and not as impacted by the localized weather effects in texas and on the coast that we had. so we saw strong lightweight volumes with demand, as i mentioned, at pre-pandemic pace. so very encouraged with what we're seeing there. the ability to drive price there as well and same on our trench shoring side. so all in all, on a quarter perspective, coming back to aggregate, ex the addition of stonepoint. so clearly, we had good growth in volumes with the quarter with bringing stonepoint into the portfolio. we did see volume growth. i'd attribute that some to some bolt-ons that we completed late in the year last year, but we did see a small amount of organic growth despite the weather.
antonio carrillo -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. stefanos, this is antonio. one more thing that we did not touch on the remarks, but the other thing that we saw in the quarter was there was a -- one of the bottlenecks in the industry, specifically in texas was there was cement locations. after the storms in february, there was a shutdown of a couple of cement plants that created a significant problem of cement industry here in texas, and there were allocations. we consume cement in our specialty materials in our cherry business. but also a lot of our customers, which are ready-mix companies that buy cement, were in a location. so that created a bottleneck for the quarter. that allocation has gone away. there's imports coming into the port of houston and others. and there is no allocation anymore. so i think we should be a much more conducive environment in the second half of the year to be able to grow organically in texas.
stefanos chambous crist -- cjs securities, inc. -- analyst
that's great color. thank you. and then just on the southwest acquisition. is the strategy going forward to build more in phoenix? or do you think the strategy is more focused on finding other metropolitan areas? how should investors think about that?
antonio carrillo -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. so that's a great question. as i've said in my prepared remarks, i think we've done a lot of acquisitions. we've used our balance sheet to a point where we feel very comfortable where we are. as gail said in her prepared remarks, we're measuring 2.4 times after the acquisition on net debt-to-ebitda. but at a very low point in our cyclical business is the barge and rail components, etc. so we are very comfortable where we are. but at the same time, our focus over the next few quarters is going to be finishing the integration of these acquisitions. we have a lot of things to do there, extracting all the value from them making sure we fund them well. we understand their needs and their organic needs also, all of them come with very strong management teams, but also with a lot of ideas of how to grow organically. and when we put all those ideas together, we have -- the good news is we have a lot of projects that we can choose to continue to allocate capital. so over the next few quarters, i think you should see us allocate capital to finishing the integration organic growth. we have some very nice organic projects that are getting to be finished. and then the way you should see each one of our platforms, phoenix, tennessee, pennsylvania, texas, is there's going to be some bolt-ons around them. normally, we've been able to find those bolt-ons at relatively attractive prices, easy to integrate, and they allow us to grow faster. and you will see us do that before we jump into another metropolitan area. those are larger, and we need to generate cash to be able to do that again. so the short term is more on the bolt-on organic growth and integration.

good morning antonio, good morning gail. a few questions on southwest. some quick ones. first, was it an auction? second, what would you say is its competitive advantage? and third, given sort of the low revenue per ton, sort of what's the backdrop there? is it low transportation costs? and what are the capex needs?
antonio carrillo -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. let me take a stab. so the deal was not a process. as i said, when we bought stonepoint, they have developed a relationship with the majority shareholder and they were already in talks, and we were able to, let's say, continue building that trust with the owner and with the management team. and we -- i think we reached a good agreement with the shareholders. so it was not a process, and that's what we like. we normally -- we prefer acquisitions where there is not a process involved. and so we were very happy with that piece. the company has the competitive advantage, i would say, like every other -- like every other aggregates business is their location, where the reserves are. it's always the biggest thing. and they have really good locations. they've been in that market forever, both the owner and the operator and the management team are very experienced in the region, very experienced in the area. we're inheriting a very capable management team that knows the area very well. and it comes down to location, and that's the competitive advantage. also, they have incredibly well-kept and well-run operations. when you go there -- i can tell you i've seen a lot. and these are as good as it gets. they had an incredible clean, well-maintained, well-capitalized business. we do not see significant need for any capex. like always, what you should see us do in phoenix, like in all the areas, our focus is going to be as we grow this business, so continue to find reserves and look for additional growth in the region. but overall, no big needs for capex.
gail m. peck -- chief financial officer
yes. justin, i would say -- this is gail. i would say, on the capex front, their historical run rate has been about $3 million to $4 million a year. they are -- from an equipment and property plant perspective in fabulous shape. they've been investing in the company, keeping up on maintenance. so we really don't see anything near term other than their normal annual needs from a capex perspective.
justin laurence bergner -- gabelli funds, llc -- analyst
great. thank you. and one other question, if i may. i know you discussed sort of input cost pressures in regards to steel earlier. but is it safe to say that considering the puts and takes to your maintained $270 million to $290 million ebitda guidance, the increased cost pressure is not one of the headwinds or larger headwinds in the current guidance than when it was sort of updated or maintained a quarter ago? or has cost pressure become more of a headwind in your maintained guide?
antonio carrillo -- president, chief executive officer & director
no, i think you're right. i think we've been able to manage the cost pressure well. and i think we found -- we are -- let's say, we found the way to do it and do it well and our team is doing a fantastic job passing those through. the thing -- the biggest headwind for us is volume in barges and wind towers. those are the two headwinds for the second quarter. we believe they are temporary, and they're going to come back. and the good news is we built an incredible platform. our construction segment is the size of arcosa in terms of ebitda when we spun 2.5 years ago. so we built a very strong base. and when this cyclical business has come back, we mentioned the rail components is coming back, and we're going to start seeing that in the second half a little by little. so i think i'm very comfortable where we are happy with what we see for the future and happy with the way we're passing through the price increases. and once we solve this steel issue of hitting our customers' volumes, i think we're going to be in a really nice track.
justin laurence bergner -- gabelli funds, llc -- analyst
thank you. best of luck in the second half.
antonio carrillo -- president, chief executive officer & director
