thank you. (operator instructions) our first question is from mike morales with walthausen & company. please go ahead.
michael morales -- walthausen & company -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys and thanks for taking my questions. i want to dig into a little bit on the slower bookings that you commented on. i know last call that you said that january was running pretty strong, but there was some concerns about inventory levels out there. can you just give more color on when and in what verticals you started to see slower bookings in the first quarter?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i think across the board, i think there's two major things that we're facing. one was the shortages that were out in a market, driven by ics and capacitors that people were being cautious and double booking and making sure, they had orders come in. so that was one concern that we felt that was out there. the other concern was if the government moves from a 10% tariff to a 25% tariff, people want to get those products in before then.
and also, i think some two of our major distributors that are both private companies. one is digikey, one is mouser. i think really took a very aggressive stance, and bringing in substantial inventory. so we see both of those distributors just holding back on their order process at this time. and so, we're projecting that by this quarter, hopefully, a lot of that inventory would be flushed out.
michael morales -- walthausen & company -- analyst
got you. so just to make sure that i'm interpreting this correctly. you said you expect downward pressure in the second quarter. is that a slight top line contraction? are you subjecting a little bit of growth in the second quarter, how are you think (ph) about that and what do you suspect?
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting
i think for the second quarter as we indicated, we are expecting top line sales to go down compared to last year's second quarter. and at this point, we're estimating high single-digit decline.
michael morales -- walthausen & company -- analyst
okay.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting
now, as we look to the second half of the year, it's still a little too early to tell at this point. we do see some positive growth drivers further out in the year particularly related to some military programs that we're on and also hev projects that are picking up.
but we -- we typically only have about 12 weeks of visibility in our business. so, it's hard to predict at this point, how the second half will look, but we do see positive indicators as we look to the second half.
michael morales -- walthausen & company -- analyst
great. that's very helpful. thanks for the color. and then dan, one of the things that you mentioned was some concern about the component shortages that are out there. i've heard over the past couple of months, people kind of point to june 2019 is when this starts to fully work itself out. we've seen some relief recently moved from where you guys are sitting. what are you seeing on the component side? is there any areas of tightness. has it worked itself out? how is that right now?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i think at this point, we see a substantial easing of the lead times. we were facing some situation with lead times to stretch out past a year, 18 months. i think that's come down substantially more real reasonable levels.
the big curve ball that we have out there, i think is electric cars, and the uses that they have with capacitors and ics. so, for example, if you look at we do a lot (ph) with fuses and circuit protection, the standard non-electric car were maybe used 40 or 50 fuses, on a new car -- electric car, you could have 500 fuses.
so we don't know how that's going to progress and how that's going to change the market. if you look back at the shortages that we were facing last year, i think it was large -- largely dependent on the auto industry.
michael morales -- walthausen & company -- analyst
ok. and then, i've also read that china's kind of pulling back some subsidies hev's
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
electric cars. yeah.
michael morales -- walthausen & company -- analyst
hev exposure be -- electric cars. where would your hev exposure be. is it more china-oriented? is it us and europe?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
no, it's definitely more north america and european. i don't think we -- we (inaudible) cost competitor for the electric market in china. so our focus has been more -- from the power side, it's more a niche markets in europe and in north america. and by then for example buses, trailers, not...
michael morales -- walthausen & company -- analyst
off-road equipment...
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
off-road. yeah. even we do -- we're working a lot with motor companies for -- i'm sorry boating companies now on battery charges for them. also, we do a lot of work with tesla on circuit protection.
michael morales -- walthausen & company -- analyst
got it. dan, lynn and craig, thank you very much for the color. i appreciate it.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
we appreciate the questions.
operator
(operator instructions) our next question is from hendi susanto with g. research. please go ahead.
hendi susanto -- g. research -- analyst
good morning, dan, craig and lynn.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
hi.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting
good morning.
hendi susanto -- g. research -- analyst
dan, do you have estimate of 5g addressable market for bel fuse? and can you remind us your major products that will benefit from 5g?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
okay. what we're doing is a lot -- a lot of the wireless work, again, looking at telecommunication where that's going, looking at the auto industry, different areas are moving. i mean, if you look at 5g, it's -- basically you have a whole world interconnects with itself from what's going to happen with the lighting systems outside, how cars interact with each other.
so basically, we're coming up with array of products that can meet this new technology. really focused on the rf side, and the wireless side of the business from that. i should say from the cinch side, the high -- or the high reliability side of the business than the commercial side.
hendi susanto -- g. research -- analyst
and then i think you cited like lower demand of macjack and discrete magnetic component in q1. how should we expect those two product groups to trend as we see the remainder of 2019. should we expect like lower demand to continue?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think both of those -- those product groups go heavily into the networking companies like hp or cisco or oracle (ph). so i think -- again, i think they're more of an no way (ph) inventory situation, because of the concerns they had with the shortages that they brought in. cinch is a greater product than they need. so we're hoping that a lot of that product could be flushed out this quarter and hopefully the beginning of next quarter. so it should start improving by the second half of this year.
hendi susanto -- g. research -- analyst
okay. and then lynn mentioned q2 expectation of high single digit year-over-year. and can you elaborate let's say, like across different segments like whether like one would see, like a higher decline versus like a slower decline among your product groups, i mean.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
lynn, do you want to take that one?
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting
sure. so i think on the magnetic solutions piece, we're probably going to see the highest decline in that group. just related to what dan was just referring to, one of our major customers had a new product launch. they have a lot of inventory on hand right now, that they're working through. and under the new revenue recognition standard, we now report revenue as we ship it to their hubs. so to the extent that they are using inventory and we're not shipping as much, that does have a downward impact on our sales.
so i think that's the group where we see the most decline, the connectivity solutions group, some pressure there, but could either be flat slightly down, but no major concerns there. and then on the power solutions group, we are expecting that to be down a bit from last year's second quarter. we did have some shipments especially in two blockchain customers that we don't anticipate repeating in this year's second quarter.
hendi susanto -- g. research -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. thank you.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting

good day, and welcome to the bel fuse inc. first quarter 2019 results conference call. today's conference is being recorded. at this time, i'd like to turn the conference over to mr. dan bernstein, president and chief executive officer. please go ahead, sir.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, mary. joining me on the call today is craig brosious, our vice president of finance; lynn hutkin, our director of financial reporting. before we begin the call, i'd like to ask lynn to go over the safe harbor statement. lynn?
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting
thank you, dan. good morning, everybody. before we start, i'd like to read the following safe harbor statement. except for historical information contained on this call, the matters discussed on this call such as statements regarding sales projections, customer demand, the impact of product releases and anticipated cost savings are forward-looking statements as described under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties.
actual results could differ materially from those projections. among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements are: the market concerns facing our customers; the continuing viability of sectors that rely on our products; the effects of business and economic conditions; difficulties associated with integrating recently acquired companies; capacity and supply constraints or difficulties; product development, commercialization or technological difficulties; the regulatory and trade environment; risks associated with foreign currencies; uncertainties associated with legal proceedings; the market's acceptance of the company's new products and competitive responses to those new products; the impact of changes to us trade and tariff policies; and the risk factors detailed from time-to-time in the company's sec reports. in light of the risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that any forward-looking statement will, in fact, prove to be correct.
we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. we may also discuss non-gaap results during this call and reconciliations of our gaap results to non-gaap results have been included in our release.
i would now like to turn the call back to dan for a general business update.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, lynn. before going through the financials, i would like to provide a brief update on how the business did from an operation standpoint this quarter and what we see going forward.
overall, we were pleased with the continued year-over-year sales growth during the first quarter, with sales coming in at $125.4 million, up 6 % from the first quarter of 2018. our power solutions and protection group continued their trend of year over year sales growth, with an increase of $5.7 million compared to the first quarter of 2018, driven by continued demand for our power supplies in array of data center applications.
sales of our dc to dc products also showed growth in 2019. this was offset by a decline in demand for our custom module products.
our connectivity solutions group had year-over-year sales growth of $1.4 million. our cinch business increased revenue by $1.3 million compared to the first quarter 2018, led by strong demand for our connector products in commercial aerospace applications, both direct to customers and through aftermarket sales.
our magnetic solutions sales were generally the same as last year for the first quarter. the sales of our signal transformer products were strong during the first quarter of 2019 related to medical and industrial applications. this increase was offset by lower demand during the quarter from macjack products and discrete magnetic components.
following the record bookings in 2018, we did see some slowing in bookings during the first quarter attributed to customers working down on high inventory levels which has been built up in response to new product launches and potential rises in tariffs. these factors led to a backlog of a $166.8 million at march 31st, 2019, a reduction of $4.4 million or a 3% from 2018 year-end.
by product groups, the backlog of orders for our connectivity products grew by $6.4 million from year-end, offset by declines of $5.8 million for our magnetic solutions products and $5 million for our power solutions and protection products.
from a profitability standpoint, we benefited more from a favorable exchange rate environment during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter of 2018 and improved stock market conditions led to a $1.1 million increase in cash surrender value of our coli policies. these factors were offset by the continued challenges with higher labor costs due to minimum wage increases in the people's republic of china and mexico, and a higher material costs as compared to the first quarter of 2018.
the restructuring efforts implemented in late 2018 and early 2019 will help mitigate the rising cost and preserve our margins beginning in the second quarter.
overall, while we expect some downward pressure on second quarter sales compared to last year's second quarter, we are generally optimistic for the future sales growth and improved profitability in the second half of this year. as our customers work through their inventory on hand, we expect there will be an upswing in bookings. there are several positive drivers we look to the second half of the year, particularly related to key military, aerospace platforms, in which we participate in, continued momentum for our power products within the hev market, and we also are investing time and resources on developing and launching products to support the up and coming 5g markets. and believe that we're well-positioned to capture future growth as this new technology emerges.
and with that, i turn the call over to craig to run through the financial update.
craig brosious -- vice president, finance
thank you, dan. to provide a quick recap on sales, sales during the first quarter were $125.4 million. north america sales were $64.6 million, up 8.6% from last year's first quarter. european sales were $23.5 million, up 16.6% and asian sales were $37.3 million, down 3.5%.
by product group, power solutions and protection sales were $42.8 million, up 15.3% from last year's first quarter. connectivity solutions sales were $44.4 million, up 3.4% and magnetic solutions sales were $38.3 million, essentially the same as last year.
gross profit margin increased to 18.8% in the first quarter of 2019 as compared with 17.9% in the first quarter of 2018, as incremental sales in 2019 led to improved fixed cost absorption, partially offset by higher labor and material costs during 2019.
our selling, general and administrative expenses were $19.8 million or 15.8% of sales as compared with $20.7 million or 17.5% of sales in the first quarter of 2018. the decrease in sg&a expenses during the 2019 period, primarily related to a $659,000 increase in cash surrender value of our company-owned life insurance policies, as a result of the stock market rebounding during the first quarter of 2019.
in addition, foreign exchange losses were $428,000 lower in 2019 versus 2018 first quarter. these factors were offset by an increase in erp implementation costs of $661,000 during the first quarter of 2019, as the first phase of our implementation went live in january.
on a go forward basis, we would expect sg&a to run between $20 million and $21 million per quarter in the near-term, barring any significant fluctuations in foreign currencies. as a result of these factors, we generated income from operations of $2.8 million in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to $437,000 in the first quarter of 2018.
interest expense was $1.4 million in the first quarter 2019, up $263,000 from the same period last year, due to the higher interest rate in effect during the 2019 period.
our provision for income taxes was $39,000 for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $325,000 during last year's first quarter. the provision for income taxes during the first quarter of 2019 benefited from a decrease in taxes related to uncertain tax positions and the impact from permanent tax differences on us tax exempt activities.
earnings per share for the class a common shares was $0.08 per share in the first quarter of 2019 as compared with a loss of $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2018. earnings per share for the class b common shares was $0.09 per share in the first quarter of 2019 as compared with a loss of $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2018.
on a non-gaap basis, which excludes certain unusual and other non-recurring items, eps for class a shares was $0.20 per share in the first quarter of 2019 as compared with the loss of $0.09 per share in the first quarter of 2018. on a non-gaap basis, eps for class b shares was $0.22 per share in the first quarter of 2019, as compared with a loss of $0.09 per share in the first quarter of 2018.
and now, i'd like to go through some balance sheet and cash flow items. our cash and cash equivalents balance at march 31st, 2019 was $43.2 million, a decrease of $10.7 million from december 31st, 2018. during the first quarter of 2019, we made net payments of $744,000 toward our outstanding debt balance. we also use cash for capital expenditures of $2.4 million, dividend payments of $800,000 and interest payments of $1.2 million.
accounts receivable were $94.2 million at march 31st 2019 as compared with $91.9 million at december 31st, 2018. days sales outstanding were 68 days at march 31st 2019 compared to 59 days at december 31st 2018.
the increase in accounts receivable balance was largely due to the higher sales volume in the month of march 2019 as compared to the month of december in 2018. our dso during the first quarter was unfavorably impacted by the pause in shipping product to our customers consignment hubs, while we've worked down their inventory levels.
inventories were at $124.8 million at march 31st 2019, up $4.7 million from december 31st 2018. the increase was primarily in work-in-process (ph) and finished goods, due to the slow down of incoming orders and the shipments to the consignment hubs during the quarter.
accounts payable were $48.1 million at march 31st 2019, down $8 million from its level at december 31st 2018, primarily due to lower raw material purchases during the quarter.
bel's outstanding debt was reduced by $744,000 during the first quarter, bringing the balance down to $115.2 million as of march 31st, 2019, excluding deferred financing costs.
you'll see that our balance sheet has a few new line items this quarter related to the adoption of the new lease standard, which requires us to record a right-of-use asset and associated lease liability in connection with assets utilized under an operating lease, which were previously off balance sheet items.
on the january 1st 2019 adoption date, we recorded right-of-use assets in the amount of $20.7 million and an associated lease liability in the amount of $21 million. book value per share, which is calculated as stockholders' equity divided by our combined a and b classes of common stock outstanding was $14.53 cents per share at march 31st, 2019 as compared to $14.39 cents per share at december 31st, 2018.
and now, i'd like to turn the call back to dan and open the call for questions. dan?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. hi, mary. can we open up the call for questions?

operator
thank you, mr. bernstein. [operator instructions] and we'll take our first question today from jim ricchiuti with needham & company.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
hi, good morning. i'm wondering if you could speak a little bit more about rms connectors and eos acquisition. share with us, perhaps if you could, just any details on their financial contribution, or just the impact that you would anticipate in 2021? thanks a lot.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
okay. before i have craig go over the numbers review -- but just to give you an insight to both those companies. eos, again, we've been private labeling their product for over three years. we have a very strong relationship with them. we know the people. it was a market, perhaps, in a low, medium market, mostly in the medical area and industrial area, which we felt we could grow with the proper pricing structure and product portfolio. so, we've been pestering them for many years if they were interested in selling. so, we're very excited that -- again, that we could put this deal together and close on march 31st. so, that deal, as i said -- and the key for us also is that we are overly dependent with manufacturing in china, which gives us another area that we can have low-cost manufacturing. and in addition to that, we do believe india market should be a substantially stronger market for bel as we move forward.
the other acquisition, rms, when cinch was the boeing supplier for the 737 connectors, boeing suggested very strongly that they approve a second source and that company was rms. and over the past 10 years, we've contacted them every year to see if they were interesting in selling, because of price pressures that we're feeling on the aerospace companies out there. because their medical sales were growing so fast, this wasn't a strategic product line for them any longer. so, they allowed us to buy and we came up, i thought, with a very strong deal, almost close to book value. and their book value is a lot of automated high-end equipment that we didn't have with us. so, beside eliminating a good competitor, we were able to pick up some state-of-the-art equipment. so, we think that also is going to be a home run acquisition. and we do think it's going to become profitable once we move it into our facility, which would take three or four months. and once boeing kicks -- boeing starts ordering again, we think it would be one of our most successful acquisitions.
craig, can you go over more of the financial, how we see both companies in terms of the bottom-line?
craig brosious -- vice president, finance
yeah. starting with rms, obviously, they play in that commercial aerospace segment. so, their revenues have been depressed over the last 12 months, the pause in the manufacturing and also the aftermarket impacts. so, for the coming 12 months, we're kind of expecting an incremental revenue, maybe $5 million to $8 million related to that. once we get back to a normal run rate, obviously, that revenue would be -- certainly pick up. and because we were moving the entire production facility into one of our existing facilities, there is no incremental g&a and we will be able to leverage our internal overhead structure. and so we expect that this could be fairly profitable.
on the eos acquisition, they have been, obviously, impacted by covid like the rest of the industry. they had been running at approximately $12 million revenue run rate over the past seven, eight months now. so, once they come on board, we expect the incremental revenue, assuming a march close, would be approximately $8 million to $9 million for 2021. margins there are similar to our rather power margins. so, we except that -- we expect that business to be accretive right out of the gate.
hope that answers your question, jim?
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
it does. [speech overlap] clarification, craig, the margin will be more of the back power and not like cui?
craig brosious -- vice president, finance
yeah, that's correct. the traditional power origin.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
thanks for that. thanks for the color. dan, they sound like nice acquisitions. so, congrats. i wonder if you could also, to the extent, you can elaborate a little bit more on the impact of some of the component supply chain issues on the business? are you seeing any impact, or is this just a case of monitoring the situation in terms of whether it gets worse?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i think, again, we're very fortunate because we do have long-term relationship with our semiconductor companies we deal with and the components that we deal with. so, again, they came to us [indecipherable] listen, hey, if you want -- if you want support this year, you have to sign up for a yearly non-cancelable order, and then you had to lock in the deliveries. also, i think, we did a good job in staying ahead of the situation because of our relationships we had in this industry, so we tend to know about shortage before it go down. so, again, one of the major problems that we don't have, we won't have any pricing pressure during this period and we have seen some pricing increases during the shortage period. but i don't think it will affect our delivery, but it might impact the price going forward and we have to increase pricing on to our consumers.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. and just last question from me. just, in general, the level of activity you're seeing across your markets, it sounds like with the exception, obviously, the commercial aerospace and potentially a couple of situations with one of the larger oems, is it fair to say that the level of business activity you're seeing is picking up?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
well, comparing to last year when we were in the middle of covid and you had chinese shut down, i think, going over that bar, it's not too high.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
yeah. i'm thinking more in terms of as you're entering the year versus q4? obviously, year-over-year comparison are skewed.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i wish i could. i still think we just had such limited visibility. i think there's still so much uncertainty out there with covid, how the new government is going to affect policy, and i still think there's still a little bit -- a lot more positive than last year, overall. however, i still think there is still a substantial amount of uncertainty, where people, again, that infamous term 'cautiously optimistic', but i don't see anybody opening up the champagne, how about that.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
that's fair enough. thank you. thank you for that. i'll jump back in the queue, if want.
operator
next, we'll hear from theodore o'neill with litchfield hills research.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
thanks very much. two questions for you. first on the margins, which continue to show improvement, last quarter, there was a $900,000 chinese subsidy in there, were there any one-time items like that in this quarter?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
craig or lynn, can you address it?
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting
so -- hi, theo. this is lynn. we did have a similar amount in q4 this year related to those subsidies that was $835,000 in the fourth quarter.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
and again, this is -- this may or may not continue into the next year?
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting
we don't believe [phonetic] that it will continue.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
okay. my other question is about the eos acquisition. so, just from a branding perspective, will you continue to private label and sell under the eos brand, or will you move that to the bel label brand?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
that is one of the big questions we're debating constantly. i'll show you how crazier the situation we have. we private label eos under the bel brand. the company we acquired last year, cui, private labels under -- eos product under their brand, and then eos uses their brands. so, we have a couple of distributors that sell three of the same products with three different names, all go by eos. so, the margin, it's -- the number one thing our marketing group is working on is how do we brand -- how we brand eos, but how we brand bel with so many different companies that we acquired over the past couple of years.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
okay. thanks very much.
operator
we'll now hear from hendi susanto with gabelli.
hendi susanto -- gabelli -- analyst
good morning, dan, farouq, craig and lynn.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
craig brosious -- vice president, finance
good morning.
hendi susanto -- gabelli -- analyst
dan, can you just talk about your m&a pipeline now that you have farouq in your team?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i'll let farouq speak about our m&a pipeline. farouq?
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, dan. great to be with you here today. so, coming from the industry, there is a good amount of activity that we expect to occur a little bit and more frequently in 2021, especially as the world set to recover up from covid. so, our expectation is we will see more and expect to have a robust pipeline. and then, obviously, we, with the team at bel here, and now, in addition to myself, will be trying to cultivate our own proprietary side of the house, not to be similar to [indecipherable]. so, i would say, it's in -- it's definitely out there, and that we just need to figure out where we want to be spending time and going after it.
hendi susanto -- gabelli -- analyst
thank you.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
and i think with the value also, farouq, besides knowing so many of our competitors or companies in the industrial market which we will participate in, i think how we deal with the banks going forward, where historically -- now because we have involved nobody in the past, and the financing terms and so forth, i think that's key for us. it's great that we want to buy a company, but the question is can we get the proper financing from our lenders? and i think with farouq on board i think that's going to be a major benefit that he brings to the party besides his acquisition knowledge.
hendi susanto -- gabelli -- analyst
got it. i would like to repeat that long lead times, there has been talk -- i don't know whether you had talked about this or not. there has been talk about inventories in the channel and inventory at oems are lower than optimal, and therefore, they would take more and then build their inventories. do you see the same trends among your customers, or that doesn't apply in your area?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i think, again, i think the initial concern you have, we have long lead times. if someone has to wait nine months for a semiconductor, i think, [indecipherable] two months, are they going to push back your deliveries for the last item. generally, we will never see that. what we see generally when there are long lead times, we always feel it's beneficial to the business, because most of our customers are more concerned about delivery than they are about pricing. and at some point, they willing to pay a premium for pricing. so, we think, even though we do think it's a beneficial, again, for all of us when we have long lead times and how we prepare ourselves properly for. and i think [indecipherable] flood line is open with product and because of the long-term relationships we have with our suppliers. again, i feel with these lead times, we are somewhat confident that we can manage it properly. and if we do face increased pricing, then we can offset it with our pricing to our customers.
hendi susanto -- gabelli -- analyst
got it. and then, within eos and rms connectors, what should be our expectation for operating expense?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
craig?
craig brosious -- vice president, finance
hendi, you're asking the expectation for opex?
hendi susanto -- gabelli -- analyst
opex and sg&a.
craig brosious -- vice president, finance
yeah. for rms, there should be very little incremental opex, because they basically bringing a manufacturing facility into our own, and we are not bringing any incremental sg&a, it's a lot of that. on the eos piece, the opex would be probably traditional about 13% to 15% of revenue. maybe some synergy there, we're not anticipating a significant amount.
hendi susanto -- gabelli -- analyst
and then, craig, can you share what kind of absolute dollars of sg&a we should expect?
craig brosious -- vice president, finance
let's see, that would be revenue on an annualized basis of, say, $12million to $15 million. so, i'd say 14%, 15% of that.
hendi susanto -- gabelli -- analyst
okay. and then i think for -- starting from q1, you would see some benefit in r&d and then some closures also?
craig brosious -- vice president, finance
well, on the comparative basis, we should see positive comparison for r&d.
hendi susanto -- gabelli -- analyst
okay. thank you, craig.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting
[speech overlap] were you asking about the consolidated business?
hendi susanto -- gabelli -- analyst
yeah. the consolidated business, yeah. i think months ago, i think, that we've fashioned that sg&a as between like $19 million to $20 million.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting
great. so, for the consolidated business, we will see incremental cost savings in q1 of about $1.3 million. the majority of that will be in r&d, about $750,000 related to the switzerland closure. and then the rest will be split between sg&a and closure.
hendi susanto -- gabelli -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you, lynn. thank you.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, hendi.
operator
we'll now hear from steve kohl with mangrove.
steven kohl -- mangrove capital -- analyst
yes. good morning, guys. thanks for having the call. i have a few quick questions. first off on magnetics. i know you mentioned one of the large oems was kind of sitting tight, now are starting to come back. can you give a little bit more color on what else is happening there that gives a comfort that the order patterns are coming back and you're seeing more strength outside of that oem?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
based on -- we're using our backlog to make that judgment call, and the backlog has increased nicely in the fourth quarter in the magnetic side of the business.
steven kohl -- mangrove capital -- analyst
okay. and turning down to the rms business, i know you talked about the five-day bump in incremental revenues. if we kind of go back and look at what a more normalized world will look like in commercial aerospace side, what is the expectation on where rms connectors be if you look a longer view? so, if we don't look at this year, but we look [speech overlap]
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
so, again, i think the key is where boeing planes are going to be. before covid and before the 737 problems, they were looking at 49 to 51 planes a month. and that's and i think we have 5,000 connector per plane. so, there is a substantial valid in rms versus second source at boeing and to the suppliers. so again, -- and now i think, craig, will say -- hoping to get to '21 soon. craig?
craig brosious -- vice president, finance
right. yeah, the activity -- it's going -- is expected to be a slower ramp up in their build schedules. so it's going to take a couple of years until they get back up to that run rate that we were anticipating earlier.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
so again, if you look at, i think the point to us is, we could have waited if boeing was back to normal, saying 42, 43 planes, we believe the buy rms would probably be maybe two to three times what we paid for it today. so, we feel very fortunate. we did take a big risk. if the 737 doesn't come back, this is not the best acquisition we have had. but even the fact that we picked up state-of-the-art of equipment that we needed anyway in offsetting, we were really pleased again with the acquisition besides boeing and the aftermarket and how it strengthens our relationship with some of our key aerospace distributors. so, for us, it's just with -- again, it took me eight years, i think, nine years from sending christmas cards to the president of the company before he finally responded, and i thought he's going to thank me for our christmas card. it's obviously -- funny, right. again, it's probably the best investment we thought we've ever made with $20 christmas card.
craig brosious -- vice president, finance
that's pretty good deal. and it's probably $20 for whole package. so not as an individual one. [speech overlap]
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
well, maybe, it's also exciting. we were able to complete this deal in a roughly two-months period, less than eight weeks, right. working closely with them and i think that's a good sign. when we do deal with a lot of acquisitions, which we will going forward, we can -- i don't think there's many companies out there that can close a deal in that shorter timeframe. and so that our philosophy, as you say, that we've done a lot of divestitures with billion-dollar companies. and i think if you look at it [indecipherable] some of the other companies we deal with, i think they decided to go with bel fuse, not because we pay the highest dollar, it's because of user transaction and how we treat the customers and associates. so i think we have a team of expertise, some of our competitors, we have a really good track record. we can do a deal, we're going to do a fair deal and will be quick do, so that that's going to help to look a lot in his pursuit.
steven kohl -- mangrove capital -- analyst
[speech overlap] okay. go ahead, i'm sorry. i'm sorry, lynn.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting
i just wanted to quickly add that if you looked at a couple of years, pre-covid, pre-grounding, the rms business was running around $15 million to $16 million a year in revenue, and that compares to where they were in 2020, which was around $8 million. so just to give you some perspective of where they were in 2020.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
and lynn, do you have their profitability?
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting
yes. so before all of this and in normal conditions, their ebitda margin was around 20%. where it's right now, they've been running around 5%. there's definitely room for improvement as conditions improve.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i repeat, on the bel without their overhead and without their building and so forth, we should be able to substantially improve those margins.
steven kohl -- mangrove capital -- analyst
all right. and this is going to seem like an off-the-wall question. i'm sure you've hear this one too. but the world -- you talked about obviously t&e has gone for everybody now. but how do you -- when we look longer-term -- in terms of how you're doing business, will you expect a structural change in t&e and things like this going forward, or how -- in terms of how you conducting your business, or how do you view that...
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i think we're going through a revolution. and maybe i'm wrong, but i think the revolution would have taken maybe four or five years. but i think the revolution is going to take in few months or sooner. i mean, the role of salespeople, when people working from home, how can you call on the customer, that's 50% of the people working from home going forward, and how do you connect with these people. and that's why we made a major effort over the last three or four months to consolidate our sales force. historically, we had no sales person for each company. so, we had a sales person a cui and sales person for bel power solution, a sales person for signal transformer, possibly all point on the same customer.
we consolidate that -- we're consolidating that into four people that cover the country. in addition to that, we are pushing our digital sales group substantially that add people on. so how do we connect to engineer, through linkedin, through youtube, through twitter. again, if you're dealing with young people, as you know, i don't think they like to use phone calls and i don't think they like to talk to people, they want the information quickly, they want it fast, and they don't want bs. and so we clearly understand that and hopefully they're moving quick enough to address the new engineers. and for us, that's the key. i mean we -- for us to be successful, we have to be able to work with engineers before designing the product. if we coming as a second supplier or a third supplier, it makes it extremely difficult. but we come when the engineer is designing the product, we can help them, we can guide them and assist them to use our product in the proper way, and then hopefully eliminate some of our competitors. so, it's definitely an exciting time we're within and i definitely believe things are changing rapidly.
steven kohl -- mangrove capital -- analyst
one last question that was kind of your opening about the one that feel into my heart. so you mentioned about pointing out the valuation disparity between the sum of the pieces in the current marketplace. i guess, obviously farouq is coming on and i guess the best thing to do is throw him right into this task of, how do we narrow that. so, obviously you've been successful to varying degrees on acquisitions as you've alluded to and running the company efficiently. but how do we narrow -- i'm still little bit confused on how do we do that? so how do you get a share price on a public [speech overlap]
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
farouq, you want to earn your salary right now and explain on how you going to do it? [speech overlap]
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
got to start somewhere. i'm basically here. so i was on other side of the table looking at bel, and kind of seeing kind of the same information that you're looking at, i would say you develop certain expectations and perspective on the business and being slightly under the covers here. on the other side, i would echo dan's sentiment, now that we're peeling back the onion. i'd also say though when -- that i was sitting at another side of table, on the far side, bel represents a unique opportunity from a size, reach and global positioning quite frankly, with varying degrees, whether it be on the connectivity side or the power side and the magnetic side.
so when i see -- when i'm looking at i feel great base for us to build upon and drive growth faster, both, i would emphasize, inorganically and organically. so one of the benefits from my perspective is bring a fresh set of eyes and asking questions for us to look at how bel is conducting business today and where should we be and what do we want to do down the road.
so to your question, how we'll have bridge the gap? i think there is a consistency in kind of performance and the way we do business that we need to address. so we cannot have a feeling, again, sitting in your shoes, talking to investors, and i would say that dan had alluded to it earlier, whether it be on the margin side, the way we just do business is simplifying and position ourselves for longer-term sustainable growth. so, it is a tough question, but i think we know the answers and we need to just figure out how to get there.
steven kohl -- mangrove capital -- analyst
sounds good. thank you very much. not a bad answer for day three.
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
i'll take it.
steven kohl -- mangrove capital -- analyst
okay. thanks.
operator
we have a follow-up from jim ricchiuti with needham & company.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
hi, thanks. just looking at the commercial aircraft market, the comparisons actually get much, much easier for you when q3, was that when the business really started to come down sharply?
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting
so, on the commercial aerospace, i guess, it was actually end of the second quarter of 2020 is when we saw the largest drop off. so, there will be some incremental pressure on q1 sales related to that, but then we should be in a more normalized position come q2.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. thank you. and i'm just looking at comment in your press release. i just want to make sure i'm not misinterpreting it. you talked about an additional $4.4 million of cost savings in 2021. and i just want to make sure i'm not confusing that with some of the other saving you've highlighted this morning.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting
right. so, the $4.4 million that will be incremental in 2021, that is looking at full year 2020 cost versus 2021. so like of that, $2 million relates to the switzerland facility closure. we have about $1 million of that cost savings realized in 2020 at the tail end of the year here, and the other $2 million will be realized in 2021. other actions that we have done throughout the year, the germany sales office closing, our north america sales reorganization. and we had a couple of other actions that were implemented in q4, with moving some functions in asia that will result in another $1 million of savings in 2021. so that $4.4 million is incremental. and i do have the detail of it by quarter if that would be helpful?
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
sure. thank you.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting
okay. so again, these are year-over-year incremental savings. so, in q1, it's $1.3 million versus if you're looking at q1 '20. on q2, it's almost $1.4 million. in q3, it's $1.1 million. and in q4, it's about $600,000.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
and jim, just to add some more color on that. we still believe that we still got ways to go before we start our cost savings program with a few things with the implementation of our new software. and now instead of having many different roi systems, we got it down to two, one for cinch group and one for the bel group. so we can look at consolidating many functions because we're all on one system now. also our manufacturing footprint in china, we have three operations in china that we have to look at consolidating down to either one or maybe two. so we still think there is good opportunity to improve our savings over the next year or two years. so, we still got ways to go and we're still focused on.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
perfect. thanks very much. thank you.

operator
good day, and welcome to the bel fuse inc. fourth quarter 2020 results conference call. today's conference is being recorded.
at this time, i'd like to turn the conference over to dan bernstein, president and chief executive officer. please go ahead.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, james. i would like to welcome everybody to our fourth quarter and year end financial results today.
before i begin, we hope you and your family stay safe during these difficult times. on the call today is craig brosious, our vice president of finance; lynn hutkin, our director of financial reporting; and i would like to introduce our new chief financial officer, farouq tuweiq, who came onboard this week.
while working with bmw -- i'm sorry, working with bank of montreal in the past, we have developed a strong relationship with farouq. during this time, we've been overly impressed with his knowledge of our industry, work experience, interpersonal skills and most importantly his ability to solve problems in a timely manner. his number one goal at bel, simply put, will be to increase bel's overall value to our shareholders. the board believes there is a substantial valuation gap between bel's share price and our current breakup value. farouq has a broad mandate to work team members to examine the various pathways to increase top-line growth, margin improvement, simplify our operations while driving growth through m&a. when searching for our first cfo in the company's history, he was the best candidate, and we feel fortunate that he joined bel to offer us his fresh perspective. welcome aboard farouq.
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
thank you, dan, for the introduction there. i'm very excited to be joining the bel family and team.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
okay. lynn, can you please go over the safe harbor statement?
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting
all right. thank you, dan. good morning, everybody.
before we start, i'd like to read the following safe harbor statement. except for historical information contained on this call, the matters discussed on this call, such as statements regarding the potential rebound of sales in magnetic solution business and overall products sale, anticipated impact of global cost reduction program on bel's positioning for further margin expansion, anticipated cost savings resulting from the closing on the sale of the switzerland facility and other restructuring actions, potential benefits of bel's margins resulting from recovery of demand in bel's end markets, the anticipated impact of the rms connectors acquisition included on bel's ebitda, the anticipated impact of the eos power acquisition including the timing and closing thereof, factors that may -- and factors that may impact bel's organic growth for 2021 including continuing visibility -- limited visibility as a result of covid and long lead times for semiconductors and certain components are all forward-looking statements as described under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially from bel's projections.
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements are: the market concern facing our customers; the continuing viability of sectors that rely on our products; the impact of public health crises, such as the governmental, social and economic effects of covid-19; the effects of business and economic conditions; difficulties associated with integrating recently acquired companies; capacity and supply constraints or difficulties; product development, commercialization or technological difficulties; the regulatory and trade environment; risks associated with foreign currency; uncertainties associated with legal proceedings; the market's acceptance of the company's new products and competitive responses to those new products; the impact of changes to u.s. trade and tariff policy; and the risk factors detailed from time-to-time in the company's sec reports.
in light of the risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that any forward-looking statement will in fact prove to be correct. we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. we may also discuss non-gaap results during this call, and reconciliations of our gaap results to non-gaap results have been included in our release.
i would now like to turn the call back to dan for a general business update.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, lynn. first, i'd like to provide an update on covid-19 and how it impacted our facilities. overall, i'm pleased to report that all our manufacturing sites globally continued to be operational for the majority of the fourth quarter. there were two facilities that needed to be closed for about a week during the quarter in response to the infection, but we were still able to service our customers during this time.
while the number of covid-19 cases appeared to be moving in the right direction and vaccine distribution is now under way, the situation still remains fluid. we continue to operate our facilities with all preventive measures in place and ensuring ongoing compliance with local regulations to migrate our risk. i would again like to acknowledge our production managers and manufacturing associates who work day-to-day under difficult conditions. the continued -- their continued dedication to bel and our customers is truly appreciated.
now, turning to our results. we saw improve in margins on relatively flat sales as compared to last year's fourth quarter. while there was a minimal change in overall sales balance, the composition of our sales has changed quite a bit since last year's fourth quarter.
sales within our power solutions and protection group were up $16.2 million, or 44.8%, from the fourth quarter of 2019. our acquisition of cui in december 2019 contributed $11 million incremental sales for the fourth quarter of 2020 and this business run at a higher margin. other areas within our power segment that was strong as well. our products sold in the fast growing e-mobility market were up $2.5 million, a 200% increase from 2019 quarter and cui sales were up $1.3 million, an increase of over 40% from last year's fourth quarter. these areas of growth were offset by the elimination of low-margin products within this group.
within our connectivity solutions segment, sales were down $6.8 million, or 16.6%, in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus the same quarter of 2019. we continue to be impacted by the depressed commercial aerospace industry, where sales were down $7 million, or 80%, from last year's fourth quarter. the connectivity segment was also impacted by the lower sales of product in the premise wiring applications as new construction projects stalled in 2020 due to covid also. we were able to shift our production lines to support our growing military backlog, which enabled us to capture 60% increase in military sales, partially offsetting the commercial decline.
sales within our magnetic solution business was down $3.4 million, or 22.1%, from the fourth quarter of 2019, as one of our largest oem end customers had paused ordering as they work through their inventory on hand. on a positive note, magnetic bookings have since rebound and which will see the sales pick back up in the first quarter of 2021.
overall, margins have improved by 420 basis points and are trending in the right direction. this can be attributed to a combination of product mix, i discussed previously, and our ongoing cost reduction program.
on the acquisition front, we have been busy over these last few months as we recently announced our purchase of two companies, rms connectors and eos. bel closed the acquisition of rms connectors in january, which will enable us to expand our market share in the commercial aerospace business. they will benefit us when the industry start to be dominated in 2021. we also signed an agreement to acquire eos power, which is based in india. the acquisition of eos will not only expand our product portfolio in the low to mid range, but will also importantly provide us a manufacturing capability of outside china. both these acquisitions fit within our strategy to increase market share while diversifying our product portfolios and geographic footprint.
looking to 2021, we have seen some recovery in certain of our served markets. we would expect demand from military customers in e-mobility to remain the driver for sales throughout 2021. we additionally see signs of certain additional markets such as premise wiring, rail, commercial aerospace have potential to recover throughout the year as covid conditions improve. while our competitive position remains strong as ever, the covid situation is still with us and uncertainty regarding some semiconductor components that might be in short supply, gives us limited visibility into the future. in the meantime, the management team will remain focus on bottom-line growth while integrating the announced acquisitions and actively looking other strategies -- avenues to better position bel for the future.
and with that, i'd like to turn the call over to craig for the financial update. craig?
craig brosious -- vice president, finance
thank you, dan.
sales by product segment for the fourth quarter of 2020 were as follows: power solutions and protection sales were $52.3 million, up 44.8% from last year's fourth quarter; connectivity solutions sales were $34.2 million, a decline of 16.6%; and magnetic solution sales were $29.6 million, down 22.1% from last year's fourth quarter.
gross margin by product segment for the fourth quarter of 2020 were as follows: power solutions and protection had a gross margin of 27.8% in the fourth quarter of 2020, up from 19.7% in last year's fourth quarter; connectivity solutions gross margin was 24%, down from 24.5% in the 2019 quarter; and magnetic solutions gross margin was 23.3%, up from 19.1% in last year's fourth quarter. on a consolidated basis, gross profit margin increased to 25.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared with 21.1% in the fourth quarter of 2019, the result of a combination of factors.
overhead and indirect labor costs were $1 million lower during the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to restructuring measures implemented during late 2019 and a reduction in the cost structure for cinch connectivity solutions segment to align with current sale and volume within that segment. a portion of the margin improving in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to the elimination of certain low-margin power products from our portfolio.
research and development costs were $5.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2020, a decline of $1 million from the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to restructuring efforts implemented during the latter part of 2019.
our selling, general and administrative expenses were $19.6 million, or 16.8% of sales, flat from the fourth quarter of 2019. lower travel expenses of $713,000 and savings from other cost containment efforts fully offset the $1.1 million of incremental sg&a expenses associated with the cui business acquired in december of 2019. on a go-forward basis, we would expect sg&a to run between $19 million and $20 million per quarter in the near-term as we expect our t&e spend will continue to be lower than normal for at least the first half of 2021.
during the fourth quarter of 2020, we closed on the sale of our facility in switzerland. this transaction resulted in a gain of $1.9 million, which is included in our fourth quarter results.
these factors resulted in income from operations of $5.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared to a loss from operations of $2.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.
other expense net was $395,000 for the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared to $1.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2019. an increase in foreign exchange losses of $700,000 in the fourth quarter of 2020 was offset by a larger gain on the company's serp investments, which are now included in this line item. the expense in the fourth quarter of 2019 largely related to a $2.1 million loss on the liquidation of foreign subsidiaries.
the interest expense was $900,000 in the fourth quarter of 2020, down from $1.3 million in the same quarter last year as a result of decreases in the libor rate, the company's spread on its credit facility driven by ebitda improvements, and the overall reduction in our outstanding debt balance.
we had a provision for income taxes of $774,000 in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to a provision of $392,000 during last year's fourth quarter.
earnings per share for the class a common shares was earnings of $0.27 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared with a loss of $0.50 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. earnings per share for the class b common shares was earnings of $0.29 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared with the loss of $0.52 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019.
on a non-gaap basis, which excludes certain unusual and other non-recurring items, eps for class a shares was earnings of $0.18 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared with a loss of $0.30 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. on a non-gaap basis, eps for class b shares was $0.20 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared with a loss of $0.30 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019.
and now, i'd like to go through some balance sheet and cash flow items.
our cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31, 2020, was $84.9 million, an increase of $12.7 million from december 31, 2019.
during 2020, we generated cash flows from operating expense -- activities of $46.1 million and received $4 million in proceeds from the sale of property. we made net payments of $28.2 million toward our outstanding debt balance and used cash for capital expenditures of $5.5 million, dividend payments of $3.4 million and interest payments of $4.1 million.
accounts receivable were $71.4 million at december 31, 2020, as compared with $76.1 million at december 31, 2019. days sales outstanding decreased to 57 days at december 31, 2020, as compared to 60 days at december 31, 2019. the decrease in accounts receivable balance was largely due to lower sales in asia where payment terms tend to be the longest.
inventories were $100.1 million at december 31, 2020, down $7.1 million from december 31, 2019. the decline we see in raw material is due to reduced material intake in anticipation of slower fourth quarter.
accounts payable were $39.8 million at december 31, 2020, down $4.4 million from its level at december 31, 2019, primarily due to lower purchases of raw materials during the fourth quarter of 2020.
bel's total outstanding debt balance was $115.6 million as of december 31, 2020, net of deferred financing costs, a decrease of $28.1 million since the 2019 year end balance. this primarily reflects voluntary debt repayments of $28 million made during 2020.
book value per share, which is calculated as stockholders' equity divided by our combined a and b classes of common stock outstanding, was $15.04 per share at december 31, 2020, as compared to $13.69 per share at december 31, 2019.
and with that, i'll turn the call back over to dan. dan?

thank you. my first question is about the e-mobility market, which is getting an awful lot of discussion this quarter. could you give us an idea about, is it scooters, is it bikes, both? do you see any regional differences in the market? and how big do you think the opportunity could be?

i think at this time, it's too early to measure the opportunity. what our niche is we're not really focused on the automobile market at all. we do do some good business from a circuit protection business, but the growth that we got from e-mobility, we're focusing on now is the business that we do from our power group. and what we're looking at are niche markets, so basically a post office, school buses, sanitation, mining equipment. so, very specific niche markets where they're moving to electric vehicles. again, we think the opportunity should have substantial growth, at least in the next five to six years. and again, that's what the areas we're focusing on, specifically niche markets, also voting [phonetic] charging markets also.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
okay. it's not scooters and e-bikes?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
no. absolutely not.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
okay. all right.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
but [indecipherable] i can give you a -- we did do a business with a company called streetscooter that was building mailbox deliveries in europe. so, more of a government-specific requirement type of situation, but nothing that's mass market.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
okay. you've mentioned in the prepared remarks that you've seen an uptick in commercial aviation business. how -- i mean, i guess that was probably pretty low, but how much more headroom do you have on the commercial aviation business, if we get back to something looking approaching normal?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i mean, what's normal? again, i think if you look, again, from what we understand that you do see with airbus receiving a big order last week from delta, i believe. so -- and you see -- i can't mention anybody else. so, we do see opportunities. but, again, if you look at -- my hands are kind of tied because of agreements. so, basically, it can't get much lower. so, we do see consistent improvement in aerospace for the next three to four years till we get back to normal from all the research that we read.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
okay. i like that answer.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting
so, if you want, dan, i can certainly comment on the broader commercial aerospace end market that...
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
all right. go ahead. go ahead, lynn.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting
look, if you walk in, in the fourth quarter,-- our total commercial aerospace sales, and this is direct, this is not through distribution, was around $2.1 million. and in the first quarter, we saw that go up to $3.3 million, so definitely some recovery here. but to put it in perspective, last year's first quarter, we were at $5.1 million. so, it's definitely a partial recovery at this point and we anticipate it being a long runway, no pun intended, in getting back to that normal that we had.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
and also, you should know that we are picking up the benefit of our new acquisition, rms which is dedicated to the the aerospace industry also.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
right. okay, thank you very much.
operator
we'll go next to jim ricchiuti with needham & company.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
hi, good morning. i just wanted to pursue the increase in backlog. so, i think you guys reported in your k, you had a backlog at the end of february of around $180 million, so this is a big increase. and i'm just wondering, if you could maybe talk a little bit about which areas, which segments -- i mean, you alluded to the demand, i think, in e-mobility, but i wonder if you could talk a little bit more broadly about where you're seeing the business recover so strongly and how does this compare with some other cycles?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
you know this, every cycle is kind of unique, but this is truly broad-based if we took out commercial aerospace. each one of our product groups are seeing some good substantial increases that is dependent on where the lead times are. currently, our power group has the longest lead times of any products, because they do use semiconductors. so, those lead times that went from 12 to 14 weeks up to 32 weeks, so we've seen that be stretched out. and so that really helped increase the backlog.
our concern at this point is historically is, is there double ordering taking place because of the long lead times and material shortages? and that's what we have to monitor. but it's -- again, it's -- if you look at our customers and the different types of products, they -- our fuse product line is not our biggest product line by far in a way, but it does have the glorious customer base because it goes into so many different markets and that's a great sign, and same with our distribution business that our distributors sell to industrial, commercial, networking, computing, you name it, security, medical. and every one of these markets, we see strength out there. again, our only concern is that double booking occurring because of the long lead time and people can't get parts and possibly our other suppliers.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
yeah, i mean you're anticipating my next question. and how do you monitor, you've improved so many of these periods like this? and is there any better way to monitor it than, say, in the past, when sometimes you guys are caught off guard?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
but historically, you try to say there's non-cancelable orders, say that you need payment upfront, situations like that, that you look at and you try to work through depending on your contract agreements that you have with customers. so again, you just try to hit it, someone has to pay up. if you really want the parts, are you going to pay a premium for delivery and how much do you want to pay upfront to guarantee delivery? so those are the things that you can look at and also non-cancelable orders and that could help also.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
sure. got it. are you guys seeing any signs that the component constraints are potentially a risk factor just for some of your customers because of their own supply chain challenges, which might lead to some disruptions?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
no, we see some slightness of that where we're taking our parts if we're not getting all the parts in the build to finished product. so trying to push us off. but the problem you have with that situation is, because there's such a demand from our other customers, if a customer tries to push back our product that we achieve, we can send it to another customer and they use it. we're not going to accept push outs if we have other customers for those products. so basically, if you're a aggressive customer, you're going to take the parts in and wait the extra four to six weeks till the other parts come in or you might lose all your parts. does that make sense?
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. and i'll jump back in the -- yes, it does. it does. and one more, i'll jump back in the queue. the sg&a was a bit higher than i think you guys were indicating back in the last call, i think you said around $19 million to $20 million. so is this a level that we think you're going to see going forward and probably trends up with the growth in sales that you're expecting?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
craig, can you answer that?
craig brosious -- vice president of finance
yeah, i think you're right, jim. i think it will trend up a little bit just because of maybe the increased activity related to travel and stuff like that in the future quarters. we'll also have some incremental expense coming from eos that basically joined bel right at the end of the quarter. so we'll have a little bit of an uptick there.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
okay. i'll jump back in the queue, got a few others. thanks.
operator
we'll go next to hendi susanto with gabelli funds.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds -- analyst
good morning.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, hendi.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds -- analyst
first question, dan, i saw you talk about price increase that will take place in q2 and q3. would you be able to pass like 100% of the price increase, or is there some like sharing component into your discussion with your customers?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
there's always sharing with our customers. but i think our goal -- and i think it's industry wide, it's not us. so i think we do look at each customer. we do look at what our competitors are doing. but across the board, i think we're trying to implement 5% to 12% price increase depending on where the product sits on the fence. again, it's a new product that's just been introduced. we probably only look for a 5% increase, but a mature product that's been beaten up over many years. we have to increase it probably closer to 8% to 10% to improve the margins. and as you know, we have walked away in the past -- we have walked away in the past year on products that do have low margins where the customers do not accept our price increases.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds -- analyst
and then in terms of gross margin expectation for this year. last year, you did improve gross margin quite significantly. and then with raw material cost increase and price increase, what are the puts and takes on your gross margin for 2021?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
craig, i think that's a good question for farouq. what do you say, craig?
craig brosious -- vice president of finance
yeah, farouq address that one.
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, hendi, this is going to here today. so from a gross margin perspective, obviously, we saw the dip, but as it was alluded to in the open commentary, last year's gross margin was aided by a little bit of kind of one off government subsidies adjustments. so i think when we look it at an organic or adjusted basis, the delta is not as wide. with that being said, i think the overarching theme, that's a number we're laser focused on. and to dan's -- also, the comments that he made, we are seeing some of this -- we're doing price increases, raw material increases. so we are monitoring that situation closely. obviously, we're trying to prevent that from dropping to the gross margin line in addition to our other, call it, organic focus on it.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
does that answer your question, hendi?
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds -- analyst
okay. thank you. and then, dan, last question for -- yes thank you, farouq, dan do you have any insight into it hardware? many companies talk about substantial recovery in the second half of 2021. and then i'm wondering what your takes and insight into data center or it hardware markets?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
again, the hardware, we still haven't seen much -- i mean, that's the only area that we -- our backlog is very strong on those products. but we haven't seen the ciscos, the siemens, some of these companies out there, we really haven't seen much bullish behavior from them. data has been strong for us and i don't think the data farms have cut back at all. so we do have opportunities that we are addressing in certain countries. again, looking at niche markets, not the facebooks, the amazons and microsofts of the world, but the second tier type of customers, where we feel that we can offer a benefit with our technology and our service.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds -- analyst
i see. okay. thank you.

operator
good day and welcome to the bel fuse incorporated first quarter 2021 results conference call. [operator instructions]
at this time, i'd like to turn the conference over to mr. dan bernstein, president and chief executive officer. please go ahead.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, jennifer. joining me on the call today is farouq tuweiq, our cfo; craig brosious, our vice president of finance; and lynn hutkin, our director of financial reporting.
before we begin the call, i'd like to ask lynn to go over the safe harbor statement. lynn?
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting
thank you, dan. good morning, everybody. before we start, i'd like to read the following safe harbor statement. except for historical information contained on this call, the matters discussed on this call, such as statements regarding the anticipated impact of the acquired eos power business on our results, anticipated higher sales for our magnetic solutions group during the second and third quarters as a result of strong bookings in the first quarter, expectations regarding our scheduled backlog as an indicator of stronger sales in the second and third quarters, expected contributions to net earnings from our rms and eos acquisitions, and cost savings from restructuring efforts, and our efforts to continue to optimize our cost structure are all forward-looking statements as described under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially from bel's projections.
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements are the market concerns facing our customers; the continuing viability of sectors that rely on our products; the impact of public health crises such as the governmental, social and economic effects of covid-19; the effects of business and economic conditions; difficulties associated with integrating recently acquired companies; capacity and supply constraints or difficulties; product development, commercialization or technological difficulties; the regulatory and trade environment; risks associated with foreign currencies; uncertainties associated with legal proceedings; the market's acceptance of the company's new products and competitive responses to those new products; the impact of changes to us trade and tariff policies; and the risk factors detailed from time to time in the company's sec reports.
in light of the risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that any forward-looking statement will in fact prove to be correct. we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. we also may discuss non-gaap results during this call, and reconciliations of our gaap results to non-gaap results have been included in our release.
i would now like to turn the call back to dan for a general business update.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, lynn and thank you everybody for joining us on the call today. i hope that you and your families continue to stay safe during these difficult times. first, i'd like to provide an update on covid-19 and how would it impact our facilities. overall, i'm pleased to report that all manufacturing sites globally continue to be operational throughout the first quarter. our most recent acquisition eos is based in mumbai, india where they're going through a very difficult time. the factory continues to be operational as a manufacturer essential products and protective measures have been put in place to prioritize the safety of our new associates. we would like to thank these new associates for working each day under these difficult conditions. before getting to our results, while bel does not normally comment on market activity, we realized there was a substantial amount of trading in bel's stock on friday and the company does not know the reason for this increased trading activity.
turning to our results, we saw a 6% improvement in sales as compared to last year's first quarter. demand in each of our market was strong with the exception of commercial aerospace. both e-mobility and circuit protection had exceptional quarters and demand from our distribution partners were strong, which is good indicator of general market demand to their broad customer base.
sales within the power solutions and protection group [phonetic] were up $7.5 million or 21% from the first quarter of 2020. cui turned in another strong performance this quarter with $2.1 million increase in sales over last year's first quarter. our products sold into e-mobility applications were up $1.5 million, a 100% increase from 2020 first quarter. and fuse sales were up $1.6 million, an increase of 60% from last year's first quarter. the areas of growth were partially offset by elimination of low margin products within the group.
within our connectivity segment, sales were down $1 million or 3% in the first quarter of 2021 versus the same quarter of 2020. while we continue to be impacted by year-over-year comparison related to the commercial aerospace market, we saw a partial rebound in the end market versus the fourth quarter of 2020. and looking at that trend from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2021, commercial aerospace increased by $1.2 million or 57% and payoffs through distribution by $3 million or 30%.
sales within magnetic solution business were fairly consistent as compared to the first quarter of 2020. we have strong bookings in this segment over the past two quarters and our production team is working through some challenges on material and labor availability in order to accommodate these increases in demand. overall, our margins were down in the first quarter of 2021, primarily [phonetic] driven by the industrywide material shortages resulting in higher material costs. labor costs also continued to rise as labor availability in china has been impacted by the lack of traditional workers migrating during chinese new year holidays as a result of the pandemic this year.
our cost saving initiatives from prior years have mitigated a higher cost to a certain extent and the remaining impact has been -- significantly been addressed through price increases to all our customers. we anticipate price increases the majority of these increases, to go in effect during the second quarter and third quarter of 2021.
on the acquisition front, our first acquisitions of rms -- our first quarter acquisitions of rms and eos have both been run smoothly and integrating has been proceeding planned. it is encouraging to see that rms was accretive to bel's results in the first quarter of 2021 and we anticipate eos to be immediately accretive to our results in the second quarter. our backlog of orders was $234 million as march 31 and we reached $264 million by the end of april, a strong indicator of top line growth for the balance of the year. our ability to fulfill orders on the books will be dependent on the availability of materials and labor. we will keep a close eye on costs and availability of raw materials and direct [phonetic] labor in order to service our customers as timely as possible.
i would like to now turn it over to craig to go over the financial update. craig?
craig brosious -- vice president of finance
thanks, dan. sales by product segment for the first quarter of 2021 were as follows. power solutions and protection sales were $43.6 million, up 20.6% from last year's first quarter. connectivity solutions sales were $38.1 million, a decline of 2.7% and magnetic solutions sales were $28.9 million, largely the same as last year's first quarter. preliminary gross margin by product segment for the first quarter of 2021 was as follows. power solutions and protection had a gross margin of 24.7% in the first quarter of 2021, up slightly from 24.3% in last year's first quarter. connectivity solutions gross margin was 25.7%, down from 28.6% in the 2020 quarter. and magnetic solutions gross margin was 13.7%, down from 21.2% in last year's first quarter.
on a consolidated basis, gross profit margin decreased to 21.9% in the first quarter of 2021 as compared with 24.8% in the first quarter of 2020. gross margin during the first quarter of 2021 was impacted by industrywide increases on raw material pricing and higher labor costs driven by wage increases and an unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuation. bel implemented price increases to its customers and distribution partners to offset these higher input costs with many of those price increases taking effect in the second quarter. the margin comparisons were also affected by $2.2 million in covid-related subsidies received in last year's first quarter that did not repeat.
research and development costs were $5 million during the first quarter of 2021, a decline of $1.1 million from the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to the closure of our switzerland r&d facility in mid-2020. our selling, general and administrative expenses were $21 million or 19% of sales, up slightly from a dollar perspective from the first quarter last year. sg&a salaries and fringe benefits were $1.4 million higher as compared to the first quarter of 2020. these costs were partially offset by a reduction in commissions and other selling costs of $632,000 and lower travel expenses of $416,000.
during the first quarter of 2021, we closed on the sale of a property in hong kong. this transaction resulted in a gain of $6.2 million, which is included in our first quarter results. these factors resulted in income from operations of $4.5 million in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to a loss from operations of $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2020. other income and expense net was an income of $546,000 for the first quarter of 2021 as compared to an expense of $2.1 million during the first quarter of 2020. the expense in the first quarter of 2020, largely related to a $2 million loss on the company's serp investments which are included in this line item.
interest expense was $800,000 in the first quarter of 2021, down from $1.4 million in the same quarter last year. as a result, decreases in both libor, the company's spread on its credit facility driven by ebitda improvements and the overall reduction in our outstanding debt balance. we had a provision for income taxes of $1 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to a benefit of $772,000 during last year's first quarter. the benefit in the first quarter of 2020 reflected a reduction in gilti tax and tax benefits associated with the cares act.
earnings per share for class a common shares was earnings of $0.24 per share in the first quarter of 2021 as compared with a loss of $0.30 per share in the first quarter of 2020. earnings per share for the class b common shares was earnings of $0.26 per share in the first quarter of 2021 as compared with a loss of $0.31 per share in the first quarter of 2020. on a non-gaap basis, which excludes certain unusual and other non-recurring items, eps for class a shares was a loss of $0.23 per share in the first quarter of 2021 as compared with a loss of $0.28 per share in the first quarter of 2020. on a non-gaap basis, eps for class b shares was a loss of $0.23 per share in the first quarter of 2021 as compared with a loss of $0.29 per share in the first quarter of 2020.
now, i'd like to go through some balance sheet and cash flow items. our cash and cash equivalents balance at march 31, 2021 was $74 million, a decrease of $10.9 million from december 31, 2020. during the first quarter of 2021, we've made net payments of $16 million in connection with the acquisitions of rms and eos, $1.5 million toward our outstanding debt balance and used cash for capital additions of $1.2 million, dividend payments of $815,000 and interest payments of $627,000. these items were partially offset by cash flows generated from operating activities of $3 million and $6.7 million in proceeds received from the sale of property.
accounts receivable were $74.1 million at march 31, 2020 as compared with $71.4 million at december 31, 2020. the primary driver of the increase related to the 2021 acquisitions of rms and eos, which added $3.1 million to our receivable balance. days sales outstanding increased to 60 days at march 31, 2021 as compared to 57 days at december 31, 2020. inventories were $106.7 million at march 31, 2021, up $6.6 million from december 31, 2020. the increase was seen in raw materials and work in progress and was largely due to the inclusion of $5.3 million from the 2021 acquired companies.
accounts payable were $42.5 million at march 31, 2021, up $2.7 million from its level at december 31, 2020. the 2021 acquired companies accounted for $2.2 million of this increase from the year-end level. sales outstanding debt balance was $114.3 million as of march 31, 2021, net of deferred financing costs, a decrease of $1.3 million since the 2020 year-end balance. book value per share, which is calculated as stockholders' equity divided by our combined a and b classes of common stock outstanding was $15.09 per share at march 31, 2021 as compared to $15.04 per share at december 31, 2020.
and with that, i'll turn the call back over to dan. dan?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, craig. jennifer, we'd like to open up the call for questions now, if possible.

operator
thank you, mr. bernstein. [operator instructions]
and we'll take our first question today from jim ricchiuti with needham and company.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
hi. good morning. yeah, congratulations on the quarter itself. the demand is clearly strong across the board. i'm just wondering if you could comment a little bit about lead times and how concerned are you? just a general of this some of the, what we're hearing about component availability and the potential for that to be disruptive at all to the business later on, as you look out over the balance of the year?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
as we stated i think we managed the situation very well over this quarter. i think if you look at our materials, i think we have a ballpark figure about $2.5 million. we could have maybe add in greater sales if we received all the materials in. its -- lead times is stretched out, you're looking at some semiconductor companies are going out to 18 months to two years. so, it's very difficult to put a finger on it. but so far i think we've done a good job and i think we can manage it just as we've done in the past. there might be a couple of shortfalls again over sudden -- you're looking at should component shortage and then you have a situation in malaysia, where because of covid the factories are shut down for two weeks. so you are going to have these hiccups and it is a concern, but so far, we've been able to manage that concern pretty well so far.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. in terms of the impact of covid, it sounds like you've managed that fairly well. is there any meaningful costs associated with covid as you've had to secure all of your fiscal means that may be contributing to some additional costs that we don't see necessarily?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i don't think a substantial number. if you look at masks, thermostat, temperature gate, temperature measuring devices, making the place safe by putting plastic walls between spacing, no cafeteria, all those costs i think were taken out. so i think going forward, we do have -- i can't see any anything more than minimum cost going forward.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
okay. your sg&a is running a little higher than we were anticipating. i assume that's just a function also of your volumes, but i don't know if there's any additional color you could provide on that. and then i have one other question, i'll jump back in the queue. thanks.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
okay. all right. i'll let craig -- craig, you want to take the sg&a or you want farouq to do it?
craig brosious -- vice president, finance
yeah, i think i can take that one down. i think -- yeah, we are seeing some incremental sg&a related to the volume, as you said, jim, is also we have some additional expenses as we noted in our remarks here, but i think it's still in line with what our expectations were, maybe a little bit maybe on the high end, but i think we're, it's nothing unusual in there.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. just with respect to some of the pricing actions that you've taken, have you realized the benefits of that more fully or are some of those expected to flow in over the next quarter or so? i don't know if you can give us any kind of sense as to how those...
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i think...
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
actions would be?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think -- and this is just ballpark to give you a rough idea, i think in this quarter we probably, maybe picked up present of the price increases we put out there. and then the balance will be i think divided pretty equally between the third and fourth quarter. but i mean i would, i would think they would all be flushed out by the middle of the fourth quarter.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. okay. i'll jump back in the queue. and craig, i just want to wish you the best.
craig brosious -- vice president, finance
thanks. appreciate it, jim.
operator
next we'll hear from theodore o'neill with litchfield hills research.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
oh. thanks very much. congratulations on the good quarter. question about seasonality. given the strong -- sort of the strong demand here and longer lead times and the two recent acquisitions, do you think q4 seasonality will continue or do you have any thoughts about that one way or the other? if there is a potential change.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i think with covid everything is blown out the window. so again i don't -- generally because of in north america because of the christmas holiday, and thanksgiving you lose anywhere from five days to ten days, where people don't need parts but i think at this situation where the backlog is so strong and people are so desperate to get materials in. i'll be shocked that we will see-- i doubt we see the downward trend we've seen in the past.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
yeah. and it just didn't come up in the last quarter conference call, and i'll ask again here. are you concerned about double bookings and how are you managing that for-- second for that?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, that's a great question. and it's-- we're-- as you know we have-- as you probably know, we have vinnie vellucci, fromer president of arrow, of americas, of arrow, and that's a question we address all the time. at this point, everything we hear, we're getting the impression that there isn't double booking out there, but you just, you don't know. and i would think that you would probably see it more in the semiconductor area that are really stretched out long lead times than our product line. but it is a concern that people bringing in too much inventory, just as mike -- i think just a concern is bringing the double booking is people bringing in inventory too soon. so why bring about part in 20 weeks, if you're not going to get the ic in 45 weeks. and that's a concern that we try to look at, and you can leave -- do you have non-cancellable orders, do you have non-schedule change orders and we looked at that, but we haven't implemented at this time.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
okay. thanks very much.
operator
we'll take our next question from hendi susanto with gabelli funds.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds, llc -- analyst
good morning, dan, farouq and craig. thank you, craig for all the interactions.
craig brosious -- vice president, finance
thanks, hendi. enjoyed it.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds, llc -- analyst
dan, i would like to ask you questions about like sales trend. let's say, in the absence of, let's say like unforeseen covid impact and given the strong bookings, will it be reasonable to expect revenue will gradually improve every quarter throughout the end of the year?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i think, again -- i think for the next quarter, it should improve, and then again based historically, i think the fourth quarter will be substantially better than last year's fourth quarter. but then i don't know if it would be better than the third quarter because historically, the third quarter has always been a strong quarter for bel.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds, llc -- analyst
i see. yeah. and then, would you be able to share what the revenue contribution from rms and eos in q2, and then whether your expected revenue contributions from those two are higher, given like strong performance in q2?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
craig, do you want to take that?
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds, llc -- analyst
like can you tell the contribution for the year.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
okay. craig?
craig brosious -- vice president, finance
lynn, i think is better equipped to address that.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
okay.
craig brosious -- vice president, finance
yes.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
passing to her.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting
oh, sorry. i was on mute there. so, hendi, you're are looking for the quarter?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
yes...
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting
or for the...
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
for this quarter, and then do we have a forecast.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds, llc -- analyst
yeah.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting
okay. so for the second quarter, rms contributed $2.7 million. i'm sorry, we're looking at trade sales. $2.5 million of sales, and eos contributed $3.5 million of sales. and...
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
just to give you a little more color and i would say that's a big -- again they supply the aerospace people. so historically, if you looked over the -- before covid, that's a very weak month for them.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds, llc -- analyst
okay.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting
and then looking at the first half of 2021, rms contributed $4.6 million of sales and eos was the same $3.5 million since they were acquired on march 31st.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds, llc -- analyst
and then how much revenue forecast for 2021? are you expecting higher?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i would say yes. but we don't have a -- i don't think we're ready to share figure with you, though. sorry.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds, llc -- analyst
okay. yeah. no, that's fair. and then this is like a bookkeeping question, the $0.4 million cost saving from the u.k. facility consolidation, will it go toward bottom line or will you reinvest that somewhere else?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i think it's only $400,000, is the cost savings for showing down the maidstone facility.
craig brosious -- vice president, finance
yeah. so we would expect to see that drop to the bottom line, hendi.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds, llc -- analyst
okay. and then any insight into, like, price increases? not the details, i'm already -- whether it's like a single digit, mid-single-digit, high-single digit?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
no, i think on the average, price increases are falling -- some smaller ones, some higher ones, but overall i think it's probably falling into the 5% to 12% range.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds, llc -- analyst
got it. okay. thank you so much.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer

good day, and welcome to the bel fuse inc. second quarter 2021 results conference call.
at this time i'd like to turn the conference over to dan bernstein, president and chief executive officer. please go ahead.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, james. joining me on the call today is farouq tuweiq, our cfo; craig brosious, our vice president of finance, and lynn hutkin, our director of financial reporting. before we begin the call, i'd like to ask lynn to go over the safe harbor statement. lynn?
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting
thank you, dan. good morning, everybody. before we start, i would like to read the following safe harbor statement. except for historical information contained on this call, the matters discussed on this call such as statements regarding anticipated cost savings resulting from the closure of bel's modules design and technical support center in maidstone, u.k., expectations concerning pricing adjustments taking effect and their impact on offsetting labor and material cost increases, the company's plans, intentions, expectations and efforts in connection with profit improvement and maximization, operational efficiencies and the pursuit of certain opportunities and markets, expectations regarding backlog as an indicator of sales, supply constraints and the company's ability to manage them, and anticipated future trends, plans and results for the business, including for the second half of 2021 are all forward-looking statements, as described under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially from bel's projections.
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements are, the market concerns facing our customers, the continuing viability of sectors that rely on our products, the impact of public health crisis such as the governmental, social, and economic effects of covid-19, the effects of business and economic conditions, difficulties associated with integrating recently acquired companies, capacity and supply constraints or difficulties, product development, commercialization or technological difficulties, the regulatory and trade environment, risks associated with foreign currencies, uncertainties associated with legal proceedings, the market's acceptance of the company's new products and competitive responses to those new products, the impact of changes to u.s. trade and tariff policies, and the risk factors detailed from time to time in the company's sec reports.
in light of the risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that any forward-looking statement will in fact prove to be correct. we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. we also may discuss non-gaap results during this call and reconciliations of our gaap results to non-gaap results have been included in our release.
i would now like to turn the call back to dan for a general business update.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, lynn. and thank you for joining us on our call today. first, i'd like to provide an update on covid-19. all our manufacturing sites globally are operational throughout the second quarter. the delta variant is prevalent in regions in which bel operates, particularly in india, u.k. and now the u.s. we continue to stay vigilant and have protective measures in place to safeguard our associates. i would once again like to thank all of our global manufacturing associates for their ongoing dedication to bel under these difficult conditions.
turning to our results. we are pleased with our financial results for this quarter. this is our second consecutive quarter of meaningful year-over-year sales growth, as increased orders over the past six months continued to translate into sales. our bookings during the second quarter reached a new record high and our backlog of orders are managed at $314 million at june 30, 2021, an increase of 75% from a year ago. most importantly, these increases in sales and bookings were seen across all our major product groups, which is an indication of general market strength.
sales within our power solutions and protection group were up 23% from the second quarter of 2020. the increase was largely driven by a 55% growth in our fuse sales, a 53% growth in our products that support growing e-mobility end markets, and a 30% improvement in cui sales compared to last year's second quarter. these increases were offset in part by lower sales of our custom module products as we exit these low-margin products. and in connection with this exit our modular designs center in maidstone, u.k., will be closing during the third quarter with an estimated annual cost savings of $400,000. our power solution and protection group finished the second quarter robust backlog which is up $92 million or 143% from year-end.
sales of our connectivity solutions products increased by 11% from last year's second quarter, with the continued rebound of the commercial aerospace end market, which improved by $2.9 million or 114% from last year's second quarter. sales of our connectivity products through distribution channels were also strong, reflecting a $1.7 million or 12% increase from last year's second quarter. the backlog of orders for our connectivity products grew by $21 million or 45% since since year-end.
on the magnetic solutions group, our sales growth of 8% over the last year of second quarter, led by higher shipments of our integrated connector modules that are used in next generation switching applications. during the first half of 2021 our backlog of all of our magnetic products grew by $45 million or 105% since year-end. our first quarter acquisition of rms and eos are now fully integrated into bel's businesses, and both were immediately accredited to our results, contributing a combined $8.7 million in sales since the respective acquisition dates.
the recent pricing adjustments to our customers focus on margin improvement, coupled with the highest backlog in bel's history, the return of the aerospace demand and our participation in growth markets like atv, iot and 5g, allows us to be strongly optimistic about bel's future.
craig, can you go forward?
craig brosious -- vice president, finance
sure. thanks, dan. moving into the financial update. sales by product segment for the second quarter of 2021 were as follows. power solutions and protection sales were $55.4 million, up 22.9% from last year's second quarter. connectivity solutions sales were $43 million, an increase of 10.6%, and magnetic solutions sales were $40.3 million, up 8.3% from last year's second quarter.
preliminary gross margin by product segment for the second quarter of 2021 was as follows, power solutions and protection had a gross margin of 25.9% in the second quarter of 2021, up from 23.5% in last year's second quarter. connectivity solutions' gross margin was 30.3%, up from 29.6% in the 2020 quarter, and magnetic solutions' gross margin was 23.2%, down from 25.4% in last year's second quarter. on a consolidated basis, gross profit margin decreased to 24.7% in the second quarter of 2021 as compared with 25.8% in the second quarter of 2020.
bel implemented price increases earlier in 2021 to offset rising input costs, with a portion of these price increases taking effect in the second quarter. in addition to industry wide increases on raw material pricing, labor costs are higher due to wage rate increases and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations in the second quarter of 2021, as compared to the same quarter of 2020. the margin comparisons were also affected by $1 million in covid related subsidies received in last year's quarter that did not repeat. excluding the subsidy, gross margins in the second quarter of 2021 would have more -- been more comparable with last year's second quarter.
research and development costs were $5.5 million during the second quarter of 2021, a decline of $650,000 from the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to the closure of our switzerland r&d facility in mid 2020. our selling, general and administrative expenses were $21.8 million or 15.7% of sales, up $2.7 million from a dollar perspective from the second quarter of last year, but the same as a percentage of sales.
g&a salaries and fringe benefits were $1.3 million higher as compared to the second quarter of 2020. legal professional fees were up by $467,000 and we incurred $317,000 in acquisition related costs. these factors resulted in income from operations of $6.6 million in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to $6.1 million in the second quarter of 2020. other income and expense net was income of $130,000 for the second quarter of 2021, as compared to income of $1.2 million during the second quarter of 2020. the income in the second quarter of 2020 largely related to a $1.5 million gain on the company's serp investments, which are included in this line item.
interest expense was $721,000 in the second quarter of 2021, down from $1.3 million in the same quarter last year, as a result of decreases in both libor, the company's spread on its credit facility, driven by ebitda improvements, and the overall reduction in our outstanding debt balance. we had a benefit from income taxes of $1.9 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to a provision of $423,000 during last year's second quarter. the benefit in the second quarter of 2021 primarily resulted from the expiration of statutes of of limitations on certain tax reserve.
earnings per share for the class a common shares was earnings of $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2021, as compared with earnings of $0.43 per share in the second quarter of 2020. earnings per share for the class b common shares was earnings of $0.64 per share in the second quarter of 2021, as compared with earnings of $0.46 per share in the second quarter of 2020. on a non-gaap basis, which excludes certain unusual and other non-recurring items, eps for class a shares was $0.64 per share in the second quarter of 2021, as compared with earnings of $0.43 per share in the second quarter of 2020. on a non-gaap basis, eps for class b shares was earnings of $0.68 per share in the second quarter of 2021, as compared with earnings of $0.46 per share in the second quarter of 2020.
i'd now like to turn the call over to farouq to go through some balance sheet and cash flow items. farouq?
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
yeah. thank you, craig.
beginning with some balance sheet items. our cash and cash equivalents balance as of june 30, 2021 was $66.4 million, a decrease of $18.5 million from december 2021. during the first half of 2021, we made net payments of $14.8 million in connection with the acquisitions of rms and eos, $3.0 million toward our outstanding debt balance, and used cash for capital additions of $2.5 million, dividend payments of $1.6 million and interest payments of $627,000. these items were partially offset by $6.7 million in proceeds received from the sale of property.
accounts receivable were $86.9 million at june 30, 2021, as compared with $71.4 million at december 31, 2020, the primary driver of the increase related to the higher sales volume in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. the 2021 acquisitions of rms and eos also contributed to the increase in ar from year-end, accounting for $4.7 million to our receivables balance at june 30th.
days sales outstanding was 56 days at june 30, 2021 comparable with the dso at december 31, 2020. inventories were $116.2 million at june 30, 2021, up $16 million from december 31, 2020. the increase was seen in raw materials and work in progress, and was largely due to increased raw materials purposes to accommodate our higher backlog of orders, as well as the inclusion of $3 million from 2021 acquired companies.
accounts payable were $53 million at june 30, 2021, up $13.2 million from its level at december 31, 2020. the increase in ap was in line with the heightened purchasing volume of raw material during the first half of the year. in addition, the 2021 acquired companies accounted for $3.2 million of this increase from the year-end level. those total outstanding debt balance was $112.9 million as of june 30, 2021, net of deferred financing costs, a decrease of $2.7 million since the 2020-year end balance.
and with that, i'll turn the call back over to dan. dan?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, farouq.
before i open the call for questions, i'd like to thank -- take a moment to thank craig for his nearly 18 years of service to bel fuse. craig, came to the bel family through our acquisition of stewart connector in 2003. since then he assumed a number of positions within the financial department, to ultimately rising to lead the group in 2017. he is instrumental and helping guide us through some of most transforming years. i also like you now acknowledge his generous efforts in ensuring the transition for farouq is smooth and uneventful. craig will be retiring from the company at the end of september. he will be missed, but we wish him the best in his retirement. thank you, craig.
james, can we open the call for questions now?

operator
thank you, mr. bernstein. [operator instructions]
and we'll take our first question today from jim ricchiuti with needham and company.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
hi. good morning. yeah, congratulations on the quarter itself. the demand is clearly strong across the board. i'm just wondering if you could comment a little bit about lead times and how concerned are you? just a general of this some of the, what we're hearing about component availability and the potential for that to be disruptive at all to the business later on, as you look out over the balance of the year?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
as we stated i think we managed the situation very well over this quarter. i think if you look at our materials, i think we have a ballpark figure about $2.5 million. we could have maybe add in greater sales if we received all the materials in. its -- lead times is stretched out, you're looking at some semiconductor companies are going out to 18 months to two years. so, it's very difficult to put a finger on it. but so far i think we've done a good job and i think we can manage it just as we've done in the past. there might be a couple of shortfalls again over sudden -- you're looking at should component shortage and then you have a situation in malaysia, where because of covid the factories are shut down for two weeks. so you are going to have these hiccups and it is a concern, but so far, we've been able to manage that concern pretty well so far.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. in terms of the impact of covid, it sounds like you've managed that fairly well. is there any meaningful costs associated with covid as you've had to secure all of your fiscal means that may be contributing to some additional costs that we don't see necessarily?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i don't think a substantial number. if you look at masks, thermostat, temperature gate, temperature measuring devices, making the place safe by putting plastic walls between spacing, no cafeteria, all those costs i think were taken out. so i think going forward, we do have -- i can't see any anything more than minimum cost going forward.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
okay. your sg&a is running a little higher than we were anticipating. i assume that's just a function also of your volumes, but i don't know if there's any additional color you could provide on that. and then i have one other question, i'll jump back in the queue. thanks.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
okay. all right. i'll let craig -- craig, you want to take the sg&a or you want farouq to do it?
craig brosious -- vice president, finance
yeah, i think i can take that one down. i think -- yeah, we are seeing some incremental sg&a related to the volume, as you said, jim, is also we have some additional expenses as we noted in our remarks here, but i think it's still in line with what our expectations were, maybe a little bit maybe on the high end, but i think we're, it's nothing unusual in there.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. just with respect to some of the pricing actions that you've taken, have you realized the benefits of that more fully or are some of those expected to flow in over the next quarter or so? i don't know if you can give us any kind of sense as to how those...
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i think...
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
actions would be?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think -- and this is just ballpark to give you a rough idea, i think in this quarter we probably, maybe picked up present of the price increases we put out there. and then the balance will be i think divided pretty equally between the third and fourth quarter. but i mean i would, i would think they would all be flushed out by the middle of the fourth quarter.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. okay. i'll jump back in the queue. and craig, i just want to wish you the best.
craig brosious -- vice president, finance
thanks. appreciate it, jim.
operator
next we'll hear from theodore o'neill with litchfield hills research.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
oh. thanks very much. congratulations on the good quarter. question about seasonality. given the strong -- sort of the strong demand here and longer lead times and the two recent acquisitions, do you think q4 seasonality will continue or do you have any thoughts about that one way or the other? if there is a potential change.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i think with covid everything is blown out the window. so again i don't -- generally because of in north america because of the christmas holiday, and thanksgiving you lose anywhere from five days to ten days, where people don't need parts but i think at this situation where the backlog is so strong and people are so desperate to get materials in. i'll be shocked that we will see-- i doubt we see the downward trend we've seen in the past.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
yeah. and it just didn't come up in the last quarter conference call, and i'll ask again here. are you concerned about double bookings and how are you managing that for-- second for that?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, that's a great question. and it's-- we're-- as you know we have-- as you probably know, we have vinnie vellucci, fromer president of arrow, of americas, of arrow, and that's a question we address all the time. at this point, everything we hear, we're getting the impression that there isn't double booking out there, but you just, you don't know. and i would think that you would probably see it more in the semiconductor area that are really stretched out long lead times than our product line. but it is a concern that people bringing in too much inventory, just as mike -- i think just a concern is bringing the double booking is people bringing in inventory too soon. so why bring about part in 20 weeks, if you're not going to get the ic in 45 weeks. and that's a concern that we try to look at, and you can leave -- do you have non-cancellable orders, do you have non-schedule change orders and we looked at that, but we haven't implemented at this time.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
okay. thanks very much.
operator
we'll take our next question from hendi susanto with gabelli funds.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds, llc -- analyst
good morning, dan, farouq and craig. thank you, craig for all the interactions.
craig brosious -- vice president, finance
thanks, hendi. enjoyed it.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds, llc -- analyst
dan, i would like to ask you questions about like sales trend. let's say, in the absence of, let's say like unforeseen covid impact and given the strong bookings, will it be reasonable to expect revenue will gradually improve every quarter throughout the end of the year?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i think, again -- i think for the next quarter, it should improve, and then again based historically, i think the fourth quarter will be substantially better than last year's fourth quarter. but then i don't know if it would be better than the third quarter because historically, the third quarter has always been a strong quarter for bel.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds, llc -- analyst
i see. yeah. and then, would you be able to share what the revenue contribution from rms and eos in q2, and then whether your expected revenue contributions from those two are higher, given like strong performance in q2?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
craig, do you want to take that?
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds, llc -- analyst
like can you tell the contribution for the year.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer

okay. so for the second quarter, rms contributed $2.7 million. i'm sorry, we're looking at trade sales. $2.5 million of sales, and eos contributed $3.5 million of sales. and...
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
just to give you a little more color and i would say that's a big -- again they supply the aerospace people. so historically, if you looked over the -- before covid, that's a very weak month for them.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds, llc -- analyst

thank you, lynn. and thank you for joining us on our call today. first, i'd like to provide an update on covid-19. all our manufacturing sites globally are operational throughout the second quarter. the delta variant is prevalent in regions in which bel operates, particularly in india, u.k. and now the u.s. we continue to stay vigilant and have protective measures in place to safeguard our associates. i would once again like to thank all of our global manufacturing associates for their ongoing dedication to bel under these difficult conditions.
turning to our results. we are pleased with our financial results for this quarter. this is our second consecutive quarter of meaningful year-over-year sales growth, as increased orders over the past six months continued to translate into sales. our bookings during the second quarter reached a new record high and our backlog of orders are managed at $314 million at june 30, 2021, an increase of 75% from a year ago. most importantly, these increases in sales and bookings were seen across all our major product groups, which is an indication of general market strength.
sales within our power solutions and protection group were up 23% from the second quarter of 2020. the increase was largely driven by a 55% growth in our fuse sales, a 53% growth in our products that support growing e-mobility end markets, and a 30% improvement in cui sales compared to last year's second quarter. these increases were offset in part by lower sales of our custom module products as we exit these low-margin products. and in connection with this exit our modular designs center in maidstone, u.k., will be closing during the third quarter with an estimated annual cost savings of $400,000. our power solution and protection group finished the second quarter robust backlog which is up $92 million or 143% from year-end.
sales of our connectivity solutions products increased by 11% from last year's second quarter, with the continued rebound of the commercial aerospace end market, which improved by $2.9 million or 114% from last year's second quarter. sales of our connectivity products through distribution channels were also strong, reflecting a $1.7 million or 12% increase from last year's second quarter. the backlog of orders for our connectivity products grew by $21 million or 45% since since year-end.
on the magnetic solutions group, our sales growth of 8% over the last year of second quarter, led by higher shipments of our integrated connector modules that are used in next generation switching applications. during the first half of 2021 our backlog of all of our magnetic products grew by $45 million or 105% since year-end. our first quarter acquisition of rms and eos are now fully integrated into bel's businesses, and both were immediately accredited to our results, contributing a combined $8.7 million in sales since the respective acquisition dates.
the recent pricing adjustments to our customers focus on margin improvement, coupled with the highest backlog in bel's history, the return of the aerospace demand and our participation in growth markets like atv, iot and 5g, allows us to be strongly optimistic about bel's future.
craig, can you go forward?
craig brosious -- vice president, finance
sure. thanks, dan. moving into the financial update. sales by product segment for the second quarter of 2021 were as follows. power solutions and protection sales were $55.4 million, up 22.9% from last year's second quarter. connectivity solutions sales were $43 million, an increase of 10.6%, and magnetic solutions sales were $40.3 million, up 8.3% from last year's second quarter.
preliminary gross margin by product segment for the second quarter of 2021 was as follows, power solutions and protection had a gross margin of 25.9% in the second quarter of 2021, up from 23.5% in last year's second quarter. connectivity solutions' gross margin was 30.3%, up from 29.6% in the 2020 quarter, and magnetic solutions' gross margin was 23.2%, down from 25.4% in last year's second quarter. on a consolidated basis, gross profit margin decreased to 24.7% in the second quarter of 2021 as compared with 25.8% in the second quarter of 2020.
bel implemented price increases earlier in 2021 to offset rising input costs, with a portion of these price increases taking effect in the second quarter. in addition to industry wide increases on raw material pricing, labor costs are higher due to wage rate increases and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations in the second quarter of 2021, as compared to the same quarter of 2020. the margin comparisons were also affected by $1 million in covid related subsidies received in last year's quarter that did not repeat. excluding the subsidy, gross margins in the second quarter of 2021 would have more -- been more comparable with last year's second quarter.
research and development costs were $5.5 million during the second quarter of 2021, a decline of $650,000 from the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to the closure of our switzerland r&d facility in mid 2020. our selling, general and administrative expenses were $21.8 million or 15.7% of sales, up $2.7 million from a dollar perspective from the second quarter of last year, but the same as a percentage of sales.
g&a salaries and fringe benefits were $1.3 million higher as compared to the second quarter of 2020. legal professional fees were up by $467,000 and we incurred $317,000 in acquisition related costs. these factors resulted in income from operations of $6.6 million in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to $6.1 million in the second quarter of 2020. other income and expense net was income of $130,000 for the second quarter of 2021, as compared to income of $1.2 million during the second quarter of 2020. the income in the second quarter of 2020 largely related to a $1.5 million gain on the company's serp investments, which are included in this line item.
interest expense was $721,000 in the second quarter of 2021, down from $1.3 million in the same quarter last year, as a result of decreases in both libor, the company's spread on its credit facility, driven by ebitda improvements, and the overall reduction in our outstanding debt balance. we had a benefit from income taxes of $1.9 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to a provision of $423,000 during last year's second quarter. the benefit in the second quarter of 2021 primarily resulted from the expiration of statutes of of limitations on certain tax reserve.
earnings per share for the class a common shares was earnings of $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2021, as compared with earnings of $0.43 per share in the second quarter of 2020. earnings per share for the class b common shares was earnings of $0.64 per share in the second quarter of 2021, as compared with earnings of $0.46 per share in the second quarter of 2020. on a non-gaap basis, which excludes certain unusual and other non-recurring items, eps for class a shares was $0.64 per share in the second quarter of 2021, as compared with earnings of $0.43 per share in the second quarter of 2020. on a non-gaap basis, eps for class b shares was earnings of $0.68 per share in the second quarter of 2021, as compared with earnings of $0.46 per share in the second quarter of 2020.
i'd now like to turn the call over to farouq to go through some balance sheet and cash flow items. farouq?
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
yeah. thank you, craig.
beginning with some balance sheet items. our cash and cash equivalents balance as of june 30, 2021 was $66.4 million, a decrease of $18.5 million from december 2021. during the first half of 2021, we made net payments of $14.8 million in connection with the acquisitions of rms and eos, $3.0 million toward our outstanding debt balance, and used cash for capital additions of $2.5 million, dividend payments of $1.6 million and interest payments of $627,000. these items were partially offset by $6.7 million in proceeds received from the sale of property.
accounts receivable were $86.9 million at june 30, 2021, as compared with $71.4 million at december 31, 2020, the primary driver of the increase related to the higher sales volume in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. the 2021 acquisitions of rms and eos also contributed to the increase in ar from year-end, accounting for $4.7 million to our receivables balance at june 30th.
days sales outstanding was 56 days at june 30, 2021 comparable with the dso at december 31, 2020. inventories were $116.2 million at june 30, 2021, up $16 million from december 31, 2020. the increase was seen in raw materials and work in progress, and was largely due to increased raw materials purposes to accommodate our higher backlog of orders, as well as the inclusion of $3 million from 2021 acquired companies.
accounts payable were $53 million at june 30, 2021, up $13.2 million from its level at december 31, 2020. the increase in ap was in line with the heightened purchasing volume of raw material during the first half of the year. in addition, the 2021 acquired companies accounted for $3.2 million of this increase from the year-end level. those total outstanding debt balance was $112.9 million as of june 30, 2021, net of deferred financing costs, a decrease of $2.7 million since the 2020-year end balance.
and with that, i'll turn the call back over to dan. dan?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, farouq.
before i open the call for questions, i'd like to thank -- take a moment to thank craig for his nearly 18 years of service to bel fuse. craig, came to the bel family through our acquisition of stewart connector in 2003. since then he assumed a number of positions within the financial department, to ultimately rising to lead the group in 2017. he is instrumental and helping guide us through some of most transforming years. i also like you now acknowledge his generous efforts in ensuring the transition for farouq is smooth and uneventful. craig will be retiring from the company at the end of september. he will be missed, but we wish him the best in his retirement. thank you, craig.
james, can we open the call for questions now?

thank you. [operator instructions] we'll now take the first question from theodore o'neill at litchfield hills research. please go ahead.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
thank you. congratulations on the good quarter.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
so i'm not sure i heard this right. did you say that there's $10 million of sales that are going to get -- got pushed out of q3 that are going to go into q4?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
yes. that's where we think that we stated. basically it was material outage also logistics. and then finally some customers push back orders because they didn't have all the components in at the same time.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
do you have any significant customers that have closed recently due to covid?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
none throughout the world.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
okay. now historically your fourth quarter has been down sequentially from third quarter revenue. is this push out of the $10 million enough to make it not seasonal this year?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i'm going to let farouq answer that question.
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
yes. so i would say q4 historically has been obviously lower sales versus q3. really more of workday's available, holidays ordering patterns and just kind of some of the things that are outside of our control. we certainly have the orders for it to be similar to levels to q3 obviously assuming you get the materials and so on. so i think to sum it up historically gets a little bit weaker. we have the orders. it just depends on how much we can actually get out assuming we get raw materials.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
okay. that makes sense. thanks very much.
operator
we'll now take the next question from jim ricchiuti from needham & company. please go ahead.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
good morning. couple of questions. you alluded to the price increases. and i just wanted to go back to some of the comments you made i think last quarter where you said that a modest amount of the price increase was realized. i think you said around 15%, but you thought the remainder would be realized q3 and q4. so i'm just curious how is that playing out the way you thought? are you still seeing the bulk of the increases kind of split between q3 and q4?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i would say, yes, we do have maybe 10% to 15% of the customers that do have yearly contracts with us and some of those fall into next year. but i think it's our goal that all pricing should be implemented by the end of this year excluding that 10% of customers.
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
maybe just to build up on what dan said you'll recall when we put the price increases earlier this year it takes a while for it to work through the system. and obviously the world has continued to change and evolve as you think about all things cost. so this is definitely something we're monitoring on a case-by-case basis, but we'll definitely keep a close eye on it to see if any further action is needed.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
got it. sorry just on what farouq said we are looking at our pricing on a quarterly basis not every six months not every year. so we really are to try and stay on top of it to make up the difference if the difference being the price increases that we are facing.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. and i'm wondering how you're dealing with your own supply chain issues you're obviously dependent on suppliers for various components. are you experiencing any kind of decommits from any of your suppliers that might be might be exacerbating your manufacturing and deliveries?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
absolutely, yes. and it could be different supply. you know ic manufacturers. i think there's a lot of hanky-panky going on for some of our suppliers even though we have orders in the book we've committed deliveries don't might come in and try to buy our audience from us. so it's a constant battle we face every day. and so far we've done a pretty good job managing it. but that's definitely -- i would say definitely we see decommits weekly and we try to address it based on our leverage and the relationships we have with our suppliers. but definitely we see it constantly.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
is there a potential that the magnitude of the impact that you called out for q3 that $10 million gets replayed in q4? does it get any worse in this environment? it sounds like you could have a situation where you have these-this kind of impact supply chain just kind of rolling from one quarter to the next. i'm not sure how to think about this.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i would tend to think that right in but maybe using $10 million as a barometer just because we never had this type of history before, and we don't have a track record of this type of pushouts. i would initially though we'd like to probably grow another $10 million at next quarter but things change so rapidly. it's just-it's a marketplace that we have seen for a long, long time.
and again, and mostly with some of the decommits and then you throw in the logistics in the labor situation like who we think you can't find labor in china. these are the one we face. but again, i think that's why most customers have been pretty aggressive laying out their orders. it needs to give us strong visibility so we can make substantial commitments that we could have made in the past.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
yes. last question and i'll just jump-i'll jump back in the queue. but i'm just wondering you called out now a couple of quarters where you're seeing some recovery in commercial aerospace. and i guess it's off a low base, given how that market has fallen. but what i'm wondering is how we might think about that business in 2022. are you anticipating that there could be a decent recovery that is more meaningful for revenues next year in commercial?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
farouq?
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
yes. so i think the way we would think about it is there is a strong ramp-quite frankly a pretty steep ramp-up that we're going for right now. and as we scale our business up. obviously, there are also challenges but i think we're pretty bullish on the build rates that are going on in the broader market. and i think to the-our commercial aerospace i would say from a bookings perspective is up north of roughly around 700%. so it's a steep ride and-but i think we're very bullish on that.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
i think-so i understand that we should get back to normal levels by the end of 2023. is that correct?
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
that is our best guidance on so far correct.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
and is there a way to think about what normal is in terms of-the business has changed a little bit. i'm just not sure it could be-it sounds like it could be a fairly meaningful revenue amount.
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
i think pre-covid.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting principal accounting officer and company secretary
so i can answer that one. so pre-covid did our commercial aerospace business and this is just direct. this is not what may go through distribution. within the ballpark of call it $5 million per quarter. and we've seen that dip down to around the $2 million mark per quarter over this past year. so there is quite a bit on the revenue side for a rebound there.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. thanks. and congratulations on the quarter.
operator
we'll now take the next question from hendi susanto from gabelli funds. please go ahead.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds -- analyst
good morning, dan, farouq and lynn. dan, i'm wondering whether we can characterize bel fuse that it is benefiting from like customers scrambling to get their parts including like bel fuse products?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
no. i think again i think everybody is scrambling for products from toilet paper to everything. so i think anybody that's supplying anything that people are adding larger visibility and creating substantial demand. what makes us exciting with the new post covid world with people working from home more and the type of communication they needed to do properly plus the ev market, we really are playing some strong markets that are generating a lot of growth.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds -- analyst
and then, on press release, there is a repress -- like bel fuse will repress its growth and operating strategic plans. any more color on that state.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
no. i think again -- yes, within a 70-year-old family run somewhat company. and i think the board has been taking a very aggressive stand on how we want to move the company forward. and i think with farouq, the young cfo coming aboard with a lot of good ideas and a lot of energy. i think the board is looking for him to reenergize the company and take a hard look at every part of bel and see how we should improve it. so i think again, i think it's a very exciting time to tell of how we move forward, and farouq is going to be a major catalyst to make that happen.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds -- analyst
and then, how do you envision the path toward supply chain normalizing in the later part of 2022? i assume that inventory in the channel is also lower than normal. so it will take a while, but i'm wondering whether you can share some insight into what kind of guidepost that we should be watching?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i think the guidepost, we now is -- generally, we always say we never have any visibility. but from everybody we talked to in the industry, they're all saying that will the supply get back from 45 weeks down to 22 weeks. they're all predicting this by the end of the second quarter. they're seeing somewhat more normalized. now, i don't know if it were go down 45 weeks down to 12 weeks or 22 weeks, but i think everybody is confident that the lead time should be dropping by the end of the second quarter of next year.
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
and i think maybe just to build up of that hendi as well. that's a little bit of a nuanced question. and the reason being is, we obviously see in various end markets and some are going through a fundamental transformation, right? so, ev being one of them. and old things electrification, for example. so, to dan's commentary, there'll be some that that will ramp-up more kind of like the commercial air would be talked about as well. and maybe some we see a little bit of loosening up. so i think that mix and diversity that we have embedded should position us well for when that day comes.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds -- analyst
got it. and then farouq, are we at the point where bel can share the magnitude of sell to e-mobility?
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
let me think about that. and the reason is, just it's from a tracking perspective. it's something that we're trying to have a little more clarity on. and just the way it's selling, we're -- but we hear you indeed we want to put that out there at some point. but i think right now we're just working our way through it and want to make sure we put a clean number out there. so, let us get back to you on that, unless dan if you know of the top of your head i think we need to look at a little more.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i think that's definitely a farouq project.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting principal accounting officer and company secretary
farouq, i do have recurring sales on e-mobility if there would be?
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
yes. okay. and we will caution that we may have built on that later. there's a couple of more things that we've got to trade through it, but this is kind of just the clear ones if you will.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting principal accounting officer and company secretary
okay, great. so in the third quarter of 2021, e-mobility sales were $3.9 million and that compared to $1.8 million in last year's third quarter.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds -- analyst
and then, lynn or farouq, do you have year-over-year organic sales growth including that like 12.4 million sales contribution from rms and eos.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting principal accounting officer and company secretary
year-over-year organic sales growth. so that was in.
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
you just drop out rms and eos, that would be the number, right?
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds -- analyst
okay.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting principal accounting officer and company secretary
that's right.
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
$12.4 million.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds -- analyst
that's it. thank you. and then a great performance in q3, all the best for q4.
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
thank you, so much.
operator
thank you. we'll now take the next question from mike hughes at sgf capital. please go ahead.
mike hughes -- sgf capital -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my questions. first i wanted to follow up on the pricing discussion. your gross margins were pressured by 230 basis points year-over-year in the just reported quarter. so assuming that the cost side stays the same from where it is right today, do you recover that margin degradation by 1q 2022? or is it further out than that?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
farouq?
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
yeah. so it's a good question. as dan has alluded to some customers are, kind of, 30-day out notifications, some are 60, some are annual contracts. but putting all that aside for a minute, as we look at q4 barring any kind of significant fluctuation fx we should be on a similar path to q3 that we just showed for this year.
obviously q3 last year had some noise in it from some of the covid subsidies and things that we've talked to them and understanding that just the nature of the business with backlog, the backlog that we're working burning off here in q4 is effectively priced in. so when we think about pricing, it will be a little more forward. so i think we'll see something -- given some of the reactions and actions that we're taking we'll see some of that start to trickle into the first quarter.
mike hughes -- sgf capital -- analyst
okay.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i'm sorry. just to back it up, the number one goal i sell and the major focus of everybody in the organization since farouq came aboard is really look at our margins and see every area we can do to improve our margins going forward. and it's a commitment throughout the whole organization to reevaluate how we do everything and our cost decisions go forth to improve to where we have to get to.
mike hughes -- sgf capital -- analyst
okay. and are you on fifo or lifo accounting.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting principal accounting officer and company secretary
so we utilize standard costs or our inventories accounted.
mike hughes -- sgf capital -- analyst
okay. and then what is your long-term operating margin goal? have you put one out there?
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
we don't have guidance on that just given -- overall we don't provide forward guidance here. but we know we want to be north of what we are around today.
mike hughes -- sgf capital -- analyst
okay, ok. and then you made a comment and i know this isn't unique to your company, but you made a comment about tracking rolling electrical blackouts in china. so can you just speak to if that impacted your production or your suppliers' productions in the third quarter and when the impact started to occur and if you're still seeing it?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
it hasn't impacted our suppliers and ourselves. we all -- some of us do have generators, the government as you can use generators, but what we have been able to do is managed by over time. so we shutdown monday, tuesday, the workers will work saturday, sunday. so far our suppliers have been flexible. it's just a concern that's been spreading to a lot of our investors and people ask what's going on with blackouts.
and generally we've seen it in the summer or pre-olympics when they want to adjust the smart issue in china. they do change their policy on how they want to run this exploration. so at this point in time, it's something we've seen but it hasn't really affected our top line or bottom line growth.
mike hughes -- sgf capital -- analyst
okay, ok. and then just last question. sg&a and r&d costs, can we take the third quarter and just extrapolate that into the future and barring a big ramp in revenues? is that fair or not?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
yes, it is. that's fair.
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
i think with a question here is we're seemingly everything is just more on inflationary environment and everything is costing more. but i think just on average, it should be a little more step to go.
mike hughes -- sgf capital -- analyst
okay. thank you very much.
operator
[operator instructions] we'll now take the next question from edward schular [phonetic], a private investor. please go ahead.
edward schular -- a private investor -- analyst
yes. thank you. a couple of questions. dan, could you address your utilization and capacity for our company in your plans, what is the total capacity what percentage of utilization are you at now?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i do think the majority of our factories are running full tilt. and most of them are scheduling all the time to get as much as we can out of the factory within the limits of the labor laws of that country. so i don't think we have many factories that are running at 70 years 60%. so i think we're running pretty hard now. we are looking -- we do a lot of manufacturing for one product group our magnetic product group. we are looking to build a new facility in china to consolidate our operations there and give us some added space. but at this point we generally use over time means of capital investment.
edward schular -- a private investor -- analyst
like the rms transaction in january where you moved your equipment into your minnesota facility. if that business increases, would you have to increase the space in venezuela?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
no. yes, mostly -- we had additional space and we have -- we had added i think 5,000 to 10,000 square feet to our building our leases came up like six months ago. so we have space, but that tend to be a highly automated production processes where you get a lot of stamping and molding equipment, which are very expensive. so for that it's -- you get a high output you have to run those operations seven days a week, 24-hour shifts. and that's how the company we acquired were doing it. so again, we were able to than a lot of it in and just added minimum space.
edward schular -- a private investor -- analyst
another question. go ahead.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
again, let me just speak the idea, so when we bought the company they were at a current run rate of about 20% of what they did in the peak. so again, we have a lot of utilization of equipment there as that ramp-up comes up over the next two or three years.
edward schular -- a private investor -- analyst
in your magnetics business, do you have any concern about the supply for rare earth minerals? or what is your need for rare earth minerals?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
well, that said much, we do have copper on wire. but generally, it's a water level water and plastics and not. but we don't really have in terms of our rare earth and on the magnetic side we do use parts and so forth. but it has not been a problem yet. i mean, i think if you look overall i think our number one problem from a material standpoint is the other way we are the large ic companies and getting ics on timely manner.
edward schular -- a private investor -- analyst
last question and a follow-up on mike's question, on the r&d, the r&d has gone from $5 million to $5.5 million then $5.9 million. is that a good thing? is that could indicate new products are coming for next year and the year beyond?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i think the -- maybe it's difficult to understand the question, but if the question is are we confident in where we're spending our dollars to good npi out there, that's a good return. the answer is, yes. i think as where we're looking to focus the business, we are focus on margins. it's just really more of a refocus and realignment of our r&d efforts. so i think where we sit today, we're feeling good with what we have. we add strategic who needs to be. but i think we're just shifting our focus a little bit to be a little more focused.
edward schular -- a private investor -- analyst
i think the question is it looks like you had a substantial increase in r&d is after new product. but i think a lot of the increase came from the fx.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting principal accounting officer and company secretary
that's right. yeah. so a lot of our r&d staff if the engineers are in china and in europe and with the strengthening the renminbi and euro over the past year, especially since q3 last year, just those same local costs translate into much higher usd.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
so it wasn't adding more people. i think the major question you were asking.
edward schular -- a private investor -- analyst
yeah. similar to that yes, that's fine. thank you very much. i'll go back to the queue.
operator
that concludes today's question-and-answer session. i'd now like to turn the call back to manager.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer

daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, lynn, and thank you everybody for joining our call today. before discussing the quarter, i would like to thank our global manufacturing associates for their ongoing dedication to bel, and it is their efforts have kept all our manufacturing sites up and running in the third quarter. turning to our results. we achieved our third quarter a meaningful year-over-year sales growth, with new record highs in both quarterly bookings, and in our backlog of orders at the quarter end.
the increasing demand is across all our major products and end markets. the new way is power group, which had substantial growth from cui, e-mobility and the circuit protection division. interesting to note, circuit protection our oldest product line had the best quarter in our history. our backlog is at an all-time high, totaling $390 million at september 30. farouq will offer more details shortly.
we are pleased to announce that our acquisitions of rms and eos are now fully integrated into the bel family and both were immediately accretive to our results, contributing a combined $12.4 million in sales and $1.6 million of net earnings since our respective acquisition base. on the cost side, we do see increases in labor material and logistics, and our recent price increases will offset these costs going forward.
the global parts availability and logistics have pushed out approximately $10 million of expected sales in q4-expected sales into q4 2021. rolling electrical blackouts in china is something we are closely monitoring. the quarter also marked a big milestone for us as we concluded our four year erp conversion project, combining five systems into one. since the inception of this product bel has incurred a cost of $7 million, with annual cost savings achieved at $2 million.
we're excited about the data and analytics to that, the new system will provide in helping us better review and manage the profitability of our operations. for the fourth quarter, we will continue working on several fronts to streamline and simplify the business to improve our margins. yesterday, we announced jackie brito as a new addition to our board of directors. jackie is currently ceo of hr asset partners, a company focused on organization culture, human capital planning and leadership development.
in addition, she has a long career at rollins college crummer school of business, where she held positions as a system lead of emissions, career development, director of emissions; and general professor of management. our focus is on management, recruitment, selection, retention and diversity in the workplace. we are pleased to have jackie as a member of bel's board as we embark on a variety of projects in the coming quarters, which include refreshing our strategy, our growth plans, esg, associate engagement and retention and investing in the communities which we live and work.
i would like now to turn the call over to farouq to run through the financial updates.
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
thank you, dan. good morning everybody. sales by product segment for the third quarter of 2021 were as follows. power solutions and protection, sales were $60.3 million. that is up 26% from last year's third quarter. our products that contribute to the immobility end market led the group, with a growth of 115%, followed by coi infuses. as discussed previously, we continue to exit our custom modules business that was a negative contributor this quarter of weaker sales.
our power solutions and protection group finished the third quarter with their robust backlog, which is up $126 million or almost 200% from year-end. connectivity solutions sales were $40.3 million, an increase of 5% from last year's third quarter, with the continued rebound in the commercial aerospace end market, which improved by $1.4 million or 59% from last year's third quarter. sales distribution channels were also strong, reflecting a 23% increase from last year's third quarter.
the defense sales were challenged this past quarter, resulting in a 37% decrease. the backlog of orders for our connectivity products grew by $30 million or 64% since year-end. magnetic solutions were $46.3 million. that is up 20% from last year's third quarter, led by higher demand for our integrated connector modules that are used in next-generation switching applications. our backlog of orders for our magnetic products grew by $79 million or 184% since year-end.
preliminary gross profit margins by product segment for the third quarter of 2021 were where power solutions and protection had a gross margin of 26.1% in the third quarter of 2021. that is up from 24.2% in last year's third quarter. the connectivity solutions gross margin was 24.8%, down from 29.1% in the 2020 quarter. magnetic solutions gross margin was 23.1%, down from 28.3% in last year's third quarter.
on a consolidated basis, gross profit margin decreased to 24.5% in the third quarter of 2021, as compared with 26.8% in the third quarter 2020. industrywide increases on raw material pricing, higher labor costs and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations during the third quarter of 2021, outpaced the benefits from pricing increases earlier in the year. the margin comparisons were also affected by $900,000 in the covid related subsidies received in last year's quarter that did not repeat.
on the r&d front, costs were $5.9 million during the third quarter of 2021, an increase of $200,000 from the third quarter of 2020, largely due to unfavorable effects. sg&a expenses were $21.2 million or 14.4% of sales, up $1.8 million from a dollar perspective from the third quarter last year, but represents a reduction as a percentage of sales.
the majority of the increase related to salaries and fringe benefits of $700,000 as compared to the third quarter of 2020 and higher legal and professional fees of $400,000. we also started to see an uptick in travel expenses compared to the third quarter of 2020. these factors resulted in income from operations of $8.9 million in the third quarter of 2021, as compared to $8.1 million in the third quarter of 2020. on the interest expense side, there was $1.45 million in the third quarter of 2021 that is up from $1.2 million in the same quarter last year.
in connection with the refinancing of our credit agreement in the third quarter of 2021, we amortized the remaining deferred financing costs associated with our prior credit agreement. this resulted in $820,000 charged to interest expense during this year's third quarter. this was partially offset decreases in both libor, the company's spread on its credit facility driven by ebitda improvements, and the overall reduction in our outstanding debt balances versus last year's third quarter.
we had a provision for income taxes of $1.5 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to a benefit of $1.1 million during last year's third quarter. the benefit in the third quarter of 2020 primarily resulted from federal tax law changes related to gilti and expiration of statutory implementation on certain tax reserves. earnings per share for class a was $0.44 per share in the third quarter of 2021 as compared with earnings of $0.57 per share in the third quarter of 2020. earnings per share for class b shares was earnings of $0.47 per share in the third quarter of 2021 as compared with earnings of $0.61 per share in the third quarter of 2020.
on a non-gaap basis, which excludes certain unusual and other non-recurring items, eps for class a shares were $0.48 per share in the third quarter of 2021 as compared with earnings of $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2020. on a non-gaap basis, eps for class b shares were earnings of $0.51 per share in the third quarter of 2021 as compared with earnings of $0.62 per share in the third quarter of 2020. shifting over to some balance sheet items. our cash and cash equivalents balance at september 30, 2021 was $62 million, a decrease of $23 million from december 31st, 2020.
during the first nine months of 2021, we made net payments of $16.8 million in connection with the acquisition of rms and eos, $4.3 million of net payments toward our outstanding debt balance, and used cash for capital additions of $4.2 million, dividend payments of $2.4 million and interest payments of $1.7 million. these items were partially offset by $7.2 million in proceeds received from the sale of various properties.
accounts receivable were $86 million as of september 30, 2021 as compared to $71.4 million at december 31st, 2020. the primary driver of the increase related to the higher sales volume in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. the 2021 acquisitions of rms and eos also contributed to the increase in ar from year end accounting for $3 million to our receivables balance at september 30th.
days sales outstanding was 54 days at september 30, 2021 an improvement from 57 days at december 31, 2020. inventories were $128.2 million at september 30, 2021, up $28 million from december 31st, 2020. the increase was seen in raw materials and work in progress was -- and was largely due to increased raw material purchases to accommodate our higher backlog of orders as well as the inclusion of $2.6 million from 2021 acquired companies.
accounts payable were $57.6 million at september 30, 2021. that is up $17.8 million from its level at december 31, 2020. the increase in ap was in line with the heightened purchasing volume of raw materials during the first nine months of the year. in addition the 2021 acquired companies accounted for $3.4 million of this increase from year end level. bel's total outstanding debt balance was $112.5 million as of september 30th, 2021, a decrease of $4.3 million since december 31st, 2020. we had previously announced a refi that was closed on september 2nd that results in overall lower interest rates and spreads while eliminating all fixed principal team.
and with that, i'll turn the call back over to dan. dan?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, farouq. catherine, at this time, we'd like to open up the phone line for questions people might have.

thank you. [operator instructions] we'll now take the first question from theodore o'neill at litchfield hills research. please go ahead.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
thank you. congratulations on the good quarter.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
so i'm not sure i heard this right. did you say that there's $10 million of sales that are going to get -- got pushed out of q3 that are going to go into q4?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
yes. that's where we think that we stated. basically it was material outage also logistics. and then finally some customers push back orders because they didn't have all the components in at the same time.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
do you have any significant customers that have closed recently due to covid?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
none throughout the world.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
okay. now historically your fourth quarter has been down sequentially from third quarter revenue. is this push out of the $10 million enough to make it not seasonal this year?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i'm going to let farouq answer that question.
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
yes. so i would say q4 historically has been obviously lower sales versus q3. really more of workday's available, holidays ordering patterns and just kind of some of the things that are outside of our control. we certainly have the orders for it to be similar to levels to q3 obviously assuming you get the materials and so on. so i think to sum it up historically gets a little bit weaker. we have the orders. it just depends on how much we can actually get out assuming we get raw materials.
theodore o'neill -- litchfield hills research -- analyst
okay. that makes sense. thanks very much.
operator
we'll now take the next question from jim ricchiuti from needham & company. please go ahead.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
good morning. couple of questions. you alluded to the price increases. and i just wanted to go back to some of the comments you made i think last quarter where you said that a modest amount of the price increase was realized. i think you said around 15%, but you thought the remainder would be realized q3 and q4. so i'm just curious how is that playing out the way you thought? are you still seeing the bulk of the increases kind of split between q3 and q4?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i would say, yes, we do have maybe 10% to 15% of the customers that do have yearly contracts with us and some of those fall into next year. but i think it's our goal that all pricing should be implemented by the end of this year excluding that 10% of customers.
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
maybe just to build up on what dan said you'll recall when we put the price increases earlier this year it takes a while for it to work through the system. and obviously the world has continued to change and evolve as you think about all things cost. so this is definitely something we're monitoring on a case-by-case basis, but we'll definitely keep a close eye on it to see if any further action is needed.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
got it. sorry just on what farouq said we are looking at our pricing on a quarterly basis not every six months not every year. so we really are to try and stay on top of it to make up the difference if the difference being the price increases that we are facing.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. and i'm wondering how you're dealing with your own supply chain issues you're obviously dependent on suppliers for various components. are you experiencing any kind of decommits from any of your suppliers that might be might be exacerbating your manufacturing and deliveries?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
absolutely, yes. and it could be different supply. you know ic manufacturers. i think there's a lot of hanky-panky going on for some of our suppliers even though we have orders in the book we've committed deliveries don't might come in and try to buy our audience from us. so it's a constant battle we face every day. and so far we've done a pretty good job managing it. but that's definitely -- i would say definitely we see decommits weekly and we try to address it based on our leverage and the relationships we have with our suppliers. but definitely we see it constantly.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
is there a potential that the magnitude of the impact that you called out for q3 that $10 million gets replayed in q4? does it get any worse in this environment? it sounds like you could have a situation where you have these-this kind of impact supply chain just kind of rolling from one quarter to the next. i'm not sure how to think about this.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i would tend to think that right in but maybe using $10 million as a barometer just because we never had this type of history before, and we don't have a track record of this type of pushouts. i would initially though we'd like to probably grow another $10 million at next quarter but things change so rapidly. it's just-it's a marketplace that we have seen for a long, long time.
and again, and mostly with some of the decommits and then you throw in the logistics in the labor situation like who we think you can't find labor in china. these are the one we face. but again, i think that's why most customers have been pretty aggressive laying out their orders. it needs to give us strong visibility so we can make substantial commitments that we could have made in the past.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
yes. last question and i'll just jump-i'll jump back in the queue. but i'm just wondering you called out now a couple of quarters where you're seeing some recovery in commercial aerospace. and i guess it's off a low base, given how that market has fallen. but what i'm wondering is how we might think about that business in 2022. are you anticipating that there could be a decent recovery that is more meaningful for revenues next year in commercial?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
farouq?
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
yes. so i think the way we would think about it is there is a strong ramp-quite frankly a pretty steep ramp-up that we're going for right now. and as we scale our business up. obviously, there are also challenges but i think we're pretty bullish on the build rates that are going on in the broader market. and i think to the-our commercial aerospace i would say from a bookings perspective is up north of roughly around 700%. so it's a steep ride and-but i think we're very bullish on that.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
i think-so i understand that we should get back to normal levels by the end of 2023. is that correct?
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
that is our best guidance on so far correct.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
and is there a way to think about what normal is in terms of-the business has changed a little bit. i'm just not sure it could be-it sounds like it could be a fairly meaningful revenue amount.
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
i think pre-covid.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting principal accounting officer and company secretary
so i can answer that one. so pre-covid did our commercial aerospace business and this is just direct. this is not what may go through distribution. within the ballpark of call it $5 million per quarter. and we've seen that dip down to around the $2 million mark per quarter over this past year. so there is quite a bit on the revenue side for a rebound there.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. thanks. and congratulations on the quarter.
operator
we'll now take the next question from hendi susanto from gabelli funds. please go ahead.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds -- analyst
good morning, dan, farouq and lynn. dan, i'm wondering whether we can characterize bel fuse that it is benefiting from like customers scrambling to get their parts including like bel fuse products?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
no. i think again i think everybody is scrambling for products from toilet paper to everything. so i think anybody that's supplying anything that people are adding larger visibility and creating substantial demand. what makes us exciting with the new post covid world with people working from home more and the type of communication they needed to do properly plus the ev market, we really are playing some strong markets that are generating a lot of growth.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds -- analyst
and then, on press release, there is a repress -- like bel fuse will repress its growth and operating strategic plans. any more color on that state.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
no. i think again -- yes, within a 70-year-old family run somewhat company. and i think the board has been taking a very aggressive stand on how we want to move the company forward. and i think with farouq, the young cfo coming aboard with a lot of good ideas and a lot of energy. i think the board is looking for him to reenergize the company and take a hard look at every part of bel and see how we should improve it. so i think again, i think it's a very exciting time to tell of how we move forward, and farouq is going to be a major catalyst to make that happen.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds -- analyst
and then, how do you envision the path toward supply chain normalizing in the later part of 2022? i assume that inventory in the channel is also lower than normal. so it will take a while, but i'm wondering whether you can share some insight into what kind of guidepost that we should be watching?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i think the guidepost, we now is -- generally, we always say we never have any visibility. but from everybody we talked to in the industry, they're all saying that will the supply get back from 45 weeks down to 22 weeks. they're all predicting this by the end of the second quarter. they're seeing somewhat more normalized. now, i don't know if it were go down 45 weeks down to 12 weeks or 22 weeks, but i think everybody is confident that the lead time should be dropping by the end of the second quarter of next year.
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
and i think maybe just to build up of that hendi as well. that's a little bit of a nuanced question. and the reason being is, we obviously see in various end markets and some are going through a fundamental transformation, right? so, ev being one of them. and old things electrification, for example. so, to dan's commentary, there'll be some that that will ramp-up more kind of like the commercial air would be talked about as well. and maybe some we see a little bit of loosening up. so i think that mix and diversity that we have embedded should position us well for when that day comes.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds -- analyst
got it. and then farouq, are we at the point where bel can share the magnitude of sell to e-mobility?
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
let me think about that. and the reason is, just it's from a tracking perspective. it's something that we're trying to have a little more clarity on. and just the way it's selling, we're -- but we hear you indeed we want to put that out there at some point. but i think right now we're just working our way through it and want to make sure we put a clean number out there. so, let us get back to you on that, unless dan if you know of the top of your head i think we need to look at a little more.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i think that's definitely a farouq project.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting principal accounting officer and company secretary
farouq, i do have recurring sales on e-mobility if there would be?
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
yes. okay. and we will caution that we may have built on that later. there's a couple of more things that we've got to trade through it, but this is kind of just the clear ones if you will.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting principal accounting officer and company secretary
okay, great. so in the third quarter of 2021, e-mobility sales were $3.9 million and that compared to $1.8 million in last year's third quarter.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds -- analyst
and then, lynn or farouq, do you have year-over-year organic sales growth including that like 12.4 million sales contribution from rms and eos.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting principal accounting officer and company secretary
year-over-year organic sales growth. so that was in.
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
you just drop out rms and eos, that would be the number, right?
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds -- analyst
okay.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting principal accounting officer and company secretary
that's right.
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
$12.4 million.
hendi susanto -- gabelli funds -- analyst
that's it. thank you. and then a great performance in q3, all the best for q4.
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
thank you, so much.
operator
thank you. we'll now take the next question from mike hughes at sgf capital. please go ahead.
mike hughes -- sgf capital -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my questions. first i wanted to follow up on the pricing discussion. your gross margins were pressured by 230 basis points year-over-year in the just reported quarter. so assuming that the cost side stays the same from where it is right today, do you recover that margin degradation by 1q 2022? or is it further out than that?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
farouq?
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
yeah. so it's a good question. as dan has alluded to some customers are, kind of, 30-day out notifications, some are 60, some are annual contracts. but putting all that aside for a minute, as we look at q4 barring any kind of significant fluctuation fx we should be on a similar path to q3 that we just showed for this year.
obviously q3 last year had some noise in it from some of the covid subsidies and things that we've talked to them and understanding that just the nature of the business with backlog, the backlog that we're working burning off here in q4 is effectively priced in. so when we think about pricing, it will be a little more forward. so i think we'll see something -- given some of the reactions and actions that we're taking we'll see some of that start to trickle into the first quarter.
mike hughes -- sgf capital -- analyst
okay.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i'm sorry. just to back it up, the number one goal i sell and the major focus of everybody in the organization since farouq came aboard is really look at our margins and see every area we can do to improve our margins going forward. and it's a commitment throughout the whole organization to reevaluate how we do everything and our cost decisions go forth to improve to where we have to get to.
mike hughes -- sgf capital -- analyst
okay. and are you on fifo or lifo accounting.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting principal accounting officer and company secretary
so we utilize standard costs or our inventories accounted.
mike hughes -- sgf capital -- analyst
okay. and then what is your long-term operating margin goal? have you put one out there?
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
we don't have guidance on that just given -- overall we don't provide forward guidance here. but we know we want to be north of what we are around today.
mike hughes -- sgf capital -- analyst
okay, ok. and then you made a comment and i know this isn't unique to your company, but you made a comment about tracking rolling electrical blackouts in china. so can you just speak to if that impacted your production or your suppliers' productions in the third quarter and when the impact started to occur and if you're still seeing it?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
it hasn't impacted our suppliers and ourselves. we all -- some of us do have generators, the government as you can use generators, but what we have been able to do is managed by over time. so we shutdown monday, tuesday, the workers will work saturday, sunday. so far our suppliers have been flexible. it's just a concern that's been spreading to a lot of our investors and people ask what's going on with blackouts.
and generally we've seen it in the summer or pre-olympics when they want to adjust the smart issue in china. they do change their policy on how they want to run this exploration. so at this point in time, it's something we've seen but it hasn't really affected our top line or bottom line growth.
mike hughes -- sgf capital -- analyst
okay, ok. and then just last question. sg&a and r&d costs, can we take the third quarter and just extrapolate that into the future and barring a big ramp in revenues? is that fair or not?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
yes, it is. that's fair.
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
i think with a question here is we're seemingly everything is just more on inflationary environment and everything is costing more. but i think just on average, it should be a little more step to go.
mike hughes -- sgf capital -- analyst
okay. thank you very much.
operator
[operator instructions] we'll now take the next question from edward schular [phonetic], a private investor. please go ahead.
edward schular -- a private investor -- analyst
yes. thank you. a couple of questions. dan, could you address your utilization and capacity for our company in your plans, what is the total capacity what percentage of utilization are you at now?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i do think the majority of our factories are running full tilt. and most of them are scheduling all the time to get as much as we can out of the factory within the limits of the labor laws of that country. so i don't think we have many factories that are running at 70 years 60%. so i think we're running pretty hard now. we are looking -- we do a lot of manufacturing for one product group our magnetic product group. we are looking to build a new facility in china to consolidate our operations there and give us some added space. but at this point we generally use over time means of capital investment.
edward schular -- a private investor -- analyst
like the rms transaction in january where you moved your equipment into your minnesota facility. if that business increases, would you have to increase the space in venezuela?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
no. yes, mostly -- we had additional space and we have -- we had added i think 5,000 to 10,000 square feet to our building our leases came up like six months ago. so we have space, but that tend to be a highly automated production processes where you get a lot of stamping and molding equipment, which are very expensive. so for that it's -- you get a high output you have to run those operations seven days a week, 24-hour shifts. and that's how the company we acquired were doing it. so again, we were able to than a lot of it in and just added minimum space.
edward schular -- a private investor -- analyst
another question. go ahead.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
again, let me just speak the idea, so when we bought the company they were at a current run rate of about 20% of what they did in the peak. so again, we have a lot of utilization of equipment there as that ramp-up comes up over the next two or three years.
edward schular -- a private investor -- analyst
in your magnetics business, do you have any concern about the supply for rare earth minerals? or what is your need for rare earth minerals?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
well, that said much, we do have copper on wire. but generally, it's a water level water and plastics and not. but we don't really have in terms of our rare earth and on the magnetic side we do use parts and so forth. but it has not been a problem yet. i mean, i think if you look overall i think our number one problem from a material standpoint is the other way we are the large ic companies and getting ics on timely manner.
edward schular -- a private investor -- analyst
last question and a follow-up on mike's question, on the r&d, the r&d has gone from $5 million to $5.5 million then $5.9 million. is that a good thing? is that could indicate new products are coming for next year and the year beyond?
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
i think the -- maybe it's difficult to understand the question, but if the question is are we confident in where we're spending our dollars to good npi out there, that's a good return. the answer is, yes. i think as where we're looking to focus the business, we are focus on margins. it's just really more of a refocus and realignment of our r&d efforts. so i think where we sit today, we're feeling good with what we have. we add strategic who needs to be. but i think we're just shifting our focus a little bit to be a little more focused.
edward schular -- a private investor -- analyst
i think the question is it looks like you had a substantial increase in r&d is after new product. but i think a lot of the increase came from the fx.
lynn hutkin -- director of financial reporting principal accounting officer and company secretary
that's right. yeah. so a lot of our r&d staff if the engineers are in china and in europe and with the strengthening the renminbi and euro over the past year, especially since q3 last year, just those same local costs translate into much higher usd.
daniel bernstein -- president and chief executive officer
so it wasn't adding more people. i think the major question you were asking.
edward schular -- a private investor -- analyst
yeah. similar to that yes, that's fine. thank you very much. i'll go back to the queue.

the increasing demand is across all our major products and end markets. the new way is power group, which had substantial growth from cui, e-mobility and the circuit protection division. interesting to note, circuit protection our oldest product line had the best quarter in our history. our backlog is at an all-time high, totaling $390 million at september 30. farouq will offer more details shortly.
we are pleased to announce that our acquisitions of rms and eos are now fully integrated into the bel family and both were immediately accretive to our results, contributing a combined $12.4 million in sales and $1.6 million of net earnings since our respective acquisition base. on the cost side, we do see increases in labor material and logistics, and our recent price increases will offset these costs going forward.
the global parts availability and logistics have pushed out approximately $10 million of expected sales in q4-expected sales into q4 2021. rolling electrical blackouts in china is something we are closely monitoring. the quarter also marked a big milestone for us as we concluded our four year erp conversion project, combining five systems into one. since the inception of this product bel has incurred a cost of $7 million, with annual cost savings achieved at $2 million.
we're excited about the data and analytics to that, the new system will provide in helping us better review and manage the profitability of our operations. for the fourth quarter, we will continue working on several fronts to streamline and simplify the business to improve our margins. yesterday, we announced jackie brito as a new addition to our board of directors. jackie is currently ceo of hr asset partners, a company focused on organization culture, human capital planning and leadership development.

i would like now to turn the call over to farouq to run through the financial updates.
farouq tuweiq -- chief financial officer
thank you, dan. good morning everybody. sales by product segment for the third quarter of 2021 were as follows. power solutions and protection, sales were $60.3 million. that is up 26% from last year's third quarter. our products that contribute to the immobility end market led the group, with a growth of 115%, followed by coi infuses. as discussed previously, we continue to exit our custom modules business that was a negative contributor this quarter of weaker sales.
our power solutions and protection group finished the third quarter with their robust backlog, which is up $126 million or almost 200% from year-end. connectivity solutions sales were $40.3 million, an increase of 5% from last year's third quarter, with the continued rebound in the commercial aerospace end market, which improved by $1.4 million or 59% from last year's third quarter. sales distribution channels were also strong, reflecting a 23% increase from last year's third quarter.
the defense sales were challenged this past quarter, resulting in a 37% decrease. the backlog of orders for our connectivity products grew by $30 million or 64% since year-end. magnetic solutions were $46.3 million. that is up 20% from last year's third quarter, led by higher demand for our integrated connector modules that are used in next-generation switching applications. our backlog of orders for our magnetic products grew by $79 million or 184% since year-end.
preliminary gross profit margins by product segment for the third quarter of 2021 were where power solutions and protection had a gross margin of 26.1% in the third quarter of 2021. that is up from 24.2% in last year's third quarter. the connectivity solutions gross margin was 24.8%, down from 29.1% in the 2020 quarter. magnetic solutions gross margin was 23.1%, down from 28.3% in last year's third quarter.
on a consolidated basis, gross profit margin decreased to 24.5% in the third quarter of 2021, as compared with 26.8% in the third quarter 2020. industrywide increases on raw material pricing, higher labor costs and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations during the third quarter of 2021, outpaced the benefits from pricing increases earlier in the year. the margin comparisons were also affected by $900,000 in the covid related subsidies received in last year's quarter that did not repeat.
on the r&d front, costs were $5.9 million during the third quarter of 2021, an increase of $200,000 from the third quarter of 2020, largely due to unfavorable effects. sg&a expenses were $21.2 million or 14.4% of sales, up $1.8 million from a dollar perspective from the third quarter last year, but represents a reduction as a percentage of sales.
the majority of the increase related to salaries and fringe benefits of $700,000 as compared to the third quarter of 2020 and higher legal and professional fees of $400,000. we also started to see an uptick in travel expenses compared to the third quarter of 2020. these factors resulted in income from operations of $8.9 million in the third quarter of 2021, as compared to $8.1 million in the third quarter of 2020. on the interest expense side, there was $1.45 million in the third quarter of 2021 that is up from $1.2 million in the same quarter last year.
in connection with the refinancing of our credit agreement in the third quarter of 2021, we amortized the remaining deferred financing costs associated with our prior credit agreement. this resulted in $820,000 charged to interest expense during this year's third quarter. this was partially offset decreases in both libor, the company's spread on its credit facility driven by ebitda improvements, and the overall reduction in our outstanding debt balances versus last year's third quarter.
we had a provision for income taxes of $1.5 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to a benefit of $1.1 million during last year's third quarter. the benefit in the third quarter of 2020 primarily resulted from federal tax law changes related to gilti and expiration of statutory implementation on certain tax reserves. earnings per share for class a was $0.44 per share in the third quarter of 2021 as compared with earnings of $0.57 per share in the third quarter of 2020. earnings per share for class b shares was earnings of $0.47 per share in the third quarter of 2021 as compared with earnings of $0.61 per share in the third quarter of 2020.
on a non-gaap basis, which excludes certain unusual and other non-recurring items, eps for class a shares were $0.48 per share in the third quarter of 2021 as compared with earnings of $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2020. on a non-gaap basis, eps for class b shares were earnings of $0.51 per share in the third quarter of 2021 as compared with earnings of $0.62 per share in the third quarter of 2020. shifting over to some balance sheet items. our cash and cash equivalents balance at september 30, 2021 was $62 million, a decrease of $23 million from december 31st, 2020.
during the first nine months of 2021, we made net payments of $16.8 million in connection with the acquisition of rms and eos, $4.3 million of net payments toward our outstanding debt balance, and used cash for capital additions of $4.2 million, dividend payments of $2.4 million and interest payments of $1.7 million. these items were partially offset by $7.2 million in proceeds received from the sale of various properties.
accounts receivable were $86 million as of september 30, 2021 as compared to $71.4 million at december 31st, 2020. the primary driver of the increase related to the higher sales volume in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. the 2021 acquisitions of rms and eos also contributed to the increase in ar from year end accounting for $3 million to our receivables balance at september 30th.
days sales outstanding was 54 days at september 30, 2021 an improvement from 57 days at december 31, 2020. inventories were $128.2 million at september 30, 2021, up $28 million from december 31st, 2020. the increase was seen in raw materials and work in progress was -- and was largely due to increased raw material purchases to accommodate our higher backlog of orders as well as the inclusion of $2.6 million from 2021 acquired companies.
accounts payable were $57.6 million at september 30, 2021. that is up $17.8 million from its level at december 31, 2020. the increase in ap was in line with the heightened purchasing volume of raw materials during the first nine months of the year. in addition the 2021 acquired companies accounted for $3.4 million of this increase from year end level. bel's total outstanding debt balance was $112.5 million as of september 30th, 2021, a decrease of $4.3 million since december 31st, 2020. we had previously announced a refi that was closed on september 2nd that results in overall lower interest rates and spreads while eliminating all fixed principal team.
and with that, i'll turn the call back over to dan. dan?
