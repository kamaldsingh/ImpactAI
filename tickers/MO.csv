billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thanks, mac. good morning, and thank you for joining us. altria delivered outstanding results in 2020 and managed through the challenges presented by the covid-19 pandemic. our tobacco businesses were resilient, and our employees demonstrated unwavering commitment to their work, colleagues and communities.
our employees continue to move altria forward, and we believe we're making steady progress toward our 10-year vision to responsibly lead the transition of adult smokers to a noncombustible future. we continue to execute against the strategies we previously shared, including maximizing profits in our combustible businesses, responsibly expanding our noncombustible products, and demonstrating science-based leadership in the external environment. we remain active in our communities, supporting relief efforts for the pandemic and the west coast wildfires. we're committed to driving positive change and addressing racial and economic inequities.
change starts from within, and our employees are leading our efforts to build a more diverse inclusive and equitable organization. our 11 employee resource groups are helping promote cultural awareness and diversity in our workplace and within our communities. two of these organizations, mosaic and c, were recently recognized for their contributions by the national lgbt chamber of commerce and by the virginia hispanic chamber of commerce, respectively. we also acknowledge the importance of addressing environmental challenges, and we've established ambitious goals for 2030.
last month, we were among the 1% of companies awarded a aa rating from cdp for climate and water stewardship. we're proud of these efforts, and i look forward to sharing more details about our esg initiatives next month at cagny. 2020 was a dynamic year in the tobacco industry, with notable changes in each category. tobacco consumers continue to adopt noncombustible alternatives to cigarettes.
most significantly in the oral tobacco space, with rapid growth in oral nicotine pouches off of a small base and a return to moderate volume growth in moist smokeless tobacco. the heated tobacco category also showed encouraging signs of smoker interest, though it remains in its early stages. the e-vapor category, however, which has been the biggest driver of smoker conversion over the last several years contracted in 2020 as it continues to undergo a transition period, pending fda market determinations. and in combustibles, cigarette volumes were a little changed from 2019 as the covid-19 pandemic alter smoker behaviors and purchasing patterns.
looking at the tobacco space in total, estimated equivalized volumes remained stable. in fact, over the last five years, we estimate that total tobacco volumes have only decreased by 1% on a compounded annual basis. while 2020 represented a pause in some industry trends away from combustible products, our plans to achieve our 10-year vision remains centered around building a deep understanding of evolving tobacco consumer preferences, meeting these preferences by expanding the awareness and availability of our noncombustible product portfolio and when authorized by the fda, engaging with smokers to educate them, on the benefits of switching to alternative products. let's now turn to our 2020 business results.
altria's full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 3.6%, driven by strong performance from our tobacco businesses. we also returned nearly $6.3 billion in cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. and our board increased the dividend for the 55th time in the past 51 years. our smokable product segment continues to be the engine that powers our 10-year vision.
generating significant cash that can be invested in noncombustible products and return to shareholders. this segment has demonstrated strong profit growth in a variety of marketplace conditions. over the last five years, smokeable segment adjusted oci has grown by 5.5% on a compounded annual basis, and its segment has delivered excellent financial performance across varied volume and market share dynamics. we continue to be pleased with the performance of our combustible businesses, and sal will provide more details on this segment in his remarks.
moving to our noncombustible offerings. we're pleased with the continued strength of usstc's most smokeless tobacco business and the encouraging results from our other noncombustible products. we believe our products and investments with the oral tobacco, e-vapor and heated tobacco categories present compelling options for the millions of u.s. smokers looking for alternatives to cigarettes.
in oral tobacco, we believe we have an unmatched portfolio of mst and all nicotine pouch products. copenhagen remains the leading oral tobacco brand and delivered strong volume and profit performance for the year. we're also excited about the potential for on! and believe it's a satisfying product for both smokers and dippers. helix made significant progress in its first full year of operations.
over the last 12 months, our talented regulatory affairs team assist the helix and falling pmtas for the on! portfolio, which we believe demonstrate that the products are appropriate for the protection of public health. our highly skilled engineers and machine operators supported helix in establishing a manufacturing footprint for on! in our richmond facility, and helix has reached annualized capacity for on! of 50 million cans. the team continues to install a machinery, and helix expects unconstrained manufacturing capacity for the u.s. market by midyear 2021.
and the helix brand management and agdc sales teams collaborated to steadily increase the retail distribution of on! during the year and executed innovative trial generating promotions that demonstrated the ability for on! to gain traction with smokers and dippers. on! was sold in approximately 78,000 stores at the end of 2020, up nearly 40% from the third quarter and more than five times the store count from the end of 2019. in stores with distribution, on! achieved a retail share of 2.4 percentage points of the oral tobacco category in 2020, with significant growth coming into the second half of the year. helix has strong plans for the year ahead and is focused on removing capacity constraints, reaching its retail distribution targets, building brand equity and converting smokers.
we're confident in the on! proposition and believe its satisfying range of nicotine strengths and flavors and unique packaging position it well for success in the rapidly growing nicotine pouch space. moving to e-vapor. we estimate that total category volumes decreased by 10% for the full year. the category continues to undergo a transition period as fda prepares to make market determinations on the thousands of pmtas filed by the september 2020 statutory deadline.
we continue to believe that e-vapor products can play an important role in tobacco harm reduction and that sustainable e-vapor category will be one that consists solely of fda authorized products. we believe the category's long-term trajectory will be determined by regulatory decisions, legislative and tax policy and innovation that best addresses smoker and vapor preferences. in the heated tobacco category, pm usa continues to expand iqos and marlboro heatsticks responsibly and in a disciplined manner. pm usa's 2020 accomplishments included: launching in charlotte with a more disruptive retail fixture; expanding the retail distribution of heatsticks to approximately 1,000 total stores; introducing devices into select charlotte convenience stores; developing an array of new digital tools, including mobile video chat capability, which gives p.m.
usa's customer care experts, a virtual option to build connections and support age-verified smokers through their conversion journey and communicating with smokers using the fda-authorized reduced exposure claim about the benefits of switching from cigarettes. we're excited that the fda has authorized the iqos 3 device for sale in the u.s. the new device offers several enhancements compared to the current 2.4 version, including a longer battery life and a faster recharging time. pm usa expects to begin selling the new device shortly and it will be available across all existing retail channels in the atlanta, charlotte and richmond markets.
pm usa also recently introduced new packaging for heatsticks and has renamed the three currently authorized heatstick skus as amber, blue menthol and green menthol. the new packs feature a cleaner look, and pm usa believes the naming convention will facilitate heatstick line extensions in the future should additional variants be authorized by the fda. pm usa is focused on expanding the availability and awareness of iqos, achieving its contractual performance requirements and remains on track with its 2021 plans to expand iqos and heatsticks into four new metro markets and surrounding geographies. we believe that p.m.
usa has the right approach to maximize its store mover advantage while we're responsibly positioning the u.s. heated tobacco category for long-term growth and profitability. let's now turn to our financial outlook for 2021. our plans for the year ahead include accelerating investments in support of our 10-year vision, which we expect to fund through the financial strength of our tobacco businesses.
the external environment remains dynamic, however, and we're monitoring various factors, including unemployment rates, fiscal stimulus, tobacco consumer dynamics, including stay-at-home practices, disposable income, purchasing patterns and adoption of noncombustible products, regulatory and legislative developments, the timing and breadth of covid-19 vaccine deployment and expectations for adjusted earnings contributions from our alcohol assets. taking these factors into consideration, we expect to deliver 2021 full-year adjusted diluted eps in a range of $4.49 to $4.62. this range represents an adjusted diluted eps growth rate of 3% to 6% from a $4.36 base in 2020. our 2021 guidance incorporates planned investments to drive smoker conversion to noncombustible products, including continued marketplace investments to expand the availability and awareness of our noncombustible offerings, building an industry-leading consumer engagement system that enhances data collection and insights in support of conversion and increased noncombustible product research and development.
we expect our 2021 adjusted eps growth to come in the last three quarters of the year, primarily due to prior year comparisons, which includes one fewer smokable products shipping day in the first quarter. altria's tobacco businesses delivered excellent results over the past year, and i'd like to thank our employees for their hard work. their dedication drives their strong performance, and it's their passion and commitment that makes me excited for altria's future. i'll now turn it over to sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our financial performance.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
thanks, billy. let me begin by providing an update on u.s. tobacco consumers. economic conditions remain challenging for consumers in the fourth quarter as unemployment rates remain high and the enhanced benefits from the original pandemic assistance package were fully exhausted.
however, we believe consumers continue their stay-at-home practices in the fourth quarter, contributing to more tobacco usage occasions and higher tobacco discretionary spending. at retail, we estimate that the fourth quarter, the number of tobacco consumer trips to the store was slightly lower than prior levels. but tobacco expenditures per trip remained elevated versus the year ago period. turning now to our businesses.
the smokable products segment delivered excellent financial and marketplace results in 2020. the segment grew full-year adjusted oci by over 10% and expanded its adjusted oci margins by almost two percentage points. the smokeable segment also achieved robust net price realization of 6.7% for the year, with pm usa's revenue growth management framework continuing to enhance the segment's top line performance. smokeable segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined by 0.0, i'm sorry, 0.4% in 2020 versus the prior year.
when adjusted for trade inventories, calendar differences and other factors, we estimate that full-year segment cigarette volumes declined by 2%. at the industry level, we estimate that full-year domestic cigarette volumes were unchanged versus the prior year after adjusting for the same factors. looking ahead, we expect 2021 cigarette industry volume trends to be most influenced by smoker stay-at-home practices, unemployment rates, fiscal stimulus, cross-category movement, the timing and breadth of covid-19 vaccine deployment and consumer purchasing behavior following the vaccine. due to the uncertain timing and magnitude of each of these dynamics, we're not providing a cigarette industry outlook.
we believe the degree of cross-category movement will be influenced by several factors, including consumer perceptions of the relative risk of noncombustible products compared to cigarettes, fda determinations on pmta filings and legislative actions. we'll continue to monitor these factors and update you on the pandemic driven and underlying smoker behaviors that we observe in the category. turning to marketplace performance. marlboro's fourth quarter retail share was 43.3%, up 2/10 versus the prior year and unchanged sequentially.
marlboro continued to benefit in the fourth quarter from smoker preferences toward familiar products during disruptive times and continued lower promotional spending among competitive brands versus the first half of 2020. for the full year, marlboro's retail share declined 3/10 to 43%. marlboro's full-year share performance was impacted by the movement of older consumers coming back into cigarettes from e-vapor, which we observed at the beginning of 2020. this demographic has a greater tendency to purchase discount cigarettes than the category average, which increased discount segment share to start the year.
we continue to be pleased with marlboro's performance and believe its leading brand equity positions the brand well to deliver on its long-term profit potential. in discount, total segment retail share was 24.5% in the fourth quarter, unchanged versus the year ago period and up 2/10 sequentially. for the full year, discount segment retail share increased 3/10 to 24.5%, driven by the cross-category movement observed at the beginning of 2020 and growth in deep discount products. moving to cigars, middleton provided a strong contribution to the smokable segments financial results and continue to successfully navigate the regulatory environment.
reported cigar shipment volumes increased 9% for the year. and black & mild remain the leading tip cigar brand. middleton has also received market orders or exemptions from fda, covering over 97% of its volume. turning to noncombustibles.
we're very pleased with the performance of the oral tobacco products segment. segment adjusted oci increased 7.3% for the year. and it maintained its strong adjusted oci margin of 71.7 percentage points despite increased investments behind on!. reported oral tobacco segment volumes increased by 1.2% in 2020, driven by on! oral nicotine pouches.
in mst, copenhagen reported shipment volumes were unchanged versus the prior year. when adjusted for calendar differences, trade inventory movements and other factors, full year oral tobacco segment volumes increased by an estimated 1%. full-year 2020 retail share for the oral tobacco segment was 49.8%, down 2.7 percentage points due to the increased adoption of oral nicotine pouches. we remain pleased with the performance of copenhagen in the msc category, and we're excited about the growth potential of on! as we continue to expand capacity and distribution.
in alcohol, the pandemic negatively impacted the 2020 financial performance of both ste. michelle and our equity investment in abi. ste. michelle's full-year adjusted oci decreased approximately 30%, driven primarily by lower on-premise and direct-to-consumer sales, partially offset by higher pricing.
and in beer, we recorded $157 million of adjusted equity earnings in the fourth quarter, representing altria's share of abi's third quarter 2020 results, and a decrease of more than 19% from the same period last year. for the full year, we've recorded $540 million in adjusted equity earnings from abi, down over 36% from 2019. in our all other operating category, we recorded $172 million in adjusted losses for the year, more than half of which related to noncash reductions and the estimated residual value of certain assets at philip morris capital corporation. as of year-end 2020, the net finance assets balance for pmcc was $320 million.
we expect to continue reducing this balance in 2021 through rent and asset sales and fully -- and expect to fully complete the pmcc wind down by the end of 2022. moving to capital allocation. our balance sheet remains strong, and our tobacco businesses are highly cash generative. dividends remain our primary vehicle for returning cash to shareholders.
and our long-term objective is a dividend target payout ratio of approximately 80% of adjusted diluted earnings per share. we believe our dividend target payout ratio provide significant shareholder return while allowing for flexibility in our capital allocation. we perform rigorous analysis to determine the best use of excess cash, including evaluating options for reinvesting behind our 10-year vision, refinancing our long-term debt and repurchasing shares. yesterday, our board authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by june 30, 2022.
the new authorization reflects the significant value the board believes exists in our shares today. with that, we'll wrap up, and billy and i will be happy to take your questions. while the calls are being compiled, i'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-gaap reconciliations are available on altria.com. we've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items.
operator, do we have any questions?
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of nik modi of rbc.
nik modi -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yes. just two questions from my side. just if you guys can give us maybe a state of the union of what you're seeing from the excise tax front, that would be helpful. and then the broader question is just on marlboro.
i mean, very good share performance, which could be surprising given some of the stimulus was kind of was over. we didn't -- we had kind of an air pocket in terms of government stimulus. what really drove that? i mean, you spoke in your prepared comments about well recognized brands, but i'm just trying to get underneath that there's other drivers like price gap management or the marlboro rewards program and how that played a role in terms of kind of shifting the share trajectory because it's been losing share for a number of quarters now. thanks.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thanks for the questions, nik. we'll take them in the order. on the excise tax front, i would remind you that we had two state excise tax increases happened at the beginning of this year. certainly with the build that the states have racked up responding to covid, certainly it'd be a little bit more challenging excise tax environment.
we have a great government affairs team, as you know, nik, and they engage on both sides of the aisle across the states and really know how to engage on that. from that standpoint, though, i think right now, most governments are focused on how to get the covid-19 pandemic under control. and so there's a little bit of chatter across the states. but nothing to point out at this point.
but certainly, it will be a challenging environment as they look to pay the bills related to their response to covid-19. on marlboro, nik, i think what you saw was -- and sal highlighted in his comments. people were concerned at the beginning of the year. we tried to highlight for the analyst and investor community that what we saw was consumers moving back from e-vapor back into cigarettes and both premium brands and discount brands benefited from it, but because it tended to skew older adult smoker coming back, we know that they have a proclivity toward discount brands.
we didn't panic when that was taking place. we knew what -- we felt like we knew what was behind that. and i think you've just seen the strength of the mobile brand through time. certainly, there were some competitive premium brands that had some extra resources in the marketplace at the beginning of 2020.
we saw those lessen as we progress through 2020. and to your point, the programs we have in place and the marlboro brand team do an excellent job of engaging with the consumers and really building loyalty through time, whether you mentioned the rewards program but other programs as well. and i think that's the strength of the mobile brand, and we're excited about where it stands.
nik modi -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks, guys. i'll pass it on.
operator
your next question comes from the line of bonnie herzog of goldman sachs.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
so i guess my first question is on your eps guidance. i guess i'd be curious to hear, what does your guidance assume in terms of the tax increases that you just touched on? i mean i'm wondering, billy, if it does consider a potential federal excise tax increase maybe at the low end? and then i guess i'm a bit surprised you were unable to provide even a wide range for your cig volume expectations this year. i certainly understand there's a lot of uncertainty right now in our world. but you must have, i guess, some sense of the range of your sig volumes, again, given your eps guidance.
so maybe you could touch on that for us a bit, just at a high level, whether or not you expect cig volumes this year will possibly revert back to historical declines, maybe below historical declines given the tough comps and the potential for greater excise tax increases?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
bonnie, and we'll take those in turn as well. on the eps guidance, really, when you think about the eps guidance, and i know you're including kind of the cigarette volume in that, look, we run a range of scenarios around that. we really look at what do we -- our base expectations, we have a very strong forecasting group. they forecast across the various categories.
and then we run a range of scenarios around that, upside and downside. and we think about, ok, what do we feel confident about in providing a short range of eps guidance for the year. and that's where we landed. as far as cigarette volume, it wasn't the -- that we didn't have a forecast for volume.
we feel very good about the way we go about forecasting volume. but to your point, there are a lot of uncertainties and a lot of fluidness in the environment, whether that's the consumer and how they're engaged with some of these noncombustible categories as they continue to grow or to the things we've highlighted in our remarks, whether it's unemployment or the fiscal stimulus if the government passes that. so there are a range of factors there. what we think really focusing on the consumer, and that's what we try to do and are trying to do is really give more information about how we're focused on the consumer and want to win where they go.
and that's exactly why we implemented the portfolio strategy is really looking at the consumer is going to make different decisions, depending on where they're at in their journey and how do we really focus on the consumer and have the best products and best brands in each of those categories as they make decisions. don't get me wrong. this cigarette, as i said in my remarks, really fuels. it's the engine for fueling the 10-year vision.
but we think what you should hold us accountable to is our success in meeting the consumer where they're at regardless of what category they're in.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then speaking of your 10-year vision, i did want to just maybe ask you to help us with that and maybe update us on where you're out with it. i know it's in the beginning, but are there any guideposts you could share with us that you're expecting to see for your business, maybe even the next three to five years.
and i'm asking because, obviously, per your guidance and your comments, you're entering a period near-term here where you're stepping up spend to kind of accelerate this plan. so it would help us to understand maybe some targets, like for you to convert your business to the noncombustible products, as you mentioned, is it fair to assume 20%, 25%, for instance, in the next, i don't know, again, three, five or five-plus years? and then as you execute on that vision, are you also open to or considering future m&a to even accelerate this further? or should we just assume this will all be done organically? and then i do want to hear about how you're incentivizing your employees to execute. thanks.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
sure. look, i'll think of a reverse order. as far as the employees, they have such passion, but you're right, incentivizing them in the right direction certainly directs that passion. we've shared that 10-year vision that we have and how we expect to progress through time with our employee base.
they're passionate about it. they're excited to support that. and we think we have the right incentive program in place to warrant that excitement. as far as milestones, again, i won't go into a specific numerical value.
remember, from an overall objective, we're looking to balance strong growth -- eps growth for investors and the associated cash involved with that but, at the same time, making investments over the long-term to advance our noncombustible portfolio. and so what we're really trying to do is have that balance. and so we're certainly going to share with you, through time, how we're making progress, but it's really about the journey of the consumer. so if you think about really driving awareness of the consumer for new categories, incenting trial, ultimately purchase and then, at the final stage, conversion to these new categories.
that's the way we're thinking about the consumer journey. and we're really investing to get to as close to the consumer as we can because each consumer is going to be at a different point in that journey and make different decisions across the categories. and that's exactly the portfolio approach. and different actions are taken, whether they're regulatory actions, whether they're consumers really enjoying the category is being able to be agile enough to not starve any category that's growing and make the appropriate investments there.
so that's how we're thinking about the consumers' journey. and you'll see us share more through time of how we're progressing with those consumer journeys.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. thanks. just maybe quickly on the m&a. would you be open to that as -- and i guess i'm thinking about in the next years, if there's a way to just further accelerate that, whether you've developed it internally? or would you be open to looking outside?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yes. we'll keep our eyes open for everything, but we're extremely excited about the portfolio of products that we have currently. and it's really a focus on execution. and to your point, that's exactly why we talked about the investments in our product development, is making sure that we're staying abreast with the consumer and really keeping pace and meeting their needs and desires.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
al right. thank you. i'll get back in queue. appreciate it.

your next question comes from the line of vivien azer of cowen.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
so i wanted to also switch base on combustibles, please. so if we're looking at wholesale inventories for both you and the industry, they remain elevated at year-end relative to where you guys closed out each of the last two years. i appreciate that some of that probably is just safety stock because of covid. but how should we think about inventory levels as we head into 2021, please? thanks.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks for the question, vivien. i think you nailed it. i think it was as wholesalers and retailers are making decisions around where they stood with the covid-19 pandemic and what -- because in different parts across the u.s., the surges that are taking place and different state government decisions about shutdowns and the consumer mobility in the marketplace.
and so i think, certainly, there was a slight level of increase over what you've seen in previous years as they took those things into consideration. certainly, as we've always said, through time, those wholesale inventories tend to balance out. and so we'll see as we progress through the covid-19 pandemic and the vaccination rollout how wholesalers and retailers decide to what levels are appropriate for them.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
understood. thank you so much for that. and my follow-up question is on oral tobacco. so [inaudible] suggested industry volume growth in the quarter and the year.
i was wondering whether you could unpack that at all and provide some color on what -- how much of that growth came from modern oral so we could have a better sense of what's happening with underlying mst.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yes. i would say, look, both pieces of that category did grow during the year. but certainly, the vast majority was the onset of the novel oral products, whether it be on! or zyn or other products in that space. and so that's the vast majority, but both segments of that category did grow.
so we feel good about the offerings we have in brands in the traditional mst. and copenhagen continues to lead that category, and we feel great about its position.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
understood. thank you very much.
operator
your next question comes from the line of michael lavery of piper sandler.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
could you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing with iqos and what engagement is really proving the most effective, whether it's in the stores or digital or mail or anything else? and how does the iqos 3 launch impact any of your marketing approach?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yes. it's a great question, michael. look, we're very excited about what we've experienced in the first three lead markets. from a standpoint of the exact way to engage with the consumer, what's most important we found is the consumer education, that they understand what the iqos device delivers and the marlboro heatsticks, what flavor expectations they can have and then really how to use the device.
so from that standpoint, we're trying many things. because remember, we launched in densely populated areas. so you have one strategy there. but then as you move from those densely populated areas out, that's exactly why we were testing the device sales in convenience stores to really meet consumers where they are.
and as you get to more rural locations, really having an outlet to engage with the consumer. we actually use all of those measures that you mentioned, whether it's direct mail, whether it's retail stores, the devices in the convenience stores, whether it's corners in various places or whether it's the mobile units. and certainly, in charlotte, we have used the mobile units to a larger extent because what we found is as you meet a certain capacity, you can actually move those mobile devices -- mobile units from one location to another and really maximize the number of consumers you're engaging with. now certainly, in the covid world, we had some challenges there because there's a lot of engagement 101 with the consumer, but our team implemented digital tools.
we talked about the mobile chat capability that they installed. and so we're excited to continue to expand, and we'll have more to say on that.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. great. that's helpful. and then could you just give your latest thinking on cronos? and would you expect to take full control if federal law were to change?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yes. i'm not going to speak to taking control or any m&a activities. certainly, we think cronos as -- is positioning themselves well to take a role in the u.s. if it becomes federally legal.
i think it's important to step back and really state what we believe. we believe it should be legal at the federal level, but it's got to have the right regulatory framework. so if you think about that total framework, what it should address is it should address underage use. it should establish industry product standards, and that includes safety standards.
it really needs to be guided by the science so that from a standpoint of everything should be science driven. and it really should deal with the social justice issues that are involved in that space. and so we believe it should be federalized at legal level. we support that.
we're engaged with that, but it's got to have the right comprehensive framework surrounding it.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. great. thanks very much.

your next question comes from the line of chris growe of stifel.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
i just had a question for you, first of all, on -- you've had an elevated rate of price realization in the cigarette business, in particular. and as we enter the year, certainly as you lap increases that occurred in 2020 as well as presuming you take increases in 2021 beyond what you've done already, it would seem to provide the backdrop for an even stronger rate of profit growth. so i want to understand, without getting into numbers, i realize that's going to be hard to get into, but just understand the concept of the desire behind the higher level of pricing and what you can do with that? so is that -- is there a heavier rate of investment in the business? is this going to help fund more of your expansion of on! and the noncombustible sort of part of the 10-year vision. i'm just trying to understand the pricing strategy as it's evolving here.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yes. i appreciate the question. i'll be careful, chris, as you mentioned, not to get into the future pricing strategies. look, we recognize that pricing is an important part of the algorithm.
i would remind you that the strategy for the combustible segment, both cigarettes and cigars is to maximize profitability over the long-term while balancing investments in marlboro and the funding the growth of our noncombustible portfolio. so certainly, profitability in the traditional tobacco space is what we're using to invest in the future in these noncombustible product arena. and so certainly, we look at that from a standpoint of -- when you look at pricing, a couple of the factors that we think about pricing as we move forward is really, where are our consumers on an economic standpoint. what are they feeling? how do they feel? what are they thinking about? it's the strength of our brands, how do we think about our brands and the strength in the consumer's mind.
and then certainly, business performance and objectives factor into that. i think when you look at price realization over the past couple of years, i think it's important to remember that's not all list price. it also has the price efficiencies we've been able to garner from the advanced analytics that we put in place. and so with the amount of data that we get in and the advanced analytics that we've invested in, i think you're seeing the benefit in price realization of being more efficient, but just as effective, if not, more in the marketplace with the promotional spend that we have.
so it's a combination of both, and we are extremely excited about what our advanced analytics team has been able to accomplish.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. i had one other question. that's -- and i hope it's not too general, but this is the -- i'm just curious as i look at like the cross-category movement, which was a modest factor throughout 2020. is that more difficult to forecast in 2021? again, i hope that's not having it meaning that.
but i guess what i'm getting to is this a year where your categories such as modern oral or heated tobacco, especially as they grow and become larger, could have a larger effect on the cigarette category, as an example. so is this a year where you see the potential for that transition or acceleration in some of those categories that could further influence cigarette volumes in 2021? or is it just too soon for that?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yes. i don't think it's too soon for that, chris. i'm hesitant to try to get much more on cigarette volume guidance. i think you're exactly right, though.
the success of those categories and our success in them will certainly impact the cigarette category. it's in line with our vision. but when you step back, chris, that's exactly why we really went with this portfolio approach of products. it's about meeting the consumer where they're at.
each consumer is going to make different decisions. and that's that objective we have of balancing strong growth in the associated cash for our investors and investing in these categories. as we progress through the year and we see a consumer following of one of these categories, we want to make sure we're not starting it for investments. so it provides us the flexibility we need to -- we feel to make the right decisions as we progress through the year.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. thank you for your time today.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thank you, chris.

your next question comes from the line of owen bennett of jefferies.
owen bennett -- jefferies -- analyst
just a quick one for me on -- you note the increase in the r&d spend around noncombustibles. i'm assuming this obviously can't be around vapor given and the agreement with juul. so i was just wondering what this r&d centers on. is it your own heated product? is it advancements in modern oral? is it something else entirely? thank you.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yes. you're exactly right, owen. you're exactly right from an e-vapor standpoint. with the agreement we have in juul, we're not looking at product development in that space.
but it really is staying -- the key focus is on the consumer and staying where the consumer is going. and so it's across these categories that are growing is where we want to have product development, to make sure we're keeping pace with the consumers' needs and desires. and so i think any cpg having a strong product development is important. and that's why we think it's important for us to invest in that area.
owen bennett -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. and would that be, i mean, even kind of potentially looking at developing your own heated products? is that a possibility in the future?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yes. i'm not going to get into specifics. know that it's in the noncombustible space is where we're investing. and it's really about looking how the investor is, what they're desiring and what needs are unmet and developing against that.
and so that's about as far as i'm going to go today. i think as we make progress in that space and we feel excited about the progress we made thus far, we'll share more when it's appropriate.
owen bennett -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. thanks very much. appreciate it.
operator
your next question comes from the line of steve powers of deutsche bank.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
so billy, when you -- i guess when you step back and you sum up the elective investments that you seem to be prioritizing in '21, both toward the vision of a noncombustible future and the new product development but also just the enhanced analytics around consumer insights and revenue growth management, is there a related dimension, maybe even just relative to similar investments in prior years, whether you are -- whether we should be viewing '21 as a year of acceleration, investment acceleration on those fronts? or is it -- would you frame it more as a steady state glide path if you drew a line to the last few years?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yes. i hate to characterize it either way, steve. we feel like we've made the appropriate investments. certainly, it stepped up.
but i wouldn't say that we're just gliding along. we're going to move where the consumer moves. and so it's that keen focus on the consumer. it's about driving the portfolio that we have.
and so if you think about investments around on! and in the heated tobacco space with iqos and mobile heatsticks, it's about driving investments there, driving awareness, getting the distribution we desire at retail and having it in the consumers' consideration. when you go to the next category about this digital platform, it's really about thinking about how do you -- we make great strides in analytics, and i think you've seen the benefit in the performance of our businesses. now it's about those insights being really focused on the consumer and how do we get as close to the consumer and understand where each consumer is at on their journey to conversion for whatever category they're choosing and making sure that we're able to communicate and keep pace with them in that journey. and then the final one is as we've seen in all of these categories, continued development around the product space is extremely important to the consumer and investing there to make sure we're keeping pace with the consumer.
so that's how we're thinking about it. we're extremely excited about the portfolio we have. it's about getting it there to have it in the consumer consideration set, meeting them where they're at and communicating with them along the journey and then making sure that our products keep pace with the consumers' future wants and desires.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok. ok. if i could just maybe -- i think this is probably for sal. just a couple of cleanups.
just as i think about the 2020 cost base, clearly, there were some incremental covid related costs in that base and yet also some covid related savings. as you think about the move into '21, is there a way to net out those dynamics in your base case? and then also, any -- if there's any way, any advice you might have for us on the outside as to how we should think about the earnings impact as we go forward just as you continue to wind down the pmcc business, just how we should think about that flowing through the p&l?
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
sure, steve. as far as the cost base, in 2020, remember, we were lapping the cost reduction program that we implemented in 2019. and of course, cost management remains top of mind for us. when you think about 2021, we think we have the right structure for the business and the right size of the business.
it's really about reallocating our spending, right? so we're moving spending from the combustible business as we invest into the noncombustible business. and our employees do a terrific job of thinking about efficiencies on their infrastructure and their processes and how that frees up resources to reinvest in our 10-year vision and in our noncombustible platform. so the right-sized organization, we feel really good about it. we have terrific employees.
they've done a wonderful job of continuing to provide productivity during the pandemic. and so that's how i would think about 2021 costs. as far as pmcc, the folks at pmcc over the last many years have done a wonderful job of really unwinding that business. and it has been lumpy at times.
we're selling assets. when you think about '21 and '22, we've got the net finance assets at a low level. it's significantly lower than when we began to wind down that business. and really, it's about rents received and the sale of assets.
so there might be some lumpiness in there, but we feel good about the portfolio that remains and the ability to unwind the business. and we expect to be completely wound down in 2022.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok. thank you both. appreciate it.

your next question comes from gaurav jain of barclays.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
i have three questions. so first is on the eps guide for next year, which is 3% to 6%. and in that, there is some component of share repurchases, about 1% to 2%. so your pre-tax pbt, your pbt guidance for 2% to 5% growth.
so how are you incorporating the abi equity income in that? because that fell off quite a lot this year. and if i just look at consensus numbers, they asked for a very steep bounce back in abi net income. so could you just help us understand that?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yes. gaurav, i want to be careful not to get into the particular components. there is always puts and takes across the p&l. i think what's most important is, as i stated earlier, is this objective to have strong growth but then make appropriate investments in these -- or in our noncombustible portfolio.
and so as you think about as we progress through the year, if one area or another proposed well, well then that affords us as we're progressing through the year to make changes if necessary, but it also affords us the opportunity to invest in areas that we're seeing the consumer gravitate toward so that we're not starving any particular category for investments.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
sure. that's helpful. now second is on the price increases in the u.s. industry recently.
so your primary competitor is now pricing before you, and it doesn't seem you are following all the price increases in all the states. but does -- i mean, is there a risk that the pricing balance in the industry could deteriorate as you go forward?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yes, gaurav. to be quite honest, we really don't pay attention to who goes first, who goes second or what order. really, and i mentioned this earlier, that the major factors that go into our pricing considerations, nothing from a competitive standpoint. it's really about how our consumers are from their economic position.
what are they feeling? how are they positioned? and how do they feel about their future prospects? the next is the strength of our brands. how do we feel about our brands in the marketplace and in the consumer's mind. and then it is around business performance and objectives. those are the three factors we think about when we build our plan around pricing.
and that's what drives our pricing decisions.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
sure. that is very helpful. and my last question is just on this iqos packaging, which you shared on slide 15. so i don't see any of the mrtp risk messages that were authorized by the fda.
so would there be a new packaging, which will incorporate that? and is philip morris involved in the feed design? or is this under your sort of consideration that you could put whatever branding and packaging that you would like?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yes. certainly, we collaborate with pmi, but those decisions are ours. and so from that standpoint, we wanted to make sure we had the flexibility as we move forward. we will be communicating the mrtp with consumers, and we want to do it in the most effective way that has an impact on them.
and so we'll be rolling that out, and we've started that process in some of our markets. and what we saw in research is it does bear into the consumer's mind of deciding to engage with the concept of iqos and the marlboro heatsticks as well as their desire to stick with it. and so we're looking forward to bringing that mrtp, and we'll use the avenues that we think are most advantageous for us to get that message across to the consumer.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
ok. thanks a lot.
mac livingston -- vice president of investor relations
laurie, before we go to the next question, we're aware that we've had a technical issue on the webcast and just want to make sure that investors listening on the webcast are aware that we're going to work to get our transcript and the replay up very quickly following the call. so we appreciate your patience on that.

your next question comes from the line of robert rampton of ubs.
robert rampton -- ubs -- analyst
three questions from me. the first is, so looking at -- over the quarter, i mean, for the first time, it seems like the lowest effective price and the net packed price moved in opposite directions. curious to understand what drove this? does it mean you're broadening the marlboro price ladder? and if so, interested to hear why now?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yes. i think when you think about our pricing decisions, we -- as i mentioned earlier, the things that factor into our pricing decisions. and then -- and that price realization is really around the list price increases we take and the efficiencies garnered across our promotional spend. i think when you look at the rest of the pricing decisions, they're independent of us as manufacturers make those pricing decisions.
and then, of course, you have state excise taxes that get added to that and then how retailers themselves are competitive in the marketplace. so there are a lot of factors that go into that. and we feel good about where we're at.
robert rampton -- ubs -- analyst
ok. cool. the second question. so in your -- in the annex, you suggest that macro factors were a 4% tailwind to industry volumes for 2020, which you said was primarily driven by stay at home.
in the event stay at home ends, i'm just trying to get an understanding of how that evolves. does it go to minus 4% or 0? i mean, i'm not looking for a guide here. i'm just trying to better understand what you think the sensitivities are around the big uncertainties that you flagged, if you could -- anything you can share here. maybe the experience in given states would be very helpful.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
sure. and so really, what we think drove that was exactly what you mentioned, and we had highlighted, which was stay-at-home practices, which consumers themselves face less social friction. and also -- they also were benefiting from more discretionary income related to those stay-at-home practices. so less discretionary, whether it be movie tickets or going out to eat or even gas.
and so as we progress through the year, as we see consumers respond to how they -- their behavior is related to how comfortable they feel returning to some of those discretionary other items or even they decided to go fully back to work versus work remotely, it's something that we'll be monitoring. and whether the consumer decides to adapt their life a bit to those changes or whether they go back to, i'll call it, a completely normal state pre-covid, and so that's something that we'll be monitoring. but certainly, in our guidance, we ran a range of scenarios and feel comfortable that we have levers across the business to be able to respond to that, regardless of whether those scenarios occur.
robert rampton -- ubs -- analyst
ok. and then, sorry, my final question, just on heated tobacco. any chance you can give us an update on the tax reductions you've secured in terms of number of states and the magnitude?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yes. so our government affairs team has been able to secure that reduction in six states. and then, of course, there's a slight definition change in the state of virginia. so if you count that as a reduction, it would be seven states, but six that are part of, if you will, want to receive designation from the fda, a step down taxation.
robert rampton -- ubs -- analyst
and sorry, just a quick follow-up on that. is that -- because i understand there was a kind of tiering element there with some saying 25 to 50, depending on what type of mrtp you get. is that still a fair way of thinking about it?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
it is. it varies by state, but that is a fair way to think about it.
robert rampton -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you very much. appreciate you taking the time.
operator
your next question comes from the line of adam spielman of citi.
adam spielman -- citi -- analyst
just a handful of questions, really. so just to make sure i understand what you said, the first one is talking about slide 10 of the presentation. that's the one where you have -- it's about on! and the heading is building on! momentum. and i just want to make sure i've understood it.
i think the left-hand side is saying there are more stores where you sell on! on the right-hand side, it's saying within stores, you have a higher market share. so i should -- the question is, am i right to believe this is sort of double effect. so obviously you've got a high percentage in more stores, and therefore, it's a sort of multiplicative effect. and overall, it looks better than you ever two charts alone.
is that the right way of thinking about that slide?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
that is the right way of thinking about it, adam. what we show on the left side is cumulative distribution in stores. and then on the right side, what we're showing is the quarterly share in those stores with distribution. so yes.
adam spielman -- citi -- analyst
fine. and then on the slide -- i forget what number it is. there's a slide on the sort of extra pack you give that shows oral tobacco industry volume growth estimates. and in q4, it's 6% versus q3, it was 7%.
so it's grown and then shrunk again. and i was just wondering if there's any explanation about why it's slightly lower in q4.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yes. i think you'll see fluctuations through time, adam. nothing grows in a straight line, and so you're going to have distribution efforts that will accelerate that in periods of time. and then you'll have, as distribution levels out in some areas, you'll have fluctuations.
i think we try to provide this. but if you think of this more as a line through time is the better way to think about continued distribution and growth in oral. i think it shows the desire of the consumer to find a noncombustible product that satisfies them. and as they move to those, you're going to see, through time, growth in these categories.
adam spielman -- citi -- analyst
and fine. thank you. and just a final quick clarification question. i think sal said, i just want to make sure i've got this right, that although there is clearly an incremental investment in 2021 in noncombustibles, we should think about this mainly as a reallocation from expense that would have been spent on combustibles as, for example, some of the sales force transition across to spend more time.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
good morning, adam. i would -- let me clarify for you. we are increasing some of our investments in our noncombustible. some of that will be offset through reallocation, but i don't want you to take away from my comments that it's 100% funded by reallocation.
so it helps us be more efficient across the full p&l. but as we stated in our earlier remarks, we are increasing our investment to achieve our 10-year vision.
adam spielman -- citi -- analyst
ok. and if i could just -- that was very helpful. very clear. can i just come back to clarify an answer that i didn't really understand before.
i know you're not going to give me the precise number of dollars and cents. but is the -- if i think about the increments in investment in 2021, is that roughly the same as the increment of investment in 2020 in the noncombustible area? or is it more or less? in other words, is the investment accelerating or moving at the same speed? or are we moving to sort of a more steady state situation?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yes. adam, i will be hesitant to compare it. we think we're making the appropriate investments. and it goes back to really balancing strong growth for the investor and the related cash and the appropriate investments there.
and so we're going to make the appropriate investments. we're never going to starve a category for investment that we think we're making significant progress in. and so we're going to make the appropriate investments. i hesitate to say because the timing can be different during the year, and so one quarter compared to our previous quarter or vice versa.
but certainly, we feel good about the investments we've made.
adam spielman -- citi -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of priya ohri-gupta of barclays.
priya ohri-gupta -- barclays -- analyst
i was wondering if you could walk us through how we should think about your cash balance just given the elevated nature of it at year-end? you have a few sort of things that are earmarked for that use. so you have $1.5 billion of maturity coming up, the share repurchase program, increased investments behind the noncombustible side. so how should we think about each of those relative to the elevated cash balance and sort of that cash balance getting back to more normalized levels?
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
this is sal. i think you characterized it fairly. we do have an elevated cash balance, and we have had typically, billy and i have talked about throughout 2020 the desire to have an elevated cash balance as we manage through the pandemic. remember, last year, the board of directors receded the share buyback program, and we were very focused on it.
and i think you've articulated the uses of cash for this year. we're excited that the -- and really pleased that the board of directors authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by june 30, 2022. so we're excited about that. i think it's the appropriate level.
it reflects the value in our shares and enhances shareholder value, but we also maintain capital allocation flexibility. we remain committed to the 80% target payout ratio for our dividends against adjusted earnings per share. and when you think about our cash position, in a typical year after paying the dividend, making the necessary investments, capital investments in our business, we traditionally have about $1 billion in excess cash. and we will run through our capital allocation analysis to determine the best use of that cash.
priya ohri-gupta -- barclays -- analyst
that's helpful. and i guess if we think that about sort of refinancing versus using the cash to pay down your upcoming maturity, could you walk us through some of the considerations that go into that specific decision?
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
yes. and i don't want to get ahead of myself on how we think about debt refinancing or debt retirement. what i would tell you is that we take into a lot of factors, as many companies do, market conditions, best use of capitals to enhance shareholder value. so we have a very talented treasury team.
they work really hard on staying ahead of our debt maturities and thinking about capital allocation and the best use of our capital going forward.
priya ohri-gupta -- barclays -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. one final just follow-up for me. how do you think about share repurchases in an accelerated manner versus sort of at an ongoing rate over the course of sort of the next 18 months?
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
yes. i don't think it's helpful for me to share how quickly or the pace that we buy our shares back in a share repurchase program. i would tell you that we have communicated that it's an 18-month program, and we will buy our shares. and you're right.
it does depend on market conditions when it comes to the pace of share buyback. but i really don't think i should really provide much more detail than that.
priya ohri-gupta -- barclays -- analyst
thank you so much.

your next question comes from the line of jennifer maloney of the wall street journal.
jennifer maloney -- the wall street journal -- journalist
i wonder if you could talk about how you think consumer behavior may or may not change? i know that you've talked about different scenarios that you could envision, but a lot of consumer goods companies say that they expect there to be some permanent change in the way we behave moving forward even after the vaccine. people might continue to snack more or they'll work home part of the week. so what's your best guess as to how much of this change in consumer behavior is sticky and how much we go back to the way things were?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yes. it's a great question, jennifer. it is something that we're going to monitor, engage with our consumers on a regular basis to be able to assess that. when you think about our consumer, they tend to be a bit at the lower end of the economic status.
and so from that standpoint, they definitely need to be able to work. it depends on their trade of what they are participating in the workforce end of how readily available they can choose to be completely remote versus having to report in at times. so i think it's going to vary greatly. and it remains to be seen how much they adjust their lifestyle back to, i'll call it, normal pre-covid to now even past a covid pandemic, how much they adapt and change.
so i think it remains to be seen, and it's something that we'll be engaged with our consumers to be able to assess through time.
jennifer maloney -- the wall street journal -- journalist
if people are smoking more now and their discretionary spending goes down because they want to spend more at the movie theater, how much of a lever is the discretionary spending? and how much of a lever is the fact that they are now sort of accustomed to and dependent on a higher number of cigarettes per day and that might be difficult to cut back moving forward?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yes. i mean, i think you can go back to '15, 2015. and if you look at that, really, what we saw take place was that the precipitous drop in gas prices gave our consumers extra discretionary spend. so to be able to answer your discretionary spend, i would go back in time.
and so as we saw them adapt to that, certainly, they added occasions to their day. but then they adapted those occasions back out. i think it's important to remember, the underlying trend of prevalence, that trend is pretty steady. it hasn't changed.
so it really is extra tobacco usage occasions in their day. and it goes back to your first question is how do they adapt their lifestyle? how quickly do they return to other types of discretionary spend, depending on -- that would be dependent on how they think about their usage occasions in a day.
jennifer maloney -- the wall street journal -- journalist
all right. thanks very much.

operator
good day, and welcome to the altria group 2021 first-quarter earnings conference call. today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by altria's management and a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] representatives of the investment community and media on the call will be able to ask questions following the conclusion of the prepared remarks. i would now like to turn the call over to mac livingston, vice president of investor relations for altria client services.
please go ahead, sir.
mac livingston -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, stephanie. good morning, and thank you for joining us. this morning, billy gifford, altria's ceo; and sal mancuso, our cfo, will discuss altria's first-quarter business results. earlier today, we issued a press release providing our results.
the release, presentation, and quarterly metrics are all available on our website at altria.com. during our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2020. our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results. please review the forward-looking and cautionary statements section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.
future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of altria's board. altria reports its financial results in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis.
adjusted results exclude special items that affect comparisons with reported results. descriptions of these non-gaap financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release and on our website at altria.com. finally, all references in today's remarks to tobacco consumers or consumers within a specific tobacco category or segment, refer to existing adult tobacco consumers 21 years of age or older. with that, i'll turn the call over to billy. 
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thanks, mac. good morning, and thank you for joining us. we're off to a strong start to the year and believe our businesses are on track to deliver against their full-year plans. against a challenging comparison, our tobacco businesses performed well in the first quarter and we continue to make progress advancing our noncombustible product portfolio.
this morning, we announced another important milestone in the altria's journey to move beyond smoking. we now have full global ownership of on! oral nicotine pouches as we recently closed transactions to acquire the remaining 20% global interest. we are excited about the opportunity we have with on! to convert smokers and we have talented teams supporting the global plans for the brand. before discussing our first-quarter results in more detail, we would like to honor the memory of tom farrell, our late chairman of the board.
tom served 13 distinguished years on our board, offered valuable insights and guidance during his tenure, and was a true visionary. we will miss his leadership, contributions, and friendship. the board will appoint a new chair at its meeting following our annual shareholders meeting in may. let's now turn to our first-quarter results.
our first-quarter adjusted diluted eps declined 1.8%, primarily driven by unfavorable timing of interest expense and a higher adjusted income tax rate. in the smokeable products segment, we continue to execute our strategy of maximizing profitability in combustibles while appropriately balancing investments in marlboro, with funding the growth of noncombustible products. segment adjusted oci margins expanded and marlboro continued its retail share momentum from the back half of 2020. for volumes, reported smokeable segment domestic cigarette volume declined 12% in the first quarter, reflecting year-over-year trade inventory movements, one fewer shipping day and other factors.
when adjusted for these factors, cigarette volume declined by an estimated 3.5%. we believe that in the first quarter of 2020, wholesalers built inventories by approximately 900 million units, driven in part by covid-19 dynamics, compared with a depletion of approximately 300 million units in the first quarter of 2021. at the industry level, we estimate that first-quarter adjusted domestic cigarette volume declined 2%. looking at smoker retail dynamics, we estimated that total cigarette trips in the first quarter remained below pre-pandemic levels.
also, estimated expenditures per trip remained elevated when compared to pre-pandemic levels and were steady sequentially. we are continuing to monitor the impacts from external factors on tobacco consumer purchasing patterns and behavior. in march, the federal government passed a third stimulus package. an increasing number of people became vaccinated and consumability improved sharply.
we're keeping a close eye on the tobacco consumer and we will continue to provide our insights on the underlying factors as the year progresses. moving to our noncombustible products. we are pleased to now have full ownership of on! oral nicotine pouches globally. we completed transactions in december and april to acquire the remaining 20% of the global on! business for approximately $250 million.
when we made the initial 80% acquisition in 2019, the oral nicotine pouch category in the u.s. was rapidly growing off of a small base. subsequently, oral nicotine pouch growth has exceeded our original estimates. in the first quarter of 2021, we estimate that retail share for all nicotine pouches was approximately 13% of the total oral tobacco category, double its share in the year ago period.
we expect continued growth from the oral nicotine pouch products and estimate that category volume in the u.s. will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 25% over the next five years. since 2019, helix, supported by the enterprise, significantly increased on! manufacturing capacity, broadened retail distribution, grew tobacco consumer awareness, and followed pmtas for the entire product portfolio. helix achieved an annualized manufacturing capacity of 50 million cans by the end of last year, and as of the end of the first quarter, on! was sold in approximately 93,000 stores.
in the u.s. market, on!'s momentum continued. in the first quarter, on! share of the total oral tobacco category grew significantly to 1.7%. on a 12-month moving basis, in-store selling and providing point-of-sale data, on! retail share was 3.1%, an increase of seven-tenth from the 2020 full-year share.
going forward, we intend to report on! share of the total u.s. oral tobacco category as helix expects to be in stores covering 90% of the industry's oral tobacco volume by midyear. our primary focus continues to be on increasing on! growth in the u.s. internationally, we see potential to strengthen on! in the swedish market.
we also see longer-term prospects in europe to expand on! and gain consumer feedback on potential noncombustible products for the u.s. to explore these additional opportunities, we have expanded the international on! team. we believe on! presents a compelling noncombustible alternative for smokers and we look forward to supporting their conversion journey. moving to e-vapor.
we estimate that total category volume increased 24% versus the year ago period. as a reminder, in q1 2020, the fda restricted the sales of all flavored e-vapor products among pod systems with the exception of tobacco and menthol. sequentially, we estimate that the category volume increased 7% as competitive marketplace activity continued. as a result of these dynamics, juul's first-quarter retail share of the total e-vapor category decreased to 33%.
we continue to believe that a responsible e-vapor category, consisting solely of fda authorized products can play an important role in tobacco hard reduction. as for our juul investment, the ftc trial is now scheduled for june of this year and we remain committed to vigorously defending our investment. in heated tobacco, pm usa is continuing to expand iqos and marlboro heatsticks. beginning this month, heatsticks are available in retail stores statewide across georgia, virginia, north carolina, and south carolina.
marlboro heatsticks retail volume and share continued to grow in the first quarter. in atlanta stores with distribution, marlboro heatsticks retail share of the cigarette category was 1.1%, an increase of two-tenth sequentially and in charlotte, heatsticks retail share was 1%, an increase of three-tenth sequentially. last month, pm usa began selling the iqos 3 device, which offers a longer battery life and faster recharging, as compared to the 2.4 version. the new device is being offered through device and heatsticks bundles and through the lending program, which has been effective at generating trial and driving purchase.
we're encouraged to see that many consumers are upgrading their 2.4 devices, representing approximately 25% of all iqos 3 device sales in the first quarter. along with geographic expansion, pm usa is increasing the use of its digital platforms like marlboro.com and getiqos.com to engage with smokers and communicate the benefits of iqos, including the mrtp claim on the iqos 2.4 system. for marlboro.com, iqos content is now available nationwide. smokers can sign up to receive communications and be notified when iqos is available in their area.
pm usa is also using its marlboro's rewards program to drive iqos awareness and value delivery. smokers can earn marlboro rewards points by learning about iqos and can also redeem their points for discounts on the iqos device. in june, pm usa plans to open iqos boutique in the tysons corner mall, which is a center point for the highly populated northern virginia metro area outside of washington, d.c. as a reminder, pm usa plans to expand iqos into three additional metro markets throughout the year and to expand the availability of marlboro heatsticks to geographies covering approximately 25% of u.s.
cigarette volume by year end. we are making progress in driving awareness and availability of on! and iqos while investing in future innovative noncombustible products and we continue to acquire more tobacco consumer insights to inform our strategies to actively transition smokers to our noncombustible portfolio. our smokeable products segment continues to support our vision, generating significant cash that can be invested in noncombustible products and return to shareholders. turning to our financial outlook.
we reaffirm our 2021 guidance to deliver adjusted diluted eps in a range of $4.49 to $4.62. this range represents an adjusted diluted eps growth rate of 3% to 6% from a $4.36 base in 2020. the guidance includes continued investments to support the transition of adult smokers to a noncombustible future. we will continue to monitor various factors that could impact our guidance.
our employees continue to drive the success of our businesses. they've risen to the challenge together to deliver results and are supporting each other and their communities. over the past years, the challenges associated with the pandemic have been compounded by the continued social injustice and in equities that black and brown americans still face every day. and the asian american community is hurting as violent and hateful attacks on asians skyrocketed.
we condemn any form of hatred and discrimination against any person. through our asian, black, and brown employees, we will continue to stand with you and we stand for you. we recently released our report on supporting our people and communities, which details the many ways we're making progress, enhancing our culture and positively impacting our communities. it is part of a series of corporate responsibility progress reports that we are issuing this year, and it is available on altria.com.
i'll now turn it over to sal to provide more detail on our first-quarter results.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
thanks, billy. i echo your sentiments and to our employees, thank you for all you do. moving to our results. our tobacco businesses continue to perform well in the first quarter.
the smokeable products segment delivered over $2.3 billion in adjusted oci and expanded adjusted oci margins by 2.2 percentage points to 57.5%. pm usa's revenue growth management framework supported the segment's strong net price realization of 8% for the quarter. we continue to be pleased with marlboro's performance and category leadership. in the first quarter, marlboro's retail share was 43.1%, an increase of four-tenth versus prior year.
we believe that marlboro is continuing to benefit from smoker preferences for familiar products during disruptive times and is lapping the year ago comparison quarter where we observed the older consumers coming back to cigarettes from e-vapor. in the first quarter, marlboro's price gap to the lowest effective price cigarette increased to 37%, primarily driven by heavy competitive promotional activity in the branded discount segment. despite this activity, branded discount share declined by four-tenth in the first quarter as deep discount gained share. the total discount segment retail share was 25.3%, an increase of one-tenth versus the year ago period.
in cigars, black & mild continued its long-standing leadership in the profitable tipped cigar segment. middleton's reported cigar shipment volume increased over 11% in the first quarter. turning to noncombustibles. oral tobacco products segment, adjusted oci grew by 3.1%, and adjusted oci margins declined by 0.9 percentage points to 72.1%.
adjusted oci results were driven primarily by higher pricing, partially offset by higher investments behind on!. total reported oral tobacco products segment volume increased 0.6%, driven by on! when adjusted for trade inventory movements, calendar differences and other factors, segment volume increased by an estimated 0.5%. first-quarter retail share for the oral tobacco products segment was 48.1%, down 2.3 percentage points due to the continued growth of oral nicotine pouches. copenhagen continue to be the leading mst brand and on! gained traction in the oral nicotine pouches.
in alcohol, ste. michelle's first-quarter adjusted oci increased approximately 46% to $19 million, driven primarily by higher pricing and lower costs. and in beer, we recorded $190 million of adjusted equity earnings in the first quarter, which was unchanged from the year-ago period and represents altria's share of api fourth-quarter 2020 results. moving to our equity investment in cronos.
we recorded an adjusted loss of $27 million representing altria's share of cronos' fourth-quarter 2020 results. we continue to support our investment in cronos by advocating for a federally legal, regulated, and responsible u.s. cannabis market. we joined the recently launched coalition for cannabis policy, education, and regulation.
this coalition is comprised of members across diverse industries and public policy experts who plan to inform the development of comprehensive cannabis policy that prevents underage use, advance of science, creates quality and safety standards and addresses social inequity. and finally, on capital allocation, we paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchased approximately 6.9 million shares, totaling $325 million in the first quarter. we have approximately $1.7 billion remaining under the currently authorized $2 billion share buyback program, which we expect to complete by june 30, 2022. our balance sheet remains strong and as of the end of the first quarter, our debt-to-ebitda ratio was 2.5 times.
in the first quarter, we executed a series of transactions to take advantage of favorable market conditions to adjust our debt maturity profile and extend the weighted average maturity of our debt. we issued new long-term notes totaling $5.5 billion and repurchased over $5 billion in outstanding long-term notes. in may, we expect to retire $1.5 billion of notes coming due with available cash. with that, we'll wrap up and billy and i will be happy to take your questions.
while the calls are being compiled, i'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-gaap reconciliations are available on altria.com. we've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items. let's open the question-and-answer period. operator, do we have any questions?
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from pamela kaufman with morgan stanley.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
good morning. thanks for the question. i wanted to see if you could comment on what you're seeing with respect to smoker behavior as things begin to reopen? and how you're thinking about the industry volume performance throughout 2021? do you expect to see elevated consumption in cigarettes per day continue throughout this year?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. good morning, pamela. thanks for the question. you ask a good one because the market is very fluid, as we mentioned in our remarks.
i think when you look at the first quarter and we provided the 12-month moving decomp. you can see that we still have somewhat of a tailwind and we believe, as we believed at the end of last year, that is the consumer stay-at-home practices as they had nicotine occasions to their day. certainly, as we progress forward, we highlighted that we are seeing mobility for our consumers increase significantly, but then you also have the offsets. you have the government stimulus that just came out and we'll see how the consumer thinks about that as their mobility has increased and what other areas of discretionary spend they could use that stimulus toward.
so certainly, through the first quarter, we saw a continuance. even though it was a tough comp, a continuance of what we saw at the end of the last year. i think it remains to be seen what trends the consumer has picked up during the covid pandemic that will remain and what will revert back to and i'll use your phrase to pre-pandemic or normal levels that they had in place prior to the pandemic, but thanks for the question.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
sure. and also, obviously, regulation is top of mind for investors, given all of the headlines in recent weeks. can you discuss your view of the current regulatory backdrop? and what you might be anticipating from the fda? and then separately, your thoughts on the fet proposal from last week?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think when you think about the regulatory framework, the two topics that have been in the headlines, and look, we expect to have continued headline news in the tobacco industry as you have a new administration that tends to take place, but let's just take them in turn. if you think about menthol, the fda has been considering this for years. and when you step back from it and you really think about it, we have a common goal, which is to transition the adult cigarette consumer to a noncombustible future, where we disagree is prohibition just doesn't work.
it has unintended consequences and criminalizing menthol has significant consequences. we think a better approach is to have an established marketplace of fda authorized noncombustible products. we've only heard what you've heard. so certainly, whatever the fda announces, we'll review what the fda announces and we'll engage and continue to focus on the science and evidence of what would be a multiyear process.
i think when you think about lower nicotine in cigarettes, it's very similar. it's something they've been considering for years. we know they're running studies related to this. again, we don't believe prohibition works because it has so many unintended consequences.
the better approach is to have that established portfolio of fda authorized noncombustible products. in addition to that, we don't think it's practical or feasible from a standpoint of what's been suggested. and so when you look at overall the signs and evidence, and you can see the comments that we submitted to the fda as they were considering these previously. there are significant hurdles there from a science and evidence base that it has the impact that they have suggested.
from an fet standpoint, i think it remains to be seen. there hasn't been a lot of discussion. as you mentioned, it was a bit of a headline news last week. when you step back from the specifics, it's something that's been introduced before and it didn't get very far.
i think when you think about some of the statements that president biden has made about not wanting to raise taxes on individuals making less than $400,000 a year. excise tax increase runs counter to that. i'd just remind you, we have an excellent government affairs team, is ready to engage on all of these topics and our regulatory affairs team as well. so we're ready, but i would caution that we will see, we believe, continued headline news.

your next question is from vivien azer with cowen.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi, good morning.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning, vivien.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you very much for the more detailed outlook in terms of your growth expectations for the modern oral category. i was hoping to expand on that five-year cagr outlook and just understand what your underlying assumptions are in terms of cross-category engagement? and if you can offer any detail around how you're thinking about competitive reduced risk categories? thanks.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
sure. thanks for the question, vivien. i think when you think about modern oral, it's a very exciting category. we're extremely excited to now have 100% of the economics of on!, both in the u.s.
and on a global basis. when you think about the novel oral, i think it's very intuitive that it will interact with the adult dipper from the traditional mst. that consumer is used to putting things in their mouth. i think what has us so excited about on! is its engagement with the adult cigarette consumer.
and so as we do always, we run various scenarios, i think, certainly, you can see the adult dipper converting to it and it depends on how successful we are engaging with the adult cigarette consumer of how big that category can get through time. so we're extremely excited and we'll be very excited to get past the manufacturing capacity constraint which we expect to do by midyear. i think from a competitive standpoint, you can expect that in new categories as volume grows, the various manufacturers that are participating in the category are trying to capture consumers and have them choose their products and brands. certainly, through time, i think all companies are in it for profitability.
so there will be some competitive activities as volume grows and consumers are at play and then you would expect for a turn toward profitability.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
absolutely helpful. thanks. and while perhaps maybe the cigarette -- cost category cigarette movement is a little bit more nascent relative to dip. does the migration from cigarette smokers into the modern oral or novel oral category over-indexed to menthol smokers?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. i don't have those factors in front of me, vivien. i think when you think about it, certainly, we've seen and we're trying to have some of this available in previous presentations, it tends to have a higher than normal from the mst category interaction with the female cigarette consumers because they just don't appreciate putting tobacco in their mouth and so it certainly over-indexes to that a bit compared to mst. but from a standpoint of that interaction, i think right now, it's too early to tell, and it's very small when you try to diagnose who's coming over from the cigarette category.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
understood. if i could just squeeze one last one in. it's about the tax framing for the heatsticks in the united states. can you just walk us through like what mechanisms would be necessary for the heatsticks not to be taxed as a cigarette?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think the biggest one i would highlight, vivien, is the activity that our government affairs team has been able to secure now in seven states and with a different definition of heatsticks in the state of virginia, so a total of eight. and that is that a product that has a designation of mrtp coming out of the fda that they have authorized it to have that claim, has a step function down in excise taxes in seven states, and again, the different definition in the state of virginia. so i think that's going to be the best mechanism of any reduced risk product is those that have the designation of mrtp being authorized by the fda.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
perfect. thank you very much.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer

your next question comes from chris growe with stifel.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi, good morning.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning, chris.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
so billy, i heard your commentary before about the transition in the consumer and to reduce risk products, and as a backdrop for maybe perhaps, the underlying factors in regulation. i guess, what i'm curious by is if you think about the products that the fda has approved so far, there's reduced risk products, there's been two of them. and it feels like you need to have a larger stable of products and products that consumers are aware of before they could ever really implement significant regulation at the risk of creating unintended consequences. that's obviously my opinion, but i just thought i get your thoughts on that.
and i guess with that backdrop, does that influence or define the timetable the fda has to pursue this regulation? they've got a lot more to do it seems like on approving new products before they move forward with regulation.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
so we would agree with your opinion, chris, that that's the appropriate way to do it is, you remember, i call it, roughly half of the conventional cigarette consumers are looking for a noncombustible product that satisfies them and certainly something that would reduce risk through time. and so certainly focusing on having a robust portfolio of noncombustible products that are authorized by the fda and then eventually receive an mrtp, the cigarette consumers will move, they just need those products that satisfy them and meet their needs. and so certainly, to your point, prohibition tends to be fraught with unintended consequences that can take place based on prohibition.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yeah. ok. and then i had just one other question. i know your pricing over the last few months, as in last year, it's a little different from some of your competitors, especially in the premium side.
and i'm just curious, as you look at retail today, has there been any meaningful change in price gaps? i know we always look at it versus the lowest priced product in the market, but i'm talking even among the kind of the premium brands. have you seen any real deviation in the price gaps in those products, marlboro versus other products?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. nothing that to highlight, chris. we make our pricing decisions independent. i think when you look at price realization in the first quarter of 8%, that's pretty substantial, and as shown in the total results of the company, marlboro's rock-solid.
you mentioned the price gap to lowest. that was really driven by major manufacturer being very competitive in the branded discount category and we highlighted that it didn't seem to gain a lot of traction. so you always have a little movement through time and in various periods that you look at, but nothing that i would highlight that's substantial.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. thank you for your time today.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thank you.

your next question is from bonnie herzog with goldman sachs.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everyone.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning, bonnie.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning. i actually wanted to circle back on your oral tobacco business. just looking at the performance over the last several quarters and years, volume growth really has remained negative. so i guess, i'm trying to understand ultimately how incremental do you anticipate on! can be for you? i guess, i'm wondering why we haven't maybe seeing more of a lift on your total oral tobacco volume yet.
has this been more of a capacity constraint issue in the last few quarters? or has the cannibalization been greater maybe than you anticipated? so that would be helpful if we could just hear some color on that. and then because you purchase on! outright, how should we think about the potential global opportunity for that business? thanks.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks for the question, bonnie, and i'll try to take them in turn, but if i miss one, follow back up. i think when you think about the growth in the category, certainly, we had a competitor had a great head start on us. we've seen significant growth in the category.
we have been constrained from a capacity and manufacturing. and so we look to be past that at midyear and then we can have it in the stores we wanted to be in and engage with the consumer the way we would like to engage with the consumer. i think for the upside, from a total standpoint of growth, i think we're excited about on! because, not only is it engaging with the adult dipper, but as i mentioned, also engaging with the adult smoker. so the more successful we are with that, you can see the size of the consumer base that you're able to engage with.
i think your question related to international, it's important to remember that on! already had a presence internationally. so we highlighted in our remarks, we're going to certainly pay attention to where it's at in market, make sure that we have the right look and the right products in the marketplace, introduce products that are in the pipeline through time, and then look at what other opportunities we have. and we've increased the international team, supplementing what was already existing with some altria employees to get consumer insights both for the international market, but as well as, to get consumer insights for future products in the u.s.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and that's what i was thinking that could be a nice opportunity. i did want to ask also, if i could, on iqos and mrt and the marketing plan as it relates to that.
i think you touched on this a bit, but i just wanted to see if there's anything more you could share on really how your marketing or communicating with consumers given the fact that iqos does have the mrtp. i think you even mentioned last quarter that you started to do some of this in certain markets. so love to hear any feedback on that in terms of how consumers have responded? has it helped to drive trial or conversion in some of those markets? i think that would be helpful. thank you.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
sure. thanks for the question, bonnie. yeah, it's still a bit early, yet. but certainly, we're looking to engage with the consumer, both at retail through guided trials through the heatsticks at c-stores but just as importantly and that was part of our investments we highlighted at the beginning of the year is investing in what we would consider industry-leading consumer engagement system and really being able to engage with the consumer digitally so that we can connect with the consumer.
if you think about it, not only when they're in the store, but from a 360 view of when they want to be engaged with and that's what we're really on the path to do. i think from the standpoint of highlighting what the claim does is certainly in research, it was -- it showed that the consumer, once they understood the claim that was there is that they were more inclined to both engage with the product and understand it, as well as, try the products. so we'll have more to share as we move through the year.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. that definitely makes sense and would be great. i appreciate it. thank you.

i was hoping that we could just talk a little bit about your elevated cash balance and how we should think about that trending through the year given the various puts and takes, understanding that you've already identified an intent to repay that main maturity that you have coming up. but are there other sort of pieces that we should be mindful of as we look out and where do you expect to land that cash balance as we get into 2022? thank you.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
good morning, priya. this is sal, and thank you for the question. at the end of the first quarter, you did see an elevated cash balance. as i stated in my opening remarks and you talked -- you spoke to, we do plan on paying the debt coming due with cash available.
i'll also remind you of some rather large payments we have post the first quarter, which include our master settlement agreement payment, our quarterly taxes, our dividend. so that cash begins to get depleted in april and may as we make those payments. and of course, we still have our share buyback program in place.

good morning, gents. i hope you're well.

good morning, owen.
owen bennett -- jefferies -- analyst
so i wanted to follow-up on a comment by pmi at its recent results that it planned to submit a pmta for vapor in the u.s. at some point. and so to me, i mean, it does appear clear that we will be returning to a global competitive environment going forward. so i was just wondering, how does this make you think about the need to have full control of a vapor business in the u.s.
or indeed globally? and then linked to this, especially now you're expanding with modern oral globally, how are you thinking about the need for your own into tobacco product on a global basis?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks for the question, owen. and i'll be careful not to talk about anything from a merger or acquisition or anything in the future. i think the way we think about it is we are primarily u.s.-focused because we have all of our infrastructure, sales force, relationships with retailers and wholesalers are all primarily u.s.
focused. and so that will be our focus of getting those consumers in their conversion journey from combustible to noncombustible, that will be our primary focus. but the learnings that we have and you mentioned modern oral, the learnings that we have in the conversion journey that consumers take is very similar to the consumers around the world and so we certainly want to pay attention to that and participate that in that when it's appropriate. i think from a standpoint of the comments made by pmi, they're probably better directed to pmi.
but certainly, our primary focus is u.s., but we'll certainly seize on opportunities when appropriate around the globe.

your next question comes from gaurav jain with barclays.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
hi, good morning. thank you. so my question is on juul. so your investment in juul is now valued at about $1.5 billion and if you could just remind us that if the value falls below 10% which would be about $1.3 billion, you would be out of the noncompete clause with juul.
so how should one think of the valuation that you are now ascribing to juul?
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
thank you for the question. this is sal. first, let me just state, when we do our valuation analysis, that is independent of any agreement we have as it pertains to the juul ownership. you are correct that if the valuation were to drop below 10% of the original investment which is slightly below $1.3 billion.
we would have an option as it relates to our noncompete, but with that option comes some other minority investor rights we have. so it is not an automatic trigger, it is something that we, as a management team, would obviously have to analyze and discuss.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
sure. ok. thank you. my second question is on the oral tobacco market growth, where you are saying that for the next five years, the market will grow at 25% cagr.
if i look at just the six-month data that you shared, it seems to be progressively decelerating over the last nine months. so is there any seasonality in this business? or is it just becoming bigger and bigger, so a law of large numbers is applying? or how should i think of these deceleration in oral tobacco market growth?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think when you look at that, what you're seeing is, is you're exactly right, the larger the base gets certainly from a mathematic standpoint, the growth rate reduces. i would remind you, when we show oral tobacco, that's the total category, so that's mst and the novel oral pouches and so you've got a total look at that growth of the category over the last six months. so you're going to have some cannibalization of traditional moist smokeless tobacco as novel oral pouches grow.
but you're also correct, as i mentioned, just as the base gets larger on novel oral, the growth rate slows.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
sure. and if i could just squeeze in one last question. look, the 10-year vision is to responsibly lead the transition of adult smokers to a noncombustible future which requires a lot of regulatory support and regulators are right now planning menthol cigarette ban process again, which you would be opposing. but would you be more supportive of some of these initiatives if at the same time, our regulatory pathways created that helps you achieve your vision?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
certainly, we're looking for a regulatory pathway that helps us achieve the vision. you heard my earlier remarks on an outright prohibition, whether it'd be menthol or great reduction in nicotine in cigarettes. we believe having that portfolio of noncombustible that's authorized by the fda and then eventually through the mrtp process is a much better pathway because the consumer that uses conventional cigarette has already shown an inclination that they want to transition. and so we believe we can get there with the right products and with the insights we have on the consumer, certainly having a regulatory pathway that allows that to happen in the right order, makes perfect sense to us.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst

michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
just wanted to come back to iqos. you mentioned how with your digital capabilities and website, you've got the ability now for adult smokers to receive a notice when iqos is available in their area. we've seen online chats and things, comments, lots of people outside the current launch markets who've asked how to get them, so this makes a lot of sense. can you give us a sense of what response you've had so far and if and how much that might steer where you choose to expand in kind of next or in what order?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. it's a bit early, michael. certainly, we've announced the areas that we're expanding to, certainly across the four states and then northern virginia and then three additional metro markets which we haven't discussed what they are. and so certainly, it's going to be informed by the consumer and informed by where we believe we can get the heavy foot traffic.
just a reminder, we want to launch initially in a densely populated area and then grow from that once you have a foothold, grow from that across states. and so certainly, we're going to be influenced by the consumer and the insights we have on the consumers, both from them and what we've seen in the existing markets to inform where we go next.

ok. that's helpful and just one more on iqos. you mentioned that marlboro rewards can be redeemed for discounts on the iqos device. certainly, this seems like it could help build momentum and some trial, but certainly could risk a little bit more cannibalization.
how do you balance those two? you certainly have a lot of incremental momentum already in the markets, you've given some color on that. can you just give us some of the thinking here? is it as simple as getting a bigger push, even if it might mean a little bit of cannibalization? what's the right way to think about some of that strategy?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
certainly, michael, we always have incrementality in mind from a total profitability standpoint. but i think when you look at the vision, we know that our conventional cigarette consumers want to move and we want to now proactively look at moving them. certainly, incrementality and you know the various ways we go to market and we assess that for incrementality to see where we can really reach competitive to consumers, but we don't want to ignore our consumers either. we know they want to move and so we want to reach out when they're ready to move and have them stay in our portfolio of products.
and so that's the fine balance, but certainly at retail and the way we reach out to consumers, we assess where we can get incrementality to the greatest extent.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. that's great. thanks so much.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question is from adam spielman with citibank.
adam spielman -- citi -- analyst
thank you very much. so two questions. first of all, on iqos in atlanta. i think you said it went to, if i remember rightly, 1.1 market share in the stores where you distribute it.
but i'm interested to know how many stores that is in atlanta? thank you. that's the first question.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. adam, we go to select retail chains because we want to make sure that we get great execution, the right look and high-quality because we want to learn when we have that, what does it look like for consumer engagement. we haven't mentioned the specific number of stores in atlanta, but our goal, even when we expand to the state is have great execution across the state and have it where each consumer regardless of where they live, have access to the product, to drive awareness and availability and interest. and so we may not be in every store in a certain locale, but we want to make sure that the consumer in any locale has access to the product.
adam spielman -- citi -- analyst
and if i estimated that about in metro atlanta, iqos has included all stores around -- sorry, has around 30 bps of market share, would that be about right?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. we haven't done that, adam, to go through that, so i'm hesitant to say, oh, that's exactly the way to go about it. the way we look at it is we take the geography by zip code and then say, ok, based on that, think about how the -- what are the cigarette offtake and what is the iqos offtake for the total geography? and so i'm hesitant to try to estimate or give you assurance on your estimate.
operator
your next question comes from robert rampton with ubs.
robert rampton -- ubs -- analyst
good morning and thank you for taking my questions. first one is just on pricing. so it's running at record levels despite moderate tax increases and i'd also argue that volumes are being more robust than maybe people expect it toward the tail end of last year. now how do you think about the trade-off between, i guess, being more competitive on price versus taking that incremental margin and investing in your efforts to transition to reduced risk? that's the first question.
thank you.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks for the question, robert. i would take you back to the overall strategy we have for the category which is to maximize the profitability of combustibles through time while balancing appropriate investments back into marlboro and funding the growth initiatives as you mentioned. and so it is a balance and something that we look at.
but i would agree with you, i would say 8% in the first quarter from a price realization was a great result for the quarter.
robert rampton -- ubs -- analyst
great. and then, sorry, just a quick clarification on modern oral. are you saying the category, the nicotine pouch category doubled versus 1q '20 and that your share within that is now roughly 13%. is that the right way to understand your comment?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
no. so we were saying novel oral, the total category had a share. so the novel oral tobacco of the total oral space was 13%. so the total novel oral of the --
robert rampton -- ubs -- analyst
so that's twice --
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, does that make sense? of the total oral space.
robert rampton -- ubs -- analyst
perfect. very clear.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
ok.
robert rampton -- ubs -- analyst
and then just a follow-up on modern oral, specifically on pack-ins in, for example, marlboro. can you comment on their effectiveness? and then how much of that are you doing? and i guess the broader question is, why not put on pack-ins in every pack of marlboro?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. it's certainly something that we wanted to test and learn about, understand the engagement, understand the most efficient way to engage with consumers, that's just one avenue. we're looking at digital avenues and ways to engage with consumers that way. and so what you're doing with our investments is we're looking at what are the various ways that we can engage with the consumer and meet them when they're trying to make those decisions for their conversion and then support them on that conversion journey as they commence it.
and so that's just one avenue, but certainly, we'll test and learn there and understand what the engagement success is and the efficiency of getting that consumer to convert.
robert rampton -- ubs -- analyst
great. that's very clear. and if i may sneak in one more, apologies. just in terms of iqos, curious as to what in your mind drives the pace of the rollout? so right now, it looks like it's very tied to those tax breaks.
so i mean, i guess, at what point would we expect a big bang in terms of national launch or given getting tax breaks is a slow process, it'll be more incremental? how should we think about? thank you.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. the way we think about it is -- and it's just important to remind everyone, look, pmi has been on this pathway for a long time. they've been talking about it. certainly, you guys have been talking about it.
we have. it is brand-new to the u.s. consumer. so we want to make sure that we're doing it the right way, i would say, in a disciplined fashion versus your terminology a big bang and once we feel like we have it right, we have plans in place to continue the expansion.
certainly, we're going to be influenced by always being able to put our best foot forward. now having the iqos 3 device approved, having the mrtp claim on the 2.4 system gives us a much better indication and a much better engagement plan with the consumer, but we are learning along the way. i would say the charlotte launch was more successful based on the learnings we had in richmond and atlanta and so we're going to continue that disciplined approach. but i don't want you to think that we're trying to get these fet agreements with the state legislatures to influence how fast or how we think about the launch, that will not be an influence in how we proceed with the iqos launch.
robert rampton -- ubs -- analyst
great. that's very clear. thank you, both. thank you for the questions.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question is from jennifer maloney with the wall street journal.
jennifer maloney -- the wall street journal -- reporter
hi, good morning. so the fda just published their press release formally announcing that they intend to pursue a nationwide menthol ban. i wonder from your perspective, what impact would this have on cigarette consumption? how many people would quit cigarettes? how many would move to reduced risk products? how many would just like switch from, say, newport to marlboro, for example?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. it's a great question. and again, you caught me off guard because i've been having the phone calls, so i haven't had a chance to read it. i think it will depend on what the proposal is, how they think about that proposal through time and how they think about implementing it.
i would remind you that the science and evidence we see and based on the comments that we have provided previously, we don't see the science and evidence that would support that. we don't think prohibition works. it's fraught with unintended consequences, but this is exactly the reason why we pursued our portfolio approach that if there are any actions by the regulatory in any specific category, that put the consumer at play, we wanted to make sure we had the right products, right brands in each of the categories and have those products and brands in their consideration set as they are faced with different choices. but we'll certainly be engaged with the fda and continue to encourage them to focus on the science and evidence.
jennifer maloney -- the wall street journal -- reporter
do you think that if it were implemented, i know that's a big if and it wouldn't happen overnight, but would it accelerate the decline in u.s. cigarette volumes?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
i think that's a tough hypothetical to answer. we'll have to see how it's implemented, if it's implemented, and how they go about it and how the consumer considers that from a standpoint of what are the unintended consequences and access they have to menthol cigarettes outside of the legal system. and then, are they at play for other products to gain their satisfaction?
jennifer maloney -- the wall street journal -- reporter
over the past few years, the company has been trying to expand its presence in the menthol category, you know, noting in investor presentations that menthol represents kind of a growing share of cigarette -- u.s. cigarette sales. could you speak to the importance of the menthol category for altria and for the u.s. cigarette industry?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think when you think about it for altria, i would remind you that we're under indexed in share in the menthol category. we tend to be over indexed in non-menthol. and so from a total standpoint of the category, i would really direct you to the comments we provided to the fda of our concerns of an outright ban on menthol that we provided previously when they've been looking at them.
jennifer maloney -- the wall street journal -- reporter
uh, thanks very much.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question is from nik modi with rbc.
nik modi -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
so just wanted to follow-up on the menthol question. billy, maybe you could just remind us the process from here, right? just in terms of the steps that need to happen just so we can kind of square it and make sure we're thinking about it the right way?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. we believe it will be a multiyear process, nik. when you think about the administrative process. and again, you caught me a bit unaware is because i can't read what they have published and how they stated it.
so we'll certainly be reading that and diagnosing it, but there's a rule-making process that takes place. they have to come out with a proposed rule, if that's where they're at right now. they have to receive comments, they have to consider all of those comments, and then they have to go to final rule making. and so that's a pretty lengthy process that we will certainly be engaged in with the fda to share our point of view.
nik modi -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. and that was kind of my question, i guess, which is everything resets, right? because obviously, we've gone through this several times in the last 10 years. so i just want to make sure i'm thinking about that the right way that they have to go through the whole process again?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. i don't know what they announced. so i can't speak to the specifics, but the normal process that they would go through as a proposed rule, there would be comments, then there would be a final rule making. and so again, i can't speak to specifics based on not having read what they announced.
nik modi -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
right. thanks, billy.

operator
good day, and welcome to the altria group 2021 second earnings conference call. today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by altria's management and a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] representatives of the investment community and media on the call will be able to ask questions following the conclusion of the prepared remarks. i would now like to turn the call over to mac livingston, vice president of investor relations for altria client services.
please go ahead, sir.
mac livingston -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, christel. good morning, and thank you for joining us. this morning, billy gifford, altria's ceo; and sal mancuso, our cfo, will discuss altria's second-quarter and first-half business results. earlier today, we issued a press release providing our results.
the release, presentation and quarterly metrics are all available on our website at altria.com. during our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2020. our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results. please review the forward-looking and cautionary statements section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.
future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of altria's board. altria reports its financial results in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis.
adjusted results exclude special items that affect comparisons with reported results. descriptions of these non-gaap financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release and on our website at altria.com. finally, all references in today's remarks to tobacco consumers or consumers within a specific tobacco category or segment refer to existing adult tobacco consumers 21 years of age or older. with that, i'll turn the call over to billy. 
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thanks, mac. good morning and thank you for joining us. altria delivered outstanding results in the second quarter, thanks to the continued strength of our tobacco businesses and the hard work of our highly talented employees. our teams have continued their commitment to moving beyond smoking by deepening their understanding of tobacco consumer preferences, expanding the awareness and availability of our smoke-free product portfolio and amplifying our voice on harm reduction within the scientific and public health communities.
their passion in pursuit of our vision gives me even greater confidence that we can responsibly lead the transition of adult smokers to a smoke-free future. let's now turn to our business results. altria grew its second-quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of 12.8% to $1.23 primarily through the strength of our tobacco businesses. the smokeable products segment continued to deliver on its strategy of maximizing profitability in combustibles while appropriately balancing investments in marlboro with funding the growth of smoke-free products.
marlboro continued to lead the cigarette category while second-quarter adjusted operating company's income grew 11%. for the first half, the segment generated adjusted oci growth of 5.3%. in the oral tobacco products segment, copenhagen continued to lead the mst category and delivered strong profit performance. the oral tobacco products segment grew adjusted oci by 3.5% in the second quarter and by 3.3% for the first half as strength in mst more than offset investments in support of on! the oral nicotine pouch category continued to grow and helix remained focused on expanding capacity, broadening distribution and driving awareness and trial.
the team has successfully achieved unconstrained manufacturing capacity for the current u.s. market. and as the category grows, helix plans to further increase on capacity ahead of expected demand. additionally, helix and agdc broadened on! retail distribution to 105,000 retail stores, which represents approximately 80% of u.s.
oral tobacco volume and 70% of u.s. cigarette volume. in the second quarter, on! retail share of oral tobacco was 2 percentage points, up 0.03% sequentially. in a heightened competitive environment, we believe helix has made consistent progress against its 2021 goals, having achieved unconstrained manufacturing capacity, increased distribution and nearly doubling on retail share over the first half.
helix deploys a broad suite of marketing tools to continue to build on brand equity and transition smokers. at retail, helix uses disruptive point-of-sale and trial and awareness generating promotions. retail initiatives are complemented by one-to-one communications and digital marketing channels, which we believe provide a more immersive and educational on! experience. these communications are tailored based on consumer preferences and insights to better resonate with individual smokers and dippers.
turning to heated tobacco, pm usa expanded iqos and marlboro heatsticks to retail stores across georgia, virginia, north carolina and south carolina. this four-state expansion is helping pm usa garner key learnings about scaling new, innovative products. over two-thirds of u.s. cigarette volume is sold through the convenience store channel.
so we believe the ability to effectively educate smokers about the iqos system in c stores is critical to the long-term success of the product. although early, we're encouraged that nearly half of second-quarter iqos device sales came from convenience stores. this highlights the impact of our sales force and their strong relationships with key retail partners. in line with our strategy to build iqos in large metro markets, pm usa expanded iqos and marlboro heatsticks to northern virginia, its fourth metro market.
we believe our commercialization team continues to improve its execution as we move into new metro markets. in early northern virginia metro market results, device penetration as a percent of the smoker population has surpassed the performance of the atlanta and charlotte rollouts. we've discussed for some time the importance of bringing a strong commercialization package to smokers to help them on their journey. in the northern virginia market, we have deployed our full range of flexible marketing tools, such as kiosk, mobile units and experts.
we also opened an iqos boutique in the tysons corner mall, which is the center point for the area. we believe the favorable results in northern virginia reflect the strategic locations and enhanced execution within these marketing channels, the availability of the iqos 3 device and built up awareness from the richmond market. we previously stated the importance of responsibility and discipline in our iqos expansion approach. pm usa has been mindful of the pending international trade commission case, which may result in a ban on the importation of iqos and marlboro heatsticks into the united states.
due to this uncertainty, pm usa had delayed further expansion of iqos and marlboro heatsticks. each quarter, we make progress toward our vision. as we do so, we strengthen the capabilities that we believe are necessary to effectively transition smokers to our current and future innovative product portfolio. these capabilities include: a flexible manufacturing system, which allows us to quickly redeploy our highly skilled employees and existing footprint in support of smoke-free products; a robust consumer engagement system that includes enhanced data collection, a portfolio of a smoker engagement tools and our trade partner relationships; and strong regulatory capabilities, including the talent to develop compelling pmtas for smoke-free products; and the establishment of required post-market surveillance infrastructure.
tobacco harm reduction must be grounded in sound science, encouraged by reasonable regulation and executed responsibly. we believe it's critical to have transparent and constructive dialogue about the science and evidence supporting tobacco harm reduction with all stakeholders. so far this year, we published 10 articles and scientific journals, participated on four panels and presented 24 posters at scientific and policy conferences. unfortunately, not all stakeholders believe that industry participants should be part of these exchanges.
recently, a scientific organization decided to ban industry participation at its annual conference. we believe this is a mistake and that limiting the exchange of scientific research impedes tobacco harm reduction and hurt smokers looking for less harmful products. we will continue to advocate for open and inclusive dialogue among all stakeholders, which we believe is essential to addressing the significant public health opportunity in front of us. let's now turn to guidance.
with our strong financial performance in the first half, we've raised the lower end of our full-year 2021 adjusted diluted eps guidance to be in the range of $4.56 to $4.62. this range represents a growth rate of 4.5% to 6% from a $4.36 base in 2020. this updated guidance reflects continued confidence in our tobacco businesses, investment in smoke-free products and the expected impact of the recently announced agreement to sell our ste. michelle wine estates business.
i'll now turn it over to sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our results.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
thanks, billy. in the second quarter, the consumer behaviors we've observed over the past few quarters largely continued. although overall consumer mobility increased, workplace mobility appeared to be relatively unchanged, which we believe contributed to more tobacco usage occasions during the quarter as compared to prepandemic levels. additionally, disposable income remained elevated partially due to the residual effects of the third federal government stimulus package in march.
at retail, we estimate that compared to prepandemic levels, the number of tobacco consumer trips to the store continued to be depressed, but tobacco expenditures per trip remained elevated. we are keeping a close eye on tobacco consumer behaviors, and we will continue to provide our insights on the factors impacting those behaviors as the year progresses. moving to our businesses. the smokeable products segment expanded its adjusted oci margins by 0.6 percentage points to 58.4% for the second quarter and by 1.5 percentage points to 58% for the first half.
this performance was supported by pm usa's revenue growth management framework, which leverages advanced analytics to guide the strategic and efficient allocation of our promotional resources. as a result, pm usa achieved strong net price realization of 8.3% in the second quarter and 8.1% for the first half. smokeable segment reported domestic cigarette volumes increased by 1.4% in the second quarter. for the first half, reported domestic cigarette volumes declined by 5.3%.
when adjusted for calendar differences, trade inventory movements and other factors, second-quarter and first-half domestic cigarette volumes declined by an estimated 4.5% and 4%, respectively. at the industry level, we estimate that adjusted domestic cigarette volumes declined by 5% in the second quarter and by 4% in the first half. marlboro sustained a strong retail performance demonstrated in recent quarters and benefited from the overall strength of the premium segment in the second quarter. marlboro's second-quarter retail share of the total cigarette category was up one-tenth sequentially to 43.2% and up five-tenths versus the year-ago period.
in discount, total segment retail share in the second quarter increased one-tenth year over year but declined three-tenths sequentially to 25%. sequential share losses in both branded and deep discount products drove the contraction as consumers benefited from the federal government's third stimulus package and continued heightened promotional spending among competitive premium brands. we continue to observe some elevated promotional activity within the branded discount segment during the second quarter. and as a result, marlboro's price gap to the lowest effective price cigarette remained elevated at 37%.
in cigars, middleton continues to perform well and black & mild maintained its leadership position within the profitable tipped cigar segment. reported cigar shipment volume increased by 9.6% in the first half. turning to the oral tobacco products segment. segment adjusted oci margins decreased to 71.7% for the second quarter and to 71.9% for the first half.
we expect oral tobacco products margins to be impacted by increased investments behind on! and shifting mix between mst and oral nicotine pouches. we remain extremely pleased with the strong overall margins for the segment. total reported oral tobacco products segment volume increased by 1.8% and by 1.2% for the second quarter and first half, respectively. the segment's volume growth was driven by on!, which more than offset a moderate decline in mst volumes.
when adjusted for trade inventory movements and calendar differences, segment volume increased by an estimated 1% for the second quarter and 0.5% for the first half. oral tobacco products segment retail share for the second quarter declined 2.2 percentage points versus the prior year and three-tenths sequentially to 47.8% due to the continued growth of the oral nicotine pouch category. as billy stated, copenhagen maintained its leadership position in the mst category. and we continue to work diligently to execute our plans to transition smokers to on! in e-vapor, total estimated volumes in the second quarter increased 15% versus a year ago and 2% sequentially as a result of heightened competitive activity.
the category continues to undergo a transition period as fda prepares to make market determinations on the millions of pmtas filed by the september 2020 statutory deadline. we continue to believe that e-vapor products can play an important role in tobacco harm reduction and that a sustainable e-vapor category will be one that consists solely of fda-authorized products. we expect the category's long-term trajectory to be determined by regulatory decisions, legislative and tax policy and innovation that best addresses smoker and vapor preferences. in alcohol, we recorded $113 million of pre-tax adjusted equity earnings from abi in the second quarter.
this was an increase of approximately 15% from the year-ago period and represents altria's share of abi's first-quarter 2021 results. in wine, ste. michelle's second-quarter adjusted oci increased approximately 80% to $27 million. ste.
michelle's adjusted oci growth was primarily due to higher volumes, including from the flagship chateau ste. michelle brand and luxury brand stag's leap, as wine consumer preferences trended to more premium products. three weeks ago, we announced the definitive agreement to sell our ste. michelle wine estates business in an all-cash transaction for a purchase price of approximately $1.2 billion and the assumption of certain ste.
michelle liabilities. we expect the transaction to close in the second half of this year, and we expect to use the net proceeds for additional share repurchases, subject to approval by our board. we believe this transaction demonstrates altria's continued commitment to value creation for shareholders and to our vision as it allows our management team to maintain its focus on responsibly transitioning adult smokers to a smoke-free future. ste.
michelle and its talented employees have built an outstanding portfolio of premium wine brands, and we wish them future success. and in our all other operating category, we continue to make progress on our wind-down of philip morris capital corporation. as of june 30, the net finance assets balance was $261 million, down $59 million since the end of last year due to rents received and asset sales in the first and second quarters. we expect to continue reducing this balance in 2021 and expect to complete the pmcc wind-down by the end of 2022.
turning to our equity investment in cronos. we recorded a pre-tax loss of $21 million, representing altria's share of cronos' first-quarter results. in the second quarter, cronos announced that it had purchased an option to acquire an ownership stake in pharmacann of approximately 10.5% on a fully diluted basis. pharmacann is one of the largest vertically integrated cannabis companies in the united states.
the option exercise will be based upon various factors, including the status of u.s. federal cannabis legalization and regulatory approvals. in our -- in support of our investment in cronos, we continue to advocate for a federally legal, regulated and responsible u.s. cannabis market.
and we're encouraged by the current momentum toward federal legalization. next, let's discuss capital allocation. the highly cash-generative nature of our tobacco businesses continues -- contributes to our strong balance sheet. we believe this, in turn, allows us to invest in our vision while rewarding shareholders with cash returns.
we were active in the capital markets during the second quarter as we repaid $1.5 billion of notes upon maturity, paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchased 6.6 million shares totaling $325 million. we have $1.35 billion remaining under the current authorized $2 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by june 30, 2022. because the current program is limited to $2 billion, additional share buybacks in connection with the sale of ste. michelle are subject to board approval.
moving to corporate responsibility. we disclosed several updates in the esg section of our release this morning. these updates included following through on our commitment to transparency around altria's workforce data and publishing our esg data tables and a report on value chain responsibility. as a reminder, additional corporate responsibility information can be found on altria.com.
with that, we'll wrap up, and billy and i will be happy to take your questions. while the calls are being compiled, i'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-gaap reconciliations are available on altria.com. we've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items. let's open the question-and-answer period.
operator, do we have any questions?
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we will take questions from the investment community first. our first question comes from the line of pamela kaufman with morgan stanley.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. good morning. 
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning, pamela. 
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
so i wanted to ask about your plans to delay iqos expansion in the u.s. until you have more clarity from the itc. i guess what are -- it's understandable that you would delay expanding it once you -- until you have more visibility. but i guess i wanted to understand what your plans are in existing markets because it seems like you're still operating as usual there.
and then can you give more detail on what your options will be if there's ultimately an adverse decision from the itc?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks for the question, pamela. yeah, i want you to interpret the delay correctly. so the expansion markets that we are in.
so the four states, the existing markets, including northern virginia, we're staying in, and we'll complete the state expansions. it was just beyond that where we had previously announced by the end of the year, we'd be in geographies representing 25% of cigarette volume. we wanted to let you guys know and our investors know that we're delaying that until we get some certainty around that. as far as plans if it should ultimately go against us, and you know the process, i'm sure you're well aware of the process that we will step through related to the actual case.
but we're working closely with pmi on contingency plans. i think it's a bit too early to share the details of what those contingency plans are or could be. and so we'll share those when it's appropriate.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you. 
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thank you.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
and then i wanted to ask about how you're thinking about industry growth in the second half of the year and kind of discuss the puts and takes that might influence the category relative to the performance in the first half. and in relation to that, we're seeing an inflationary pricing environment with companies across the cpg space intending on raising prices. i guess what are the implications for cigarette volumes as you think about price elasticity relative to other categories? and separately, does that, in any way, influence the ability to raise cigarette prices when you see higher prices elsewhere?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. there was a lot in that question, pamela, so i'll try to dissect it and make sure i get all the pieces. i think when you think about -- and i refer to cigarette volume, i know you said industry volume, so i'm assuming that's what you're talking about. i mean i appreciate the fact that you recognize that we had a strong first half.
i think when you think about the puts and takes or the headwinds, tailwinds, and these could go either way. i think the major factors that we're going to be watching for impact to volume are really the stay-at-home practices of our consumer. do they decide that -- are they required by their employee to go back to the work site or do they still have stay-at-home practices? i think you've seen various news on unemployment rates and any associated stimulus. how does that play out for the remainder of the year? i think it's important to keep an eye across category movement.
we know that the fda has a lot of applications in front of them for pmtas. so we'll see what their decisions are and how they could impact it. but most importantly, it's the consumer purchasing behavior. as you know, we believe they're adding nicotine occasions to their day.
and so how do they think about that in this, whether it's a resurgent or vaccination rates or how the vaccine gets rolled out, how does that impact consumer purchasing behavior? your question related to pricing is -- and first, i'll talk about the input side. as far as -- we really haven't seen any material inflation impact the input side of our business. as far as decisions that we take into consideration when we make pricing decisions, it's really the economic health of our consumer. how are they feeling? right now, they still have elevated discretionary income.
it's the brand strength, and you can see marlboro's been performing extremely well, and we are very pleased with its -- the strength of that brand. and i think last and utmost is company objectives and how are we thinking about investing in our innovative product portfolios and expanding that. and we mentioned some of the investment areas earlier. so those are really the factors that go into our pricing decisions.

your next question comes from the line of bonnie herzog with goldman sachs.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you. good morning. 
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning, bonnie. 
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, billy. i actually wanted to circle back on the decision to delay the expansion of iqos and maybe come at it from a different angle. i guess, first, i assume your plan stepped up spending this year will also be lowered. if so, i guess i'm surprised you weren't able to take up the high end of your eps growth guidance range this year.
so could you maybe touch on that? and then finally, i'd like to understand how you think the delay in rolling out iqos might impact your ability to deliver and execute on your 10-year vision to accelerate the transition of smokers to a noncombustible future.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, bonnie. so let's deal with the guidance first. as we say all along, we run a range of scenarios when we established guidance at the beginning of the year. it's no different as we progress through the year, we run a range of scenarios.
so as far as any individual category, there are always puts and takes. and so that's all incorporated in our guidance. as far as the delay, i want -- just to be clear on the delay and your question about the 10-year vision. i think when you think about the 10-year vision, it's important to step back and remember it's 10 years out.
and so that's a long time. if you just take in -- where we are today and look back 10 years, whether you think about the industry or altria itself, there's been significant change in 10 years. and so we thought it prudent to finish the expansions we were in the midst of, but to delay those and knowing that we have 10 years, and we know the consumer wants to move and we want to have the products that they want to move to. and so certainly, there could be bumps in the road, but we think we have a great plan and feel confident about achieving our 10-year vision.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. that's helpful and all fair. but just thinking about what you just mentioned and thinking about the beginning of the year, there -- as we look forward this year, there was going to be a level of stepped-up spending to kind of pivot your business. and how do we reconcile that now? i mean i guess i'd just like to understand that.
should i assume that the planned spending has been pulled back this year as you've delayed the rollout of iqos? or are you still continuing to spend aggressively behind it, and just based [inaudible] markets? 
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
i -- sorry, bonnie, i didn't mean to cut you off. yeah. so when you think about it, i appreciate the fact that you are recognizing that we can be agile in our investments. we run a range of scenarios.
we're prepared for what takes place in any of our categories to be able to adjust and redeploy. and so we feel good about it. yeah, certainly, there was a level of investment in our base plan, but we run a range of scenarios around that base plan at the beginning of the year so that we're able to adjust. we have areas of the business we've mentioned previously that we were investing in.
and so we feel very good about the guidance we provided today and being able to bring up the bottom end of that guidance with more certainty.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. that makes sense. and then just wanted to clarify something else on iqos. i know you have this agreement, of course, with philip morris and you shared some of those details.
i think it was actually a year ago. so i'm curious, can you share with us if you've reached 50 bps of dollar share in any of the markets where iqos is sold, which was defined in the agreement with pm? and the reason i'm asking, because i think that was one of the areas that you needed to maintain or to get to, to maintain your exclusive distribution agreement for iqos.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yes, bonnie. the answer is yes. we believe we have achieved it related to the exclusivity. we've shared that data with pmi, and that's why you saw us moving to other expansion areas.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
perfect. and then final question, if i may, just on switching gears to oral tobacco. just any color you could share with us on your strategy with promos in your oral tobacco business. i'm asking as i look at your price realization, which has stepped down, i guess, a fair amount.
so i'm wondering how big of a concern this could be in terms of sustaining any future top-line growth for this business. in other words, i guess i'm wondering, are you finding that you need to promote more than anticipated to possibly drive any volume growth and/or trial? thanks.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. it's a great question, bonnie. i think when you think about our approach in novel oral, we have been behind a manufacturing capacity constraints and we've been somewhat limited. now that that's behind us and we'll keep it behind us as best we can, it allows us to turn our marketing and brand colleagues loose, and they can really be disruptive in the marketplace to disrupt the consumer as they're making their purchasing decisions.
they can fully engage with consumers with one-to-one in digital channels. and so we look forward to being able to turn them loose, which they are now, and have them disrupting the marketplace. i think whenever you think about a new category, you have to think about there is going to be competitive activity, and we've seen it in this space. and so you're going to want to dislodge those consumers.
but at some point in time, that typically settles down, even if you take it outside of tobacco. and so we feel very good about being able to achieve tobacco-like margins in the future. right now, we're focused on consumer engagement and making them aware of our on! product in the marketplace.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. thank you so much for that.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of vivien azer with cowen.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. good morning. 
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning, vivien. 
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
so just one last housekeeping item on iqos. sorry to belabor the issue, but can you give us a sense of the anticipated timing of any kind of decision from the itc, please?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. so when you think about the itc -- just to level set on where we're at in that process. so you think about that in may, we had the administrative law judge found in favor of the two of the plaintiff's patent challenges. and so they recommended that the administrative law judge recommended the importation for ban on the iqos system.
but you saw earlier this week that the itc accepted review of the alj findings and recommendations on certain issues, and that included the patent infringement claims and the scope of remedies, and they will review the benefit to public health. and so it's a bit different with the itc. if you think about the factors around iqos, it's the only inhalable, smoke-free product authorized by the fda. and in authorizing iqos, the fda found that the product would benefit the public health.
and so we would expect to have a final itc decision in september or october. and then you remember the process after is it can be -- it goes to presidential review and that can take up to a period of 60 days after the itc decision is final. and then any decision from the itc can be appealed in the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit.
and so that will be the process that plays out depending on how things progress.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
that's really helpful. thank you for that. moving on to your smokeable segment. you called out heightened competitive activity as being a contributor to the expanding marlboro price gap.
seemingly, you should be fine with that given that marlboro gained year-over-year share. but how are you thinking about kind of the durability of that to the extent that you see heightened competitive activity persist given that you do have some incremental resources at your disposal with pared back investments on iqos? would you be willing to reinvest?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. we think of those decisions somewhat independently, vivien. but as far as your question specifically to smokeable and marlboro specifically, we're greatly pleased with the performance we've seen in marlboro over the last four to five quarters. and when you look at the price realization that was realized in the smokeable segment and then you look at the performance of marlboro in that segment, we're very pleased with where we're at.
and so it's something, to your point, we always monitor, but we feel good about how the strategy is playing out thus far.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
perfect. thanks very much.

your next question comes from the line of chris growe with stifel.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi. good morning. 
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning, chris.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
good morning. i just had a question for you, just a very quick one on inventory, and it was a positive this quarter. and i know you don't like to talk about kind of future inventory moves. but as you just -- if you could characterize where inventories are this quarter and any -- how that would -- you believe that that sets in relation to where inventories have been historically?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think it's a great question, chris. and when you look at where we're at the end of the second quarter and you look back through history, maybe it's slightly elevated for the second quarter, but it's certainly not elevated to positions we've seen wholesalers carry. it -- with the pandemic and the way it's evolved up and down, we've seen it bounce around a lot.
you'll remember through time, we typically see it level out. but certainly, the pandemic has had it bounce around a bit more than what is typical.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
and i missed it bouncing around -- during the pandemic, inventory rates have been higher overall. is that fair to say than where you would expect them to be?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
i would say maybe slightly higher. i wouldn't call it out as something significant, but maybe slightly higher. i think also, wholesalers in the beginning of the pandemic, as well as retailers maybe got caught short a bit on inventory because they were nervous about what the pandemic was going to do to them. i think they saw consumers, as sal mentioned in his remarks, making larger purchases.
so i think they're taking a position to have a bit more inventory just to meet consumer demand.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and i had a second question just thinking on what your thought there. it couldn't be any more questions on iqos. i had one more.
and that just was to understand, there were a couple of markets, especially the earlier markets like atlanta and i think you said north carolina, where sequential share was down a little bit. you talked about moving resources to northern virginia. i just want to understand that concept. meaning that in this early stage, i would expected -- have expected more overall dollars being committed and therefore, not just moving resources around.
but i want to understand kind of how you looked at that and then how you redeployed resources in northern virginia from some of those initial markets.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. i appreciate the question, chris. and let me take a couple of things that went into that consideration. i think first and foremost, you remember, we had flexible marketing tools at our disposal, whether you consider it kiosks or mobile units.
and so you move those from launch market to launch market. i think the other thing that's important to remember is we've always said we wanted to put our best commercialization foot forward. and as we got through to charlotte, remember when we first launched charlotte, we had the 2.4 device that did not have an mrtp authorization nor did we have authorization on 3.0. and so as you move into a market, you're going to put your best foot forward, we feel like that is the right package.
and i think you've seen the results from the learnings, as well as those -- both version three and the mrtp authorization in northern virginia. and so it doesn't mean we won't go back and relaunch in some of those markets with those added benefits to the consumer and consumer engagement, but we thought it was prudent to move that. and then the last note is as you move from densely populated areas to a fully expanded across the state, you evolve your commercialization practice. and we know to launch across the total u.s., we're going to have to have that c-store experience.
and so it's perfecting that. and we feel good about -- as you saw in the -- you heard in the remarks, the amount of device sales that we had through the c-store channel. if you step back and just look in the second quarter, volume -- consumer takeaway overall volume was up 40%. and so i would consider that a great achievement.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yeah. so really, in that regard, billy, the most recent market, at least in this case, where you stand today, is the best representation of your selling model and we don't need to necessarily look back at other markets because of this -- you're kind of changing as you move into these new markets. is that fair to say?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
i think that's fair to say. i don't know if i would characterize it as -- certainly, we feel like that's the best commercialization package we've had to date. i think it's too early to read and to say, ok, this is exactly what we're going to do as we go forward. we're going to continue to get learnings and evolve.
but yes, the best commercialization package we've had to date is that we put in northern virginia.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and i did have one other quick follow-up, which is on! in oral tobacco. and just to think there -- at what point -- i think you've talked about before getting -- being -- having on! available in more stores that sell oral tobacco products being whether it's 90% or 100%. so should we expect that to just to kind of continue to kind of build through the second half of the year now that you're unconstrained on manufacturing capacity?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think right now, you can consider us focused on really disrupting the consumer and making them aware of the qualities of on! in the marketplace, engaging with them through the one on one in digital channels. we feel good about where we're at, but we always assess the amount of stores we're in, and you'll see adjustments through time.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. thanks so much for your time.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer

your next question comes from the line of gaurav jain with barclays.
gaurav jain -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
hi. good morning, billy. 
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning.
gaurav jain -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
hi. so i have a couple of questions. so one is on the cigarette industry volume decomposition -- the table which is in your quarterly metrics. so the additional cost category movement is only minus 0.3% over the last 12 months.
and we know that oral nicotine pouches have gained about 1 percentage point of share. and then based on the data you have on slide 23 of your presentation, it seems e-cigarettes have also gained 1 percentage point of share. so that would imply that the cross-category movement has like -- it has significantly reduced versus what we saw in 2018, 2019. is that a correct way of looking at this data?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. that is correct, gaurav. when you think about it, remember, in secular decline, to your point, about 1% was cross category. and then anything above that 1% outside of secular decline of that cross category is what we call out in that decomp.
and so you can see in the chart that as of 6/30/21, on a 12 months ended, it was 0.3% above that. and so that is really what is the impact to the cigarette industry from cross-category movement and it includes novel oral, it includes e-vapor. i think when you think about e-vapor, if i understand the gist of your question, really what's going to impact how e-vapor progresses in the u.s., and we believe it can play a significant role in harm reduction, is really three things. it's regulatory decisions.
and you'll recall, all of the products are with the fda for their review. it's the legislative and tax policy, how will excise taxes evolve in that space. and to sal's earlier remarks, innovation, how will companies think about innovating in the future and applying for authorization from the fda. so those will be the three major factors that play.
but yes, it is less than what we experienced in 2019.
gaurav jain -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
but then i guess that leads to the question that is it leading to additional consumption in nicotine and are there additional consumers coming in and where are these consumers coming from, which leads to a lot of other questions as well. so [inaudible]. 
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think when you look at the factors underneath, whether you think about total -- the total nicotine space, and you've seen us before volume equivalized and stacked that up, historically, if you look over the past five years, down about 1%. so that would say overall consumption is still coming down, not increasing. certainly, during the pandemic, and we've highlighted to you guys and investors is that we saw consumers add nicotine occasions to their day, which we believe was stay-at-home practices and some of those factors.
and so certainly, there has been some short-term nicotine occasions added to the day. but overall, total volume when you stack up nicotine on an equivalent volume basis has still been declining.
gaurav jain -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
sure. and if i could ask one quick follow-up on pricing. so your key competitor is clearly pricing quite aggressively right now, which is helping you and everybody else. and your pricing realization is also quite strong, not as much as your key competitor.
but i would have thought that you will be taking this benefit and investing more on the discount side of your business and stabilizing some of the volume share losses there. so could you just help us understand how you're thinking on the discount side of things?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. and i appreciate the question. i think when you step back and think about the strategy we deploy in that category, it's to maximize profitability through time while balancing investments in marlboro and funding the future growth categories. and so that's what guides us.
as far as competitive pricing and worries about what they took or who went first, those are not the factors. i really gave the factors earlier to pamela. it's economic health of our consumer, its brand strength and company objectives. and so that's the way we think about our pricing decisions in the marketplace.
competitive actions don't factor into that. i think when you think about our pricing and look, i would say eight point -- over 8% both in the quarter and for the first half is pretty nice based on the results we've seen across the entire company here. we're pleased with that. remember, we have two factors that come into our price realization.
one is list price, which you're referring to. the other is as we implement -- and some people refer to it as revenue growth management, it's how do we become more efficient with the retail promotional dollars we have in the marketplace. and so i think you see those two factors play into our price realization.
gaurav jain -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
well, thanks a lot, billy.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer

your next question comes from the line of michael lavery with piper sandler.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. good morning. 
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning, michael. 
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
so i actually still have an iqos question, too. can you just start by confirming for the itc decision, would that apply to the device only? and then related to that, if it does, is there any potential for production in the u.s.? or is that just really not -- is there not the ecosystem for that because it would be just an import ban, correct?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
that is correct. the itc deals with importation of products. and so you're correct in that assessment. as far as -- if you read the details around the administrative law judge's decision, they made decisions on both the device and heatsticks.
and so it would apply to both. as far as contingency plans, michael, as i stated earlier, it's a bit too early to get into the details of the contingency plans, and we'll be sure to come back to you as those are ready to be unveiled.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. sure. and just on the device sales in c-store, obviously, just a huge jump this quarter. can you just give a sense of some of the drivers there? because i know for the other two quarters, they were available at least on a limited basis or at least in some areas.
what's -- it's the kind of device you don't really impulse buy most likely and it's a high price point, at least in isolation. is there -- is it driven primarily by digital engagement that sends the consumer in? is it direct mail, paper mail? or how do you really see this boost taking shape?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. it's a great question, michael, and it's something that we are very proud about. i think it speaks to the strength of our agdc, our sales force and the relationships they build at retail. so when you think about it, it includes those other channels, one-to-one, digital, regular paper mail, it includes all of those.
our team is doing a great job of engaging with the adult smoker. but i think when you think about what agdc has been able to do is really look at our retailers think about how to display the product at retail. to your point, our consumers are more of a 10- to 15-second decision. how do you disrupt them at retail where they're making that purchase decision and really give them the guided trial.
for instance, they built relationships with retail clerks that were smokers previously and walked them through this transition from smoking cigarettes to using the heated tobacco product. and so i think when you think about that, now you have the retail clerk can speak from personal experience to smokers to also disrupt their purchasing decisions. and so it's really still about the guided trial. it is about engagement through those channels, but it's disrupting them right at the point of purchase.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. they're really interesting. thanks. and just one more on on! can you give a sense of usage rates? and specifically, what i'm curious about is how much a smoker who switches maintains a similar usage rate? does it go up or down? and i assume, obviously, there's people who completely switch and some dual usage and sort of a progression there.
but do you have a sense of some of the consumer dynamics around that?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
it's certainly something that we're monitoring and we're trying to monitor it as close as we can on an individual-by-individual basis. because to your point, people are at different places in their journey. and so i think it's too early to get into here is exactly the usage rate of somebody that comes from cigarette versus somebody that comes from dipping, but it's certainly something we're tracking and understanding because you've got to meet the consumer where they're at in their journey and help them to continue that transition over. and so again, i completely understand your question, but i think it's just too early to get into the details.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. great. thanks so much.

sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
i'm sorry, i missed the end of that question. could you repeat it? i apologize.
tiffany au -- barclays -- analyst
definitely, yes. given the recent movement in the rate backdrop, how are you guys thinking about opportunities to proactively address and refinance some of your maturities over the next two to three years?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think -- i was able to hear it. i think when you think about it, we're going to assess those market conditions. we're certainly not going to give guidance exactly what we're going to do with any maturities.
but we look at the market conditions when we see maturities. and sal would tell you that with our cash-generative businesses, it gives us flexibility when we have maturities upcoming based on what the market conditions are and how we would assess those.
tiffany au -- barclays -- analyst
thank you.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
yeah. i agree with billy and i would point out that we have taken a very balanced approach to capital allocation when you look at 2021, including we did execute an opportunistic liability management transaction earlier in the year that allowed us to extend maturities on low-interest debt while managing our maturity towers.

operator
good day, and welcome to the altria group 2021 third quarter earnings conference call. today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by altria's management and a question-and-answer session. representatives of the investment community and media on the call will be able to ask questions following the conclusion of the prepared remarks. i would now like to turn the call over to mac livingston, vice president of investor relations for altria client services.
please go ahead, sir.
mac livingston -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, katherine. good morning, and thank you for joining us. this morning, billy gifford, altria's ceo; and sal mancuso, our cfo, will discuss altria's third quarter and first nine months business results. earlier today, we issued a press release providing our results.
the release, presentation, quarterly metrics and our latest corporate responsibility reports are all available at altria.com. during our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2020. our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results. please review the forward-looking and cautionary statements section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.
future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of altria's board. altria reports its financial results in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis.
adjusted results exclude special items that affect comparisons with reported results. descriptions of these non-gaap financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release and on our website at altria.com. finally, all references in today's remarks to tobacco consumers or consumers within a specific tobacco category or segment refer to existing adult tobacco consumers 21 years of age or older. with that, i'll turn the call over to billy. 
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thanks, mac. good morning, and thank you for joining us. in the third quarter, altria continued to balance maximizing profitability from our core tobacco businesses with investing to realize a vision of responsibly leading the transition of adult smokers to a smoke-free future. our tobacco business has performed well against difficult year-over-year comparisons, and we are encouraged by the significant retail share growth from on! in the third quarter.
we also continue to reward shareholders with a strong and growing dividend and announced today the expansion of our share repurchase program to $3.5 billion. both altria and the tobacco industry are evolving and with transformation comes opportunity. it also brings uncertainty and adversity, including the recently international trade commission decision related to iqos. we knew our journey to a smoke-free future would not be easy, but our determined and talented employees have demonstrated they are up to the challenge.
the pursuit of our vision is not based on a single brand or product platform. our vision is built on our understanding of tobacco consumers, their capabilities as a leading tobacco company and a portfolio of smoke-free brands and product formats. we make progress through the performance of our current smoke-free portfolio and advancements in regulatory sciences, data analytics and a robust consumer engagement system. our tobacco businesses remain strong, and our vision keeps us focused and guides us forward.
let's now turn to our business results. altria grew its third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share, 2.5% despite a backdrop of challenging comparisons and unfavorable year-over-year trade inventory movement. for the first nine months of the year, adjusted eps grew 4.5%, primarily driven by the strong financial performance of our tobacco businesses and higher abi adjusted earnings. our smokeable products segment continues to generate significant cash and return -- return to shareholders in fuel or vision.
third quarter adjusted operating company's income decreased 2.2%, reflecting the impact of trade inventory swings, but grew 2.6% to $7.9 billion for the first nine months, while marlboro remained strong. the oral tobacco product segment continued to deliver robust profit margins, while copenhagen maintained its leadership position. in all nicotine pouches, we have accelerated investment behind helix and believe that the on! portfolio is well positioned in this fast-growing category. we're advancing the sophistication of our analytics across our companies.
the helix team uses this capability to evaluate the impact of promotional tools on tobacco consumers and understand what actions effectively drive trial, repeat purchase and adoption. on! retail share of oral tobacco increased a full share point sequentially, reaching 3 share points for the third quarter and nearly tripling since the end of last year. these strong results were driven by increased smoker trial and repeat purchase from existing on! consumers. we're excited by the performance of on! during the first nine months of the year and believe consumer insights, disruptive retail executions and consumer engagement will continue to fuel its growth.
last year, we submitted premarket tobacco applications to the fda for the entire on! portfolio. while the fda has made substantial progress in reviewing millions of pmtas they received, our applications for on! are still pending. a week ago, the fda authorized the marketing of four of our oral nicotine products, verve discs and verve chews in the flavors of green mint and blue mint and determined that the marketing of these products is appropriate for the protection of public health. this is the first flavored product authorization issued by the fda for newly deemed tobacco products.
while our verve products are not currently in market, we believe the learnings we gained from developing our verve submission were critical in filing compelling and timely submissions for on!, which we completed in only nine months after closing the on! transaction. we're also actively working on modified risk product applications for on!. we believe an mrtp would be an impactful point of differentiation for the brand and an important tool in educating and ultimately transitioning smokers to less harmful products. in e-vapor, we estimate that the total category volume increased 17% versus the year ago period and increased 2% sequentially as a result of continued elevated levels of competitive activity.
while we had hoped for clarity on the category's outlook as manufacturers receive pmta decisions, the future of e-vapor is still uncertain. for most of the leading e-vapor products, the applications are still pending, including those submitted by juul. moving forward, we expect e-vapor volume trends to be influenced by regulatory activity, which has the potential to impact the degree of cross-category movement. recently, the cdc published an update from their national youth tobacco survey.
while caution is warranted when comparing results year-over-year due to the impact of the pandemic on the surveys methodology, underage e-vapor use, including use of juul, shows continued signs of decline. we're encouraged by the progress, but more still needs to be done, and we remain committed to continuing our work to drive down underage use. turning to heated tobacco. the iqos team continued to refine its go-to-market approach for new and innovative products.
across the four states where iqos is available, total marlboro heatsticks volume continue to grow, with repeat purchase accounting for approximately 85% of sales. according to iqos consumers, our iqos experts program played a significant role in their repeat purchases. the program offers smokers personalized support and encouragement through consistent tailored engagements. in the northern virginia lead market device penetrations as a percent of the smoker population continue to exceed the performance of previous rollouts.
in the last four weeks of the third quarter, marlboro heatsticks achieved a cigarette category retail share of 1.8% in northern virginia stores with distributions. as we mentioned earlier, the international trade commission recently imposed an importation ban and issued season desist orders on iqos, marlboro heatsticks and infringing components. we're disappointed in this decision as iqos is the only inhalable tobacco product to have received fda authorization as a modified risk tobacco product. the itc's importation ban will make the product unavailable for all consumers have switched to iqos, reduce the options for over 20 million smokers looking for alternatives to cigarettes and ultimately is detrimental to public health.
we continue to believe the plaintiff's patents are invalid and that iqos does not infringe on those patents. the itc's decision is currently under 60-day review by the administration's u.s. trade representative. in the event that the administration does not reject the decision, we're preparing to comply with the order.
we've been focused on our contingency plans surrounding sales and distribution and have been in communication with pmi on their domestic manufacturing plans. we view the itc's decision as a frustrating obstacle, but we are not deterred from the work required to realize our vision. we remain committed to the heated tobacco category and believe it can play an important role in transitioning smokers to a smoke-free future. going forward, we expect to apply the knowledge and capabilities we gained from introducing and responsibly marketing a brand-new product category.
for example, we've learned how to blend behavioral science, data insights and consumer engagement to support smokers on their smoke-free journey, leverage mrtps to educate consumers on the benefits of reduced risk products and establish a robust post-market surveillance system as required to monitor fda-authorized products. i'm optimistic about the future for tobacco harm reduction in the u.s. we have an unprecedented opportunity to lead the way in shifting millions of smokers away from cigarettes if we follow the science and foster innovation with the support of reasonable regulation. let's turn to our financial outlook.
we're raising the lower end of our full year 2021 guidance and now expect to deliver adjusted diluted eps in a range of $4.58 to $4.62. this range represents a growth rate of 5% to 6% from a $4.36 base in 2020. i'd also like to welcome marj connelly and matt davis to our board of directors as announced this morning. they bring significant combined expertise in operations, business strategy, consumer insights, and public policy and will be tremendous assets as we pursue our vision.
i'll now turn it over to sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our results.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
thanks, billy. i'd like to begin by discussing the macroeconomic factors we believe influence the tobacco consumer. we believe rising gas prices, inflation and the conclusion of covid-19 relief programs led to a decrease in disposable income versus the previous quarter. in addition, increased consumer mobility offer consumers more options for their discretionary spending.
at retail, trends were unchanged sequentially. we estimate that compared to pre-pandemic levels, the number of tobacco consumer trips to the store continue to be depressed, but tobacco expenditures per trip remained elevated. we continue to monitor tobacco consumer behaviors and will provide our insights on the factors impacting those behaviors as we move forward. moving to our businesses.
the smokable products segment expanded its adjusted oci margins to 58%, an increase of 0.5 percentage point for the third quarter and more than 1 percentage point for the first nine months. this performance was supported by strong net price realization of 11.3% in the third quarter and 9.2% for the first nine months. smokeable segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined 12.9% in the third quarter and 8% in the first nine months. we believe reported volumes reflect an absolute wholesale inventory swing of 1.5 billion sticks as wholesalers build inventory in the third quarter of last year, but depleted inventories this quarter.
when adjusted for trade inventory movement, calendar differences and other factors, domestic cigarette volumes for the third quarter and first nine months declined by an estimated 7% and 5%, respectively. at the industry level, we estimate that adjusted domestic cigarette volumes declined by 6.5% in the third quarter and by 5% in the first nine months. marlboro remains strong and resilient despite a widening price gap in a dynamic macroeconomic environment. in the third quarter, marlboro retail share of the total cigarette category was unchanged, both sequentially and versus the year ago period at 43.2%.
and in discount, total segment retail share in the third quarter continued to fluctuate, increasing 0.3 percentage points sequentially to 25.3%. in cigars, we continue to believe black & mild is the most profitable brand in the large mass machine-made cigar category. reported cigar shipment volume increased by 2.7% in the first nine months of 2021. turning to the oral tobacco products segment.
adjusted oci and adjusted oci margins contracted for the third quarter and first nine months primarily due to increased spending behind on! and shifting mix between mst and oral nicotine pouches. we're pleased with the strong overall margins for the segment and continue to be excited about the opportunity for on! in the oral nicotine pouch category. total reported oral tobacco products segment volume decreased by 3.8% for the third quarter and by 0.5% for the first nine months. when adjusted for trade inventory movement in calendar differences, segment volume decreased by an estimated 2.5% for the third quarter and 0.5% for the first nine months.
oral tobacco products segment retail share for the third quarter was sequentially unchanged as strong share gains for on! offset declines in mst. the segment declined 2.2 percentage points versus the third quarter last year due to the continued growth of the oral nicotine pouch category. looking ahead, we're monitoring several factors as we move toward the end of this year and into the next. many industries are experiencing rising input costs and supply chain disruptions.
thanks to the foresight and hard work of our procurement team, we are successfully managing through these issues without significant impact to date. for altria, we foresee modest inflation in the year ahead. this could have some impact on the input costs and the inflation adjustment to our master settlement agreement payments. however, our tobacco businesses remain strong, and we are confident in our ability to manage through short-term economic challenges.
as a reminder, we contemplate an array of scenarios in our financial forecast and intend to incorporate these factors into our 2022 eps guidance, which we expect to provide in january. turning to our investment in abi. the five-year lockup on our restricted shares expired earlier this month. we've been an investor in the beer category since 1970 and our original investment of $230 million has served us extremely well over the past half century.
in fact, since 2003, our beer investment has served as a diverse income stream that contributed over $12 billion of adjusted equity earnings, contributed over $10 billion of cash from both dividends and 2016 merger proceeds and strengthened our balance sheet. we've performed rigorous analyses regarding the abi investment. first, as part of the preparation of our third quarter financial statements; and second, in anticipation of the expiration of the lockup. in preparing our third quarter financials, we assessed the latest outlook for abi's business under the applicable accounting guidance and recorded an impairment to the asset.
while we continue to believe abi's share price will recover, we now do not expect it to fully recover to its carrying value as soon as previously expected. as a result, we have written our investment in abi down to its september 30 market value of $11.2 billion. regarding our decisions around the lockup, we view our abi stake as a financial investment, and our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the investment for our shareholders. we consider several factors as we analyze the investment, including the strategic rationale of continuing as a long-term investor in the beer category.
abi's share price, which has declined by more than 30% since october 2019, due in large part to impacts of the covid pandemic. our expectations of abi's business, alternative uses of capital and tax considerations. we have determined that selling our abi investment at this time would not maximize long-term shareholder value. therefore, we continue to plan to maintain our abi investment.
we continue to have confidence in abi's long-term strategies, premium global brands, experienced management team and capability to successfully navigate near-term challenges. we will continue to monitor and evaluate market conditions and the analytical factors mentioned previously on a regular basis, consistent with our goal of maximizing the long-term value of this investment for our shareholders. we remain committed to creating long-term shareholder value through the pursuit of our vision and our significant capital returns, which we demonstrated in the third quarter by paying approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and raising the dividend for the 56th time in 52 years, selling ste. michelle wine estates and expanding our share repurchase program from $2 billion to $3.5 billion and repurchasing 6.7 million shares totaling $322 million.
we have approximately $2.5 billion remaining under the newly expanded $3.5 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by december 31, 2022. with that, we'll wrap up. and billy and i will be happy to take your questions. while the calls are being compiled, i'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-gaap reconciliations are available on altria.com.
we've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items. let's open the question-and-answer period. operator, do we have any questions?
",":
operator
[operator instructions] we will take questions from the investment community first. our first question comes from pamela kaufman with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. good morning. so i had a question on pricing. so pm usa net pricing growth was very strong this quarter.
can you discuss the levers that you're managing to drive net price realization? and how much of the growth in net pricing has been driven by your strategy around l&m versus how you're managing marlboro, and what you're doing differently from an rgm perspective?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks for the question, pamela. i think when you think about pricing, it's important to remember, our price realization is really two major components. the first component everybody is all aware of and talks about regularly, which are list price increases, and that's across our portfolios.
when you think about the other component, it's the -- and we've referred to it before as the investments we made around advanced analytics and the amount of data we get from retail. and with that advanced analytics, some companies refer to it as revenue growth management, but it's really taken the retail promotions we put in the marketplace for consumers and really making it more efficient and as effective or maybe at times more effective than without the revenue growth management. so that's allowing us to increase the price realization. i think that's what you experienced through the quarter and through the first nine months.
from a standpoint of l&m, look, we've increased our profitability on l&m. we have seeded some share there, but we're a premium-focused company. we like the results that we've experienced in l&m. and i think you see with the advanced analytics, marlboro has been rock solid for, call it, now five to six quarters.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. and as a follow-up, how are you thinking about the balance between generating price realization in light of some of the macro headwinds that you highlighted that might weigh on tobacco consumers? and it looks like--
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
i'm sorry, pamela.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
so just related to that, it looks like the discount segment experienced stronger share gains this quarter driven by the deep discount segment. so are you seeing any increasing propensity of down trading in the current environment?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think if you look at the slides we provided, i'll take the discount question first. you can see discount bounces around from time to time. it's still in the range where it has been for quite a while.
i think you see the propensity for consumers to still vastly value premium brands over discount brands. from a standpoint of how we think about pricing, and i'll be careful not to talk about future pricing. i mentioned before, there are several factors we think about. we think about the health of our brands, the demographics that are associated with our brands, are we being relevant across all adult cohorts.
and we think about the economic health of our consumers that is a factor that we factor in. and then we think about overall corporate objectives. and so we look to balance how we make decisions there. i think when you think about the overall strategy that we apply to the combustible segment, it's really about maximizing profitability over the long term, while making appropriate investments and balancing investments in marlboro with investments in the noncombustible portfolio.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
operator
we'll take our next question from vivien azer with cowen. your line is open.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
so in terms of the consumer, i think you guys rightly pointed out gas prices as a key consideration in terms of watching out for the health of your core tobacco consumer. i recognize we're possibly kind of early cycle in inflation in gas. but i'm curious, as you look at the various regions in the united states, obviously, very different gas price dynamics, anything to call out in terms of kind of the underlying initial response from consumers to higher gas prices?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
nothing there to call out. vivien, you're right. we actually look at it down to the state level and below that. and i would say nothing really to call out specifically different from what you're seeing on a national base.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. ok. that's helpful. moving to the oral tobacco segment.
i was wondering, if you could kind of unpack the components of the 430-basis point decline in ebit margin mix versus the higher level of promo in on!? and to follow up on that, given the current levels of profitability in that segment, but your focus on on!, do we think that this kind of 6% to 8% level is the right one? or should we expect a recovery to more normalized rates like we've seen over the last few years? thank you.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thank you, vivien. i think when you think about our strategy in oral tobacco, you can see what we're doing is we have great margins in traditional mst. we continue to lead in that category, and we're making great strides in the on!, in the novel oral space. and we're very pleased with what we saw with the results.
once we got past manufacturing capacity constraints, the progress we've been able to make with their sales force and the helix team. it's important to remember here, disrupting the consumer and introducing them to a new category that's growing extensively. and so we're not just investing in price promotion, we're investing in making it a premium and brand and really engaging with the consumer both digitally, as well as with equity images so that they understand the nature of the brand. so you're disrupting at retail and then you're reinforcing it with equity through time.
and so that's how we're approaching the oral tobacco category. we believe on! through time, we can achieve tobacco-like margins. but certainly, we're in the investment phase right now.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from owen bennett with jefferies. your line is open.
owen bennett -- jefferies -- analyst
first question is just coming back to the pricing. the dynamics with the growing deep discount segment and the price gaps with the bottom of the market. so it does appear right now that industry share of the deep discount is coming from discounts. but at the same time, with the aggressive pricing we've seen the price gap between the top and bottom of the market is now at 38%, and this has historically held constant at around 30%.
so we're seeing quite a sharp increase there. is there any risk if this continues to pick up than the premium segment also start to lose share i.e., i guess what i'm trying to get, is there a tipping point where you think that price gap becomes too sizable?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yes. it's something we certainly monitor, owen. thank you for the question. and it's something that we supply to you guys the overall national price gap, but we look at it back to vivien's question at a much lower level.
i think when you think about that price gap, i would point to the performance of marlboro through time. being able to achieve that price realization, and i mentioned advanced analytics before and what that team has been able to do in making the retail promotions we put in the marketplace effective and more efficient. and so you see the steadiness of marlboro through time. you see the price realization, what we were able to achieve through the first nine months.
but it's certainly something we monitor, but we feel good about the position that our tobacco business is in.
owen bennett -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. and then second question, just wanted to come back to the abi stake and some of the full process around that and specifically potentially creating more value from holding on to that versus potentially owning juul outright. so i mean, juul got the potential to be hyper growth, especially if it gets traction internationally. it's also a segment that's cannibalizing cigarettes, so incentive to own all the economics.
and then arguably as well, it can also boost your esg credentials. then on the flip side, you've got abi arguably at growth not cannibalizing your cigarettes and it was nothing for esg credentials. and then you've got potentially the corporate tax rate increasing soon. so tax charge on sale could increase.
so i was just thinking, given those dynamics, i mean, why do you think abi can potentially offer more long-term value to shareholders than owning juul outright good?
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
owen, this is sal. so there's a lot to unpack in that question. let me start by saying we -- as you know, we don't comment on hypothetical or speculation around m&a. so let me move on to the abi question, which you've touched on a lot of the analytical factors i talked about in my opening remarks.
at the center of the analysis, though, is really thinking about what's best for the shareholder over the long term. at this time, we believe holding the asset is what's best for the shareholder over the long term. as i said earlier, we'll continue to monitor the asset and perform the detailed analysis that we perform as we do with all capital allocation decisions, and we'll continue to do that moving forward.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think the only thing i would add, owen is you can think of it. you've been following us for quite a while. it's no different than the analysis we went through with sab. we look at the asset.
we look at the -- go through the analytics and does it make sense to hold the asset or reallocate that capital somewhere else. and so that's something now that the restriction has gone that we'll do on a regular basis, and we'll update you at the appropriate time.
operator
[operator instructions]. we'll go now to gaurav jain with barclays. your line is open.
gaurav jain -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
i have three questions. so the first one is on the questions which have been asked earlier on the marlboro's price premium versus lowest effective. so what i understand is that bat has repositioned lucky strike below pall mall and l&m used to compete against pall mall at the equivalent price. and now you do not actually have a brand which is competing against lucky strike, which is why we are seeing this 20%-plus volume declines on the l&m side of things.
so do you think you also need to reposition our brand to compete more effectively against lucky strike?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. gaurav, i would remind you how we think about the combustible category. and it's really about maximizing profitability over the long term, and then balancing investments in marlboro because we're premium focused with investments in the noncombustible portfolio that we have. and so that's how we -- the overall strategy for the combustible segment.
i would point to the performance of marlboro again of five to six quarters of rock steady performance and the price realization we've been able to achieve, both from list price, as well as the advanced analytics and applying that to the marketplace. and so we feel good about where we're positioned as far as other companies they can make decisions independent of us.
gaurav jain -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
sure. thank you. the second question i have is on component shortages. so we have heard it impacting a lot of industries.
so have you seen any shortages impacting the e-cigarette market, which could help the cigarette volumes in the next few quarters? and you also heard one of your competitors talk yesterday about shortages in some cigar components. so are you seeing any shortages in cigars as well?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. nothing to point out, gaurav, that would be material. we've had -- from a standpoint of our procurement team, they stay on top of this. they are able to work around whether it's storms or shortages or supply chains.
but we haven't experienced any shortages either from a labor standpoint or from a product input standpoint. so we're extremely pleased with what our procurement and our hourly workforce has been able to achieve through this process.
gaurav jain -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
sure. and the last question on the msa calculation, and you referenced that because of inflation next year, there could be a higher adjustment. so could you just remind us how that calculation works and how inflation plays a role in it?
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
sure, gaurav, good morning. this is sal. the msa does have an inflation factor associated with the calculation of the payments. it has a floor of 3%.
and anything above 3% impacts that cost. now it's a point-in-time calculation. so it's cpiu as of december 31 for the current year versus the prior year. we have had times where we've been above the 3%.
it's something we are used to managing, and we've managed in the past. i pointed it out only because it is a differential aspect of inflation for the tobacco business versus other cpg industries.
gaurav jain -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
ok. sure. thanks a lot, sal.
operator
we'll take our next question from jennifer maloney with wall street journal. your line is open.
jennifer maloney -- wall street journal -- analyst
i just wanted to talk about consumer behaviors. could you talk a little bit about why you're seeing a drop in industry cigarette volumes of 6.5%? is it because people are spending more on travel and gas? is it because they're out and about more and not spending as much time at home?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. it's a great question. i would point to the mobility of our consumer. and we talked about the extra nicotine occasions that we believe were added last year because of the stay-at-home practices.
they -- and so as they've increased their mobility and you point to both factors, they're out -- about more and they're using their discretionary income on other things. the only other thing i would highlight that you did not highlight is gas prices, and we know gas prices affect our consumers. but these are characteristics of the consumer. we know how to navigate through, and i think you've seen we've been successful in the past.
but those would be the major factors i would highlight.
jennifer maloney -- wall street journal -- analyst
and our e-cigarette sales a factor? are you seeing a continued downturn in e-cigarette sales is affecting, is that easing somewhat and hurting cigarette sales?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think if you refer to, we try to provide a decomposition of industry volume. and so we do it on a 12-month moving. and so as of the end of the third quarter on a 12-month moving, remember in secular decline, which is people smoking last or quitting smoking or moving to other categories, that's always contained about 1% of people leaving cigarettes for other categories.
and then if we see additional cross-category movement beyond that, we highlight that you can see that was a 0.2%. so you can think about 1.2% of consumers leaving cigarettes for whatever other category they choose.
jennifer maloney -- wall street journal -- analyst

please go ahead, sir.
mac livingston -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, leo. good morning and thank you for joining us. this morning, billy gifford, altria's ceo; and sal mancuso, our cfo, will discuss altria's fourth quarter and full year business results. earlier today, we issued a press release providing our results.
the release, presentation, quarterly metrics and our latest corporate responsibility reports are all available at altria.com. during our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2020. our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results. please review the forward-looking and cautionary statements section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.
future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of altria's board. altria reports its financial results in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis.
adjusted results exclude special items that affect comparisons with reported results. descriptions of these non-gaap financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release and on our website at altria.com. finally, all references in today's remarks to tobacco consumers or consumers within a specific tobacco category or segment refer to existing adult tobacco consumers 21 years of age or older. with that, i'll turn the call over to billy. 
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thanks, mac. good morning and thank you for joining us. altria delivered outstanding results in 2021 across our businesses, including strong financial performance, progress toward our vision and advancements in our esg efforts. this morning, we'll highlight our accomplishment in each of these areas.
first, altria grew its 2021 adjusted diluted earnings per share by 5.7% driven in part by the resiliency of our cigarette, cigar and moist smokeless tobacco businesses. additionally, we returned more than $8.1 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. this total represents the third largest single year cash return in altria's history and the largest annual return since 2002. we have continued to make progress toward our vision of responsibly leading the transition of adult smokers to a smoke-free future.
our teams took several steps forward in 2021, including accelerating the retail share growth of on! and further enhancing the capabilities to expand heated tobacco and other new u.s. tobacco products. advancing the science, research and development behind our smoke-free products, advocating for tobacco harm reduction by encouraging the fda and other stakeholders to address the widely held nicotine misperceptions in society and we made excellent strides in establishing a best-in-class consumer engagement system to support smoker transition to smoke-free products. our system leverages robust transactional data and our advanced analytic capabilities to engage with consumers at the point of purchase.
finally, some of our achievements across our responsibility focus areas,included publishing six corporate responsibility reports, summarizing our progress in critical areas, such as harm reduction and underage prevention and publishing our inaugural task force on climate-related financial disclosures report. we were recognized for the second consecutive year with a aa rating from cdp for climate and water stewardship. and we advanced our internal talent and cultural goals, embraced workplace flexibility and embedded inclusion and diversity considerations within our performance review process to hold our leaders accountable. we're excited to share more about our responsibility efforts and our consumer engagement system next month at cagny.
2021 was a dynamic year for the u.s. tobacco industry and total industry volumes were influenced by several factors, including pandemic-induced shifts in consumer purchasing behavior and tobacco usage occasions, a continued trend toward smoke-free alternatives and an evolving regulatory and legislative landscape. despite year-over-year volatility due to pandemic-related factors, total tobacco volume trends remained stable. in fact, we estimate that overall tobacco space volumes have decreased by 0.3% annualized for the past two years and by 0.8% over the last five years on a compounded annual basis.
diving deeper, total estimated equivalized volumes for smoke-free products in the u.s. grew to 3.8 billion equivalized units in 2021 and represented approximately 24% of the total tobacco space. we estimate the year-over-year increases in smoke-free volumes were driven by the e-vapor category, which result -- resumed its growth after a temporary pause in 2020 and on! nicotine pouches, which continue to grow rapidly from a small base. 2021 smoke-free volumes also benefited from the geographic expansion of iqos in the heated tobacco category, but we're pressured by modest declines in the mst category due to shifts in consumer purchasing behavior and movement to other smoke-free categories.
and in combustibles, volume declined to approximately 11.8 billion equivalized units driven by several factors, which sal will discuss later in his remarks. turning to our smoke-free product portfolio. we're excited by the exceptional performance of on! and on! nicotine pouches. on! retail share of oral tobacco increased by nearly a full share point sequentially, reaching 3.9 share points for the fourth quarter and nearly doubling its share over the past six months.
these strong results were primarily driven by an increase in multi can purchases. as of the end of the year, on! was available for sale in approximately 117,000 u.s. retail stores. the on! nicotine pouch category reached a total oral tobacco retail share of 17.9 percentage points in the fourth quarter, growing 7.4 share points year over year.
we're encouraged that on! represented more than one-third of this growth and the brand is proving to be a highly competitive product in the space. our premarket tobacco applications for the entire on! portfolio remained pending with the fda and we believe that the fda should determine that the marketing of these products is appropriate for the protection of public health. we are actively working on modified risk tobacco product applications for on! and expect to submit these applications to the fda by the end of this year. we believe an mrtp claim would be an impactful point of differentiation for the brand and an important tool in educating and ultimately transitioning smokers to less harmful products.
in heated tobacco, our teams made excellent progress with iqos in the northern virginia market, with marlboro heatsticks achieving a 1.9% retail share of the cigarette category in stores with distribution for the month of october. unfortunately, pm usa had to remove iqos from the market in november due to the international trade commission's importation ban and cease and desist orders. pmi is responsible for iqos manufacturing and we have been in contact regarding product availability. at the present time, we do not expect to have access to iqos devices or marlboro heatsticks in 2022.
however, we remain focused on returning iqos to the market as soon as possible. our teams are actively working on reentry plans and we expect to be ready to bring iqos back to u.s. consumers when available. our agreement with pmi contemplates disruptions, such as those caused by the itc orders and requires the parties to negotiate in good faith to amend the agreement appropriately.
in the second quarter of 2020, we disclosed two milestones in our iqos agreement with pmi necessary for pm usa to maintain its exclusive license and distribution rights for iqos in the u.s. and to earn the renewal option for an additional five-year term. the initial five-year term does not expire until april of 2024, but we believe that pm usa has already met these milestones based on the strong performance of iqos in the charlotte and northern virginia markets. pmi has communicated that it disagrees with our position.
we expect to continue discussing these matters with pmi. we firmly believe that heated tobacco products can play an important role in u.s. harm reduction and we are continuing our efforts to support the category's growth. we have gained significant knowledge from our iqos commercialization efforts, which we expect to use going forward.
our teams learned how to educate u.s. smokers on a brand-new tobacco category and how to effectively support their transition journey to smoke-free alternatives. we demonstrated improved performance in each successive market and gained valuable knowledge on leveraging mrtp claims to transition smokers. additionally, we have built a robust post-market surveillance system, all of which we believe will position us to successfully achieve our objective of moving beyond smoking.
moving to the e-vapor category. the 2021 monitoring the future study was recently released and the data showed positive improvements in underage usage trends. both underage use of nicotine vaping products and juul specifically show continued signs of decline. the latest data shows that juul underage usage is down by 70% from 2019, with total underage nicotine vaping down 27% over the same period.
we are encouraged by the progress, but more still needs to be done and we remain committed to continuing our work to reduce underage use of all tobacco products. turning to the regulatory environment. the fda is currently weighing several decisions that we believe will shape the future of harm reduction in the u.s. in the e-vapor category, the fda has issued marketing denial orders for many e-vapor pmtas, predominantly, applications for open systems and flavored e-liquids.
these denial orders have resulted in significant litigation across the country. in the meantime, pmtas for most leading e-vapor products, including juul, are still on an fda review. the fda granted its first e-vapor market order last year for the tobacco variant of a cigar-like product. the fda has not reached a final decision for that manufacturer's menthol variant, but did deny its submissions for its other flavored cartridges.
in oral tobacco, pmtas for the leading oral nicotine pouch products including on!, remain pending with the fda. last year, the fda granted the first market authorizations among innovative oral tobacco products for our verve discs and chews in the flavors of green mint and blue mint. these were also the first flavored product authorizations for newly deemed tobacco products. additionally, mrtp applications previously submitted for copenhagen snuff and competitive snus products remain in fda review.
finally, in combustibles, the fda has stated that they are on track to issue proposed product standards by april 2022 regarding menthol in cigarettes and characterizing flavors in cigars. as a reminder, the fda rule-making process for these and all potential product standards has multiple steps and provide several opportunities for stakeholders to provide input. there are formal requirements related to public notice and comment and steps requiring the office of management and budget to assess economic consequences at several points in the process. importantly, if the fda chooses to move forward with their final rules, they must address all comments received throughout the rule-making process.
of course, any final rule must take into account the potential for unintended consequences and would be subject to legal challenges. we plan to review the proposed rules in detail and intend to engage with the fda throughout the rule-making process on each of these issues. we remain optimistic about the future of harm reduction in the u.s. we believe we have an unprecedented opportunity to lead the way in shifting millions of smokers away from cigarettes, if we follow the science and foster innovation with the support of reasonable regulation.
we are encouraged that the fda has authorized a product in each of the three major smoke-free categories. going forward, this year, we expect the fda to carefully consider the scientific merits of each remaining application and we're hopeful for significant progress in product marketing and claim authorizations. i would like to end my commentary regarding 2021 with the message to altria's employees. thank you for your dedication, passion and creativity through a difficult period.
we experienced several challenges last year in both our professional and personal lives and i admire your resiliency and fortitude. you are a driving force in moving beyond smoking and we are very appreciative of your efforts and commitment. let's now move to our financial outlook for 2022. our plans for the year ahead include a continuation of our strategy to balance earnings growth and shareholder returns, with investments toward our vision.
for 2022, our planned investment areas include digital consumer engagement, smoke-free product research, development and regulatory preparations and marketplace activities in support of our smoke-free products. the external environment remains dynamic, however and we're monitoring various factors such as the economy, including the impact of increased inflation; the impact of current and potential future covid-19 variants and mitigation strategies; tobacco consumer dynamics, including tobacco usage occasions and available disposable income and regulatory and legislative developments. taking these factors into consideration, we expect to deliver 2022 full year adjusted diluted eps in a range of $4.79 to $4.93. this range represents an adjusted diluted eps growth rate of 4% to 7% from a $4.61 base in 2021.
we expect 2022 adjusted diluted eps growth to be weighted toward the second half of the year. our guidance includes anticipated inflationary increases in master settlement agreement expenses and direct materials expenses and our current expectation that we will not have access to the iqos system in 2022. i'll now turn it over to sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our results.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
thanks, billy. i'd like to begin with an update on consumer disposable income, mobility and retail store traffic. we believe rising gas prices, inflation and the reduction of covid-19 relief programs led to a decrease in disposable income on a sequential and year-over-year basis. in addition, increased consumer mobility versus the prior-year offered consumers more options for their discretionary spending and led to fewer tobacco usage occasions.
at retail, fourth quarter trends were unchanged sequentially. we estimate that compared to pre-pandemic levels, the number of tobacco consumer trips to the store continued to be depressed, but tobacco expenditures per trip remained elevated. moving to our businesses. the smokeable product segment delivered excellent financial performance once again.
our strategy for this segment continues to be maximizing profitability, while balancing investments in marlboro, with funding the growth of our smoke-free portfolio. we believe our teams are successfully executing this strategy and the segment has delivered strong profit growth and stable marlboro marketplace performance throughout the pandemic period. in the fourth quarter, the segment grew its adjusted oci by 4.9% and expanded its adjusted oci margins to 56.2%. the segment also reported strong net price realization of 8.8%.
fourth quarter smokeable segment reported domestic cigarette volumes decline by 5.9%. when adjusted for trade inventory movements and other factors, we estimate that segment domestic cigarette volumes for the fourth quarter declined by 8% and that industry volumes declined by 6.5% over the same period. as a reminder, adjusted cigarette volumes were strong in the fourth quarter of 2020, with our smokeable segment adjusted cigarette volumes declining by just 1% and industry volumes growing by one half percent. for the full year, smokeable segment adjusted oci grew 3.1% to $10.4 billion.
adjusted oci margins expanded by 1.2 percentage points to 57.6%. these strong full year results were supported by robust net price realization up 9.1%. full year smokable segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined 7.5% due to the strong comparison period and the continuation of pandemic driven changes in the consumer behavior. when adjusted for trade inventory movement, calendar differences and other factors, we estimate that smokable segment cigarette volumes declined by 6% and that the full industry declined by 5.5%.
we believe it's important to analyze cigarette volume trends over the longer term as decline rates in any one year can be influenced by various factors. the covid-19 pandemic has certainly been one of these distorting factors and we believe the best way to assess cigarette volumes during this period is looking at 2020 and 2021 volumes combined. in fact, the two-year average decline rates for adjusted smokable segment and industry cigarette volume declines were 4% and 3%, respectively, well within the range of historic norms. turning to marketplace performance.
marlboro remains strong and has demonstrated resilience. the cigarette category remains very competitive. after market share gains in the first half of 2021, marlboro did see share in the fourth quarter. we believe the sequential share decline occurred due to macroeconomic pressures on consumer disposable income.
while the vast majority of marlboro consumers are highly brand loyal, we do know that cigarette brand selection for a subset of smokers is dependent on economic conditions. these consumers are more likely to select premium brands during economic upswings, as demonstrated by marlboro share gains in the first half of 2021, but they are also more likely to trade down in tougher economic situations. we remain focused on the long-term strength of marlboro and we are very pleased that its full year share grew 0.2 to 43.1% and that the brand remained stable since the beginning of the pandemic. in discount, total segment retail share in the fourth quarter continued to fluctuate, increasing 0.7 sequentially to 26% driven primarily by deep discount products.
we believe the share increases observed in the discount segment are due to the previously mentioned macroeconomic factors that pressured the consumer in the fourth quarter. for the full year, discount segment share increased five-tenths to 25.4%, which was at the high end of its historical ranges. we expect fluctuation in discount segment shares to continue as the cohort of price sensitive consumers react to their short-term economic conditions. and in cigars, middleton provided strong contributions to smokable segment financial results.
reported cigar shipment volume was essentially unchanged for the year, as middleton maintained the strength of the iconic black & mild brand and successfully managed the supply chain during a challenging year. turning to the oral tobacco product segment. adjusted oci and adjusted oci margins contracted for the full year primarily due to increased investments behind on!. total segment reported shipment volume was unchanged for the year.
when adjusted for trade inventory movements and calendar differences, we estimate that total oral tobacco segment volumes declined by 0.5%. we remain pleased with the overall performance of the segment as copenhagen continues to generate significant income in the high-margin mst category and we're excited about the growth demonstrated by on!. oral tobacco product segment retail share for the fourth quarter was down slightly sequentially as strong share gains from on! nearly offset declines in mst. the segment declined 1.6 percentage points versus the fourth quarter last year due to the continued growth of the oral nicotine pouch category.
turning to our investment in abi. we recorded $172 million of adjusted equity earnings in the fourth quarter, representing altria's share of abi's third quarter results. for the full year, we recorded $639 million in adjusted equity earnings, up 18.3% versus 2020. as we shared in our previous earnings call, we view our abi stake as a financial investment and our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the investment for our shareholders.
in our all other operating category, we continue to make progress on our wind down of philip morris capital corporation. at year-end, the net finance assets balance was $114 million, down more than $200 million since the end of 2020 due to rents received and asset sales. as previously announced, we expect to complete the pmcc wind down by the end of 2022. turning to capital allocation.
we remain committed to creating long-term shareholder value through the pursuit of our vision and our significant capital returns. as billy mentioned in his opening remarks, we returned more than $8.1 billion in cash last year to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. these record cash returns included paying $6.4 billion in dividends, raising the dividend for the 56th time in 52 years and repurchasing nearly 36 million shares during the year totaling $1.7 billion. we also sold ste.
michelle wine estates and expanded our share repurchase program from $2 billion to $3.5 billion. we have approximately $1.8 billion remaining under this expanded program, which we expect to complete by december 31, 2022. we continue to have a strong balance sheet and our goal is to maintain an investment-grade credit rating. as of year-end, our debt to ebitda ratio was 2.3 times and our weighted average coupon was 4%.
with that, we'll wrap up and billy and i will be happy to take your questions. while the calls are being compiled, i'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-gaap reconciliations are available on altria.com. we've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items. let's open the question-and-answer period.
operator, do we have any questions?
",":
operator
[operator instructions] we will take questions from the investment community first. our first question comes from pamela kaufman from morgan stanley.
pamela kaufman -- monness -- analyst
hi, good morning.
mac livingston -- vice president of investor relations
pam, this is mac. just one quick second before your question. we understand that there were some technical issues associated with the webcast, so i want to apologize for the disruption to those listening there. we will work to get our recorded remarks up on the website as soon as possible.
thanks and go ahead, pam.
pamela kaufman -- monness -- analyst
thanks. so how would you characterize the current competitive environment within the cigarette category. the deep discount segment continues to invest in price and is gaining share. given the headwinds that you highlighted that are impacting the tobacco consumer, how are you thinking about managing price gaps versus the discount segment? and are you prioritizing stabilizing marlboro market share? thanks.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning, pamela and thanks for your question. i think i would start with marlboro's share. i mean, when you look at marlboro's share performance over the past eight quarters, it has been stable. so you can look at kind of this period in the pandemic to pre-pandemic levels and you see marlboro has remained strong throughout that period.
i think when we went through the pandemic, though, there were several macroeconomic tailwinds, and we've mentioned them before. there was lower consumer mobility. there was higher government stimulus payments and, what we believe, led to increased smoking occasions. and when you think about that, that led to increased or higher discretionary income for competitive adult smokers who then traded up to marlboro.
and i think that really showed the continued appeal of premium brands. now, as we start seeing some of those pressures you're referring to put pressure or decrease the discretionary spend of some of our consumers, you see the more price-sensitive adult smokers moving back to discount brands and i think that would be expected. look, we believe that the current discount share, to your point, is at the high end of historical norms, but we do expect quarterly fluctuations in share to continue until the economy begins to stabilize from the pandemic. i think, overall, from a pricing standpoint and i'll be careful not to talk about future pricing, you recall the four factors that we look at to make pricing decisions, strength of the brand, the economic health of our consumers, the demographics or relevancy of the brands across the various age cohorts and corporate objectives.
and i think when you think about the strength of the brand, i would remind you that like marlboro has over 90% loyalty and that i think has shown through the eight quarters of stability.
pamela kaufman -- monness -- analyst
that's helpful. and then just a question on smokeless segment. profitability and margins have been under pressure in smokeless over the last several quarters. can you elaborate on the investments you're making there? and how are you thinking about smokeless investments and profitability in 2022?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, it's a great question. i appreciate you raising it. i think when you think about it, pamela, we had talked, as we progressed through 2020 that we were really focused on getting past the manufacturing capacity constraints and that would allow us to really start engaging with the consumer. so now being in the 117,000 stores, you want to have a nice look at retail.
you're going to want to engage with smokers with equity messages that go to the consumer, whether through direct mail or through digital. and then because you're introducing a new category and is growing, you want to have some disruption at retail, both with the look and with some price off and so you have price promotions that take place in the marketplace. so those are the major factors that, as we're investing in on! and it's growing, impact the overall oral tobacco category from a margin standpoint. i know you would like me to say this is the exact date we expect to end that, but i think as you think about a growing category and on! certainly participated in that growth, we're going to invest appropriately as that category continues to grow.
pamela kaufman -- monness -- analyst
thank you.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer

we'll take our next question from bonnie herzog of goldman sachs.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. thank you. good morning, everyone. 
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning, bonnie.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. i have a question on your '22 eps guidance. you mentioned you plan to balance earnings growth and shareholder returns with investments toward your vision, which includes increased smoke-free product r&d. but at the same time, you don't expect to have iqos in the market.
so two questions. one, can you give us a sense of your investment spend in r&d.? for instance, will your investments in this effort be elevated above '21 levels? and then two, can you share maybe just a little bit more with us about your 2030 vision and how the development of an additional smoke-free product could fit into your portfolio? i'd be curious to hear what that product might look like, when it might be right to test, just be curious to hear if it's closed or is this still a year or two out.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, thanks for the question, bonnie. and it was pretty packed up, so i'll try to unpack it. but if i miss any point, please follow up. i think when you think about guidance overall, right, we run a range of scenarios across all the categories we participate in and there are always puts and takes in those various scenarios.
and it's important to remember when mindful that we're still in a pandemic environment and that we want to ensure we have the flexibility to adapt to our adult consumers as we progress through the year and they're making different choices. as far as the investment areas, i know you would like us to say this is exactly when we're going to bring this product and here's what it looks like. i think it's important to step back and think about where we're investing and it really is marketplace activities for support of the products we have in the marketplace. it's also investing in the digital consumer engagement, being able to get closer to the consumer on a one-on-one basis and we'll share more details of that at cagny.
and then it's not just research and development. it's also the regulatory preparations that take place. so for instance, in 2022, we're preparing the mrtp application for the on! portfolio. so there's a vast array of investments.
it does include product development in r&d. and so that's kind of how we look at 2022 and how we're moving forward. i think when you look at the vision, even if you look overseas where they're able to innovate much quicker, you see the consumer constantly moving from a technology standpoint through the various options that are available to them. and so we want to make sure that we're investing appropriately to stay paced or actually be ahead of where the consumer is going to be as we progress through time.
and so that's how we think about product development in the -- from a fitting into the portfolio to address that point of your question.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok, that's helpful. and then just speaking or thinking about your 2030 vision. could you give us maybe an update on that? and i just keep thinking about any guidepost you guys could share with us that you expect to hit for this business or your business, i should say, in the next three to five years. what ultimately is a realistic target in terms of converting your business to noncombustible products? and then in the context of that and executing on this vision, curious to hear if you're open to m&a to accelerate this or are you going to continue to remain focused on things that you develop in-house?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think from a guidepost standpoint and we get this question often, is i think it's a bit different in the u.s. where we're predominantly based versus overseas. remember, everything has to go through the fda authorization process and really, the entire harm reduction opportunities in front of us in the u.s. and so i think as we progress and we start seeing some of the fda authorizations come through, we'll be sure to share some guideposts on how we're thinking about measuring going forward.
i know that's what you and the investors want. it's just that we need to get through the fda authorization process and understand how they're going to think about and authorize these products going forward. and then we can provide some guideposts to be measured against in that regard. i think, overall, though and we've shared this before, call it, roughly half to slightly over half of adult consumer -- cigarette consumers in the u.s.
prefer or would desire an alternative product that satisfies them and has the potential to reduce the risk associated with using nicotine through time. so we want to consistently provide those consumers the products and transition them to the smoke-free products. from a standpoint of the 2030 vision, i mentioned that the entire rrp opportunities in front of us and what we feel like we have is we have the infrastructure to support that, whether you think about government affairs or regulatory affairs, a top-notch sales force. we have product development.
we engage with the largest number of u.s. adult tobacco consumers through our brand -- premium brands and our digital capabilities. and if you step back and we have strong core businesses that produce lots of cash that allow us to fund our investments. and i believe if you ask consumers, we have credibility with the adult tobacco consumer.
so your last question, if i recall them all correctly, was m&a versus internal. look, we monitor what's taking place around the world and we're extremely focused on our organic development, staying close to the consumer as we continue with that process.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
all right. thank you. i'll get back in queue.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question is from owen bennett of jefferies.
owen bennett -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning, gents. hope you're well. i just had a question around some of the details on the automatic renewal of the iqos agreement. and firstly, did you need to hit certain market share levels by april 24? and then two, it sounds like from what you're saying, you believe you already hit these levels in 2020.
and would that be right? it just sounds like if that's the case, the share targets were set really low. and then three, if you believe you've already hit the share targets, what exactly is being renegotiated with pmi currently? thank you, guys.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, i appreciate it. i want to appreciate your question. look, we disclosed what we felt like we could from a standpoint. remember, we have cross confidentiality in place with pmi and we disclosed that in 2020 because we thought it was important for you guys and the investors to know that there were performance objectives in the contract.
we feel like we have hit those as far as the extension or renegotiation that's taken place. look, we described that we feel like we hit on pmi in disagreement with that and their mechanisms in the contract to be able to settle any disputes that take place. you can see with any two parties that have an agreement, there can be disputes or disagreements and that was all contemplated in the agreement.
owen bennett -- jefferies -- analyst
ok, thanks a lot. very helpful.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
we'll take our next question from vivien azer of cowen.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi, thanks very much. i really appreciate the commentary on the health of the consumer and some of the normalization in terms of down trading behavior. billy, as i kind of think back to the evolution of the marlboro franchise over the last decade, there was a big push, if i recall correctly, coming out of the last recession to balance out the price points that were available for marlboro. so can you just remind us kind of where special blend fits into the total marlboro franchise? and i recognize your revenue growth management tools have gotten a lot more sophisticated over the last decade, but the role that you envision special blend playing to the extent that we see sustained down trading.
thank you.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, thanks for the question, vivien. i think when you think about the entire marlboro portfolio, remember, that services four out of every 10 consumers that go to the marketplace. you have consumers that the marlboro brand appeals to them. and i mentioned it earlier, those price-sensitive consumers, it still appeal to them.
and when they have extra discretionary income, they want to trade up. across the portfolio with the tools that you mentioned, we can provide the consumer a safe landing, with various parts of the portfolio where they can stay in the marlboro franchise. and we see that's better for them than actually losing them or having them trade up and try to win them back later. and so we have the advanced analytics.
we have this robust data coming in from retail. and now with those tools, we're trying to provide it closer and closer to the individual consumer. and we feel like we have the tools that allow us to navigate this type of pressure that the consumer is under. i think it's important, though, to remember that our goal is not to grow marlboro share through time.
it's to stabilize it, so that we can grow profitability through time. and so that's where our overall goal is specific to the marlboro franchise and then we use the tools in the portfolio to be able to do that.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
that's really helpful. and then as my follow-up question is on the on! franchise. clearly, the promotional investments that you guys are making are translating to market share gains, which is great to see. i was wondering if you could offer any color on where you see on! promotional spending relative to the broader competitive backdrop.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
sure. i think when you think about the promotional spending there, look, we had to get past manufacturing capacity constraints. so we certainly had a competitor get out there much earlier than us. and so we want to be a bit disruptive in the marketplace to disrupt the consumers from their normal purchasing behavior in the category or if they're thinking about the category.
the same tools that you think agree with that we have in the cigarette category, we're using those tools in this space as well. so we're constantly using those tools with the data we're getting from retail, with the feedback we're getting from consumers and understanding what's effective and what's not effective. and so we'll be continually adjusting those as we move through time to improve the share growth and through -- once we get past the investment period to get increased margins and profitability.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
understood. thank you.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer

our next question is from chris growe of stifel.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi, good morning.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning, chris.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
good morning. i had a question, first of all and this is not even in the situation in the last kind of year and a half or two, but you did not provide a volume outlook for the year, for example, for your cigarette business or smokeless business overall. and i'm just curious, not maybe getting to a number, but just to understand, is that volatility in volume, maybe the uncertainty around that, kind of the main factor that could push your eps around within that range? is the worst volume conclusion for the year what likely drives the lower end of your eps range and a better volume performance or at the higher end? is that one of the main driving factors of your guidance range for the year as you see it?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
i think when you think about cigarette volume, it's certainly an important factor in that, but there are always puts and takes that take place in the p&l. and so as i mentioned, chris, we run a range of scenarios. and in those scenarios, we have puts and takes that take place across the various categories. certainly, cigarette volume is one of the factors, but it's not the only factor.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok, and then i just had a question in relation to marlboro and share. there's been a few questions on that front. but just one thing i was curious about is that in some of your price increases over the last year, year and a half, maybe last year, you've set aside some funds that you were going to put toward investing behind marlboro. i guess, i just want to get a sense of, based on the performance and largely flat performance in share, even though it's been up and down, i guess, are those funds being utilized as you expected behind marlboro? do you see the need based on some of the growth in deep discount share, for example, to continue to increase that rate of spending behind marlboro?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
it's something we'll certainly monitor chris going through time. and we talked about look, we're mindful of keeping pace and understanding how we need to adapt to our consumers across all of our categories. i think i go back to the comment i made to vivien. our goal with marlboro is not to grow share through time.
it's to have stable share and be able to grow profitability. and i think you see we were very successful with that in 2020.
yes, ok. thank you for your time.
thank you, chris.
operator
we'll take our next question from callum elliott of bernstein.
callum elliott -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
thanks for the question. look, billy, i appreciate the color on the dispute resolution process with pm. my question is, do you guys have contingency plans in place in heated tobacco in the event that, that dispute resolution process goes against you and the licensing agreement isn't extended beyond 2024?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. i'm not going to go into the hypothetical there, callum. i think you can appreciate that we feel like we can resolve it. it was pretty thought out with the agreement that the mechanism is in place to settle disputes and so we'll go through that process.
but we're in continued discussions with pmi.
callum elliott -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
ok, thanks. and just a quick follow-up on vivien's question about sort of promotional environment in nicotine pouches. i guess, my question is, are you concerned at all that, that heavy promotional environment for on! might damage the brand equity? and selling today at a huge discount to the market leader, as you mentioned, are you not at all concerned that, that might impact the long-term brand perception here?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
we are not. if you think about -- even if you go back to the cigarette category, when we launch chews and whether it be on marlboro or any of our other brands, you always had introductory price promotions. it's important to remember when our consumer is going to and c-stores is one of the primary locations they go to, they're making that decision in 10 to 15 seconds. it's the snap of an eye almost.
and so when you think about that, you want to disrupt them at retail, not only with price promotions, but with a great look at retail or disrupt them either in their mailbox or their email box with -- through digital. and so we're going to use all of those tools available to us, but we feel like we have strong equity and building strong equity with on!.
callum elliott -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
ok, thank you.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer

at this time, we'd be happy to open up the queue for our media representatives. we'll take a question from jennifer maloney of the wall street journal.
jennifer maloney -- the wall street journal -- reporter
hi, good morning. i wanted to follow up on bonnie's questions about your r&d and your 2030 vision. can you speak specifically to your -- how e-vapor fits into your 2030 vision and rrp portfolio?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think from an r&d portfolio -- i'll take that first. you'll remember our agreement with juul precludes us from being able to do any organic development in e-vapor. so that's one category that we do not have any organic development going on.
if you think about the 2030 vision, the way we think about the e-vapor category, certainly as the entire category is going through the fda authorization process as they make decisions, the e-vapor category will be in a bit of transition. but we believe the e-vapor category and juul included in that can play an important role in the u.s. in harm reduction and the future of harm reduction. so when you think about that, e-vapor can play an important role, but it's going to be in a bit of a transition as it goes through the fda authorization process.
jennifer maloney -- the wall street journal -- reporter
you only have a minority stake in juul, so do you -- i mean, what's your strategy there for this 2030 vision in the e-vapor category? it's just you'll only be able to participate in the e-vapor category through your minority stake in juul. or do you have some other strategy there?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
there -- our only participation in the e-vapor category would be through our minority investment in juul. and i think if you step back and see the success juul had in the marketplace with converting adult smokers to the e-vapor category, you'll see that it still has the lead in market share in the u.s. with adult tobacco consumers.
jennifer maloney -- the wall street journal -- reporter
ok, thanks.

billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thanks, mac. good morning and thank you for joining us. we're off to a strong start to the year and believe our businesses are on track to deliver against their full year plans. our tobacco businesses performed well in a challenging macroeconomic environment, and we continue to make progress toward our vision to responsibly lead the transition of adult smokers to a smoke-free future.
let's start with a review of the macroeconomic backdrop and its impact on u.s. tobacco consumers. in january, the surge of omicron cases disrupted consumers' routines and purchasing patterns, resulting in short-term decreases in retail trips and overall tobacco volumes. increased inflation throughout the quarter pressured discretionary income levels as the consumer price index reached a four-year high in march and higher gas prices were exacerbated by the russian invasion of ukraine.
however, the rise in inflation was partially offset by improved employment metrics and increased wage growth for some consumers. the unemployment rate was 3.6% at the end of march, down from 6% in march of 2021. total wages grew by nearly 5% in the first quarter compared to 8% average inflation. for some occupations, wage growth outpaced inflation, including occupations that over-indexed toward tobacco consumers.
for example, wages grew 11% for production related jobs and nearly 10% for jobs pertaining to transportation and materials moving. additionally, the pressures of inflation were also offset for some consumers by higher federal income tax refunds. in the first quarter, the average federal income tax refund payment issued by the irs increased by approximately 12%. we do expect inflation to persist for the balance of the year, however, and we will continue to monitor its effect on tobacco consumers.
moving to our consolidated results. altria delivered strong first quarter performance in this dynamic environment, growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 4.7%. adjusted eps growth was primarily driven by higher operating companies' income and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by lower adjusted earnings from our abi investment. in the smokeable products segment, we continued to execute our strategy of maximizing profitability in combustibles while appropriately balancing investments in marlboro with funding the growth of smoke-free products.
first quarter smokeable segment adjusted oci increased 5.7% and marlboro retail share was stable sequentially. we believe marlboro's share performance through this period reflects its continued strong brand equity among smokers. we believe the investments we have made behind data analytics and revenue growth management provide us with the right tools to support the smokeable strategies. these tools include pm usa's manufacturer-supported off-invoice program, which enables more efficient resource deployment for marlboro, as well as retail trade programs with multiple options designed to provide retailers with store-level solutions for our brands.
we believe these capabilities position our smokeable businesses to navigate the current environment and to continue to deliver strong profitability in support of our vision and shareholder returns. turning to our smoke-free product portfolio. we're excited by the performance of on! and oral nicotine pouches. on! reported shipment volume nearly doubled to 18 million cans in the first quarter.
at retail, on! share of all tobacco increased by 2.5 percentage points, reaching 4.1%. as we shared at cagny, on!'s share growth has been primarily driven by repeat purchases from existing on! consumers and increased tobacco consumer trial. we are encouraged that these dynamics continued into the first quarter. at the category level, oral nicotine pouches reached a total oral tobacco retail share of 19.3 percentage points in the first quarter.
the category grew 6.1 share points year over year, with on! representing more than 40% of this growth. we believe the brand continues to be a highly competitive product in the space, and it continues to perform well in all regions of the u.s. as a reminder, our premarket tobacco applications for the entire oral portfolio remain pending with the fda. and we believe the fda should determine that the marketing of these products is appropriate for the protection of public health.
we are also actively working on modified-risk tobacco product applications for on! we believe mrtp claims will provide impactful points of differentiation for the brand and important tools in educating and ultimately transitioning smokers to less harmful products. in e-vapor, we estimate that total category volume increased 10% versus the year-ago period and increased 4% sequentially as a result of increased volume in the vape store channel. our minority investment in juul remains subject to challenge by the u.s. federal trade commission.
in february, an administrative law judge found in favor of altria and juul and dismissed the entirety of the ftc's claims. the ftc is appealing that decision to the ftc. any decision by the ftc is subject to appeal in federal appellate court. in heated tobacco, our teams are continuing to work with pmi on iqos reentry plans, and we will keep you informed on developments as circumstances warrant.
there is no change to our expectations regarding iqos product availability. moving to the regulatory environment. president biden signed a bill last month to bring synthetic nicotine products under fda regulation by updating the definition of a tobacco product within the food, drug, and cosmetic act to include any product that contains nicotine, including synthetic nicotine products. the bill allows manufacturers of synthetic nicotine products currently on market to keep those products on the market for 120 days after the bill's enactment provided that they have submitted a pmta for those products by may 14.
unless the fda grants a pmta within that time period, the products become unlawful and subject to the fda's enforcement discretion. the bill creates a certain exception for this review period for those circumstances where the fda issued a denial of a marketing order and the manufacturer thereafter marketed the product with synthetic nicotine. we believe this legislation is an important step toward the creation of a responsible, smoke-free marketplace consisting solely of fda-authorized products. in combustibles, the fda has indicated that it is on track to issue proposed.
in combustibles, the fda has indicated that it is on track to issue proposed product standards this month regarding menthol and cigarettes and characterizing flavors in cigars. as a reminder, the fda rule making process has multiple steps and provides several opportunities for stakeholders to provide input. underage smoking is at the lowest level in a generation, and efforts to prohibit the legal sale of products to adults, as we have seen with alcohol prohibition and cannabis criminalization, have consistently failed. prohibition pushes products into illegal markets that lack regulatory oversight and lack underage prevention.
we believe equitable harm reduction is a better public policy approach to reducing smoking and improving public health. this means manufacturers must develop and the fda authorize an array of potentially reduced-harm alternatives that can appeal to and transition smokers across all backgrounds and demographic groups. we expect to be actively engaged in providing our perspective to the fda throughout the process. we remain optimistic about the future of harm reduction in the u.s.
we believe we have an unprecedented opportunity to lead the way in shifting millions of smokers away from cigarettes. we're encouraged that the fda has started authorizing smoke-free products. but more needs to be done to build a marketplace of authorized reduced-harm products that smokers can consider as they move away from cigarettes. our tobacco businesses delivered extraordinary results in a challenging and dynamic environment, and this cannot be done without the passion, resiliency and fierce determination of our employees.
their talent and dedication continue to give me confidence in our ability to move beyond smoking. i'll now turn it over to sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our results.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
thanks, billy. i'd like to begin with a discussion on the inflationary environment, which was exacerbated by the russian invasion of ukraine. we continue to monitor the potential impacts to our operations and supply chain, and we are actively working to mitigate risk. thanks to the hard work of our teams, we have not experienced a material adverse impact from these events.
while our company will continue to monitor the situation, our hearts go out to the suffering ukrainian people and to all of those affected by the war. moving to our businesses. the smokeable products segment delivered excellent financial performance once again. in the first quarter, the segment grew its adjusted oci by 5.7% and expanded its adjusted oci margins to 59.5%.
the segment also reported strong net price realization of 9.2%. first quarter smokeable segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined 6.3%. when adjusted for trade inventory movements and other factors, we estimate that segment domestic cigarette volumes for the first quarter declined by 8% and that industry volumes declined by 6.5% over the same period. we believe it's important to analyze cigarette volume trends over the longer term as decline rates in any one period can be influenced by various factors.
in fact, the two-year average decline rates for first quarter adjusted smokeable segment and industry cigarette volume declines were 5.5% and 4.5%, respectively. in the marketplace, marlboro demonstrated strength and resilience during a dynamic period for consumers. in the first quarter, marlboro's retail share of the category was 42.6%, stable sequentially and down 0.4 versus the year ago period. marlboro also maintained its leadership among premium brands, growing its share of the premium segment to 57.8%, up 0.2 sequentially and versus year ago.
and in discount, total share of the cigarette category in the first quarter increased 0.3 sequentially to 26.4% driven primarily by deep discount products. we believe the share increases in discount were due to the previously mentioned macroeconomic factors that affected tobacco consumers in the first quarter. in cigars, middleton continued to provide strong contributions to smokeable segment financial results, and we are encouraged by the continued strength of the iconic black & mild brand. reported cigar shipment volume decreased 9.6% in the first quarter, primarily driven by trade inventory movements.
to date, middleton is successfully navigating the regulatory environment with the support of our regulatory affairs team, having received market orders or exemptions from the fda covering over 99% of its volume. of course, as billy mentioned earlier, we will continue to monitor the fda's proposed product standard on characterizing flavors in cigars and its potential impact to middleton's portfolio. we expect to be actively engaged in providing our perspective throughout the rule making process. moving to the oral tobacco products segment, adjusted oci and adjusted oci margins contracted in the first quarter primarily due to the increased investments behind on! total segment reported shipment volume decreased 1.9%.
when adjusted for trade inventory movements and calendar differences, we estimate that total oral tobacco segment volumes were unchanged. at the industry level, total oral tobacco volume growth moderated to 1.5% over the past six months. we continue to observe steady growth from the oral nicotine pouch category, but this has been offset by declining moist smokeless tobacco volumes as a result of difficult comparison periods and the macroeconomic challenges facing tobacco consumers. retail share for the oral tobacco products segment declined 1.1 percentage points in the first quarter as declines in mst offset strong share gains for on!.
we remain pleased with the overall performance of the segment as copenhagen continues to generate significant income in the high-margin mst category, and we remain excited about the performance of on! turning to our investment in abi, we recorded $141 million of adjusted equity earnings in the first quarter, down 25.8% versus the prior year. as we have previously shared, we view our abi stake as a financial investment, and our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the investment for our shareholders. moving to capital allocation and our financial outlook. we remain committed to creating long-term shareholder value through the pursuit of our vision and our significant capital returns.
in the first quarter, we paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchased approximately 11.3 million shares totaling $576 million. we have approximately $1.2 billion remaining under the currently authorized $3.5 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by year-end. we reaffirm our guidance to deliver 2022 full year adjusted diluted eps in a range of $4.79 to $4.93. this range represents an adjusted diluted eps growth rate of 4% to 7% from a $4.61 base in 2021.
we continue to expect that 2022 adjusted diluted eps growth will be weighted toward the second half of the year. before opening it up to q&a, i'd like to comment on our recent esg progress. whilst harm reduction and underage use remain the most important social issues for our company to address, we have committed to make advancements in other esg areas. at altria, we are committed to reducing our environmental impact and recently announced our first virtual power purchase agreement for energy produced by a new wind farm project in texas.
this agreement marks significant progress toward two of our science-based environmental targets. achieving 100% renewable electricity and reducing operational greenhouse gas emissions 55% by 2030. when the project is operational, we expect we will hit both those targets ahead of schedule. we're proud to support a project that will bring additional renewable energy to the electricity grid, contributing to positive climate action.
with that, we'll wrap up, and billy and i will be happy to take your questions. while the calls are being compiled, i'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-gaap reconciliations are available on altria.com. we've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items. let's open the question-and-answer period.
operator, do we have any questions?
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from chris growe from stifel. please go ahead.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi, good morning.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning, chris.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
good morning. i just had a question for you. you've had -- there's a little bit more of a macro headwind that's been occurring. obviously, there are some areas where wages you showed, i think, were doing a little better.
but as i think about that, as you look at your -- kind of the way you look at it today, whether it be unemployment, gas prices, those sorts of things, is there a point -- at what point this year would you expect that to be less of a drag on volume? and i guess related to that, in terms of what you're seeing within the marlboro franchise, marlboro's share was quite resilient this quarter. are consumers moving around within that to marlboro to different blends as an example?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, thanks for the question, chris. i'll take them in order. so from a standpoint, we were excited to see the resilience of our consumer. that's why we wanted to highlight the wage inflation that i think a number of industries don't see it's benefited our tobacco consumer.
it's something that we'll continue to watch. certainly, gas prices has an impact on our consumers because usually they're filling up their car or truck and then going in and purchasing the product. so it's something that we'll continue to watch, but we feel pleased through the first quarter with the resiliency we've seen in the tobacco consumer. as far as marlboro, we're extremely excited with the stability of marlboro.
and if you go back, you can see pre-covid, we had the benefit of the strength of marlboro, and we benefited from the consumer having extra discretionary income as we proceeded through the covid pandemic. and i think that pointed to that marlboro's still the aspirational brand in the marketplace. and then as we've seen discretionary income come under pressure, we gave a little bit of that share back that we had benefited during the covid virus. but through that entire period, the marlboro brand has held up.
you always see a little bit of movement. if you think about marlboro as the brand that has over 90% loyalty, that's a consumer that's buying it every time they make a purchase of a cigarette in the marketplace. but you see a little bit of movement, but nothing that i would highlight for you at this point.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. i just had one other question. i think you talked about the dynamic of consumers moving into vape shops, for example for vapor. and is that a movement away from traditional outlets? and i guess just what could be driving that or -- and, i guess, to that effect, what that could mean to juul in the future based on that movement by consumers?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yes. we -- what we tried to highlight was where we saw the -- some of the growth. it was in the vape shop channel. again, no trend there to highlight.
just wanted to highlight where we saw the growth sequentially. i think if you step back and look at the entire e-vapor category, what we've tried to highlight is as all of these products are coming under fda regulation and we should see and have started seeing some of the decisions by the fda, i think that entire category will be in a bit of a transition over the next year to 18 months as some products make it through the process and some are denied. and so those consumers will be moving around a bit. what we look forward to and continue to believe is that e-vapor can play an important role in harm reduction in the u.s.
once we get to a total fda-authorized marketplace.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. thank you for your time today.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from vivien azer from cowen. please go ahead.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. good morning. 
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning, vivien.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
so the menthol news has been long anticipated certainly over the last 12 months given the april 2022 target. billy, maybe it'll be helpful, you guys have been pretty consistent in disclosing your share of menthol. but just dimensionalizing how big the menthol category is in the broader category context. thanks.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, so to your point on our metrics page, you can see our share of menthol is 9.4% across pm usa, and it's pretty consistent from an industry standpoint that it represents about a third of industry from a menthol cigarettes in the marketplace versus non-menthol.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
understood. thank you. that's really helpful. my next question is on the irs callout.
that's a bit of a unique callout relative to what we've been hearing from other companies under my coverage. so is the message that this is kind of a one quarter benefit? like how are you guys kind of thinking about that? like does it annualize? or you kind of just thought that, that was kind of a onetime offset to inflationary pressures for the consumer? thanks.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think you can think of it as a form of government stimulus, to a certain extent, vivien. when you think about it, the actual refund checks are up. as far as -- we'll see how that plays out through the second quarter. not everybody gets their refund checks in the first quarter.
but we certainly want to highlight it for our consumer. i think the bigger callout, though, and you saw it, was the wage inflation. and that's a piece that was benefiting our consumer, and that would be something that we would anticipate would be consistent throughout the year.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
understood. thank you so much.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from pamela kaufman from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. good morning.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
can you give an update on your strategy in the oral tobacco segment? performance reflects continued elevated investment behind on!. how should we think about profitability in this segment and how it evolves? and is there a level of market share or a particular goalpost you can point to that would drive a shift toward more of a profit focus for on!?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. i appreciate the question, pamela. i think when you think about our strategy in oral tobacco, it's to maximize profitability over the long term in the moist smokeless category with the strength of copenhagen while making responsible investments in on! for -- to continue to fund its growth. we believe long term we can achieve tobacco-like margins within the oral nicotine pouch category.
but certainly, to your point, we're in the investment period now. and you saw the significant growth we saw year over year, almost doubling volume from a comparison point first quarter-to-first quarter. and we've been trying to highlight all along, once we got past the manufacturing capacity constraint, that we wanted to invest to make sure it was in the consideration set of our consumers when they're making those choices for alternative products. what you'll see that we've started is really using our advanced analytics that we invested in to be more targeted with some of the promotions.
but we're still in the investment period, and we'll remain in that for a period of time.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks. and then can you discuss what you're observing from the competitive landscape within the cigarette category in light of the current consumer environment? the deep discount segment continues to gain share at a higher pace, and price gaps remain wide relative to historical levels. can you talk about how you're thinking about trade-down within the cigarette category given some of the consumer headwinds?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, sure. some of what you've seen is exactly what you highlighted, pamela, which is, as the discretionary income comes under pressure, whether that's through inflation or gas prices or even mobility, you'll see some trade-down. i think if you think about the total cigarette consumer group, think about it as a bit of a barbell. there's a group of consumers that are at the bottom end of that, that are always buying the cheapest in the store.
and so you see that occur. and you saw the benefit in marlboro that we experienced when discretionary income wasn't under so much pressure. but the way we think about it is we're a premium-focused company, and you see this the rock-solid stability of marlboro through time.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from gaurav jain from barclays. please go ahead.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
hi. good morning.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
so a couple of questions here. billy, so the slide #6 in which you are talking about how wages are trending across different professionals was very interesting. now if i apply a similar sort of lens to the entire u.s. in different states and maybe different wage inflation in different states, are you seeing better volume trends in the states where wage inflation is higher versus where wage inflation is lower?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, it's an interesting question. we don't disclose to that level, but we do see where wage inflation has -- and we tried to highlight a couple of the categories, but where wage inflation has benefited the tobacco consumer. and that's why we wanted to highlight that for you.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
sure. and if i were to just say that wage inflation will likely accelerate as we go through this year because of -- we can see weekly jobless data and everything and federal reserve is still behind the curve, so then should we then expect that cigarette volumes, which were minus six and a half percent in q1, which are difficult comps, which are the gas price spike, so it should start moderating from here and improve as the year progresses?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think the macroeconomic environment, to your point, is very dynamic. certainly, we would expect wage inflation to at least be consistent throughout the year in your hypothesis of it increasing, i guess, we'll see on how unemployment goes and how job openings respond to that. i think the other side, though, is the tailwind. you highlighted gas prices.
we'll see where gas prices go through the remainder part of the year and where inflation trends. so i think it's very dynamic, and that's why we wanted to highlight some of the tailwinds and headwinds that we were seeing.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
sure. and just coming to the synthetic nicotine market and what the fda has done. so in the synthetic nicotine market, like how do you see this entire category playing out in the next few months? and will that be a benefit to your volumes as well?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. so when you think about the total nicotine, you've seen us highlight that a couple of times and really looking at how the consumer is moving around. and that's exactly why, gaurav, we put the portfolio approach in place, because fda decisions in one category put consumers at play and force them to other categories. and so we believe having the portfolio approach is important.
and so you can take the e-vapor category depending on the decisions made by the fda. that's why we highlight that, that category could be in a bit of a transition for the next year to 18 months as decisions come out and some products make it through and some products do not. those consumers for products that do not make it will be at play either for other e-vapor products or other categories that they have in their consideration set.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
sure. and if i could just sneak in a last one for sal. so sal, there's this net periodic benefit income line item in your p&l which has been a constant benefit. and i used to think that when interest rates go up, it will become a headwind, but it hasn't.
so how does this line item work?
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
can you repeat that? i apologize.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
the net periodic benefit income, that line item which i think is linked to your pension, interest and income and expense. so it has always been a tailwind to your p&l. and i thought that it would become a headwind as interest rates rise, but still there is no benefit that's happening. so how do...
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
yes, that's a reflection of the strength. i'm sorry to interrupt. that's a reflection of the strength of our funding of our pension plan and also some favorability in our overall performance in the pension plan which, as you know, gets amortized over time. so you are correct in that it has had a slight benefit to our p&l.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
sure. thank you.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
sure.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question comes from bonnie herzog from goldman sachs. please go ahead.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everyone. 
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning, bonnie.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
i wanted to circle back on your cig volumes just given some of the investor concerns about your volume in this environment, especially your premium marlboro volume given the wider price gap. so first, billy, could you highlight for us if your q1 results were in line with your expectations? and then maybe share some more color for us around your strategy to protect your volume and share. for instance, i think you guys are stepping up promotional spending a bit for some of the price-sensitive consumers. and then maybe highlight for us how you leverage your special select brand during these times to kind of keep more consumers in your marlboro franchise.
and then i'd like to just better understand why you aren't maybe striking a better balance between your pricing and volumes.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, bonnie. so i'll try to address it. there were multiple parts there, but i'll try to address it with the strategy we implement. i think what you've seen with marlboro, and we highlight it for you, is the rock-steady performance of marlboro through time.
i think when you think about the pricing and the promotions in the marketplace, we highlighted for you the way we're using advanced analytics and revenue growth management, as what most companies call it, being able to get closer to the consumer and provide more -- if we're having promotions, provide it closer to the individual consumers. and so whether that's through our retail trade programs, where we have multiple options for retail trade partners, to really have multiple solutions, store-level solutions versus more of a total geographic solution for consumers in the marketplace because, as you know, certain states, the consumer is under different economic health than other states. as well as, the ability to have our manufacturer to off-invoice. and so our price realization, i would just remind you, is made up of two components.
it's list price and it's the efficiencies that we're getting through our revenue growth management and our advanced analytics. so when you think about that in totality, you see the steadiness of marlboro and the efficiencies coming through the promotional process. and so it's allowing us to be more targeted and efficient with the way we spend promotions.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
bonnie, i would just add one other point which we highlighted in our opening remarks. i think the strength of marlboro's performance within the premium category, where share of premium has grown, is a reflection of the effectiveness of the programs and tools billy just mentioned.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
all right. yeah, i mean, so i guess the right way to think about your smokeable business, i mean, it's an industry that's in secular decline in terms of volumes. they've been declining for a very, very long time. so the way you're managing this is offsetting that with pricing and trying to drive whether it's low- or mid-single-digit operating income growth and expanding your margins.
and you feel good, even in this environment, that you're going to be able to continue to do that.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think you see with the results through the first quarter. i think that was from a macroeconomic standpoint, it was a pretty tough quarter. and you've seen other industries be impacted by that, and we were able to navigate that very nicely.
again, i would just highlight, with the advanced analytics and the tools we have available to us, we can be much more precise. when you look at the 12-month decomposition we provide on volume, you can see from a price elasticity it's holding firm from a standpoint of total price elasticity. you can really see it's just the macroeconomic factors that have switched around through time.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok, thank you for that. and just one quick final clarification just on your guidance. can you touch on what it assumes in terms of total industry cig volumes? i mean are you assuming that volumes decelerate further this year? any color on that would be helpful to kind of frame all of this. thanks.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, i appreciate it, bonnie. and i know that you're looking for volume guidance that we don't provide. i think with this dynamic marketplace, the reason we give a range of guidance is we know that things are going to change for our consumer base, and we want to be able to provide the consumer what they need. and so that's why we put a range of guidance out there.
volume is one component, but there are multiple components that go into that guidance. so just to highlight one factor i don't think is appropriate. it's really -- we feel comfortable reaffirming that guidance in the quarter, and it's really about keeping an eye on how the consumer is bearing through this macroeconomic environment. 
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok, thank you.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question comes from priya ohri-gupta from barclays. please go ahead.
priya ohri-gupta -- barclays -- analyst
hey. thank you so much for taking the question. sal, i was wondering if you could just provide us with some thoughts on your outlook for the refinancing market, you do have a little over $1 billion maturing later this year, and how you're thinking about other opportunities for perhaps greater interest expense management across your debt portfolio. and then secondly, you do have one of your eurobonds maturing early in 2023.
if i recall, that serves as a net investment hedge against the dividend you receive from abi. so strategically, how should we think about sort of the need to refinance that in euro versus sort of refinancing in dollar? thank you.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
sure. so i'll take those questions in order. first, i guess the way i'd respond to your initial question is that it's critical for us that we continue to manage a strong balance sheet going forward. as you know, last year, in part of our capital allocation, we did do some tender refinancing of debt, which extended maturities of low-interest debt.
we're pleased with the results of that transaction. and part of the way we manage the balance sheet is we manage our debt towers going forward so that we're less impacted by market dynamics and we're -- we have the ability to have flexibility in how we treat maturing debt. so i'm not going to forecast out necessarily how we'll handle that debt that's coming to maturity. but of course, we will do the analysis and determine the best way to handle that, whether it's paid off with existing cash or think about refinancing and as such.
and the same answer goes for the euro debt that's coming through -- that's coming due. we'll do the analysis. you are correct in that it is a natural hedge against the abi dividends that we receive. and we do have flexibility to think about being -- how we can be opportunistic across various markets, whether we're thinking about managing our balance sheet going forward or refinancing or managing debt as it comes due.
priya ohri-gupta -- barclays -- analyst
ok, thank you so much.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer

and we have a question from gaurav jain from barclays again. please go ahead.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
thank you. just a quick question on the abi stake. i believe -- sal, like any updated thoughts on how you are thinking about it? thank you.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
there's really nothing new to say. we continue to perform the analysis related to our abi stake. as we spoke about in our opening remarks, it's a financial investment. our focus is on maximizing that investment for the long-term shareholder value.
we continue to do the analysis and there's nothing new to report on the asset itself.

we will now take questions from the media representatives. and our next question comes from jennifer maloney from wall street journal.
jennifer maloney
good morning.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning.
jennifer maloney
i wanted to ask about consumer switching patterns that you would expect to see if a menthol ban were implemented either in the state of california or nationwide. first of all, would you expect to see newport smokers switching to marlboro? and if so, what net impact would you expect to see on your overall cigarette business?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think it's tough to say. i think with some of the alternative products that are in the marketplace, certainly if there were an outright ban, using your hypothetical, to menthol, the consumer for the menthol cigarettes will either go to the illegal market, as we highlighted, under unintended consequences of an outright ban or look to either non-menthol cigarettes or alternative products. so it's tough to say where they will go. i think if you look at some of the research, i think there's limited research on it, but some would say that they would convert to non-menthol cigarettes.
i think the better point here, though, is -- if you step back, prohibition, at least through history, hasn't worked. the better approach is to have these alternative products and allow -- we know consumers want to move to alternative products that have the potential to reduce harm. that seems like that should be the focus and a better approach than an outright ban.
jennifer maloney
one quick follow-up. what products would you expect marlboro menthol smokers to switch to? and would you market any product specifically to them in the event of a menthol cigarette ban like marlboro gold or juul or on!?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. we'll have to wait to see what the proposal that comes out and how it approaches menthol. we would really look to, as we said, to support our vision and really look to move the consumer down the continuum of risk. and so that's the way we would approach it with the alternative products that are in the marketplace.
but certainly, it's ultimately the consumer's choice.
jennifer maloney

adjusted results exclude special items that affect comparisons with reported results. descriptions of these non-gaap financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release and on our website at altria.com. finally, all references in today's remarks to tobacco consumers or consumers within a specific tobacco category or segment refer to existing adult tobacco consumers 21 years of age or older. with that, i'll turn the call over to billy. 
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thanks, mac. good morning, and thank you for joining us. altria's tobacco businesses performed well in a challenging macroeconomic environment for the first half of the year. the smokeable products segment delivered solid operating company's income growth behind the resilience of marlboro, and our moist smokeless tobacco brands continued to drive profitability.
we also continue to make progress toward our vision through the investments we laid out in january, which included supporting the expansion of on!. we are encouraged by on!'s retail momentum and significant share growth since achieving unconstrained capacity last summer. we believe this is a pivotal point in the u.s. tobacco industry.
the fda has the opportunity to create a mature, regulated marketplace of smoke-free products that can successfully realize tobacco harm-reduction and improve the lives of millions of smokers. we share the fda's goal, to transition smokers away from cigarettes, but we continue to believe that harm-reduction, not prohibition is the best path forward. my remarks this morning will focus on three topics: our core tobacco businesses, including the macroeconomic backdrop and potential combustible tobacco product regulation; the smoke-free opportunity in the u.s. and our smoke-free product portfolio; and our continued confidence in our vision.
i'll then turn it over to sal, who will provide further detail on our business and financial results. let's begin with a review of the macroeconomic backdrop and its impact on u.s. tobacco consumers. in the second quarter, rising gas prices and inflation continue to pressure tobacco consumers' disposable income, resulting in volume declines across the tobacco space.
however, we believe that tobacco consumers adapted their purchasing patterns across a variety of goods and services to compensate for the increases in prices. some of the tactics used by consumers to manage their spending included only partially filling the gas tank and shifting their tobacco purchases from multipack toward single-pack purchases particularly among discount smokers. we also saw signs of continued brand loyalty in the tobacco space. in may, we conducted research to understand how tobacco consumers were managing their spending in several categories, including tobacco, alcohol, groceries and household items.
our research indicates that tobacco consumers are more likely to stick to their preferred brand regardless of price in the tobacco category compared to other categories. additionally, tobacco consumers saw price relief in other categories before doing so within the tobacco category. we believe that this prioritization is reflected in the sequential stability of marlboro retail share despite greater economic pressures on consumers. we believe inflation and the rising gas prices was partially offset for some consumers by a strong job market and wage growth.
overall, average wages increased 5.2% in the second quarter compared to an average of 8.6% increase in cpi. and for some occupations including the service industry, wage growth outpaced inflation. we continue to monitor tobacco consumer behaviors and changes in marketplace conditions, such as the declining gas price that we have observed in recent weeks, and we will continue to provide our insights as the year progresses. these macroeconomic factors contributed to accelerated cigarette volume declines in the second quarter and first half, which sal will discuss in his remarks.
in combustible regulatory news, the fda proposed rules that would ban menthol in cigarettes and characterizing flavors in cigars. the fda has already received over 200,000 comments on the proposals, and we expect to submit our comments by the august 2 deadline. the fda will need to address all of these comments before advancing to the next step in the rule-making process. as our comments will make clear, we believe that there are compelling reasons for the fda to reconsider its proposed rules relating to menthol and cigars.
additionally, the biden administration announced plans for future fda rule-making to develop a product standard that would set a maximum nicotine level for cigarettes. if and when the fda proceeds with rule-making, we expect to be fully engaged in the multiyear process. we believe harm-reduction is the best approach toward reducing smoking and improving public health. and according to a nationwide survey, others agree.
based on our research, a majority of the survey public policy professionals, smokers and general population adults support the concept of tobacco harm-reduction and prefer this policy approach over tobacco prohibition. but to achieve harm-reduction, we believe manufacturers must develop and the fda must authorized an array of potentially reduced harm products that can appeal to and transition smokers. this brings me to my next topic, the smoke-free opportunity in the u.s. and our smoke-free product portfolio.
today, over 20 million u.s. smokers seek less harmful alternatives to cigarettes. our strategy is to deliver a compelling portfolio of smoke-free products that offers a range of satisfying product choices for smokers and to responsibly lead them to these alternatives. our approach spans three of the most promising smoke-free categories with the potential to reduce harm: oral tobacco, e-vapor and heated tobacco.
in oral tobacco, we're encouraged by the growth of the novel oral products, which comprise more than a fifth of total industry oral tobacco volume in the second quarter. the category grew 6.8 share points year over year, with on! representing more than 40% of this growth. in the second quarter, on! reported shipment volume increased nearly 60% versus the year ago period. and on! retail share of oral tobacco increased eight-tenths sequentially, reaching 4.9 share points in the second quarter.
this represents a growth rate of almost 150% year over year. these strong results were driven by increased adoption of on!, increased brand awareness and higher levels of investment. helix achieved unconstrained on! manufacturing for the current u.s. market in the second quarter of 2021.
over the four quarters since then, helix enhanced the retail visibility and awareness of on!, leading to an over 70% increase in consumer awareness, tripled on! repurchases and continue to increase trial using transition marketing and data-driven strategies. and grew on! retail share to be a top five u.s. oral tobacco brand and solidified its position as the second largest oral nicotine pouch brand in each region of the u.s. more recently, helix launched the new carry on equity campaign, which encourages smokers to make progress in their transition journey.
the campaign highlights that by converting to on!, smokers can have nicotine satisfaction without having to step away from their daily routines, which addresses the social friction they experience with smoking. looking ahead, helix expects to use its understanding of the smoker journey, the smoke-free products to drive repeat purchases and adoption among smokers. we are excited about the performance of on! and the opportunity for future growth. i'll now move to the e-vapor category, which we continue to believe will be significantly influenced by regulatory actions.
in the second quarter, total estimated e-vapor volumes declined 2% versus a year ago and 7% sequentially as a result of decreased volume in the vape store channel, a reversal of the trend we observed in the first quarter. currently, slightly over half of the category's volume is comprised of pod-based products such as juul and vuse alto. within e-vapor, disposables represent the fastest growth segment since january 2020, which corresponds to when the fda issued in its guidance banning flavors only in pod-based e-vapor products. many of these disposable brands, including puff bar contain synthetic nicotine.
recent legislation, which we strongly supported, clarified the fda's authority to regulate tobacco products containing nicotine from any source. manufacturers of synthetic nicotine products were required to obtain fda authorization by july 13 to continue legally marketing their products. so far, no synthetic nicotine product has been granted authorization. and the fda has committed to pursuing compliance and enforcement action against companies found to be marketing, selling or distributing illegal synthetic nicotine products.
thus far, the fda has authorized only 23 total e-vapor applications, accounting for only eight products and approximately 1% of estimated e-vapor category volume. further, the fda has only authorized tobacco-flavored e-vapor products, most of which were for cigalike-style products, which we believe generally do not meet smoker expectations or deliver a satisfying product experience. given the limited number of authorizations today, we believe that the e-vapor category is still in its early phases. but with the support of reasonable regulations, we believe it could play in important role in harm-reduction.
moving forward, we hope to see timely science and evidence-based determinations from pending pmta application and further enforcement or noncompliant manufacturers. in the second quarter, juul products received marketing denial orders, or mdos. earlier this month, the fda administratively stayed the juul mdos citing unique scientific issues that warrant additional fda review. the administrative stay temporarily suspend the mdos during the additional review, but does not rescind them.
regarding our investment in juul, we recorded for the second quarter a noncash pre-tax unrealized loss of $1.2 billion as a result of a decrease in the estimated fair value of our investment. the decrease in fair value was driven by several factors including uncertainty created by the fda's action related to juul and uncertainty relating to juul's ability to maintain adequate liquidity. as of june 30, our estimated valuation is $450 million, which reflects a range of regulatory, liquidity and market outcomes. under the terms of our relationship agreement with juul, we have the option to be released from our non-compete obligation under several conditions including the fair value of our investments, if the fair value of our investment is not more than 10% of the initial carrying value of $12.8 billion.
however, if we elect to be released from our noncompete obligations, we would lose many of our investment rights, including our consent rights, our pre-emptive rights, and most of our board designation rights. at this time, we continue to believe that these investment rights are beneficial to us. therefore, we have not opted to be released from our non-compete obligations at this time, but retain the option to do so in the future in accordance with our agreement with juul. we continue to believe that e-vapor products, including juul, can play an important role in tobacco harm-reduction.
in heated tobacco, our teams remain in discussions with pmi related to iqos. we continue to believe in the potential of the heated tobacco category in the u.s. our plans remain on track to finalize designs by year-end for two product platforms within heated and oral tobacco and then begin regulatory preparations. our journey toward responsibly transition adult smokers to a smoke-free future continues.
and while we may face near-term challenges, we believe that the tobacco harm-reduction opportunity remains in front of us. as the leader in the u.s. tobacco industry, we have continued confidence in our ability to achieve our vision for several reasons, including our robust manufacturing, sales and distribution system and understanding of u.s. tobacco consumers.
our science-based approach to tobacco harm reduction, which we believe is aligned with tobacco consumers, society and the fda. our portfolio of products and investments across the most promising smoke-free categories and our significant cash flows and flexible balance sheet, which support our investments and shareholder returns. with these in mind and the resiliency of our organization, we believe we can lead the u.s. in moving beyond smoking.
i'll now turn it over to sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our results.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
thanks, billy. altria grew adjusted diluted earnings per share by 2.4% in the second quarter and by 3.5% in the first half across the challenging macroeconomic environment that billy described. the smokeable product segment continue to deliver on its strategy of maximizing profitability in combustibles while appropriately balancing investments in marlboro with funding the growth of smoke-free products. the segment grew its adjusted operating company's income by 0.6% in the second quarter, and 2.9% first half.
adjusted oci margins expanded by 0.7 percentage points to 59.1% for the second quarter and by 1.33 percentage points to 59.3% for the first half. this performance was supported by robust net price realization of 11.5% in the second quarter and 10.4% for the first half. i'll remind you that manufacturer price realization does not reflect retail price change for smokers. for example, marlboro net retail pack price increased 5.6% in the second quarter compared to last year.
smokeable products segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined by 11.1% in the second quarter and 8.9% in the first half, primarily due to changes in consumer purchasing behavior as a result of increased gas prices and inflation. when adjusted for trade inventory movements and factors, second quarter and first half domestic cigarette volumes declined by an estimated 10% and 9%, respectively. at the industry level, we estimate that adjusted domestic cigarette volumes declined by 8.5% in the second quarter and 7.5% in the first half. as billy mentioned marlboro displayed resiliency during a period of continued uncertainty for consumers.
in the second quarter, marlboro's retail share of the cigarette category grew a tenth sequentially to 42.7% while declining four-tenths versus the year ago period. additionally, marlboro grew its share within the premium segment to 58.1%, an increase of three-tenths sequentially and five-tenths versus a year ago. moving to the total discount segment. total share was flat sequentially even as gas prices rose significantly from the first to second quarter.
discount increased 1.3 percentage points year over year to 26.4% as we lapped the period when the discount segment contracted from smokers having higher disposable income. additionally, we observed increased churn between the branded and deep discount segments as a result of a deep discount manufacturer's exit from the marketplace earlier this year. in cigars, reported cigar shipment volume decreased by 5% in the second quarter due to macroeconomic pressures on consumer, disposable income, trade inventory movements and other factors. however middleton continue to provide a strong contribution to smokeable segment financial results.
in the oral tobacco product segment, adjusted oci and adjusted oci margins contracted in the second quarter and first half due to several factors, including declines in mst volumes, increased investments behind on! and unfavorable mix. we remain pleased with the strong overall margins for the segment as we made progress with on!. at the industry level, tobacco oral tobacco volume declined 0.5% over the past six months. we continue to observe steady growth from the oral nicotine pouch category, but this has been offset by declining mst volumes due to the challenging macroeconomic environment and its effect on consumer behavior, consumer movement to oral nicotine pouches and other factors.
total segment reported shipment volume decreased by 4.4% for the second quarter and by 3.2% for the first half. the segment's volume was -- volume decline was driven by declines in mst volumes, partially offset by the growth of on!. when adjusted for trade inventory movements, segment volume declined by an estimated 2.5% for the second quarter and 1% for the first half. the total oral tobacco product segment's retail share for the second quarter contracted two-tenths sequentially and 1 share point versus the prior year to 46.7%.
copenhagen is celebrating its 200th anniversary this year. we're extremely proud of copenhagen's long history and the fantastic employees who have supported the brand over the years. to them, we say thank you. after 200 years, copenhagen remains the no.
1 dip brand because of your hard work, dedication and passion. to honor this impressive milestone, the team introduced cop rewards, the first and only national rewards program for an mst brand. under the program, dippers can earn points by entering codes from their copenhagen cans and can redeem them for coupons or rewards. we're excited about cop rewards and its potential contributions to copenhagen's sustained leadership in mst.
turning to our investment in abi. we recorded $124 million of adjusted equity earnings in the second quarter. this was an increase of approximately 9.7% from the year ago period and represent altria's share of abi's first quarter 2022 results. we committed to creating long-term shareholder value through the pursuit of our vision and our focus on significant capital returns.
we demonstrated this commitment in the first half by acquiring intellectual property and other assets for a multi substrate heated capsule technology from poda. paying approximately $3.3 billion in dividends and repurchasing 21.4 million shares, totaling $1.1 billion. we have approximately $750 million remaining under the currently authorized $3.5 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by the end of this year. our balance sheet remains strong.
and as of the end of the second quarter, our debt-to-ebitda ratio was 2.3 times. in august, we expect to retire $1.1 billion of notes coming due with available cash. and lastly, our financial plans for the year remain on track and we reaffirm our guidance to deliver 2022 full year adjusted diluted eps in the range of $4.79 to $4.93. this range represents an adjusted diluted eps growth rate of 4% to 7% from a $4.61 base in 2021.
with that, we'll wrap up and billy and i will be happy to take your questions. while the calls are being compiled, i'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-gaap reconciliations are available all on altria.com we've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items. let's open the question-and-answer period. operator, do we have any questions?

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from chris growe with stifel. please go ahead. your line is open.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thank you. good morning. billy, i have a question for you, and you made a good point about -- it's clear we're at a very pivotal moment for this category. i was hoping to get just a better perspective from you and how you're investing today to be able to internally develop rrp, reduced risk products.
you've got some uncertainty around your positions in juul and iqos, and there's risk. those are no longer in your portfolio, certainly just a risk at this point. but i guess i just want to get a sense of what you're doing internally. and you talked about having a product already this -- at the end of this year.
and then to what degree maybe m&a could play a bigger role in giving you a better position in rrps going forward?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
hey, thanks for the question, chris. i think when you think about where we're investing, certainly, we invested in our innovation process. we have the internal development going on. and i've spoken previously about changing that innovation process so that it's laser-focused on the consumer.
it monitors the marketplace. but i think before we were -- i would characterize it as almost chasing the market versus sitting side-by-side with the consumer. and so there's a lot of consumer interaction, almost to the point of co-developing with the consumer in those categories that we can develop in. to your point, we can't develop, per agreement with juul, in the e-vapor category.
but it's something -- we continue to monitor the marketplace and understand consumer satisfaction with the various products in the marketplace. we monitor the entire globe as far as alternative products to both influence -- how we think about internal development, but looking for products that could be emerging in the other markets as well.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
and so would m&a be an important contributor, do you think, going forward for altria's position in this category?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
it certainly won't be off the table, chris. but i think for the investments we're making in our internal development, we feel good about the pipeline of products that we have.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and just one other question in relation to pricing in the cigarette category. it's been larger than expected, and it's occurred sooner than i expected, at least this year. and i guess in this environment where there's obviously a more burdensome kind of macroeconomic factor that's weighing on your volume, are you seeing a greater shift to some of the lower-priced or more highly promoted marlboro varieties? and do you see a need to have to increase promotional investments in light of the heavy pricing coming through in this environment?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. chris, its a good question and it's something we monitor. but i think when you look at the sequential performance of marlboro, and even the discount category, you saw sequential stability. marlboro actually grew a tenth and the discount category stayed flat.
so that were experienced first quarter to the second quarter. from a standpoint of the tools that we put in place with advanced analytics, we feel good about the position. sal raised an important point. when you think about the impact to the consumer and you think about industrywide, call it a 5% to 6% price increase, that's well below the inflation they're experiencing in other categories.
and you saw the results and their remarks of the -- where we went to the consumer and talked about how they think about the tobacco categories and other categories, and you see they continue to prioritize the tobacco category at the top of their list. and i think that's telling. and you it -- we get a lot of questions about the -- i think you have to step back and think longer term on this. if you think about marlboro's share, we're right where we were prepandemic, certainly during the pandemic as they received additional funds, whether that be from government or unemployment or things of that nature, it reinforced that marlboro's the aspirational brand.
so marlboro benefited during that period. certainly, we've given a little bit of that share back and feel satisfied with where marlboro is. we've really -- the teams in advanced analytics, as well as the marlboro team putting those into the marketplace, the stability of marlboro is incredible.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. thank you for all the color. i appreciate it.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thank you, chris.
operator
and we'll take our next question from pamela kaufman with morgan stanley. please go ahead. your line is open.
pam kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. good morning. so industry cigarette volumes have weakened considerably during the second quarter. you highlighted the headwinds facing smokers and how they're adjusting their purchasing behavior.
i guess how are you thinking about the outlook for cigarette volumes over the remainder of the year? and then related to that, how much more pricing do you think that consumers can tolerate just given so far, we really haven't seen a meaningful acceleration in trade down to the discount segment, it's been consistent over the last couple of quarters. do you see an accelerated risk of trade down within the category?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. let me see if i can unpack that a little bit, pamela, if i miss anything, please follow up. i think when you think about the cigarette volume declines that we saw to the first half, you look historically and when you see the environment, the macroeconomic environment changed for our consumer. you see that they make short-term adjustments and then they adopt to it through time.
i think, certainly through the first half, and we saw a little bit of a downshift in gas prices as we entered the third quarter, i think we've seen a correlation in gas prices just because our consumer is usually filling up their vehicle and then going in and making those purchases. but again, i think the research that we did is telling that the consumer is adjusting those behaviors to be able to prioritize their tobacco choices in the -- mostly in the c-store or gas stores. i think from a standpoint of pricing, and pamela, we've shared with you this before. if you look at minutes worked in the u.s.
and benchmark that around -- with other countries around the world that have mature tobacco categories. when you look at that, you still see that the u.s. is at the low end of that scale. so certainly, we feel like there's room to price, but that's something that we monitor.
you remember that the factors that we think about when pricing is the strength of the brand. certainly, corporate objectives play a part in that. but then we think about the economic health of the consumer and what those competitive activities do. and i think it's important to mention here again, the tools that we put in place.
we put out the price gap, we put out kind of national metrics. but with the advanced analytics, we're able to use those tools and be very specific. so it to be different in cleveland, ohio than in dallas/texas. because these tools allow us to adapt the retail promotions we put in the marketplace depending on what the individual consumers are feeling in that local area.
pam kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. that's helpful. definitely, i just wanted to ask about how you're thinking about the implications to your relationship with philip morris in the heat-not-burn category, given their planned acquisition of swedish match? and how are you preparing for changes in the competitive in the u.s.?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
well, pamela, you know this, as well as i do that it's always been a competitive marketplace. we always had major players. certainly, this brings a new major player to the marketplace, but we feel like we have the tools in place. so we're going to evaluate everything, make sure that we understand or at least game plan how, pam, i would approach, the marketplace using the products of swedish match and adapt accordingly.
i don't want to go much further than that for competitive reasons. i think from a standpoint of heat-not-burn, i shared in my remarks that we're continuing discussions with them about iqos.
pam kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer

and we'll take our next question from azer vivien with cowen. please go ahead. your line is open.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. good morning. i wanted to touch on -- billy, so your commentary around the improved trial through the expanded helix manufacturing capacity was interesting. i was curious if you could just expand and touch on repeat and how you're measuring that, given the promotional and the category.
thank you.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. vivien, it's a great question. i think when you think about on! our research teams are really looking repeat purchases versus a trial offers. and we want to have increases in both.
if you think about repeat purchases, we're very pleased with where we're at. certainly, to your point, as we're investing, you have those repeat purchases that take place and you want to see the concreteness of that. and we feel very pleased and enjoy the repeat purchases that we have. but we felt like there was still opportunity to drive awareness and you've seen the increase in awareness we've been able to drive.
and it's specific to the adult consumer that the product is product is very satisfying to the adult cigarette consumer, and we feel like there's still opportunity for trial there.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
understood. thank you. and then my other question is just on the industry outlook. i know you guys have shied away from offering industry volume guidance for a while now, and i fully appreciate why.
but if we look at the supplemental disclosures, estimated industry volume declines have nearly doubled over the course of the last 12 months, against a very challenging macrobackdrop. and that does account for it in the table that you've disclosed. i'm just curious so, has your thinking around the underlying macrodrivers changed at all?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
it has not, vivien. when you think about it -- and can take those quarters that we provide and stretch them back, and you thought -- and you saw macroeconomic was a benefit not that many quarters ago. so you certainly see the swing. it's no different than the swings we see through history.
you have the -- macroeconomic economic can be a benefit at times. we saw gas prices in 2015 were a huge benefit. and so i think the only thing i would point out is we're seeing a higher correlation with gas prices and purchasing behavior. that would be the only -- because historically, we tried to correlate gas prices to it.
and they were moving nickels and dimes at a time. i think you're seeing faster swings in gas prices so there's a correlation the consumer behavior as they adapt to the short-term nature of those changes.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
understood. that's helpful. thank you so much.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer

all right. thank you. good morning, everyone. i just have a question on your guidance.
you maintained your full year mid-single digit eps growth guidance, but that does imply the second half eps growth will need to accelerate versus the first half to hit the midpoint of your full year guide? so i just want to hear from you, what gives you the confidence this is going to happen, especially during an economic slowdown. i mean are your expectations that this will be driven from greater net price realization, assuming volumes remain pretty pressured or decelerate further? are there any expected cost savings that you're hoping to realize in the second half that you could share with us? and then just finally, how do we think about stepped up investments that you might be making toward your smoke-free vision. is that something that's factored into your guidance?
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
yeah. so bonnie, first, thank you for the question, and good morning.. i'll take you through how we think about guidance. so throughout the year, we have communicated that we expected the second half to really drive the growth of our eps on a year-over-year basis.
and just to remind you of a couple of factors that we are seeing in the back half of the year. one is, we begin to lap quarters where we had unconstrained manufacturing in the nicotine pouch category. also, in the fourth quarter we're, for the first time, going to be lapping a quarter without line income, right? that will happen in the fourth quarter. and then in the back half of the year, as inflation accelerated and we adjusted our msa inflation assumptions, you start to lap that in the back half of the year as well.
so there's some comparative factors that are part of the first half versus second half eps growth. as far as investments, spending isn't linear necessarily throughout the year, especially when you were making investments in infrastructure and things like that. so i definitely wouldn't look at one quarter spending when it comes to that and read into it. it is something that ebbs and flows throughout the year.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
all right. thank you. and then i did just want to ask about the -- i guess the uncertainty around your smoke-free future, given everything going on from juul to philip morris entering in the u.s. via swedish match, i guess, the dispute you have with philip morris as it relates to iqos.
this continues to be one of the key concern from investors. i know you've touched on this, but any more color you can provide or share with us as to your goal to kind of hit the smoke-free future or transform your business in the next, i guess, decade would be helpful. i mean i know with your agreement with juul now that the fair value is below the agreement, i think you have the ability to compete in the e-vapor market. so is that an option you're exploring? and then just maybe color -- a little more color on the timing as it relates to your heat-not-burn.
you mentioned it's in final design by the end of the year, and then you're going to begin regulatory preparations. but how long before you have a product that you can bring to the market, do you think? is that two years out, three years out? just trying to get a sense of some parameters as to how you're going to achieve your goal? thank you.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks for the question, bonnie. i think it's really important to step back, and i said it in my remarks, but let me add some color to it. the entire harm-reduction opportunity is in front of us in the u.s., and let me explain why i say that.
you remember in my remarks, i talked about the authorizations that have taken place in e-vapor thus far. and they represent 1% of the e-vapor category volume. so there's still 99% of authorizations that could go either way. and so that category will be in a bit of transition while we're waiting for the fda to make those authorizations, and then the outcome of those authorizations.
if you think about novel oral, yes, we're making progress and competitors are making progress, but we're still waiting for fda authorizations in that category. and so while we're making progress, there will be physicians from the fda regarding that category. and then heat-not-burn, while it's been gaining momentum internationally, it's nonexistent in the u.s. and so that's nonexistent.
so those are the three major growth categories. that's why i keep saying, i just wanted to add some color that the entire harm-reduction opportunity's in front of us. you're right to mention that we have development underway in two of those categories. we feel good about the pipeline.
i know you would love to see those products, and i would love to show them to you, and we will at the appropriate time. but we feel good about that. as i mentioned earlier, the co-development with the consumer in that space. i think with e-vapor, the color i would add there is -- and i mentioned it earlier, we've always monitored the marketplace to understand consumer satisfaction with the various products in the marketplace, both in the u.s.
and outside of the u.s. additionally, with this quarter with us going below, you're right, we have the option to get out of the noncompete. if we so elect to do so. and we really feel like in the process with the stay from the fda, and that decision's still looming, as well as the rights that i mentioned in my remarks, we believe are beneficial to us at this point in the process, but we'll continue to really gauge what our options are there and make decisions accordingly.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
all right. thank you.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thank you, bonnie.
operator
and we'll take our next question from priya ohri-gupta with barclays. please go ahead. your line is open.
unknown speaker
hi. this is [inaudible] on behalf of priya. and my question is, so based on your comments indicating that you plan to repay your upcoming maturity with available cash. how are you thinking about any subsequent need to access the market for refinancing? and i also have a follow-up after that.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
sure. and thank you for the question. i'm really not going to signal future capital allocation decisions. i'm happy to share how we think about capital allocation, which, of course, considers a number of factors in those decisions including marketplace dynamics.
we manage our balance sheet very carefully. we want to have a strong balance sheet. we want to continue to have investment-grade credit rating. so when we think about capital allocation, we take a balanced approach, and we've made the decision in august to use available cash to retire that debt, but future debt maturity towers, we'll analyze the marketplace at the time and make the appropriate decision.
unknown speaker
ok. that makes sense. thank you. and as a quick follow-up, where should we sort of expect you to manage your cash balance over the near term as this will likely bring it more in line with your prepandemic type ranges?
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
yeah. look, we are very fortunate in that we have operating companies that generate a significant amount of growth in cash. in a typical year, after paying our dividend and making the necessary investments, we traditionally have had, let's call it $1 billion in excess cash. and at the time, we make various decisions.
there are times where we've gone to the board and ask for a share buyback program. there are times where we've done some liability management to manage our maturity towers going forward, and strengthen the balance sheet. and there are times where we've made some investments such as the investment we made for the poda technology recently. so that's how we think about cash going forward.
but again, our operating companies do a tremendous job of generating cash flow for the shareholder and other stakeholders.
unknown speaker
all right. thank you so much.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
sure.
operator
and our next question will come from gaurav jain with barclays. please go ahead. your line is open.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
billy, good morning, sal. a couple of questions from my side. so look, we have had some discussion around the harm-reduction opportunity in front of us, and how it is very early. but if we really look where harm-reduction is really developing, it is all international because it's very hard to introduce new products in the u.s.
market because of the pmta process. but do you think that really to explore the harm-reduction opportunity, you need to go international, much like philip morris is entering u.s.?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. to your point, and i appreciate you recognizing that the pmta process and the entire harm-reduction opportunities in front of us in the u.s. it's something that we consider on a regular basis of how to get early consumer feedback outside of research in a live marketplace. and thus far, we've opted to go the route we are, which is with consumer research, but it's something that we consider on a regular basis.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
sure. and just also a follow-up on the questions around juul and potential end of exclusivity, and you also met -- referenced the synthetic nicotine market. and some of these companies have applied for pmtas, and can potentially get pmtas. so how do you think of synthetic nicotine as an ingredient? like is that a market you would like to explore? and if some of the companies get pmtas, that's an area you would like to enter?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. certainly, we were pleased that with the support that took place, that synthetic nicotine is now under fda authority. we believe in the process as far as the fda being able to assess the science and evidence. again, we watch all products that are in the marketplace, both in the u.s.
and internationally, to understand how the consumer is interacting with them, what benefits they receive from them as far as satisfaction, enjoyment, the brand itself. and so it's something that stays on our radar.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
ok. thanks a lot.
operator
[operator instructions] we'll open it for the media. we'll go next to jennifer maloney with wall street journal. please go ahead. your line is open.
jennifer maloney -- wall street journal -- analyst
morning. i wanted to follow up on your statement, billy, that m&a is not off the table for reduced risk products. and i wanted to ask specifically about the e-vapor category. would you be open to the possibility of acquiring an e-cigarette brand, for example, that already has fda authorization?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. while i don't speak to m&a in any regards. as i mentioned, look, we've always been monitoring the marketplace in the e-vapor space. we want to make sure we understand consumers' interactions with the various brands in the marketplace, whether they like those brands, whether they like the product -- satisfaction that those products give them.
now that we've written down this quarter below 10%, it affords us the opportunity to really explore those opportunities and make different decisions if we so choose. at this point in the process, we chose not to make any different decisions. we believe that where it's at in the process, as i mentioned earlier, with the fda today and relooking through the review process of the applications, as well as for -- some of our rights that we have as part of the agreement, we think those are beneficial. and we think, as we stated, the right decision currently is to stay under the non-compete.
jennifer maloney -- wall street journal -- analyst
for your smoke-free future goals, do you expect or plan to focus on one particular category, like is modern oral going to be the focus of your efforts there? or do you hope to play in all of the reduced-risk categories?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. we highlight that we see three categories right now as the growth potential in the u.s. that's the heat-not-burn category, the e-vapor category and the novel oral. certainly, they will be shaped by regulatory decisions, federal legislative decisions on excise taxes and future innovation in those categories from the various manufacturers.
so that will shape how large they are, but we see those as the three potential growth areas, and we look to participate in those. i would remind you that's why we work with the portfolio approach because we see consumers going from cigarettes to those various categories, and we want to be there for the consumer, depending on what category they choose.
jennifer maloney -- wall street journal -- analyst

good day, and welcome to the altria group 2022 third quarter and nine months earnings conference call. today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by altria's management and a q&a session. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to mac livingston, vice president of investor relations for altria client services. please, go ahead, sir.
mac livingston -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, katie. good morning, and thank you for joining us. this morning billy gifford altria's ceo; and sal mancuso our cfo will discuss altria's third quarter and first nine months' business results. earlier today, we issued a press release providing our results.
the release, presentation, quarterly metrics, and our latest corporate responsibility reports are all available at altria.com. during our call today unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2021. our remarks contain forward-looking, and cautionary statements, and projections of future results. please review the forward-looking and cautionary statements section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.
future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of altria's board. altria reports its financial results in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles. today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis. adjusted results exclude special items that affect comparisons with reported results.
descriptions of these non-gaap financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release and on our website at altria.com. finally, all references in today's remarks to tobacco consumers, or consumers within its specific tobacco category, or segment refer to existing adult tobacco consumers 21 years of age or older. with that, i'll turn the call over to billy. 
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thanks, matt. good morning and thank you for joining us. this is an exciting moment on our journey toward moving beyond smoking. tobacco businesses remained resilient during the first nine months of the year, and we continue to reward shareholders while making investments in pursuit of our vision.
we have deepened our consumer understanding, enhanced our capabilities, and built a science to support smokers' transition away from cigarettes. the tobacco harm reduction opportunity remains in front of us, and we continue to believe altria is uniquely positioned to responsibly lead adult smokers to a smoke-free future. our remarks this morning will focus on our progress today and some exciting steps we have recently taken, that we believe will accelerate our progress toward harm reduction. i will then turn it over to sal, who will provide further details on our business and financial results.
let's begin with the heated tobacco category. last week, we entered into an agreement with philip morris international, under which we will receive $2.7 billion in cash in exchange for assigning our exclusive us commercialization rights to the iqos system at the end of april 2024. we believe this agreement provides us with fair compensation and greater flexibility to allocate resources toward moving beyond smoking. the heated tobacco category is still undeveloped in the us and we believe we can lead in this space supported by our robust infrastructure and deep understanding of the us tobacco consumers.
this morning, we announced the pursuit of a global smoke-free partnership with jt group. we signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with jt, signifying the commitment of both parties toward further smoke-free collaboration. jt is a leading international tobacco company committed to investing, growing, and reducing risk products. we believe that together, altria and jt can accelerate global harm production by collaborating on all the product development, and global commercialization of smoke-free products.
we believe this potential collaboration can leverage the strengths and resources of both companies to transition more smokers away from cigarettes. as the first step in this partnership, we announce the formation of horizon innovations, a joint venture between altria and jt for the us commercialization of heated tobacco sticks or hts products. we believe that hts products can appeal to certain smokers as they provide a more familiar, tactile, and sensorial experience to cigarettes. under the terms of the jv, both parties will combine their scientific and regulatory expertise to jointly prepare pmta filings for the latest version of the ploom hts products, which are not yet commercially available.
the parties expect to file a pmta in the first half of 2025. upon authorization, horizon will become the exclusive entity through which the parties market and commercialize stick products in the us. jti will supply ploom heated tobacco stick devices and pm usa will manufacture marlboro hts consumables for us commercialization. the parties have agreed to commercialization milestones for horizon which include distribution requirements and minimal levels of cumulative marketing investment.
under the financial terms of the jv, pm usa has a 75% economic interest in horizon, with jti having 25%. we're excited about the prospect of introducing the latest version of ploom hts products to us smokers. jt has demonstrated success innovating in the heated tobacco space. for example, jt launched ploom x last year in japan, and since its introduction.
jt doubled its share of the japanese hts segment. jt estimates that there are more than 1 million ploom x consumers, and according to their research, these consumers perceive ploom x as a stylish, credible, and unique brand. consumers also describe the product as easy to use. we look forward to playing the newest version of this exciting product to us smokers.
we have discussed our increased focus and investment in an internal wholly owned heated tobacco product development. our approach puts the consumer at the center of everything that we do. we receive more data on their preferences, purchasing patterns, and friction points than we ever have. additionally, we embedded a rigorous regulatory scientist team early in the process to align our product development efforts with fda expectations.
we believe these efforts are building a promising pipeline of wholly owned heated tobacco products and intellectual property consisting of heated tobacco capsules for htc formats, and new-to-market technologies. we believe capsule products can appeal to smokers who are open to novel smoke-free products but have not yet found a satisfying alternative to cigarettes. this audience includes the millions of us smokers who tried but ultimately rejected e-vapor products. we expect to finalize the design of our first capsule product by the end of this year, and we expect to follow pmta by the end of 2024.
we also expect to partner with jt to launch this product in an international test market using jt's sales and distribution network. we plan to share more on this product platform once the design is finalized. we believe moving beyond smoking in the us requires multiple fda-authorized products within each smoke-free category to appeal to a diverse range of smokers and help them transition away from cigarettes. we believe that our pipeline of heated tobacco products and partnership with jt combined with these internal capabilities i described earlier positions us well to increase the adoption of smoke-free products for the millions of smokers interested in these products.
let's now move to the e-vapor category. in the third quarter, the total estimated e-vapor volumes declined by 4% versus a year ago and were flat sequentially. we believe the regulatory uncertainty related to juul caused market disruptions in the quarter, and we observed a reduction in juul purchases throughout the supply chain. we previously disclosed that we have exercised our option to be released from our non-compete obligations related to our juul investment.
while we retain our 35% economic stake in juul, we're exploring all options to build an fda-authorized portfolio of e-vapor products that will help smokers transition away from cigarettes. for example, our teams are conducting consumer research, performing external scans, and evaluating internal product development options. we're excited about the opportunity to increase our participation in the largest smoke-free category in the us. turning to oral tobacco, we remain encouraged by the growth of novel oral tobacco products, which grew a share of the total oral tobacco category for the 18th consecutive quarter.
the category grew 6.5 share points year over year and now represents approximately 23% of the overall oral tobacco category. in the third quarter, on! reported shipment volume increased by nearly 70% to 21 million cans. and on! retail share increased 3/10 sequentially, reaching 5.2 share points of the oral tobacco category in the third quarter. we believe these strong results were driven by increased brand awareness and adoption of on! supported by continued equity and promotional investments.
building on the second quarter launch of the carry on brand equity campaign, helix recently introduced on! rewards, a digital program that enables on! consumers to track the rewards balance online, and redeem their points for coupons for other items. we're excited about on!'s continued momentum, increasing brand loyalty, and the opportunity for future growth. let's now turn to our view of the regulatory environment. we continue to believe that more should be done to advance harm reduction in the us and that the fda should move more deliberately toward creating a market of authorized smoke-free products to help accelerate smoker transition away from cigarettes.
the fact remains that today only a small percentage of e-vapor volume has been authorized and no oral nicotine health products have received market authorization. we believe collaboration and accountability from all stakeholders are required for this market transition to take place. we also believe that smoke-free products should serve as an offering for smokers, not an on-ramp for new users. we remain encouraged that youth smoking rates in the us are at the lowest levels ever recorded.
in fact, the latest monitoring of the future study estimated that in 2021, the combined past 30-day smoking rates among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders was 2.3%, a nearly 92% reduction from its 1997 peak. additionally, data from the 2022 national youth tobacco survey indicate that while e-vapor usage remains high among middle and high schoolers, the levels were significantly lower than the peak observed in 2019. for the 2022 nyts survey, 50% of the middle and high school current e-vapor users indicated that they most often use disposable e-cigarettes, such as puff bar. moving forward, we hope to see timely, scientific, and evidence-based determinations on pending pmta applications across all smoke-free categories and further enforcement on non-compliant manufacturers.
a journey toward responsibly moving beyond smoking continues, and we're optimistic that the actions we have taken to date have strengthened our portfolio in the three major smoke-free categories. we have built a compelling portfolio and the heated tobacco enhanced our ability to compete in e-vapor and continue to strengthen on!'s position and the oral tobacco category. and we believe that we're able to maximize the value of these actions by leveraging our existing scale and infrastructure, such as our manufacturing centers and sales force. for example, our flagship richmond manufacturing center began production of oral nicotine pouches in 2020.
we now expect to add the production of heated tobacco sticks for our new jv. our sales and distribution system, driven by a world-class sales force, gives us the ability to responsibly market products in over 200,000 stores. and we have decades of experience navigating a dynamic us regulatory and political environment through the strength of our regulatory and government affairs organizations. these functions together with our many other talented employees give me confidence that we can achieve our vision.
before i conclude, i'd like to thank leo kiely for his distinguished service to altria's board. leo has served on the board since 2011 and will retire at the completion of his term early next year. i'd also like to welcome jase hernandez to our board of directors effective november 1st. jase brings a significant and deep understanding of the tobacco landscape following his years as an investment analyst covering the tobacco industry.
jase will serve on the finance and innovation committees. i'll now turn it over to sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our results.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
thanks, billy. i'd like to begin with a review of the macroeconomic backdrop and its impact on us tobacco consumers. in the third quarter, consumer discretionary income levels remained under pressure as higher gas prices and inflation persisted. however, we saw signs of continued brand loyalty in the tobacco space.
in september, we conducted research to understand how tobacco consumers were managing their spending in several categories, including tobacco, alcohol, groceries, and household items. our research indicates that tobacco consumers continue to stick with their preferred tobacco brands at a higher rate compared to other categories when experiencing higher prices. these results were consistent with the results from our previous surveys. we believe, inflation and the rise in gas prices were partially offset for some consumers by a strong job market and wage growth.
overall, average wages increased 6.9% in the third quarter, compared to an average 8.3% increase in cpi. and for some occupations, including the service industry, wage growth outpaced inflation. we continue to monitor tobacco consumer behaviors and change the marketplace conditions. despite these macroeconomic challenges, our core business has performed extremely well in the third quarter, underpinned by the strength of our premium brands marlboro, copenhagen, and black & mild continue to grow profitably, and on!'s momentum and growth reflect its strong positioning in the marketplace.
this strong business performance combined with fewer shares outstanding drove altria's adjusted diluted earnings per share results. altria grew adjusted diluted eps by 4.9% in the third quarter and by 4% in the first nine months. turning to our business results, the smokeable products segment continued to deliver on its strategy of maximizing profitability in combustibles while appropriately balancing investments in marlboro with funding the growth of smoke-free products. the segment grew its adjusted operating company's income at 1.8% in the third quarter and by 2.6% in the first nine months.
the smokeable products segment expanded its adjusted oci margins to 58.9%, an increase of 0.9 percentage points for the third quarter and 1.2 percentage points for the first nine months. this performance was supported by a strong net price realization of 10.2% in the third quarter and 10.3% for the first nine months. i'll remind you that manufacturer price realization does not reflect retail price changes for smokers. for example, marlboro's price per packet retail increased 6% in the third quarter compared to last year, which was below overall inflation for the quarter.
the smokeable segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined 9.2% in the third quarter and 9% for the first nine months, driven in part by the continued macroeconomic pressures i described. when adjusted for trade, inventory movements, and other factors. domestic cigarette volumes for the third quarter and first nine months declined by an estimated 10% and 9.5% respectively. at the industry level, we estimate that the adjusted domestic cigarette volumes declined by 8.8% in the third quarter and by 7.5% in the first nine months.
we believe it's important to analyze cigarette volume trends over the longer term as decline rates in any one period can be influenced by various factors. in fact, q3, year-to-date adjusted industry cigarette volumes have declined by an average of 4.5% over the past five years. in the third quarter, the total discount segment retail share of the cigarette category increased by 1.6 percentage points versus the year-ago period and 7/10 sequentially reflecting increased competitive activity and the challenging macroeconomic environment. we are encouraged that the discount segment was largely sourced from -- with just 1/10 sequentially and 4/10 versus the year-ago period.
we are pleased with marlboro's performance and stability over the long term. in the first quarter of 2020, marlboro's retail share was 42.5 percentage points. we believe that increased discretionary income, driven in part by government stimulus checks and lower consumer mobility, led to an increase in marlboro's retail share throughout the pandemic. as consumer mobility returned to pre-pandemic levels and federal stimulus checks ended, marlboro's share returned to its pre-pandemic levels and has remained stable through the subsequent quarters.
in fact, since the first quarter of 2020, marlboro has performed better than many of the other premium brands in the category. as a result, marlboro continued to grow its share of the premium segment to 58.4%, an increase of 4/10 sequentially and 7/10 versus a year ago. we believe its performance over the long term is a testament to its positioning within the premium segment as an aspirational brand with strong consumer loyalty. in cigars, recorded cigar shipment volume increased by 3.3% in the third quarter.
black & mild, continues its long-standing leadership in the profitable tipped cigar segment, and middleton continues to provide a strong contribution to the smokeable segment's financial results. turning to the oral tobacco products segment, adjusted oci grew 4.9% in the third quarter, but declined 3.4% for the first nine months, primarily due to higher investments behind on!. we're pleased with the strong overall margins for the segment and excited about on!'s performance in the marketplace. total reported oral tobacco product segment volume increased by 1.3% for the third quarter and decreased by 1.8% for the first nine months.
when adjusted for trade inventory movements in calendar differences, segment volume decreased by an estimated 2% for the third quarter and 1.5% for the first nine months. the oral tobacco product segment retail share declined 1.5 percentage points as declines in msp were partially offset by the continued growth of on!. turning to our investment in abi, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of approximately $2.5 billion for the third quarter in the first nine months of 2022. this impairment reflects the difference between the fair value and carrying value of our investment in abi as of september 30th.
we continue to believe that abi's share price performance is not reflective of its underlying long-term equity value and that abi's share price will recover. however, we believe that it will take longer than previously expected, as macroeconomic and geopolitical factors may continue to impact foreign exchange rates and abi's financial results and share price performance in the near term. as we have previously shared, we view our abi stake as a financial investment in our goals to maximize the long-term value of the investment for our shareholders. we remain committed to creating long-term shareholder value in the pursuit of our vision and our significant capital returns, which we demonstrated in the third quarter by paying approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and raising the dividend 57 times in 53 years, and repurchasing 8.5 million shares totaling $368 million.
we have approximately $375 million remaining under the currently authorized $3.5 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by the end of this year. our balance sheet remains strong and as of the end of the third quarter, our debt to ebitda ratio was 2.1 times. in august, we retired $1.1 billion of notes that came due with available cash. as billy stated we will receive $2.7 billion as a part of the iqos agreement.
we receive $1 billion upon entry into the agreement and will receive the remaining $1.7 billion plus interest by july 2023. our expected use of the cash proceeds may include investments in pursuit of our vision, debt repayment, share repurchases, or general corporate purposes. share repurchases depend on marketplace conditions and other factors and remain subject to the discretion of our board of directors. turning to our financial outlook, we are narrowing our full year 2022 guidance and now expect to deliver adjusted diluted eps in the range of $4.81 to $4.89.
this range represents a growth of 4.5% to 6% from a base of $4.61 in 2021. we believe this range allows us the flexibility to react to marketplace conditions. with that, we'll wrap up and billy and i will be happy to take your questions. while the calls are being compiled, i'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-gaap reconciliations are available on altria.com.
we've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory, and other items. let's open the question and answer period. operator, do we have any questions?
",":
operator
thank you once again. [operator instructions] we will take questions from the investment community first. our first question will come from bonnie herzog with goldman sachs. your line is now open.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everyone.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning, bonnie.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
a lot going on with a lot of announcements that i wanted to maybe touch on. what you announced this morning related to your jv with jt. i just was hoping, billy, maybe you can help us better understand the opportunity potential for htc versus hts formats and then the target consumers for each. and also i just wanted to verify something.
the timeline with i think htc is earlier and it's 100% owned and controlled by you, is that correct?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. so there's a lot in there, bonnie. so i'll take them in a reversal of the htc is 100% owned by us. it is not part of the jv.
i think when you think about hts and htc, you've got this huge group of adult smokers looking for products that satisfy their desires and needs. and so you have some that one unfamiliar experience as closest they can get to cigarettes and that's what we believe the hts product fulfills for them. there are other consumers and a lot of -- as we've pointed out before, a lot of consumers would never try to e-vapor. so they were willing to go with the new novel type of product.
and we believe htc fulfills those desires and needs and we actually see ways for both to be successful. and actually allows us to reach a larger group of consumers that are looking to switch.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. and then just a follow-up on that. how do we think about this potentially changing either your near or long-term growth algorithm? and then, i'm just thinking through it in terms of future investments required, i assume there will be some other than the initial 250 million to develop and ultimately commercialize these products. could you touch on that?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think, look, we're certainly are going to -- as we've said previously, but remember, our overall strategy, even in the smokeable products categories to maximize our income through time. but to make appropriate investments both in marlboro and balancing that with investments in the growth areas. so there are always puts and takes. i don't want you to take that all of the investments that we make are completely incremental from the p&l.
we try to leverage and we try to point out some of that in our remarks this morning. so, for instance, in the manufacturing center where we expanded our production for on! in that facility, the heat sticks for the jv will be produced by the manufacturing center. so there you have the infrastructure in place. you have a strong, talented group of employees that are familiar with one of those machines and you leverage from their investments and you have reallocation across the p&l, but it's not all incremental investment.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. and then just maybe my final question is related to your guidance, which you narrowed down this morning. you narrowed it slightly, i guess, 20 bps at the midpoint. you stated that just to give you more flexibility to react to marketplace conditions.
so i just wanted to maybe hear from you about what got a little bit worse, or uncertain. is it the pressures on the consumer or is there something else that we should be mindful of? thank you.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, i appreciate the question, bonnie. i think you could think of most of that narrowing as the passage of time, right? we have more certainty because remember, we're on the line with api and you saw them release results this morning. but certainly, it's no surprise that our consumers are under pressure and we want to maintain that flexibility. but nothing out of the ordinary that i would point out.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
all right, thanks. i'll pass it on.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from pamela kaufman with morgan stanley. your line is now open.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. good morning.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning, pamela.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
i wanted to follow up on bonnie's question and ask about how you were thinking about the evolution of the us tobacco market over the next 5 to 10 years. how do you think about the relative size of the e-vapor versus heat-not-burn categories over time? and now that you have greater flexibility to invest in e-vapor, given the non-compete termination with juul, and the partnership with jt? how are you going to prioritize your investment between heat-not-burn, and e-vapor?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, it's a great question, pamela, and i think it's important to remember as you step back, and that's what we tried to highlight in the remarks, that the reduced harm in the us is really undeveloped. and the reason i say that is from an authorization standpoint, taking the two that exist today, e-vapor and novel oral. a very low percentage has been authorized by the fda in e-vapor, and we believe that's going to go through a period of transition as those authorizations come out and some make it and some get denied. when you move to the novel oral, really no authorizations have been received in that space.
and so that, again, depending on how the regulatory body goes about assessing and authorizing those takes, that could be a bit of a transition there. and then in the heated tobacco space, it's really nonexistent. i think when you think about those three categories, we believe the extent of those three categories will really be shaped by three factors. so one i mentioned is the regulatory decisions that are taken in each of the individual categories.
between the legislative and tax policy, how does that develop through time related to the individual categories? and then, really through time is the innovation in the spaces that best address the consumer preferences based on what they desire. so that's really what's going to shape the size of the three individual categories. we believe those are the three categories that will grow through time as consumers continue to move away from cigarettes to smoke-free products. as far as prioritizing, we're going to prioritize based on where we see the consumer moving and how we see the consumer moving.
it's going to be completely consumer-driven and that's why we're excited to be able to leverage the sales force to get the products in the right stores, as well as the amount of data we receive and the insights that we can garner from those.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you. and my second question is on abi. do you previously expect the shares to recover and decided to hold onto your investment when your lockup expired? it seems that now you expect this recovery to take longer than expected.
so how does this impact your thinking around the investment? and does this further extend your plans to hold on to the stake, or increase your willingness to sell it at a lower price?
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
good morning, pamela. the impairment of the abi asset and the reduction in our carrying value is really accounting-driven. when you think about whether an impairment is temporary or not, you have to look at the timing of your expected recovery. as far as the abi asset, as we stated, we view it as a financial investment.
our focus is to maximize the value for our shareholders. but the share price value is one of many variables that go into that analysis. it's an analysis that we do on an ongoing basis, and we'll continue to focus on what's best for our stakeholders over the long term.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
and maybe i could squeeze one more in. can you just talk about what you plan to do with the proceeds from the iqos termination agreement and if there are any e-vapor assets that would be attractive to you to help accelerate your entry into the category? thanks.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
thanks, pamela. we mentioned them in our opening remarks, so i don't have a lot to add to that. i mean, obviously, the proceeds provide us with increased flexibility, which is always a good thing. so there's really nothing more to add.
and we're going to continue to look at all capital allocation through the lens of what's best for our shareholders, be it investments in our long-term vision, continuing to manage a strong balance sheet, or providing further returns to our shareholders. but again, that's part of our broader capital allocation strategies.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
you're welcome.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from chris growe with stifel. your line is now open.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi. good morning.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning, chris.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
good morning. i had a question for you. a bit of a follow on to the agreement with jt. obviously, very encouraging to get you back into that category.
given the timeline for the development of your products and obviously the fda review. do you have a reasonable timeframe for launching a product in the us? and if i could ask related to that, you have this international capability in terms of launching a product. so should we expect that you are able to develop products to kind of test and learn internationally to refine those for an ultimate pmta application in the us?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, chris, thanks for the question. and you're right, we are excited about the opportunities we have in front of us. i think when you think about the timeline for launch, so what we try to provide is when we would anticipate being enabled to file pmta then it will be dependent on how long it takes the fda to authorize those products. i believe through time, those authorizations will become more predictable and quicker whether that's the next product that they authorize or it takes a couple of for them to get used to the new categories remains to be seen.
i think when you think about the launch internationally, yeah, we're excited about the potential there for being able to test products in the market in the international realm. we're excited about the ability to act, whether it's in any of the new categories to be able to leverage that. but i don't want to get ahead of myself, we mentioned the memorandum of understanding about future collaboration, and we'll share more when it's appropriate to share.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
and just to be clear on that, billy, would it be -- given your timeline for when you expect the pmta and for the product you're developing, would it be reasonable to assume we'd see that like next year in the international market being tested at least and then moving to an application in 2024 or i'm getting too far ahead of myself here?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
i'd say you get a little bit ahead of yourself, i think, from an international launch. we tried to say, look when we would anticipate beginning our launch into international markets, maybe your question underlying that is why are you taking so long? and i think it really goes back to what we want to be this disciplined. we want to conduct preliminary studies to certify that we can consistently meet the high standards for product quality that we hold ourselves to, as well as the constituent reductions. and so we're going to go about it in a thoughtful manner.
but yes, we are excited to get it into an international market and look forward to it.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and i had a question just in relation to your just part of your guidance, this flexibility to react to current marketplace conditions. and as i look at your business today on the smokeable side, particularly, you're gaining share in the premium segment. obviously, premiums losing share though, overall.
so i guess, i think about where you need to invest, i would be curious, is it in the premium brands inventory category to take back share from the discount? or is it more on the discount side where you're losing shares, do you want to invest going forward?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, i understand your question, chris. i really wouldn't look at the narrow guidance as the passage of time. look, we wanted to make everybody aware that our consumers are under pressure, just like consumers across all industries. and we like the flexibility that's more the range we had maintained for the establishment of the guidance.
i wouldn't point out anything specific, we're very excited about the price realization we've been able to realize being on track for our guidance for the total year and the stability that marlboro's experienced in the marketplace. i mean, when you look at pre-pandemic to post-pandemic, and sal mention this in his comments when you saw government stimulus and less mobility in the marketplace, we actually saw it as encouraging. we weren't attempting to gain a share. we were performing the business like we normally do.
it shows that marlboro is still the aspirational brand in the cigarette space, and that's what we saw take place during the pandemic. as disposable incomes got a little bit tighter and mobility is up affecting that as well, we see that. we see that some of that share back, but pre-pandemic post-pandemic call it roughly flat, maybe up a 10th, and we're extremely pleased with where we're at.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. thank you for your time today.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from gaurav jain with barclays. your line is now open.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
hi. good morning.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning, gaurav.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
hi. so few questions for me. so first is on the oral tobacco pricing this quarter, which was, i think, up 5.5%, and it was flat and managed just 3% last year. and if i look at copenhagen's pricing, it is still running at the same level of plus 7%.
so does it mean that you are pulling back on promotions, or are you leaving actually on!'s pricing now that coming up as a part of the portfolio and it has hit maybe some critical market share?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. look, we're excited about what on!'s been able to perform, and how it's going to perform in growing the marketplace. certainly, with the learnings we've had in the other two categories where we have the analytics and the rgm tools that we have in place, we certainly see the opportunity to be able to find that in the new spaces as we gain volume and market share. and so overall, i think from a standpoint of the strategy and the whole space is really to maximize profitability through the long term with the strength of copenhagen while balancing investments with on!.
and i think that's exactly what you see taking place in that space.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
sure. my second question is on the logic mdo on menthol e-cigarettes focused and i appreciate it's not your product. but just broadly, like if fda now goes ahead and starts denying menthol e-cigarettes. would it make any sense to invest in us e-cigarettes right now because maybe all the menthol e-cigarettes get denied?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think it remains to be seen, and that's what we try to highlight for the size of each category. and you highlighted an important one that's in front of the entire industry in all of these faces regulatory decisions that will decide how large the individual categories can be. i would also highlight the other two. it's really legislative and tax policy and how does that mature through time? and then the last would be innovation.
but i hear you. and that's why we try to highlight those three factors that could ultimately decide the size of each of those categories relative to each other.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
sure. on the california flavor ban that could happen next quarter. how are you planning to approach that?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. so we've engaged with our government affairs team. we don't believe the science supports it from a standpoint and we've highlighted that and we've been pretty vocal with that, even with the fda as they've looked at some of these things. we think those decisions are better based on the fda where it's science and evidence-based.
but when you think about the overall category in california, certainly you can have an industry impact, but we, as a reminder sku non-menthol cigarettes and we sku non-flavored products and more smokeless space. so again, i think it could have an impact on the industry. the science doesn't support it, but i just wanted to remind you of our positions from an sku standpoint.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
sure. and if i could just squeeze the last one on capex, like you reduced the capex guidance slightly. would you be able to help us understand why that happened?
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
can you repeat that gaurav?
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
the capex number, the capex guidance was reduced. so what are the factors driving that?
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
yeah, if you think about capital projects core the spending is not necessarily linear, right? the projects are moving along quite well. the year time has passed throughout the year or three quarters through the year. so we just lowered our forecast for spending. so that's more timing.
the projects remain on track. of course, there are some delays in the supply chain when you're ordering equipment, but nothing material. we've been able to manage that quite well. so it's not uncommon for fluctuations in the capital forecast as the year progresses.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
sure. thank you.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
you're welcome.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from vivien azer with cowen. your line is now open.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. good morning.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning, vivien.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
so i also wanted to touch on the heat-not-burn, please. i apologize for the lack of imagination on my part, billy, but when you describe the htc capsules, it reminds me of the original ploom innovation that jt launched in 2016 and 2017. can you expand on how that's different if at all because that didn't really resonate with consumers in japan? thanks.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
sure. and i don't want to get too far ahead of myself. we'll come forward with the actual product and i know you'll be excited about it when we're able to bring it forward once we complete the design. if you think about the stick, that's pretty evident because everybody's seen that in the marketplace.
if you think about the capsule, the tobacco contained within the capsule is different than the technology. you're familiar with the ploom, but again, i don't want to get too far ahead of myself from a standpoint of describing the device before we're ready.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
okay, fair enough. but it is different in terms of nicotine flavoring.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
that is correct.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. perfect. thank you. i do look forward to seeing that for sure.
maybe just pivoting to the smokeable segment, please. understanding perfectly well that your objectives are really focused on profit growth. it's hard to ignore the fact that your price gap is now the highest it's been since 2009. and so i'm just curious how you think about operating leverage for that segment.
if modest market share declines are fine. you're right. obviously, on a three-year basis, declines haven't gotten that much worse. but, you're two years back and deteriorating on an industry-adjusted basis.
and so how do you think about operating leverage in that segment from a volume perspective? thanks.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, sure. i think when you look at the price gap, i just want to remind you, vivien, and i know this, but that the 40% price gap that we disclosed is really a barometer for the national level. we put that out because it allows you all to have a barometer of what we manage at much lower than that, i think you see as the introduction and execution against that analytics and the revenue growth management, most people refer to it as those tools that we have available, allows us to manage the price gap at a much lower level. and so that is, i think, what you're seeing in the success of the model market share through time.
and so we're extremely pleased with where we're at. we feel good about the performance of marlboro and being able to expand the price gap and increase the profitability through time, the way they're done.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
absolutely. and that segues though, explains my last question, which is on! the performance of the discount category, it's obvious that deep discount share gains are now reaccelerating. you've articulated, i think, very helpful, the puts and takes in terms of the backdrop of the consumer. but just any updates on how you're thinking about kind of strategically positioning your discount brands against that backdrop? thanks.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. and you'll recall vivien, and we're more premium focused. we participate in a discount because it's important for our retailers to have a portfolio that services all of their customers that visit their stores. but we're premium focused.
we ship, that we see the channel, and then we felt like we would see sharing and selling them as we increase profitability. but we're pleased with the increased profitability we've experienced on all of them and with the willingness to see some of that sure to deep discounts. you remember our consumers at the lower end of that socioeconomic status. loyalty is extremely high, over 90% for premium brands.
and so you always have that group of consumers when they get under pressure, we're going to shop around and move around depending on what their individual situations are.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
absolutely. thank you so much.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question will come from carla cassius with jpmorgan. your line is now open.
oliver brotman -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hi. this is oliver brotman on for carla. thanks for the question. just a couple for myself.
with regards to the announcement made last week on the agreement reached with philip morris. is there any risk to the remaining $1.7 billion that philip morris owed, could that value change between now and then?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, with that value, it was an exchange of $2.7 billion. the only thing that would change the $1.7 billion is the interest that would accumulate through time depending on when they made that payment. exclusivity remains with us until the final payments are made.
oliver brotman -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then just secondly on juul. while the non-compete is no longer in place and you're turning your focus to bearing options to build out the portfolio, you still retain that 35% stake.
is there a plan longer term that you would maybe do at that stake?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
ideally no plan at this point, we hold the economic stake. we'll see what their performance is in the marketplace. but we thought it was important at that point in time to get out of the non-compete to open up our flexibility in the e-vapor category.
oliver brotman -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
got it. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from priya gupta with barclays. your line is now open.
unknown speaker -- barclays -- analyst
hi. thank you for taking my question. this is auguste in for priya. one quick question.
you have a euro debt maturity early next year. do you need to have that euro exposure or could you be flexible in refinancing that in us dollars?
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
yeah. i don't want to get ahead of ourselves on that maturing debt. so how do we retire that debt and in the process we go through? we'll wait and see. obviously, we'll do the necessary analytics from a market perspective, and from a capital allocation perspective.
to your question, though, while we have flexibility on where we could issue debt, we do not necessarily need to have the euro exposure now.
unknown speaker -- barclays -- analyst
thank you. and one last one. what are your thoughts on the relative attractiveness of the us dollar market versus the european market in terms of swap rate?
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
well, obviously fx exchange rates are a factor that goes into that allocation. i don't want to necessarily predetermine which is more attractive, but for us, what's important is to have flexibility in the marketplace. we are fortunate in that we have a strong balance sheet. we've got operating companies that do a tremendous job of converting income to cash.
so as that comes due, we can refinance or we can think about other methods of retiring the debt. so for us, it is really the flexibility to determine how we want to handle that debt coming due. but also with markets we may or may not want to enter. fx exchange is definitely part of that process, though.
unknown speaker -- barclays -- analyst
thank you.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
you're welcome.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from callum elliott with bernstein. your line is now open.
callum elliott -- bernstein research -- analyst
hi. thank you for the question. i'd like to ask you guys a little bit more about horizon if that's ok. i guess our sense is it feels like giving away a 25% economic share is a huge amount, given that candidly this is a poorly performing product, a weak number for the brand globally without regulatory approval in the us.
and so hoping you can just talk about the drivers behind why you entered this jv, and how you arrived at a 75-25 economic split. it feels just to us and then based on the conversations we've had this morning with investors as well that this is going to be very difficult for this to be economically viable for you.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, we think about it a bit differently. i mean let me describe. you'll recall when we accrue large volumes across the nicotine space in the us it greatly reduces the decline rate. so if you look over the past five years, declined by about 1%.
we think it's important to have a portfolio of products in each of these categories and across the categories that attract consumers to them. from a standpoint of being able to participate in those categories and have strong products and brands across those categories, which will be a benefit to volume and attract a larger group of consumers to transition from cigarettes over to the smoke-free space. i think it's important to remember that the jv that's in place is for a product that hasn't even been commercialized yet as they continue to garner learnings and consumer insights and feedback. and so we're extremely excited and we think this is a foundation for future collaboration and potential exposure to international revenue as well.
callum elliott -- bernstein research -- analyst
ok. thanks for that. and i guess it's just one follow-up. unrelated one, if i get you to talk a little bit about cannabis as well, i think you obviously still have your stake in cronos, a 1% to expire in a few months because you really are not likely to exercise and given a way out of the money that.
but more broadly, my question is how you're thinking about the cannabis category has changed over the past three and a half years since you made that investment. and what is on the list of capital allocation priorities today?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think when you think back, we highlighted when we made that investment of cannabis that it was going to be a long-term investment. we still believe it has long-term potential in the us. certainly with the current political environment doesn't feel imminent that anything will switch in the us. i think the president made an important first step in some departments, but it's the first step and it's a lot more to take place before the industry dynamics change in the us to be able to capitalize on that.
so we still believe it has long-term potential in the us, but certainly, in the political environment, nothing is imminent.
callum elliott -- bernstein research -- analyst
ok. thank you.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] thank you. at this time, i would now turn the call back over to billy gifford for closing remarks.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, katie. i'd like to conclude our remarks by going back to where i started. we're in an exciting period of altria's history and have an unprecedented opportunity in moving beyond smoking.
we expected our actions to lead to a strengthened portfolio across the three major smoke-free categories that will help smokers transition away from cigarettes. in heated tobacco, we believe we have taken a huge step forward with our new joint venture with jt and our internal product development efforts. we now have the ability to compete in the e-vapor category and are already assessing our options in this space. and we have demonstrated progress in the growing novel oral category with on!'s continued growth.
i continue to be confident in my belief that we can achieve our vision and create long-term value for our shareholders. thank you for joining us and have a great day.

operator
good day, and welcome to the altria group 2022 fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call. today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by altria's management and the question-and-answer session. representatives of the investment community and media on the call will be able to ask questions following the conclusion of the prepared remarks. i would now like to turn the call over to mac livingston, vice president of investor relations for the altria client services.
please go ahead, sir.
mac livingston -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, todd. good morning. and thank you for joining us. this morning, billy gifford, altria's ceo; and sal mancuso, our cfo, will discuss altria's fourth quarter and full year business results.
earlier today, we issued a press release providing our results. the release, presentation, quarterly metrics, and our latest corporate responsibility report are all available at altria.com. during our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2021. our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results.
please review the forward-looking and cautionary statements section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of altria's board. altria reports its financial results in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis. adjusted results exclude special items that affect comparisons with reported results. descriptions of these non-gaap financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release and on our website at altria.com. finally, all references in today's remarks to tobacco consumers or consumers within a specific tobacco category or segment refer to existing adult tobacco consumers 21 years of age or older.
with that, i'll turn the call over to billy. 
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thanks, mac. good morning. and thank you for joining us. it was an exciting year for altria as our businesses delivered strong financial performance, and we continued to strategically invest toward our vision.
we grew our adjusted diluted earnings per share by 5%, and our tobacco businesses remained resilient and successfully executed their strategies. we also returned significant cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. last year, we returned more than $8.4 billion to shareholders, outpacing our record returns from 2021 and representing the largest single-year cash return since 2002. our vision guided our actions, and we believe we made meaningful progress on our journey toward moving beyond smoking.
our teams took several steps forward during the year, including accelerating the growth of on! nicotine pouches, creating long-term optionality for our inhalable smoke-free product portfolio, enhancing our digital consumer engagement, and continuing to advocate for tobacco harm reduction. helix grew on! reported shipment volume to 82.5 million cans during its first full year of unconstrained manufacturing capacity, an increase of more than 70% versus the prior year. at retail, on! share momentum continued in the fourth quarter as the brand reached 5.9% of the total oral tobacco category and 24% of the nicotine pouch category. this impressive performance was driven by continued increases in brand awareness and adoption by smokers and dippers.
additionally, we believe helix effectively managed on! promotional spend as the year progressed and reduced on! promotional spend per can by approximately 15% during the second half of the year compared to the first half. in oral tobacco product development, we are excited to announce we have finalized a new product design, which will provide tobacco consumers more smoke-free options within our portfolio. we also began regulatory preparations for the product, and we are encouraged by the initial research results and the response we have received from dippers and nicotine pouch users. we look forward to sharing more details and unveiling this innovative product at our investor day next month.
turning to our inhalable smoke-free portfolio. we created long-term optionality in the heated tobacco and e-vapor spaces. internally, we have not yet finalized the design of our heated tobacco capsule product, but our teams continue to make progress. the consumer remains the focal point of our innovation system.
and our teams are tailoring the product to appeal to smokers who have not yet found a satisfying alternative to cigarettes. we also look forward to unveiling this exciting new product at our investor day next month as well. and in october, we announced a strategic partnership with jt group, including a joint venture for the u.s. commercialization of heated tobacco stick products.
we're encouraged by the initial collaboration between our teams and the pace at which they are operating. horizon is optimizing team for the u.s. market and plans to begin regulatory preparations later this year. we're excited about the opportunity and are working diligently to bring ploom to smokers in the u.s.
in e-vapor, we previously announced we elected to be released from the noncompete obligations related to our juul investment. we retain our economic stake in juul. e-vapor remains the largest smoke-free category in the u.s. and the most successful category in transitioning u.s.
smokers away from cigarettes. we believe the category can play an important role in harm reduction, and we're continuing to evaluate all options to best compete in the category. next, let's discuss the progress we made to enhance our digital consumer engagement. we launched a new digital trade program last spring, and we believe this program enhances our ongoing commitment to responsible retail.
the program includes multiple participation options for retailers. for those participating at the highest level, we introduced incentives for retailers to include age and identity verification solutions in their digital platforms. and once the consumer is verified, retailers can then provide offers and messaging from our brands within the retailer's app. i'm excited to share that we implemented these solutions in more than 33,000 stores, exceeding the goal we outlined last year at cagny.
currently, consumers can view offers from our smokeable and more smokeless tobacco brands. but going forward, we expect to expand the program to include on! and other smoke-free brands. as we continue to broaden our digital reach, data will help us better understand each smoker's journey and help them successfully transition to other smoke-free alternatives in our portfolio. moving to the regulatory environment.
we remain optimistic about the future of harm reduction in the u.s. we believe we have an unprecedented opportunity to lead the way in shifting millions of smokers to smoke-free alternatives, if we follow the science and foster innovation with the support of reasonable regulation. in december, the reagan-udall foundation published its operational evaluation of the fda's center for tobacco products. we were among the stakeholders who provided input into this evaluation.
among its recommendation, the report urges the fda to clearly define product pathways and accelerate pmta decision-making, take enforcement actions against manufacturers and products in violation of the law, and address the need for risk communications to tobacco consumers. we agree these are important opportunities and believe that the fda should direct its focus toward implementing a framework to advance harm reduction, rather than focusing on prohibition policies that we believe will further expand the illicit market and create other unintended consequences. let's now move to the operating environment. we estimate that total equivalized tobacco volumes declined 6% for the year and 1.7% over the past five years on a compounded annual basis.
combustible volumes declined by an estimated 7.8% last year as smokers faced increasing economic challenges. we are encouraged that smoke-free volumes were stable compared to the prior year at 3.8 billion equivalized units and now represent an estimated 26% of the total tobacco space. e-vapor has been a major contributor to the growth of smoke-free products over the five-year period, although volumes declined by an estimated 1% year over year amid considerable regulatory uncertainty, such as the fda from denial order and subsequent temporary stay on juul products, which caused market disruptions for both consumers and retailers. in oral tobacco, volumes grew by an estimated 1.5%, driven by the continued adoption of on! nicotine pouches.
turning to our financial outlook. our plans for 2023 include a continuation of our strategy to balance earnings growth and shareholder returns with strategic investments toward our vision. for 2023, our planned investment areas include continued smoke-free product research, development, and regulatory preparations; digital consumer engagement; and marketplace activities in support of our smoke-free products. we believe the external environment will remain dynamic in 2023.
we will continue to monitor the economy, including the impact of high inflation, tobacco consumer dynamics, and regulatory and legislative developments. considering these factors, we expect to deliver 2023 full year adjusted diluted eps in the range of $4.98 to $5.13. this range represents an adjusted diluted eps growth rate of 3% to 6% from a $4.84 base in 2022. before i turn it over to sal, i would like to send a sincere thank you to our employees.
i continue to be impressed by the talent within our companies and our ability to adapt and overcome challenges in a dynamic operating environment. the passion and dedication of our employee base is evident, and i'm confident in our ability to execute our vision because of you. also, i'd like to honor the memory of leo kiely, the long-standing member of our board who recently passed away. leo served on our board since 2011 and made many contributions to altria, including as chair of the compensation and talent development committee and as a member of the innovation committee.
we will miss his leadership, guidance, and friendship. i'll now turn it over to sal.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
thanks, billy. we were very fortunate to have leo's 12 years of service at altria, and our thoughts remain with the kiely family. moving to our results. our tobacco businesses generated strong financial performance again this year and were responsive to changes in a dynamic external environment.
in the fourth quarter, the smokeable products segment grew its adjusted operating companies income by 4% and expanded its adjusted oci margins to 58.4%. the segment also reported robust net price realization of 13.5%. as a reminder, manufacturer price realization does not reflect retail price changes for smokers. for example, marlboro net retail pack price increased 6.4% in the fourth quarter compared to last year.
we continue to successfully execute against our strategy in the smokeable segment, maximizing profitability while balancing investments in marlboro with funding the growth of smoke-free products. for the full year, smokeable segment adjusted oci grew 2.9% to $10.7 billion, and adjusted oci margins expanded by 1.4 percentage points to 59%. in smokeable segment, net price realization for the year was 11.1%. in addition, over the past five years, the smokeable segment has grown adjusted oci by $2.2 billion, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 4.7%.
over the same time period, adjusted oci margins have expanded from 51% to 59%, an impressive increase of 8 percentage points. turning to volumes. our smokeable products segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined 12.1% in the fourth quarter and 9.7% for the full year. when adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movements, domestic cigarette volumes for the fourth quarter and full year declined by an estimated 11% and 9.5%, respectively.
at the industry level, when adjusted for trade inventory movements, calendar differences, and other factors, we estimate that adjusted domestic cigarette volumes declined by 9% in the fourth quarter and by 8% for the full year. next, let's discuss retail share performance. full year retail share for the industry discount segment increased 1.4 share points. we believe these results were driven by an increased pressure on smokers' disposable income and increased competitive activity, including multiple branded discount offerings priced at deep discount levels.
marlboro retail share declined by 0.4 for the full year. most of the full year share losses were attributable to the value options within the marlboro brand family, such as special select and marlboro 72s, as some price-sensitive consumers continue to seek additional price relief. meanwhile, the brand's mainline nonmenthol offerings, including the iconic red and gold pack varieties, were resilient and performed well for the year. marlboro's share of the premium segment grew to 58.2% for the full year.
marlboro has performed better than many other premium brands over the last several years. in fact, over the past three years, marlboro grew its share of premium by 1 full share point. we are encouraged by marlboro's resilient performance as the brand celebrates 50 years of leadership in the cigarette category. in cigars, reported cigar shipment volume decreased 4% for the full year.
while black & mild continued to maintain its leadership in a profitable machine-made tip cigar segment. next, we will move to the oral tobacco products segment. full year segment adjusted oci and adjusted oci margins contracted as we continued to invest behind on!. total segment reported shipment volume declined 2.4% for the year as growth in on! volume, which more than offset by lower reported msp volumes.
when adjusted for trade inventory movements and calendar differences, we estimate that full year total oral tobacco segment volumes declined by an estimated 2%. full year oral tobacco products segment retail share declined 1.3 percentage points as declines in mst were partially offset by the continued growth of on!. within the traditional smokeless category of mst and snus products, copenhagen's share performance has been stable over the last three years, declining only 0.3 from 2019, whereas the second largest traditional smokeless brand has ceded 1.6 share points. overall, we continue to be encouraged by the performance of our oral tobacco products as on! grew volume and share in a competitive category and copenhagen remained the category leader.
turning to our investment in abi. we recorded $571 million of adjusted equity earnings for the full year, down 10.6% versus 2021. we continue to view the abi stake as a financial investment, and our goal remains to maximize the long-term value of the investment for our shareholders. in our all other operating category, we have completed our wind-down of philip morris capital corporation, and no finance assets remain.
i would like to thank the many pmcc employees who contributed to its success over the years and to the other altria employees who helped complete a successful wind-down. finally, we continue to effectively manage our balance sheet while generating strong financial performance and returning significant cash to shareholders. these results were driven by our tobacco businesses that continue to be highly cash generative. our year-end credit metrics remain strong.
our debt-to-ebitda ratio was 2.1 times, down 0.4 over the past three years. and our weighted average coupon was 4%, a decrease of 0.2 over the past three years. we also expect to retire approximately $1.3 billion of notes coming due later this month with available cash. in addition, we returned more than $8.4 billion in cash to shareholders last year through dividends and share repurchases.
these record cash returns included paying $6.6 billion in dividends and raising the dividend for the 57th time in 53 years. we also repurchased more than 38 million shares during the year, totaling $1.8 billion, which completed our previously authorized program. earlier this week, our board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by the end of 2023. i'll now turn it back to billy to conclude our remarks.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thanks, sal. while the calls are being compiled, i'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-gaap reconciliations are available on altria.com. we've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory, and other items. as we mentioned during the call, we have exciting topics to discuss at our investor day next month.
we look forward to having a fulsome conversation about our smoke-free future, and we are excited to share more about our journey toward moving beyond smoking. todd, we'll now transition to the q&a period.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from vivien azer with cowen.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. good morning.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning, vivien.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
so, i just wanted to start with the industry volume backdrop. i recognize you guys have kind of suspended the historical practice of offering industry guidance, and that makes good sense to me. but just hoping to get some color on how you're thinking about the potential impact of the menthol ban in california if you think that's an incremental headwind for the year. thanks.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
sure. yes, i think it's a little early to say exactly what that headwind will be, vivien. certainly, it will be a headwind from the state of california having banned it. it went into effect, you remember, in december.
so, we'll see how that proceeds. but yes, i would say that would be a headwind as we enter 2023.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
fantastic. thanks for that. and then just pivoting to the oral tobacco segment, encouraging to hear some rationalization on the on! promo having fallen 15% into half '22. can you offer a little color on where that positions on! relative to the competitive set?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. we think it's -- it actually -- we were very pleased with the results we -- as you mentioned, we reduced it 15% first half to second half, and it continued its momentum and grew share. we think it's a growing category, vivien, and that the entire segment is growing, and we want to participate in that growth. so, we're continuing to invest behind it.
and as we move forward, i think you see the benefit of data analytics, and then, in the future, the application of what most people refer to as revenue growth management that we've seen success in traditional smokeless as well as cigarettes. so, that's what you can expect from us as we move forward.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
perfect. thanks a lot, billy. and just one last one for you, sal, please, i recognize it's premature for us to start modeling royalties from the ip litigation with british american tobacco because there's certainly an appeals process. but if you could just contextualize how we should be thinking about that incremental revenue stream as litigation draws to a conclusion, please.
thank you.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
yes, sure. vivien, you're right, there is an appeals process. you know, we developed our guidance. we have not considered the royalty, any potential royalties in that guidance.
but, as you know, with any year, you put plans in place, and there are always puts and takes. so, i think it's early to really think about how you might model that. let's see how the appeals process plays out.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
fair enough. thank you so much. looking forward to the analyst day.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from pamela kaufman with morgan stanley.
pam kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
good morning.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning, pamela.
pam kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
how would you characterize the current state of your consumer? and this builds on vivien's question, but just wanted to hear how you're thinking about the puts and takes to figure out volumes in '23. volume declines were clearly very elevated in '22. so, do you expect a more normalized year of mid single-digit volume declines, given easier comparisons and moderating gas prices?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. vivien, i know you're looking for -- i'm sorry, pamela, you're looking for guidance on upcoming volume. let's talk about the headwinds and tailwinds as we progress through the year. i'll talk about the consumer first because that's the most important when you think about volume.
i think the consumer remains under pressure. you know, we tried to highlight that it was the compounding of the inflation's impact as we progressed through 2022. i think you've heard as many predictions as i have had, soft landing, no deep recession. so, i think even the experts, from an economist standpoint, are all over the board.
we feel good about the guidance that we put out. we feel good about where the consumer is, but we want the adaptability and the flexibility to be able to move with the consumer needs. so, i think the consumer will remain under pressure until we see some relief, if you will, from inflationary pressures in the marketplace. gas prices is just one aspect.
that's -- you know, we certainly have seen a decline, but nowhere near the lows we were seeing as we were pre-pandemic levels. so, gas prices can move around depending on china reopening and things of that nature. so, we'll see where that goes. i think when you think about volumes, and specifically combustible volume, it's important to remember that what we're looking at is how the consumer is impacted.
tobacco, the industry, is not immune to macroeconomic environment. it's just less impacted than other industry categories. and so, from that standpoint, historically, what we've seen, pamela, is that as the consumer is experiencing this rapid change in their economic condition, whether up or down, they make changes in their purchasing behavior. and then, it becomes more comfortable to them through time, and they adjust various factors in their purchasing basket.
so, it remains to be seen. we'll see how the macroeconomic shapes up. but i would say that's the biggest thing and how that macroeconomic impacts purchasing behavior.
pam kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. that's helpful. and my other question is just on your 2023 earnings guidance, which reflects a slightly lower growth rate compared to your 4% to 7% guidance over the last several years. so, can you talk about the puts and takes influencing the outlook for '23? and how much incremental investment does this reflect behind reduced risk? and are there any other discrete factors contributing to the slight shift in the growth rate?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think, the last comment you made, i would say there's a slight shift. we're very excited about the guidance we put out. i think when you think about it, it's really the uncertainty around the macroeconomic environment was the biggest impact to the overall guidance.
and you've mentioned it, and you asked about that earlier. it's where does the macroeconomic environment go through as we progress through 2023, and how does that specifically impact our tobacco consumer across all categories.
pam kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from bonnie herzog with goldman sachs.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
all right. thanks. good morning, everyone.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning, bonnie.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
i had a question about, you know, your pricing. just thinking about the strength in your net price realization and smokables over the past several quarters, it's been so darn robust. so, i just wanted to hear from you how sustainable you think this is, especially in considering, i guess, the pressure on the consumer and some of the other things you called out.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
sure, bonnie. and i'll be careful not to talk about future price increases. but the way we think about pricing, as you know, it's an important part of the algorithm when you're in a declining category. remember, our strategy in that category is maximize profitability over the long term while making appropriate investments in marlboro in the growth areas.
so, we see that as the engine that does that. when you think about pricing, i think it's important to really focusing on what sal mentioned in his remarks. you see high price realization. but at retail to the consumer, from a consumer-facing, marlboro, on average, went up about just shy of 6.5%, 6.4%.
so, the price increase to the consumer is much lower than what you see in the price realization. and, you know, we mentioned before price realization is really two components for us. it's list price, as you would expect, across the industry, but it's also the implementation of rgm. and so, with that price realization -- and usually, bonnie, you or one of the other analysts will ask us about price gap, and it's at 41%.
i think it's important to remember, as we get the data and really that data -- that's somewhat impersonal. it's consumer purchasing behavior through time. as we analyze that, what we're able to do is the price gap varies locality to locality. it can vary store to store, and it can vary within -- even within the marlboro franchise.
you know, you heard sal talk about -- if you think about that overall price gap of 41%, you have the packing. so, take red and gold in the marlboro franchise. if you look at total year 2022 to total year 2021, you can see it was very stable. where we're seeing it is in those packings or skus we have within marlboro that are there for price-sensitive consumers to have a safe landing point.
and so, we'll continue to implement those tools. as far as how do we think about pricing going forward, you know, we've shared with you whether it's percent of discretionary income, a minutes work. and when you benchmark the u.s. against other countries around the world, we're still at the very low end of that.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. that's actually super helpful. and that was going to be a question. i'm pleased you kind of walked through the gap.
that's useful context. just switching gears, if i may, a question on your oral tobacco business. you know, you highlighted how strong, you know, on! volume growth has been and -- but in the context of that, your total oral tobacco revenue and, you know, profit growth has been under pressure with a fair amount of margin contraction. so, you did sort of touch on this.
but hoping maybe you could talk a little bit further about, you know, maybe your strategy for turning around the entire, you know, oral tobacco business. you know, any key initiatives that you could highlight for us, and maybe you'll talk about this more in march.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. we will -- we're certainly excited to be able to talk about it in march. you're exactly right. within the old tobacco space, if you think about that total space, you have traditional moist smokeless tobacco, and you have novel oral pouches.
some of the margin contraction you're seeing is just true mix, right, as consumers are moving from traditional moist smokeless tobacco, and novel oral is growing. you're going to have some mix impacts in that overall margin. we highlighted for you the reductions we made in promotional spend per can, but still had the minimum share. i think the biggest thing that we're excited is to be able to unveil the product that we have designed and have locked down and be able to show at investor day what that product is and some of the research related to that.
so, more to come at investor day.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. final one for me, just, you know, speaking of that. any more color you could provide, you know, on your smoke-free vision today and maybe just how confident you are that you're going to be able to deliver on your long-term strategy? you know, i'm sure you're going to talk through this in an investor meeting, and i'm excited to hear about it. but any sneak preview as to what you're most excited about?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
i won't necessarily give you a sneak preview because i don't want to get ahead of myself for investor day. we'd like to unveil it in total context and paint the solid picture for investors. so, i appreciate the question. i look forward to being to unveil that for you at investor day.
bonnie herzog -- goldman sachs -- analyst
all right. i'll be patient. thank you.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thanks, bonnie.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from callum elliott with bernstein.
callum elliott -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
hi, guys. thank you for the question. billy, you spoke in the release and in your prepared remarks about making ""meaningful progress"" on the smoke-free portfolio. and you also mentioned strategic investments in the division.
but at the same time, your capex guide is flat versus last year's guidance. you're continuing to deliver all algorithm eps growth. and i think as you said to pam that any slight reduction is more driven by the macro environment, which, presumably, also implies little or no incremental p&l investment in ngps as well. so, my question is, what are the strategic investments that you're talking about? how meaningful are they? and where can we see them in the financial statements?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think it's a great question. i appreciate it. i think when you think about where those investments show up, it's important to remember, they're not all incremental spend.
they're always puts and takes. they're going to shift some of those -- the infrastructure that the combustible or traditional mst has bore the cost through history, and you're going to shift that to the ngp space. we do have incremental investments around ngp product development, the regulatory preparations associated with that, and the research associated with that. here's an example for you, callum.
if you think about like even the digital consumer engagement, that we're implementing in traditional smokeable or combustible and mst, and we mentioned in the remarks being able to transition that over. so, you'll see those costs will actually appear in the combustible and the smokeless before it appears in the ngp categories. so, there's a lot going underneath the surface, if you will, from an investment standpoint. but there are always puts and takes.
we're trying to be wise with the investment but not restrict growing categories.
callum elliott -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
so, thanks a lot, billy. i guess, the natural follow-up is, if i benchmark relative to your big competitors, both in the u.s. and internationally, the two biggest among them are spending literally billions of dollars a year. and my guess is, instinctively, if you're just talking about switching a portion of your cigarette spend, over into ngp, you're not going to get anywhere close to that billions of dollars a year.
and so, the question is, you know, do you genuinely believe you can be successful if you're spending so much less than those competitors? and then how?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah, we do believe that we're trying to really be driven by the consumer, learning from the global marketplace of products in the marketplace, and use those as, if you will, a launch point for products, and really trying to meet what the desires and needs of the consumers are in the marketplace that aren't met by those existing products in the marketplace. and so, we feel like we can achieve the vision. we've highlighted for you guys that we really believe we can navigate strong returns to shareholders at the same time, making the appropriate investments in these growing categories. and we believe we can do that.
i think you'll continue to hear us talk about investments, and we'll provide a lot more detail of some of the progress we've made at investor day.
callum elliott -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
ok. thank you.

thank you. our next question comes from gaurav jain with barclays.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
hi. good morning, billy. good morning, sal.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
hi. so, i have three questions. so, first one to you, billy. you know, we will have a new competitor next year in the u.s.
market with iqos. and when you were distributing iqos, then the volumes were much lesser than any of us had expected. so, what did you find were the challenges when u.s. consumers came to iqos?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. it's a great question. i appreciate you asking it, gaurav. i think when you think about iqos, it was really about the disciplined approach that we were taking to introduce in a brand-new category.
the consumer in the u.s. was used to the e-vapor space. they had understood that. when you're introducing a new category that requires some education on how to use the product and how to maintain the product that, there is investment there that takes place.
and, you know, we talked about the learnings we had as we went along the way. but i would say the biggest challenge is educating the consumer on the product and then meeting their desires. and i think there's still unmet needs in the marketplace.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
sure. the next question and, perhaps, to you, sal, is around msa payments next year and how we should factor in inflation? and if you could just help us understand because i think there is confusion that how does that 3% number work versus inflation. or is it the change of inflation that we should be looking at?
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
gaurav, you are correct to point out that inflation is a factor when you think about msa expense. you know, a couple of points i'll make. one is the high rate of inflation in 2022 has been accounted for and is already in the base. you are correct to point out that when you think about inflation related to msa, there's 3% floor.
so, even if inflation were measured below 3%, there'd be a 3% increase in the msa expense. and i'll also remind you that inflation is measured at a point in time, december 31st current year to december 31st prior year. so, we have considered that when you think about 2023, there will be an elevated level of inflation. we have seen some receding of the rate of inflation, but still expect it to be elevated.
so, we have considered that when we put together our guidance. and then, finally, i'll say, you know, there are other factors besides inflation to consider when you think about msa expense, including volume, shipment share, and other such factors.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
sure. and my last question is on share repurchases for next year, which at $1 billion or below what we thought and, i think, where most people were. and even though your ebitda is growing, you know, you're generating free cash flow after dividends, your leverage will anyway be down when you have the abi stake, so what mix do you buy $2 billion of stock and not $1 billion?
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
well, first, let me say, you know, we're very happy that the board authorized a $1 billion share repurchase. and if you think about capital allocation, i think we have a history of taking a balanced approach. so, as you know, as i noted in our opening remarks, we plan on paying back about $1.3 billion in notes coming due with available cash. we continue to pay a strong dividend as well as the $1 billion share repurchase.
gaurav, i really have nothing to report on the abi asset. we continue to do the analysis that we do with all capital allocations. and currently, we believe the best thing for the shareholder over the long term is to hold the asset.
gaurav jain -- barclays -- analyst
sure. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from chris growe with stifel.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi. good morning.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning, chris.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi. i just had a quick question for you on marlboro. you have to be very happy with the resilient performance of marlboro. and, obviously, [inaudible] discount and deep discount share is accelerating, which has seemed to provide some risk to the brand.
i'm sure we're not going to get your promotional program on this call. but i wonder if you could talk about how you see the brand performing in '23. and maybe, more pointedly, have you increased promotions at a faster rate behind marlboro to preserve that share where it's doing so well there?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yes. they're great questions, chris. i think when you think about the resilience here at marlboro, we're very pleased with it. we're pleased with how it's positioned with the consumer.
we are pleased with that. it's still the aspirational brand within the cigarette space. i think when you think about your question on promotions, i would point to you that the high price realization actually shows that we're able to be more effective and efficient on our marlboro price promotion. i think it may be useful that -- i talked about marlboro red and gold versus some of the price sensitive, but some of the tools that we have in place actually allow the precision.
so, i'll just walk through a quick example with three consumers. you have one consumer that's purchasing premium brands and occasionally pops up and buys a discount brand. the other consumer is continuing to flip flopping between premium and discount. and the third consumer is a discount consumer that occasionally pops up and smokes a premium cigarette.
when you think about those consumers, you're going to treat those differently to make them more of a continuous premium brand smoker. that discount smoker, you may never be able to get them to convert to a premium because of the condition -- the economic condition that they're in. so, as we move to personal value delivery, as close as we can get to the consumer, we can tailor that across those three. and so, that's where i refer to the price that being at the national level.
we're doing this down at the local level and on our journey to move as close as we can get to the consumer. and so, that allows us to have marlboro be resilient, address the consumers' needs on a case-by-case basis, if we can get really close to the consumer, and spend those resources accordingly to have a more consistent premium consumer through time.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thanks for that and the color there. i appreciate that. i had one other follow-up, which would be, you do have two, you know, relatively unique kind of profit drags this year, with pmcc winding down, obviously, pensions moving around. could you give some more color around -- or context around how much that's weighing on profitability this year?
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
yeah, chris, i'll be -- so let's talk about pensions for a moment. if you think about pensions, obviously, there's a p&l impact related to return on assets, changes in discount rate. but i would say, you know, the pension is really well funded. we have strong funding in that pension plan.
it's actually fully funded, so we feel really good about that. and i would say the changes in pension expense, i'll remind you, a noncash. we have successfully completed the wind-down of pmcc. so, you are correct in that we had earnings and cash flow last year, and this year, we will not.
and it is a year -- on a year-over-year basis is a slight lag. but remember, pmcc was part of our all other category. it was -- so we consider it fairly immaterial to the total earnings of altria.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. thank you very much.

thank you. our next question comes from andrei condrea with ubs.
andrei condrea -- ubs -- analyst
hey. good morning, billy and sal. thanks for taking my question. one for me, please, if you don't mind.
on your smokeless business, especially on what we've seen, the brand has been driven by strong discounting versus the main peer. now, do you expect that to continue going forward, or rather just closing the price gap between you and your main peer, even if you put your product -- promo spend per can is decreasing? thank you.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
sure. thank you. i think when you think about it -- and this is not an excuse, it's just facts. they had a first-mover advantage.
and when consumers -- to get consumers to have new brands in their consideration set, you have to induce trial. and that's what we feel like we're doing. i would say, from a consumer standpoint, it's still very small compared to the total nicotine space. so, we're going to spend while -- and invest while the overall category is growing, so we can participate in that growth.
we mentioned previously, it was intuitive that the adult dipper would move to the product pretty quickly and that the adult cigarette consumer, you're going to have to induce trial. and that's what we're in the process of doing and are excited about the results thus far. i think through time, we did reduce the promotional spend per can. so, when you think about the price gap, if you will, the way you referred to it, to a competitive product in the marketplace, you're going to invest while the category is growing, so you get these products in the consideration set.
i talked about bringing some of the data analytics. i think you saw the benefit of that in this past year, but we have more to do there. and i think as we continue to progress and move forward, we feel good about it. i don't want you to think, though, it's all discount.
it's all priced off. that's to induce trial. we really see it as a complete marketing ecosystem, if you will. and i hate to use the business term, but it's surrounding the consumer and really meeting them where they're at in their journey and then supporting in that journey to fully transition over, if you will, from cigarettes to this novel oral pouch.
and so, that's where we're at. we feel good about the progress we've made thus far, but we certainly have to continue to drive awareness of the induce trial.
andrei condrea -- ubs -- analyst
that's very clear. thank you. and, yes, you are completely right. it has been fantastic progress for one.
and if i could squeeze in just one more, if you don't mind, is that marlboro has indeed done very well, and congratulations for that. but for the rest of your portfolio, as small as it is versus marlboro, what steps are you taking to defend your market share versus pressure, both from peers on the very top end of the price end and the bottom end? thank you.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. i would say if you look at growth, i would say the growth, if you look at competitors, has really been at the very, very bottom end. you know, sal highlighted in his comments, there are a number of major manufacturers that have what we would consider branded discount, priced in deep discount space. and so, when we look at total portfolios for some of those, we don't see the benefit of having gone down to that low-price tier.
they may grow one brand to the detriment of another brand within the discount space. so, we want to participate in the discount category. we think it's important, but we certainly don't want to grow the discount category. and i think being premium focused where we feel the profitability and the high loyalty is in the cigarette space is an important place to play, and that's where we're focused.
and, you know, sal highlighted for you, our premium brands are growing. total premium share of the premium space is growing through time on the backs of marlboro. so, we're pleased with that. we talk about the rgm tools, so i won't repeat that.
but being able to continue to get closer to a consumer-by-consumer basis and meet them where they're at when they have needs is where we're headed. and we're excited about that progress.
andrei condrea -- ubs -- analyst
thank you. that's very clear.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thank you.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from priya ohri-gupta with barclays.
priya ohri-gupta -- barclays -- analyst
good morning. thank you so much for the question. so. i really appreciate your commentary, sal, around the intent to pay down your upcoming euro maturity later this month.
i guess, as we take a step back, your euro-denominated debt has really sort of come down, i guess, partly driven by sort of the income that you're receiving from the abi stake given that that was sort of a natural hedge. given where sort of your euro exposure stands now in terms of your debt portfolio, are you pretty comfortable with where that is? or is there a need to continue to grow that euro exposure over time, either synthetically or through outright issuance in that market?
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
yeah. priya, first, i'm going to start my answer by just reiterating, i really have nothing to report as it pertains to abi. we continue to believe holding the asset is in the best interest -- long-term interest of our stakeholders. second, i would tell you that, you know, while we have flexibility, it's really a market-by-market analysis and a transaction-by-transaction analysis related to what markets we may or may not enter as we think about managing our debt going forward.
so, that's kind of how i would answer your question.
priya ohri-gupta -- barclays -- analyst
thank you. that's helpful.
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
sure.
operator
at this time, we will open the q&a to members of the media. [operator instructions] we'll take our next question from jennifer maloney with the wall street journal.
jennifer maloney -- staff reporter
good morning.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
good morning, jennifer.
jennifer maloney -- staff reporter
my first question is about your juul valuation. i saw that you lowered the value of your stake to a price that values juul at $714 million. and i wondered if you could explain the reasoning behind that valuation decrease. i was a little surprised because in the fourth quarter, juul resolved a large part of the litigation that it faced, which eliminated some of the uncertainty around the company.
so, could you explain that valuation?
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
sure. good morning, jennifer. first, i'll remind you that we had taken an impairment related to litigation, and we really captured it within kind of our overall discount rate of the juul assets. so, we had accounted for that.
but on a quarterly basis, the way we account for juul is -- has us run an analysis of the fair market value of the investment. it's not publicly traded, so we have to do an independent analysis. and, you know, from quarter to quarter, there's going to be changes, and we've been pretty communicative about that. this quarter, it did -- our investment was reduced to $100 million.
and it's really macro-driven, it's really macroeconomics and other factors that are considered when doing that analysis.
jennifer maloney -- staff reporter
so, things like inflation and possible recession?
sal mancuso -- chief financial officer
yes, macro market conditions, inflation, discount rates, things like interest rates, consumer dynamics, all of that goes into the analysis.
jennifer maloney -- staff reporter
got it.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
you'll note, jennifer, when you build a discount rate, it starts with a risk-free rate. so, certainly, the interest rate increases we've seen through time are going to continue to impact it as long as they're still on an upward trajectory.
jennifer maloney -- staff reporter
got it. my second question is a little more color around the consumer purchasing patterns right now. can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing consumers doing? you know, the volume had come down. so, is it because people are making fewer trips to the store to purchase cigarettes? or are they buying less each time? can you sort of talk about what the actual pattern is?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
yeah. it's a great question. what we're seeing is as we see mobility increase, if you will, the u.s. is coming out of the covid pandemic, we're actually seeing a return to more frequent trips.
remember, our consumer pre-covid would go either every day or every other day. i think what you're seeing and what consumers tend to do when they get under economic pressure is they reduce their number of nicotine occasions in a day. so, through time, that factors into their purchasing behavior. you see a little bit, and we highlighted that, which was the consumers that are under dire economic conditions at times will, you know, either switch out or trade out to a cheaper brand.
we try to give them a safe landing place within the marlboro franchise. but as far as number of trips, we haven't seen a reduction in the number of trips. it's more about through time, reducing their nicotine occasions.
jennifer maloney -- staff reporter
i see. so, they're smoking fewer cigarettes per day?
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
that's correct. so, remember, as we came into the -- there's no change in the overall trend, if you will, the long-term trend. as we went through covid and there was less mobility, less societal pressures, we actually saw, what we believe, nicotine occasions go up. we see in -- when the economic conditions and the macroeconomic environment is greatly impacting the consumer, they will strict their nicotine occasions as they become more comfortable with that they tend to return to a normal trend.
jennifer maloney -- staff reporter
all right. thanks very much.
billy gifford -- chief executive officer
thank you.
