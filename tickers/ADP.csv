(operator instructions) and our first question comes from ramsey el-assal from barclays. your line is open.
damian wille -- barclays -- analyst
hi. good morning. this is damian on for ramsey. i wanted to ask on the employer services bookings guidance. i know you both talked about it at length, but i just wanted to see if you could give any more color on just the quarterly cadence. i know, kathleen, you mentioned difficult comps coming up in q4. but maybe just any granularity that you could give would be great. and then just your overall level of confidence to kind of get to the midpoint of that 6% to 8% guidance.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
i'll let maybe kathleen make a comment as well. but again, i think if you look at last year's pattern, we -- our second quarter last year was soft, so that would be the easier compare in the fourth quarter because of the acquisition of the client base acquisition from wells fargo, i think will be a little more difficult. but we obviously try to apply some judgment on these things, and we obviously have information about individual unit performance and kind of what's happening across regions. and i think what we tried to provide some of the color of our comments is that this quarter, we had very strong, what i would call strong results in our core us businesses, sbs, major accounts and national accounts.
and where we really had some weakness was in international and multinational, and we're looking at the details of that. there were a few large deals in prior year, as well as some deals that didn't close in the first quarter as expected. so that's what gave us some confidence that i think we're still on track for the year despite these kind of quarterly fluctuations because, i think, as kathleen said and we said many times, for us, bookings is certainly more volatile than revenues.
obviously, we have a recurring revenue model. but on bookings, the clock was back to zero at the beginning of every -- of every quarter, but we see some underlying strength that gives us some optimism, but we did have some weakness in the international, multinational and that is something that we're looking at. i don't think that it's any major change in the economy because it's been kind of a difficult economic climate for a while in europe where we have a large business. so again, as we looked at the details, it just looked like typical lumpiness in our bookings.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, just to follow on that, look, you're always going to have some degree of lumpiness in your quarterly bookings number, right, from -- at least a couple things, right. if you've got larger multinational type deals, that's going to cause some lumpiness and then you've got the year-over-year comps issue. if you've got a tough comp or an easier comp, so you'll always have a little bit of that going on.
and so, importantly, while the quarterly numbers obviously important, i think even more important to look at a longer-term trend, right. when you look at how we've been doing in particular with last year having a really strong and i think record, right, number, $1.6 billion for last year and then 8%. and then on top of that another, what we think is a really solid number, 6% in q1, when you look at that longer period of time. we're actually feeling pretty pleased with the start to the year. now, there is, of course, always pockets that are stronger and others that are maybe a little slower out of the gate and carlos mentioned on the outside of the us having a little bit of lumpiness there. but net-net, we're pretty pleased with the start to the year.
damian wille -- barclays -- analyst
yeah, that makes sense. great. then maybe i'll zoom out a little bit and ask on overall sort of product strategy at the large enterprise level. i just want to dig in and see how you see your product suite evolving there, sort of in the context of you continuing to invest in vantage over time and then your strategy -- and your strategy around the lifion offering?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
don't forget, we also -- again, one of the highlights for the quarter and frankly, it's been a highlight i have been trying to kind of signal because i'm not sure how it's -- if it's landed yet. but our decision to use workforce now in the lower end of the upmarket. so call it in that 1,000 to 3,000, even though, frankly, it can go higher. we have a couple of clients that have 8,000, 9,000 employees that are on workforce now, but that decision has been great competitively in growth wise.
so, we are selling a lot of units in that kind of lower end of the upmarket. so the ability to use workforce now for -- and it fits certain types of profiles of clients and you can probably imagine, generally speaking, they are large but simpler and the vantage clients would be more complex and have more complex needs like complex benefits and talent requirements and so forth. and lifion is still, obviously, an early adopter type of product, even though we're getting great traction. and we told you what -- how we've done in terms of new sales. given the size of adp, it's really workforce now and vantage now that are affecting the numbers in terms of the bookings and the revenue. and i think, again, in case if i wasn't clear like -- we had a good quarter even in national accounts in the upmarket, primarily as a result of really good results from workforce now.
and so the strategy is the same strategy we've had all along, which is know, i think we've -- we figured out that we have a really great solution for a segment of the market. i think last quarter, i mentioned that we had an external third-party do some analysis for us in terms of segmenting the market. and as usual, one solution doesn't fit the entire market and what we found was that a pretty good size percentage of the market can be addressed by our workforce now solution. so, that's what we're doing
and we were right and the analysis was right. and we think the vantage still addresses another segment of the market and lifion is more of kind of the emerging solution that we, obviously, have placed a lot of confidence and a lot of -- and a big bet on for the future. but as of today, it's really not having a big impact on the numbers. and i'll add also in terms of just to your question about market dynamic. when we had this meeting in las vegas for the hr tech conference that i mentioned in my comments, again, early positive signs we had for anyone who was there and i think some of our, some industry analysts and some financial analysts were there. i think it was pretty clear that we are making an impact in the market. so, our lead flow was multiples of what it has been in the past in the upmarket because of the interest in lifion. but i just want to be cautious in terms of pace here because relative to our $15 billion in revenue, this is not next quarter or three quarters from now, but the signs are very, very positive in the long term as kathleen mentioned. if you focus on the long term, i think lifion -- the traction we're getting on lifion is very, very encouraging.
damian wille -- barclays -- analyst
yeah. that's really good. we will keep watching. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from kevin mcveigh from credit suisse. your line is open.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thank you. hey, you're able to reaffirm the revenue despite the lower client interest on kind of funds and extended investment. was there any kind of offset there, particularly given the incremental headwinds in fx? seems like you're able to -- maybe from the guide despite those couple of headwinds.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
i think it goes back to what we were saying about the some of the underlying performance of the business. so as an example, even though we don't give quarterly guidance on retention, you could tell from our comments, i hope that we felt pretty good about it this quarter, so that you could probably read into that, that it improved prior to -- compared to last year's prior first quarter. and as i mentioned before, retention, if you do the math, has a pretty outsized impact on our business both in terms of revenue and frankly, big impact on margin, because for equal growth, you don't have to implement as much business. and so there is a lot of different moving parts that go into the -- into the pot here, but i would point that went out as an area of strength. i think we talked about the strong performance in our core us businesses.
so for the first quarter, we had kind of our three core businesses performing very well in terms of bookings as well. so this is a process of -- from the ground-up of us building this forecast. first, the plan and now the forecast. and i think we have some optimism that we're still in that range. and -- but i just want to point out the retention story because three years or four years ago when it was going the other way, i pointed out that it takes 4 points to 5 points of sales growth of new business bookings growth to offset one point of retention, just because of the way the math works. and so now as retention, as you get a little bit of improvement in retention, that helps a lot in terms of our growth rate.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yes. so as carlos mentioned, there is a couple things that obviously gave us some headwind or unfavorably versus what we would have been expecting, particularly the fx and the interest from foreign funds. however, when you look at operationally, the fundamental things look really good. as carlos said, retention is on a steady track upwards, now gets harder and harder the higher up you go, but we are happy to see some level of increase in the first quarter here and bookings were solid for the quarter.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
and i'll just add that on the client funds interest, we do have -- we had some of this. for the year, it obviously has an impact as we guided, we gave you the information in terms of we're slightly below what we expected to be, but it's not a huge number for this fiscal year.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. and then just, carlos, to highlight the retention little bit more because, obviously, really nice progress there. any sense of just the success across the enterprise versus the mid-market versus kind of downstream a little bit, the range on those?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i do have some sense. my sense is that we're improving a lot. so, we show some signs in terms of the win-loss, what we call balance of trade, some encouraging signs, particularly in our mid-market business. so again, the mid-market now is performing. you've got to be cautious because this is definitely a forward-looking statement, but it's performing according to script. in the sense, if you remember, we took a lot of pain and a lot of effort to migrate all of our clients onto one single strategic platform, which is workforce now. and when you looked at the history of what happened in our sbs downmarket business, when we did that, we were optimistic and hopeful that we would have the same kind of traction in our mid-market business and it's beginning to show now.
so, we have improving retention now for, it feels like six quarters or seven quarters, somewhere in that range. i'm being told more. so once we kind of finish the migrations and got through that difficulty, i think our -- we've had steady improvements in retention. this quarter was the second highest retention we've ever had in our mid-market business. and in this quarter, what was very encouraging was to see the level of activity in new business bookings. so the combination of those two things give us a feeling of optimism for what is one of our biggest and most profitable businesses.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
awesome. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from david togut from evercore isi. your line is open.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you. good morning. could you comment on the drivers that you expect to move your peo revenue growth up from 8% in the recent quarter to 9% to 11%, which is your guide for this year? and then just as a follow-up. at your analyst day last year, you gave a multi-year guide of 12% to 14% cagr for your hro business and you're trending well below that now. did you anticipate at the time that the growth rates in the earlier years, double-digits effectively, would slow toward the end of that period, let's say, mid to high single-digit?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
well, if i can start with the second one first, since i was there at the analyst -- and after i'd ask kathleen. i think that as we built the guidance for or i guess the estimates for our three years, we had, i think we've mentioned this a couple of times. we had certain expectations around our pass-through revenue and the inflation of those numbers that had some historical precedent, both around workers' compensation and healthcare. and i think literally within two months of that , the picture changed and we communicated that very clearly and very transparently and frankly, without any anxiety because it doesn't have any impact on our eps. so if you remember the investor day, i think was in june. and i think when we had our august earnings call, i think we brought down significantly for that year at least, the growth rate for the peo, mainly primarily -- close to almost based on lower inflation.
now, on top of that, we have had some slowdown in worksite employee growth, which is the core driver, underneath of the real growth of the business. but i think the main driver of this differential from what we communicated at investor day has been the lower inflation of the pass-throughs, which again doesn't concern us in a big way because it's zero margin and doesn't really affect our profitability in terms of dollars.
in terms of your question about the behavior of the quarters and so forth, probably beyond the scope of this call. but it's just kind of math in terms of when we have our open enrollment for healthcare in kind of the may, june timeframe, which we've again communicated very transparently when that happens and what happens when that occurs, you tend to have some client churn. so, that drops your worksite employee growth and obviously, revenue growth for the peo. and then as bookings continue to -- assuming they continue to be robust, you start to build that up again.
and then at the end of calendar year end, you have another event at year-end where you have some churn in the client base in terms of clients that choose to leave at the end of a calendar year because that's more natural. but we also have historically, a lot of bookings in january as well. so, we've been doing this for 20 years. and if we see a difference or a change, we would obviously communicate that. but i think we're just kind of dropping the numbers in, as they are supposed to come in terms of -- based on historical trends.
christian greyenbuhl -- vice president, investor relations
david, i would just add. so last quarter, we did say that we would expect to start the year on the lower end of the range and then grow -- and then grow into the range as the year progresses because, obviously, we started with a -- somewhat of a weaker ending worksite employee number in the fourth quarter last year.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
and i think it's probably worth asking. i mean adding just again in full transparency, i think we said it last quarter, our healthcare renewal was slightly higher than the previous year. so, i wouldn't -- it wasn't anything out of norm in terms of historical, but it was higher than the previous year. and when that -- when we have that happen, you tend to get more shoppers and more -- healthcare cost is a large part of what a small business pays in their overall cost structure of their workforce. and so they tend to shop and look around and so forth, and so we had a little bit more, more churn than, i think than we've had in the prior year.
the good news for us is that we have that issue, but we've been dealing with that for 20 years, but we don't take any risk on healthcare. and so whatever we get in terms of price increases through the carriers, we pass those through to 100%, which is what we call zero margin pass-through. so that eliminates any risk or any surprises in the future, but it also means that you have to have frankly the courage to just pass those costs through and let the chips fall where they may, and the chips fell. and i think you can see from the numbers that the chips didn't fall off the table because there wasn't a collapse in the business or a huge slowdown, but we definitely had a speed bump. and now it's really through new business bookings that we have to regain the momentum and kind of have that ramp up again and reacceleration of the growth rate.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from bryan bergin from cowen. your line is open.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. good morning. thank you. carlos, i wanted to ask your macro view, your outlook on the current employment market. it sounds encouraging based on the performance of the business. but i'm curious how much of that is due to the improved competitive product position versus the underlying demand you might be seeing?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
it's a great question because it's an important one for us to keep kind of asking ourselves because we do have some things that if they turn on us would put pressure on us. interest rates, obviously, is one of them, pays per control, et cetera. but we're also feeling pretty good about our product situation, and i think our competitive situation in the marketplace going forward here. so it is, i think it would be a very important question for us to stay focused on here for the next few quarters.
but as of today, when you look at our -- the lagging indicator, so pays per control, it doesn't look like there is a slowdown or a big issue. but if you look at the same things that everyone else would look at, that we have access to and that you have access to in terms of leading indicators like confidence indexes or nfib, ism, those types of things, michigan confidence, there is some concern there and some reason for caution.
in our numbers, the only place where we've seen some, a little bit of softness in pays per control and it doesn't get reflected in our -- in what we report because as we've disclosed prior, this is our auto pay base, which is a very large base of both large employers, mid-sized employers and smaller employers. but we have most of our employees in our run platform and there, we've seen a slight downtick in pays per control growth over the prior -- over the prior year.
it doesn't -- when you look at over the 10-year history, i don't think it's anything to be alarmed by. but when you look at other factors, it's certainly a cost for caution. i just happen to look, i think the last couple of days at nfib and that softened significantly, but it's still well above recession levels. and so, i think we're all -- we're all kind of trying to figure out the same thing here, which is, is this a soft patch or is it kind of a trend line? but with the fed easing and the consumer still strong like, right now, our plans are that we kind of work our way through this soft patch.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then, kathleen, on just margin expansion progress, any further details you can share on the various transformation initiatives. as you look across the various sources, where are you seeing the most yield and anything surprising as you've had just more time in the seat?
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah, no, thanks for the question. obviously, something that i'm really focused on in the organization is really very focused on as well. i mean, just to kind of give some context and kind of big picture when you step back and take a look at what we've done in the last couple of years. i mean, remember back in 2018 we were at a margin rate of 20.7% with a small amount of margin expansion in that year. and then in 2019 when -- fiscal 2019, when we were executing on some really big and meaningful transformation initiatives, you saw that really outsized margin expansion of 160 basis points.
and now, as a reminder, the guide for another 100 basis points to 125 basis points for fiscal 2020. so, a track record here of really consistent margin expansion as we start in fiscal 2020 with q1, that 60 basis points of margin expansion. we're really happy to see that and very happy that we are on track with how we plan the year. now, there is a lot of execution and a lot of work behind the scenes going on. but i'd point out that number one, as i started my comments, there is a lot of energy around it and a lot of alignment. and that energy and alignment is around both executing, what i call in-flight projects, as well as developing the pipeline for the future.
so that's really exciting. i talked about on the previous call that most of the margin expansion from a transformation perspective, this year is coming from what we're calling workforce optimization and procurement initiatives. both are very much on track. from a workforce optimization standpoint, think about that in terms of spans and layers exercise, if you will, in particularly, targeted to management layers. so, that's kind of on track and already executed, with most of that benefit being in fiscal '20, not much from that coming beyond fiscal '20.
and then procurement transformation, there is a lot of projects there. as we look at across all parts of the organization and spend, as we look at volume and we look at policy and we look at our ability to negotiate smartly with vendors and suppliers. there is opportunity there and there's a lot of execution going on. so lot of work by the organization. we're happy with what the team has been doing, happy with the progress, but more to do.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
hey, bryan. i just -- one thing just to add, as you think about the margin, because your question, i think was related to margins in particular and obviously, what's driving those. but last year, the first and second quarter, but particularly the second quarter was a very strong growth in margin in that time. and just a reminder, we also had pressure from m&a at the time. so just layer that went on to it as well, as you think about margin cadence last year versus this year.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from david grossman from stifel. your line is open.
david grossman -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
thank you. good morning. i wonder if i could just follow up with a couple of questions on the peo. each of your, kind of larger peers in that space have identified some type of incremental issue with their health insurance book in their most recent reports. and i know you mentioned just higher health premiums and obviously, you pass everything through in your -- in your model. but is there anything else you're seeing in the marketplace that may be impacting the cost of delivering health insurance in the peo industry?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
no.
david grossman -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
right. so for you, it's just a straight higher premium and not seeing anything else that i guess you don't really see the claims data, is that right? in terms of how claims may be impacting costs?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
we don't see individual employee claims data, but we, of course, very, very carefully look at claims data to get some sense with our carriers and partnership with our carriers of what's happening in terms of trends. and maybe i should be a little bit more clear on this premium increase issue. so, i'm not going to give you the exact numbers. i don't think we want to get down that rabbit hole. but the change from this renewal to the prior renewal was, call it, 1 percentage points to 2 percentage points higher on average in the prior year.
so if the previous year, the average renewal increase was 6%, then the next year, it was 7% or 8%. that -- and that increase that year, that was slightly higher, was completely in line with the prior six years or seven years. so, that wasn't -- so there are some ups and downs, but the prior year was the one that was actually exceptional. i think we were very clear about that. i think we talked about that on our calls that we had a really great renewal on our healthcare on average. and remember, this isn't one carrier, these are multiple carriers. we use a number of different carriers to make sure that we have good coverage across the entire -- across the entire country.
and so that was unusual and it helped us competitively. but i think this renewal was not out of line with historical norms and has nothing to do with any kind of -- i think anything that's happening around healthcare is, probably has to do with people's underwriting policies and their own approach to bringing in business and repricing business, because it's not just about the business you bring in. but every year if you're self-insured or you are taking risk, you have the opportunity or the option of passing through or not passing through healthcare costs and you actually have some judgment with your underwriters on what those costs are. and so that's generally -- that's typically what can create a problem in healthcare, but it doesn't appear to us that there is really anything happening broadly in the healthcare industry around peos.
david grossman -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
and then just on your -- just based on your commentary on workers' comp, i mean i think the whole industry had a tailwind. so if you look at this year's, health increased, plus the workers' comp at a more normalized level. this is really a more typical year for you, right, i mean in terms of the peo, in terms of those two items?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
i think that's right. that's fair. and i think on the workers' comp, just again to be clear, it was a -- i think we were clear. but we should say one more time a smaller positive. so, we're not having surprises in terms of losses in workers' comp or any kind of. and by the way, we have a very tight ship there in the sense that we have, as we disclosed in our 10-k, a color that limits our risk in a fairly significant way.
caps are a downside on workers' comp. so, we have reinsurance on individual claims and then we have a color around our overall loss estimate. so it's quite limited in terms of the volatility. i think the other thing that i would mention is that our business mix hasn't changed, so we look at that very carefully as well. so, we look at the mix of, we call, white collar versus grey collar. but within those categories, you have a lot of different industries and a lot of different categories of people and we don't see any major change there as well.
david grossman -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
okay. got it. and just the follow-up is kind of a bigger picture for your question, carlos, is that given the relatively low penetration rates for the industry and that you get a lot of your new clients from -- a client that is already using you for payroll, what are the major objections to somebody enrolling in the peo, particularly if they're an adp payroll customer and you already have the payroll records, so the kind of disruption and transition costs and time and effort are substantially lower.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
i think it's -- it goes back to like, i guess, my first year marketing class in graduate school, which is a high involvement decision, right. so the peo -- if you go to a small, mid-sized businesses and tell them that you are going to create a co-employment relationship, you're taking over their healthcare plan, your workers' compensation. remember, all along the way there are -- as an example, there could be a relationship with an insurance agent or a broker that has been providing the healthcare and the workers' comp for the last 10 years, that gets remediated [phonetic]. you have to -- payrolls is hard enough to convince someone to switch payroll because the people worry about, are you sure you're not going to make a mistake because make sure that it's going to go [indecipherable].
we obviously have an incredibly strong reputation on payroll that helps us, but the traditional business you're trying to convince, i want to give you your payroll, now you're also trying to convince them to give you everything around their hr department. and so the higher level of trust and it's, again, what i remember being taught is called a high-involvement decision, which takes longer to make and is more difficult to make. so, i honestly don't think that there is really anything that prevents clients from becoming peo clients and i think we've demonstrated over 20 years that we've convinced a lot of them. and so our board asked the same question you're asking, which is, can't you convince even more? and we're trying, like we continue to add improvements in the product.
we continue to provide better tools. we continue to enhance our product. we continue to do all the things we can to make it more compelling and easier to use. as an example, i think we've kind of talked about this in the last 18 months. all new business now in the peo is starting on our workforce now platform, which has higher functionality and provides the ability to satisfy slightly larger clients and we could before because it's a mid-market platform. and so, lot of things that we're doing to try to convince as many clients to come over to our peo solution as possible, i think it's good for them and it's good for -- and it's good for us. but there is really nothing that i can point to other than kind of the difficulties of the convincing of the sale.
david grossman -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
all right. got it. very helpful. thank you for that.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jason kupferberg from bank of america. your line is open.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. i just wanted to pick up on some of the margin commentary. i mean, as you rightfully pointed out, the comparison there gets quite a bit harder actually in the second quarter, so just -- so that our expectations are properly calibrated. i mean, do you expect margins to be up in the second quarter year-over-year?
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah. it's a really tough comp in q2. remember last fiscal year q2, we had over 300 basis points of margin expansion. so it's going to be tough to expand in q2. maybe it's flat, slightly up, slightly down. hard to say exactly because there are so many moving parts, but the way i would think about it is that the bulk of the expansion to come this fiscal year will come in the second half of the year.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. okay. that's fair. and then just on the bookings front, somewhat similar question, except in reverse, right, because you've got the easy comp there in the second quarter. so, do you need to be above the full-year guidance range in the second quarter just to make sure that you stay on track to achieve the full-year outlook, because then, obviously, the comparisons here get a bit harder in the second half?
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
above the bookings guidance number in the second quarter?
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
you need to be above the full-year range in q2 just to keep yourself on track.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
mathematically, yes. so, you're absolutely right. i mean it's -- just stay on that for the full year, you will have more growth in the second quarter and then much less than in q4.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
right, right. okay. and then just last quick one from me. what will be the drivers of the anticipated acceleration in the wse growth during the balance of fiscal 2018?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
selling more new clients then losing clients. it really goes back to the -- i mean i hate to -- i'm not trying to be a smart alec, but it's really the pattern, i think i talked about it a couple of questions ago that when we do [phonetic] our open enrollment in may and june, we tend to experience some client churn. the sales don't accelerate at the same -- necessarily at the same time. and so you have -- same phenomenon happens sometimes at the end of the calendar year, where you may lose a group of clients and then you bring on new clients at the beginning of the year. but then you also bring on -- so clients tend to not leave at other times of the year, other than a calendar year-end and open enrollment which is may and june. that doesn't mean that none leave. i'm just saying that the skewing is skewed toward those two periods, and the sales are skewed differently. and the combination of those two things is what causes either growth or deceleration in worksite employee growth.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah -- no, look, on any of the -- not any, but like a lot of these metrics, when you look at a very short period of time, one quarter, you could have some one-off things happening. and that's what i -- as i said earlier, looking at the trend and the track record over time for things like bookings and worksite employee growth and even margin, right, looking at the trend over time is helpful i find.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
but again, in this case, we also have -- we have to hit our plan, obviously. i guess, as usual, when we have these calls if -- we're giving you the numbers based on what we expect right now. so if we hit our new business bookings plans and retention stays where we expect it to stay, then you would get the outcomes that you were talking about. but as kathleen said, there's a lot of other moving parts. if three months to six months from now, the economies in the tank and pays per control is declining, it's going to decline in the peo, in addition to es or anywhere else than adp, and then that would create a headwind. but in the absence of any -- any new information, i think we feel pretty good about the forecast we have.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. i appreciate it. thank you.

hey. good morning. just maybe a follow-up on the margin expansion path. looking beyond sort of the next few quarters or even this year, just wanted to talk about the messaging and make sure we were getting proper sense of the drivers there. i think a lot of the talks been around workforce optimization and procurement over the next 12 months or so. but i think one of the things you guys have tried to talk about is the tech improvements or your investments. as you build more of those into your platform, as you're adding them more into what you're doing on a day-to-day basis, can you talk a little bit about how that scale that you're adding or that scalable -- the expense base that you're adding will show up in terms of cost reductions or margin improvement?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think, again, back to what kathleen was talking about in terms of the math, some of this is really about the comparisons rather than anything that we're doing. but we have to help you. we understand that it's important for you guys to understand that. so just as a reminder, last year what happened was, we had, with the voluntary early retirement program, we had a good number of people taking that and then the backfills that we had planned, which was all planned, certain percentage of backfills were delayed. and so that impacted that year. we also got off to a very strong start. for a couple of other reasons, we had other, what we call quick wins at the time around transformation to help us get off to a strong start in the first half.
and i think kathleen talked about, we had, for us, like an incredibly strong margin improvement. and so it's just a very difficult compare mathematically. as we've been going along, regardless of how the math works, we continue to work on a number of initiatives. this year, obviously, we executed on this spans and layers initiative and then we have a number of other projects around -- procurement is one of them, but we also have a number of kind of automation and digitization projects that i think we're making some progress on.
and when we have our industry -- sorry, our analyst day in february, we'll probably share a little bit more around some of those things that we're doing because those are around transformation and innovation as well. so, it's not just about innovating on the product side, but it's also innovating on the implementation and on the service side. and we've gotten some good traction in some of our businesses, which allows our productivity to improve, while still for our associates, while still improving our nps scores and our client satisfaction, which by the way were up again this quarter and no surprises, retention is improving. so, we usually assign that client satisfaction is still -- is still high.
so again, the trick here is you want to -- you want to transform your cost structure. but you don't want to like lose all the clients in the meantime. and for now, we've been able to balance both of those and that's our plan here for the next year or two.
steven wald -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah. fair enough. and then maybe just one quick follow-up. i noticed the buyback a little bit higher than we've seen in the last year or so. just could you provide any commentary on how you're thinking about the pace there going forward?
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, really no change in terms of how we're thinking about that and our strategy. we've talked about, we intend to buy back 1% of the share base and we've been executing along those lines. so really no change. we look all the time at the market conditions. and look, if there is some opportunity where there is a big downturn in the market and we want to become more active, maybe we'll do that, i don't know. but we constantly, we watch that, we look at and we talk about it all the time, but as of now, no particular change.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
again, one little statistic because we happen to notice these things when we prepare for these calls. because now again like, it seems like 20 years of information. so, we've reduced our share count by 30% since the early 2000s and so we intend to continue to stay on that pace. and so, obviously, it's a marathon for a company like we're kind of proud that -- it's a marathon. we've been around for seven years. and at 1% per year, it adds up. and it certainly has added up in the last 20 years to the tune of 30% share reduction. i think that companies are in a different stage of development where they're getting dilution and adding shares to their share count. we think we're going to win this marathon.
steven wald -- morgan stanley -- analyst
all right. great, thanks.
operator
thank you. and we'll take our final question from bryan keane from deutsche bank. your line is open.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi, guys. just a quick -- two quick clarifications. on the peo margin, it was below street, but it didn't sound like it was really below your expectations. and it sounds like there was a tougher comp to the adp indemnity. so, can you maybe just talk to that and how that looks going forward on the margin side?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, no, i think that's -- i think that's a fair characterization. i think that, as usual, there is -- there is a -- we try to obviously be as straight as we can be. because sometimes there is a slight disconnect between what we're expecting versus -- since we don't give quarterly guidance. but the results, i think were on that specific topic, i think we are in line with our expectations.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah, it was definitely in line with how we expected to start the year.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
and then just a cadence how we think about that going forward on the margin for peo?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
that's a good -- that's a good question. i think that what if -- when you look at the annual guidance, which i think was down flat to 25 down?
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
down to 25.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
i'm sorry, by basis points, i think that was the guidance if you take our first quarter number. i would for now assume ratably margin improvement over the course of the rest of the year because these quarterly fluctuations in adp indemnity are not something that is something that we can have -- we don't have any real visibility into that. and again, just as a reminder, part of why we've done this is, if you remember a couple of years ago, we had some criticism around our disclosures. so, we had our client funds interest and indemnity being handled in the kind of other category, which allowed us to not have these questions and not kind of mix up the results of those businesses. but as usual, there are two sides to every story. and so i think the criticism was, those things really belong in the results of the business unit, fair enough.
so we made that -- we made that change and now we are saddled with every quarter, having to explain any kind of fluctuations here because what really matters is the underlying health of the business. we don't take enough risk in that business for it's a matter. but you can't get because of the size of the business. if you get a $5 million fluctuation, which is what we had this quarter up or down, it affects the numbers. but it doesn't really say anything about what's happening in the underlying business, but it is what it is. we now report indemnity in the peo, and we're going to have to every quarter be able to give you that kind of color. and likewise in employer services, we now have client funds interest. and so now that creates some variability in that business as well.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah, so with the down -- with the flat to down 25 basis points and down 70 basis points in q1, you'll see that just mathematically it ramps. but again, it's going to depend on the adp indemnity and how that comes through during the balance of the year.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
it was certainly easier when we didn't have adp indemnity in the peo. but -- because nothing -- again, we've been doing that for 20 years. we handled it. we're not -- by the way, we're handling exactly the same way as we've always handle it. it's just a different accounting for it. that's all.
operator
thank you. and this does conclude our question-and-answer portion for today. i am pleased to hand the program over to carlos rodriguez for any closing remarks.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
well, thanks very much. you can tell, we feel pretty good about the start to 2020. we're obviously trying to change a lot of things. we've talked a lot about transformation. we'll share more with you when we have our innovation day here in february. but we're focused on execution. as i think kathleen alluded to, there still a lot of execution in front of us, but we still -- we try to continue to be focused on our clients and our associates. and our associates are doing a phenomenal job as evidenced by our continuing improvements in our nps scores.
obviously, we feel good about what happened with hr tech, with our lifion debut. so, i think that gives us some optimism. we're very excited about what's happened in the mid-market business here in the first quarter. so, i continue to be very proud of our organization and the resiliency of the organization and the transformation efforts that they continue to execute on. so, we look forward to giving you more updates in the time to come, and we thank you for joining our call today.
thank you.

operator
good morning. my name is krystal, and i will be your conference operator. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to adp's first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. [operator instructions]
i will now turn the conference over to mr. christian greyenbuhl, vice president, investor relations. please go ahead.
christian greyenbuhl -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, krystal. good morning, everyone. and thank you for joining adp's first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call and webcast. with me today are carlos rodriguez, our president and chief executive officer; and kathleen winters, our chief financial officer.
earlier this morning, we released our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. the earnings materials are available on the sec's website and on our investor relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call, as well as our quarterly history of revenue and pre-tax earnings by reportable segment.
during our call today, we will reference non-gaap financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. a description and the timing of these items, along with a reconciliation of non-gaap measures to their most comparable gaap measure, can be found in our earnings release.
today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. we encourage you to review our filings with the sec for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.
before turning the call over to carlos, you will have noticed in today's earnings release that we made a correction this quarter to certain peo's zero margin pass-through revenues that we had previously reported on a gross basis and which going forward will be reported on a net basis. for consistency, we also revised prior periods and the total impact of fiscal 2019 revenues and operating expenses was $65 million. this does not materially impact our previously reported growth rates and does not impact consolidated earnings before income taxes, net earnings, consolidated financial condition or cash flows.
to better assist you, we have also included the details of these adjustments in the appendix to the presentation that accompanies today's call. our supplemental schedule of quarterly history of revenue and pre-tax earnings by reportable segment also reflects the impacts of these changes. accordingly, our reported results and full-year outlook and the following commentary from both carlos and kathleen also fully reflect the impact of these adjustments. as always, please do not hesitate to reach out, should you have any questions.
and with that, let me turn the call over to carlos.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, christian, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call.
this morning, we reported our first quarter fiscal 2020 results with revenue of $3.5 billion for the quarter, up 6% reported and organic constant currency. we are pleased with this revenue growth, which despite some higher-than-expected unfavorability in fx, was in line with our expectations.
our efforts to enhance our operating efficiency, along with our focused attention on transformation, helped us deliver 60 basis points of adjusted ebit margin expansion for this quarter. this margin expansion was in line with our expectations, and we are happy to see the progress that our associates continue to make in helping to improve our productivity, while also improving client satisfaction, particularly given the difficult margin compare given our strong performance in the first half of fiscal 2019. together with share buybacks and a slightly lower-than-expected adjusted effective tax rate, these results helped us deliver 12% adjusted eps growth this quarter, which was slightly ahead of our expectations.
moving on to employer services new business bookings. this quarter, we saw solid growth across our us markets, which helped drive 6% growth in the quarter. with regard to our international and multi-national sales opportunities, we did see some impact from timing as certain deals that were expected to close this quarter are now expected to close slightly later in the fiscal year. nevertheless, we are maintaining our full-year employer services new business bookings guidance of 6% to 8%.
now turning to client service. we continue to drive improvements in our client satisfaction scores across our businesses. in this quarter, we were especially pleased with our progress in the upmarket, with improvements in both our implementation and overall client satisfaction scores. we continue to take positive steps to transform our service organization and enhance the client experience. and with this continued progress in mind, we remain confident in our forecasted full-year fiscal 2020 retention increase of 10 basis points to 20 basis points.
we are pleased with our start to fiscal 2020 and with the continued momentum in advancing our strategy to simplify how we do business, deliver innovative solutions for our clients and associates and drive sustainable long-term growth for our shareholders. we understand that a key element of building our success in the market is in the capacity to be agile and to anticipate and adapt to change.
innovation is at the core of this need, and it's a job that's never done. while we are incredibly excited about the solutions we are delivering in the market today to help clients meet the needs of an evolving workforce, we're even more excited about the future. as the workforce continues to evolve, organizations are looking for ways to manage their entire workforce through a single-user experience.
today, companies of all sizes are using a variety of applications to get work done. what they need is an open hcm platform that allows easy integration with third-party solutions and is also flexible enough to handle the increasingly dynamic nature of work; one, where workers are organized around how work happens in teams, often with individuals working on multiple teams at the same time. aided by insights from the adp research institute, our next-gen hcm platform is designed at the core to address these needs.
a few weeks ago, i had the opportunity to attend the hr technology conference in las vegas, where our next gen hcm platform and used innovations took center stage. as i met with clients and hr professionals, i was incredibly proud of the reception and recognition that we receive for delivering innovative solutions that address how and where work is done today.
i was especially proud when our next gen hcm platform won both the hr executive top hr product of the year award and the awesome new technology award, a remarkable achievement and a testament to adp's commitment to innovation. back in september, we also had the opportunity to showcase some of the differentiating features of adp's next gen platform to hcm industry analysts when we hosted our 2019 industry analyst day.
at this event, we spent time sharing some of the more meaningful and differentiating elements of our technology, such as the use of graph database technology that powers the unique ability to dynamically configure teams while enabling actionable data and insights around relationships, or our metadata-driven design approach that allows a solution to be tailored by the client via low-code rapid development through a drag-and-drop interface. in addition, our solution was designed from the beginning to be public cloud-native. this among other advantages helps improve resiliency and uptime.
finally, our solution is designed to be global, companies that are expanding globally and that would like to more effectively manage their existing global workforce are an ideal target for adp next gen hcm. we were equally proud and excited to see the recognition of our efforts from industry experts at this event. and while it is great to receive these awards and to be recognized by industry experts, it is even more rewarding when we see our efforts translate into recognition and acknowledgment from our clients and prospects.
as we work to scale our solution and its capabilities, our next gen platform is also building momentum in the market and continues to progress in line with our expectations. as an example, earlier this quarter at our industry analyst day, we shared details of a successful go-live with a 6,000 employee us company that chose adp's next gen hcm platform for its talent capabilities and the ease of integration with the clients own internally developed onboarding tool.
at the same event, we were also pleased to share that we had recently signed a 65,000 employee global enterprise that was looking for an hcm platform capable of handling its growing workforce. with that said, our focus on innovation is not limited to our next gen hcm platform. we have also increasingly leveraged machine learning to enhance our core strategic advantages in payroll and big data. as an example, we simplified 21 million raw job titles from our unmatched data lake, and normalized them down to 2,400 job categories, ultimately enhancing -- enhancing both the functionality and accuracy of our adp data cloud benchmarking.
customers are using our compensation and hr benchmark data to make substantial changes to their business. for example, one of our clients was able to leverage our turnover benchmark data to identify opportunities for improvement, and ultimately to reduce their turnover by 20%. while another saw its front line managers use our executive and manager insights mobile solution to help reduce its overtime cost by 6%. these equate to real multi-million dollar operational savings that are being enabled by adp's data and products.
also, to enhance the efficiency of our implementation organization, we are designing our next gen payroll engine to automatically recognize, convert and classify different formats and inputs from prior payrolls into payroll policies. we believe that this will give us an advantage when we onboard new clients, since it will enable the automation of various elements of the implementation process and allow us to share best practices with our clients.
and finally, we also continue to drive innovation for our front-line associates in an effort to transform how we work, by reducing low-value client contacts, while still delivering value-added service. with this in mind, last year, our support organization in the down-market rolled out expanded chatbot functionality, which today is capable of handling over 100 different inquiry types for more than 640,000 small business clients.
adp's unique ability to meet the needs of clients and the workers today while anticipating their needs in the future have been hallmarks of our success over the past seven years, and i believe will drive our sustained growth in the years to come.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to kathleen for her commentary on our results and fiscal 2020 outlook.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
thank you, carlos, and good morning, everyone. as carlos mentioned, we're pleased with our progress in transforming our business in order to simplify, innovate and grow. our strategy is working and we are off to a solid start to the year.
this morning, we reported first quarter revenue growth in line with our expectations at 6% on a reported and organic constant currency basis, which includes a slightly greater amount of fx unfavorability than we had previously anticipated. our adjusted ebit increased 8%, also in line with expectations and adjusted ebit margin was up 60 basis points compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
we're pleased with this margin improvement, which benefited from cost savings related to our workforce optimization and procurement transformation initiatives, as well as continued efficiencies within our it infrastructure. these benefits were partially offset by incremental brand spend as well as selling, amortization and peo pass-through expenses. this margin performance is particularly gratifying, given the difficult margin compare that we faced in the first half of the year. as a reminder, this resulted from the very strong performance in the first half of fiscal 2019, resulting from the outsized benefits related to our voluntary early retirement program due to slower than anticipated planned backfills at that time.
our adjusted effective tax rate decreased by 100 basis points to 21.2% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. the decrease was mainly due to an increase in tax incentives related to our r&d efforts and a decrease in reserves for uncertain tax positions. adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 12% to $1.34. and in addition to benefiting from our revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate, was also aided by fewer shares outstanding compared to a year ago.
let's move now to our employer services segment and interest on funds held for clients. employer services revenues were in line with expectations and grew 4% reported and 5% organic constant currency. interest income on client funds grew 13%, and benefited from a 10 basis point improvement in the average yield earned on our client fund investments to 2.3%, and growth in average client fund balances of 7% to $23.7 billion.
this growth in balances was driven by a combination of client growth, wage inflation, and growth in our pays per controls, partially offset by lower sui collections. our employer services same-store pays per control metric in the us grew 2.4% for the first quarter. employer services margins saw an increase of 50 basis points in the quarter. the increase in margins this quarter was enabled by the same factors i mentioned earlier when discussing our consolidated results.
our peo segment revenues grew 8% for the quarter to $2.1 billion, with average worksite employees growing 7% to 563,000. revenues, excluding zero-margin benefits pass-throughs, grew 7% to $358 million and continue to include pressure from lower workers' compensation and sui costs and related pricing.
margins decreased about 70 basis points for the quarter, largely due to changes in adp indemnity loss reserve estimates, which drove about 60 basis points of pressure resulting from a smaller benefit in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. as a reminder, with adp indemnity results now reported in the peo, it is normal to expect some volatility in our quarterly peo margins as a result of changes in our workers' compensation loss reserves.
let's turn to the outlook for the full year, and start with the consolidated view. we continue to anticipate total revenue growth of 6% to 7% in fiscal 2020. this revenue outlook assumes a more elevated level of fx unfavorability for the remainder of fiscal 2020 relative to our previous expectations. with the recent volatility in overnight and fixed interest rates, we now assume interest income on client funds of $570 million to $580 million and interest income from our extended investment strategy is now expected to be $575 million to $585 million.
with the continued negative interest rate environment in the eurozone, we made the decision this quarter to wind down our two eurozone-related client money movement activities in france and the netherlands. as a result, we have liquidated our dutch client funds portfolio, and we will be liquidating our french client funds portfolio by the end of fiscal year 2020. we, therefore, now anticipate our growth in average client funds balances to be about 4% as compared to our previous forecast of 4% to 5%. this decision is exclusive to france and netherlands. we continue to anticipate our adjusted ebit margin to expand 100 basis points to 125 basis points, and we now anticipate our adjusted effective tax rate to be 23.3%.
the rate includes this quarter's unplanned tax benefit from stock-based compensation related to stock option exercises. it does not, however, include any further estimated tax benefit related to potential future stock option exercise, given the dependency of that benefit on the timing of those exercises. with these slight adjustments to our outlook, we continue to expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow 12% to 14% in fiscal 2020.
moving on to the segments. let's take a look at employer services. we continue to expect 4% to 5% revenue growth in our employer services segment. this outlook includes the anticipated impact from my previous remarks regarding changes in fx and adjustments to our interest income on client funds outlook. we continue to anticipate pays per control growth of about 2.5%. we also continue to expect employer services new business bookings growth of 6% to 8%, and for our employer services revenue retention to improve 10 basis points to 20 basis points.
i'd like to remind you, as i commented in the prior earnings call, that there is volatility inherent in the quarterly employer services bookings metric from larger international and upmarket deals. and i'd also like to remind you of the difficult compare in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 resulting from our strong performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, due in part to a client list acquisition.
moving on to margins. we continue to expect our margin in the employer services segment to expand by 100 basis points to 125 basis point. as a reminder, with a difficult compare resulting from our strong margin performance in the first half of fiscal 2019, we continue to expect a much stronger margin increase in the latter half of fiscal 2020.
regarding our peo segment. overall, our outlook remains unchanged. we continue to expect 9% to 11% peo revenue growth in fiscal 2020, and 7% to 9% growth in peo revenues excluding zero-margin benefit pass-throughs, both driven by an anticipated growth of 7% to 9% in average worksite employees. because of the slower growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we continue to expect the growth in our average worksite employees to be at the lower end of our guidance range in the first half of the year, with a gradual reacceleration of our growth rate as the year progresses.
as we also discussed last quarter, we continue to expect lower workers' compensation and sui costs and related pricing to pressure our total peo revenue growth. for peo margin, we continue to anticipate margins to be flat to down 25 basis points in fiscal 2020, which continues to include approximately 50 basis points of pressure from smaller favorable reserve adjustments in adp indemnity in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019.
before i hand the call back over for q&a. i'd like to share that on february 11th, we will be hosting an innovation day focused on our technology, strategy and showcasing some of our latest innovations. a few of you have had the opportunity to see some of those developments during hr tech. others may have had a glimpse from some of the industry analysts' notes and tweets following our september industry analyst day.
the february 11th event will be specifically for the investment community to share our product and service innovations, and have a dialog around the progress that we continue to make, including how these innovations helped to differentiate adp in the market. we look forward to welcoming you then, and please be on the lookout for further details in the near future.
with that, i'll turn the call over to the operator to take your questions.
",2020-Q1,ADP
,,,,":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from mark marcon from baird. your line is open.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
hi good morning. thanks for taking my questions. one key one is just from a bookings perspective as you look out over the coming year, and you gave us a bit of a sense for the cadence that you expect -- which of the new solutions do you expect to see the greatest traction from? which ones are you the most excited about? and which ones could be the most incremental from a really long-term perspective?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
well, i think from an incremental standpoint -- start off with the last part of the question, from a long-term standpoint, i think some of the investments we've made in some of our next-gen solutions, i think for me has to be one of the most optimistic in terms of potentially moving the needle from an incrementality standpoint, right, because we already have a very large as you know, bookings number, and anything that we can add on top of that goes into the top of the funnel in terms of revenue -- revenue growth. and that's really was the reason for these investments is to really move the needle competitively and to improve our position from a differentiation standpoint.
and so the early signs of course, now somewhat temporarily interrupted by covid-19 were positive in terms of the traction we're getting both with our next-gen hcm platform as well as with our next-gen payroll platform. so that's kind of where i feel the most optimistic in terms of the long-term. in terms of kind of the cadence and more kind of the short- to medium-term in terms of next year -- really the fourth quarter is an important part as we've kind of been alluding to here in our prepared comments and some of that is really clearly the pace of the recovery. so there is -- we have an expectation, which i think is in line with generally accepted i think forecast, if you will.
and you heard kind of as a proxy, the expectation that unemployment reach a certain stage by the end of the fiscal year end, those things are all proxies for gdp growth and you guys all have plenty of access to your own firms' economic forecast and so forth, so the second half is really the key for us from a bookings standpoint. and there aside from the incrementality question, this issue that we have around for example, adjusting to our -- adjustments to our gross bookings is an important one, because to the extent that the recovery continues on the pace we expect, it would help us a lot if we would be -- if we can start and continue to implement clients that were previously sold and that that -- so clearly one positive would be that that doesn't degrade any further because in full transparency, we mentioned that in our prepared statements that's a concern under this kind of an environment, but there is potential upside as well there.
so there is downside and there is upside there as well. but when you see the incredible decrease in activity in just a couple of months following the beginning of the crisis, it takes a while for that -- those buckets to get filled up again in terms of leads then turning into first deployments then turning into presentations to clients. so that whole process of how the sales evolution goes is critical for us in the second half. and the places that were hurt the most, which in our case and some of it is perhaps just because of the nature of the crisis that the downmarket was hit very, very hard in terms of pays per control and also just declines in activity, but also came back, frankly surprisingly -- you can't call it strong because it's still down year-over-year, but i think the bookings performance in the downmarket has been i think gratifying.
and so if we continue on that trend, that will be good news for the second half of the year. and then we expect based on the current trends that the mid-market and the upmarket will then kind of follow suit as the kind of pipeline leading indicators that we mentioned translate into actual bookings and actual sales. so i guess, the short story is the things that were the hardest hit are the things that -- in the initial stages are the things that should have, in our opinion, the biggest rebound in the second half. and then on top of that obviously, our new product investments i think are a source of optimism for us. we've also invested in i think you heard us mention workforce management in the downmarket.
i mean, we have a lot of things going on. you can see it in our investments in technology over the last four to five years and obviously some of those things are longer-term like the next-gen stuff. some of it has been -- we've been investment phase for six to 12 months and we expect those things to translate now into new sales. so i don't know if you heard our tone over the last several years, we pivoted to investing more in product and particularly more around agile technology and that hopefully gives us some firepower here in terms of our bookings incrementality going into this year, but also into the following years as well.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
great.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
mark, yeah, just to add a little bit more there in terms of by each segment, for sure we're expecting sales growth across each of the segments in fiscal '21. and as carlos said, downmarket seems to be resilient and has trended up since we were at the low point several weeks ago but downmarket has been trending up earlier. and then during the latter part of the year, we'd expect upmarket and international for that matter to continue along those lines, but for sure expecting sales growth across all segments. and to carlos' point, from a long-term incremental perspective, certainly expecting next-gen hcm to be a driver there, but our strategic platforms in the near-term run and workforce now have been performing really well in the market and we expect them to continue to perform really well in the market as we recover through this.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
great. just as a follow-up, could you just give us an update in terms of where we stand in terms of the number of implementations on next-gen hcm or sometimes known as lifion and also next-gen payroll this percentage of the client base has been converted?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
so on next-gen hcm, you probably appreciate for two, three months, that wasn't really something that a lot of companies were focused on and for that matter us [indecipherable] unfortunate. but the good news is we did actually start a client just a week ago. so that is a ray of sunshine in what was otherwise a lot of dark clouds. so we had a number of clients that were set to be implemented in our fourth fiscal quarter, which delayed and one of those actually started here already in the early part of the first quarter. so that's encouraging but we're not that different from where we were before. so call it still a handful, i think we have like seven or eight clients live somewhere in that neighborhood on next-gen hcm.
on next-gen payroll, there the target at the beginning from a piloting standpoint really was -- clients are not quite the same size of next-gen hcm. so it's a slightly different dynamic and it's -- and we're making, in terms of numbers of clients more progress, but it doesn't mean that the product necessarily is making more progress. it's just the difference between the markets we're serving. next-gen hcm is really in the early stages aimed more at the midmarket, if you will, than really the upmarket even though we expect it to be our next-gen payroll engine across our midmarket and upmarket in the initial stages, it's really midmarket. so i think we have somewhere around 100 clients sold. and i think maybe that same number implemented, if i'm not mistaken.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
that's right.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
so we're making some good progress there. and there the pace is a little bit better in the sense that we didn't come to a complete stop on next-gen payroll and we continue to implement clients there and kind of move forward. but it's a -- this is a very challenging situation for our clients and we really need to kind of help them get through this situation and the crisis not necessarily press them to get started as quickly as possible although that's obviously our desire from our standpoint.

ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
hello, hello.
operator
pardon me, sir. please proceed with your question. and we'll move on to our next question. our next question comes from david togut from evercore isi.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
thank you. good morning. could you characterize the gross bookings performance in the june quarter prior to the backlog adjustment?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, i mean i think we -- we're just trying to give a nod to our sales force in terms of -- they were -- they performed better than we clearly had forecasted and that we gave in terms of color, commentary during this same earnings call or during the earnings call of the last quarter, but they were still down significantly. so at the end of the day, we just want to make sure that you guys got the right impression that we weren't disappointed and that we didn't do worse than we expected. but from a mechanical number standpoint -- think still down somewhere around 50% like if that's a fair characterization. i don't know if kathleen has any more color there?
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah, no, the gross bookings were slightly positive to what we had expected. the approximately, down 50% is right, which is what we have been anticipating. and then the backlog adjustment, which actually is part of our normal process factored into the overall bookings number being down slightly more than that for the fourth quarter.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. and just as my follow-up, assuming the employment recovery proceeds as you've laid out kathleen -- negative 7% unemployment by the end of fy '21, would you expect to be back on your sort of normalized growth path by fy '22?
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah, go ahead carlos.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
no, go ahead, go ahead.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
it's a great question in terms of when do we return to previous levels of growth and profitability. and as you pointed out, a lot really depends on the shape of the recovery. and look, we've taken the best view we can and try to share with you what we're thinking about that in terms of the shape of that recovery. but it really is going to depend on that. last recession, it took a couple of years for sales and retention and revenue growth to return to the pre-recession levels. now, is it going to look exactly like it looked last time? we don't know. this crisis is different. the make-up of adp is different. so, i hate to say it, but it's going to depend on a lot of factors but returning to those previous growth rates certainly will not be in fiscal '21 based on what we see right now and we'll update you as things change and as we go through the current year.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
i think, maybe just add a little bit of -- just in terms of my own observations from looking at the kind of the quarterly cadence, if you will and how -- what the implications are for fy '22, it really depends on -- are we thinking about sales? are we thinking about revenue? are we thinking about profit growth? and they're all kind of different buckets. but i guess and to kathleen's point, it really all depends -- if this is unlike the financial crisis, not a two or three, the financial crisis really was -- you go back and think about it, the kind of mini crisis that occurred over the course of the following two or three years. remember, we had the european debt crisis. we had a number of things that elongated that situation, but that could happen here as well, and we are of course not scientists and we don't know exactly what's going to happen.
but we're using kind of the same forecast that i think all of you are using and if you make those assumptions around when the healthcare crisis passes, i.e., vaccines and therapeutics and so forth. if you follow that path then fy '22, when we exit in the fourth quarter of fy '21 -- from a mathematical standpoint -- i think you used the term growth rates, the growth rates are going to look pretty good in terms of as you exit from a booking standpoint and then starting maybe with profitability in the first quarter of fy '22 because in the fourth quarter of fy '21 we saw some nde [phonetic] expense. but some of that -- frankly is really the comparisons. so we're going to have three quarters in fy '22 that are going to look pretty good.
because if we still think that the first couple of quarters of fy '21 are still impacted pretty significantly by covid and by the first couple of quarters of fy '22 you don't have that impact you're going to have some -- i hope some really good tailwinds on some of these growth numbers. but the key for me was looking at absolute booking dollars in the fourth quarter of '21 compared to the fourth quarter of '19 because obviously '20 is not a good comparison and looking also at our absolute profitability in the fourth quarter of '21 and our revenue in the fourth quarter of '21. and again, i feel some sense of optimism about '22 based on those exit rate assumptions with a capital a and a capital ssumption because this is -- we're a long way away from having certainty and you've seen how fluid the situation has been. but i think the math i think works kind of favorably once we get through fiscal year '21 and particularly when we get through the first three quarters of fiscal year '21.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. greatly appreciated.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jason kupferberg from bank of america. your line is open.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks, good morning guys. just wanted to start with kind of a high-level question on the fiscal '21 guide, i mean, we've got revenue down modestly, but obviously eps down quite a bit and that's being driven by a little bit of tax, but really the 300 bps of ebit margin decline. and i guess it looks like the transformation savings should largely offset the hit to float income. so, are we really just down to kind of isolating this against decremental margins that maybe people didn't appreciate the -- kind of the severity of or are there other factors there? because i just think at a high level people were surprised to see how much eps is going to be down relative to revenue for the current fiscal year.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
let me take a crack at a couple of high level things. and then kathleen probably can provide some additional maybe detail to help in terms of quantify some of the stuff. but we -- i'm not sure if it was clear from our comments last quarter or this quarter but having been through these types of -- not through a healthcare crisis but i personally have been through dot com downturn, y2k at adp, 9/11 and the global financial crisis. and our board is a board that is long-term oriented and it feels like despite how horrible the situation is, it feels like this situation is transitory and so one of the things that we have as a first principle is to maintain our level of investment.
that doesn't mean that we're not prudent around our expenses and i think we have been and i think kathleen gave you some examples of some of the things that that we're doing. but we're going to add to our sales head count next year, which might surprise some people and maybe not something that you were expecting. and the problem is that when you model only one fiscal year for a company like adp or recurring revenue model, if you decrease your sales cost or even your investment in product and technology, it actually looks quite favorable. and you can probably offset quite a bit of revenue decline. the question is, is that really the right thing to do long-term? we don't believe that it is and so that's one factor, philosophically.
the second factor is that even though we clearly have some decline in the number of clients, the nature of the revenues that are going down is very high margin. so you mentioned client funds interest, but we also have another decrease from a comparison standpoint '20 to '21 in pays per control, which is call it 100% margin as well. and there is very little work related to the number of worksite, i'm sorry, the number of employees paid by our clients. our work is -- workload is generally driven by number of clients and then as we've all now observed in the last quarer also driven a lot by the regulatory environment.
and so the amount of work has not decreased much and in some cases has increased on behalf of our clients. and again, that's a place where we could cut some of that support. and then it would lead to lower nps scores and we probably would have retention go down, but the single most important driver of financial value for adp is client retention and lifetime value. to lose clients and then have to go sell them again and implement them again makes absolutely no sense and all the experience we -- that i have and we have and our board has tells us to kind of stand firm and make sure that -- that doesn't mean that we ignore the realities around us.
if we thought that this was a permanent decrease in capacity of the economy or in terms of the global outlook, and then it was going to last two, three, four years, we probably would be behaving differently, but that's not our expectation, that's not our -- that's not the way that we're managing the company. there's also a couple of other items i think that mathematically may be not helping us and maybe kathleen can help a little bit with some of those sure.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah. look, on the surface the guide to 300 basis point decline on the surface may sound like a lot, but there's a lot going on in there. when you take it apart, i think it's really -- and you put it into the kind of buckets, i think you'll see how we arrived at that guidance and that expectation, right? as we've talked about and as you know we've got obviously a substantial impact from loss -- a very high margin revenue, right? we've got that high margin revenue. we've got clients on interest, which is a hurt on margin year-over-year. we also have growth in zero margin pass-throughs, which falls right to the bottom line from a margin perspective. that's going to be a significant hurt for us where it hasn't been as much in the past.
and the continued investment along the lines of -- look, we think it's prudent and smart to take to continue our long-term view and to continue to invest in sales and in product. we're committed to that level of investment so that's a hurt. and then you do have, as you pointed out, the transformation and other cost actions that we've been taking that only partially offset that. so i would think about it in those buckets in terms of, look, you've got this high margin revenue. you've got some other things that fall right to the bottom line like zero margin pass-throughs and client funds interest. you've got the commitment to continuing to invest and quite frankly, i think we've been executing really well from a transformation perspective and also in terms of looking at -- as we navigate through this period the excess capacity cost that we have and being really smart about addressing those.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
but i guess let me -- just to provide a little bit of color on kind of our view because i learned the hard way from my two predecessors about some of these things. so if you just look at the sales engine aspect of our business and you look at it over multiple years, you can actually do the math that if our -- if we decreased our head count, call it 5% or even if we just kept it flat and you assume the productivity continued on kind of its normal trend, which is a big assumption, but if you even -- if you assume that, you can see the impact that has on revenue growth from multiple years down the road. so obviously, if you expect that you're not going to be able to ever return to the same kind of sales productivity you had before, then you have to do something differently, but that's not the expectation we have right now. and it's critical to our growth in '22, '23, and '24 for us to maintain our investment in our sales engine. not to mention in our product and our technology and a few other places as well.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. yeah, that's really good color. for my follow-up, i wanted to ask just about retention. i know you're forecasting the 50 bps to 100 bps decline this year. i wanted to see if we can get a sense of how that compares to how you exited the june quarter on that metric? and i'm really just trying to get a sense of whether you're forecasting acceleration in churn over the next few quarters or more of just kind of a stable and steady pace of churn?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
again, let me give you some maybe philosophical, high-level comments and then kathleen, maybe can give you some color around the fourth quarter and some of the assumptions. so in general, we've been, and i've been again, having been through multiple downturns and crises, i've been surprised by the resilience of our retention and we think there could be a number of factors here. one of them could be all of the government stimulus, the paycheck protection program, all these things might -- these are all new things compared to the past that might be helping. there is also the potential that some clients are frozen in place, if you will, like, we've talked about how difficult our bookings have been. i think logic would tell me that that's probably happening across multiple industries and multiple competitors.
and so we would be -- actually dishonest not to assume that that might be helping our retention in some parts of our business like the midmarket and the upmarket because in the downmarket it's really driven more by out of business. so having said all that, i would say that a lot of these things are really about timing because if there continues to be government stimulus and there continues to be optimism about this being transitory, then i think this kind of holds. and you have probably some additional fallout in the downmarket as a result of out of business and so forth, but you don't have kind of a major downturn or a collapse in retention. and that's kind of where i am today that we're expecting what i would say is -- i would consider these to be reasonable and modest declines in retention when you compare them to other downturns that we have some data on and some history about.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah, and we did do a lot of work around and analysis around what happened in the last recession and what happened to retention by segment. and i think we've got a pretty balanced view if you look at the decline in retention that we experienced in q4 and what we are guiding to and expecting and planning for in fiscal '21. it's basically in line with the retention pressure that we had during the last recession. so we'll see. i mean, it's really hard to predict. and to tell what level of support the ppp program has had and is going to have, but that's our best view right now.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
i think -- i don't literally don't give it. but i think i feel like this is an environment where transparency is probably not a bad idea just to give you like -- like, that's why we gave you kind of the gross bookings number besides the net bookings number because you guys need to model this stuff so you can understand what's happening here. but think the fourth quarter somewhere around couple of hundred basis point decline in retention, which i think again all things considered, i thought was, and most of that decline frankly came in the downmarket. so that to me feels like better than i would have expected three months before that.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. alright, well, we appreciate all the disclosure. thank you guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from tien-tsin huang from j.p. morgan. your line is open.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, thanks so much for all this detail. just on the transformation initiatives, i caught all the details there. how about looking beyond those two initiatives? are there any other potential actions that you could take, anything that could be material over a similar size?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
again, i'll maybe give some high-level comments and let, i think kathleen give some additional detail. we have a very large menu of things that we can do. this company has a very, very long history of navigating through multiple changes in environments and multiple economic circumstances and now i think we will add to our repertoire managing through a major health crisis and a pandemic. and so, we have -- i don't know how else to put it. we have a huge number of things that we could do, if necessary, and when necessary. this is an incredibly resilient business model. i recognize that this is unusual for adp to be down the way we are, but it is what it is in terms of the economic circumstances around us. but believe me; we have a number of levers. so as i said, like some of these things are -- and our business model are somewhat self-correcting. if in the unlikely event, there was a belief that there was a permanent impairment of kind of global economic gdp or growth vis-a-vis other industries or other companies, i think that we are in somewhat of a better place because the amount of money that we spend on nde and on implementation alone would, at least for the short-term, would certainly enhance our bottom line and help us from a margin standpoint. that's not what we want because the real value to be created here is through growth -- like, through profitable growth, not by kind of shrinking our way into profitability. but we have no intentions of allowing ourselves to underperform, if you will, on a long-term basis below what we have delivered for many, many decades. and that's what '21 is all about. but if circumstances change, we have a very long list and quite a lot of variable expense in our p&l and a very strong balance sheet and a very strong cash position.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
so tien-tsin, thank you for the question. it's a logical question because when you think about kind of the past and the history over the last several years, right, in terms of what we've been driving from a transformation perspective, you can see that we've had these -- several kind of big major initiatives over the last several years, right. we had service alignment initiative first. we have a voluntary early retirement program. we told you about the workforce optimization and then the procurement and now the procurement continues and we've shared with you our work that we're doing around digital transformation. the question, what comes next? quite frankly, i think there is a lot of runway and we have a lot to do from a digital standpoint and also from a procurement standpoint.
it does get harder as you go, i will say, but there is a lot to do there. and a lot of the digital projects, first of all, the digital is certainly focused on our service and implementation, because there is opportunity there, but it is across the entire company. so every single segment and every single department, whether you're front-office or your back-office is tasked with thinking about digital transformation, automation, how do you make the work more efficient, how do you take work out? there is runway there. so i expect that you will hear us talking about that for some time to come. the procurement, well, it does get harder as you go. what i would say is, in an environment like this that we're in right now, in a downturn, it does present some procurement opportunities that may be didn't exist a year ago -- when you actually -- when you go back and you're negotiating with vendors and suppliers and so forth.
so we've got real work to do there. and as you heard us say in the prepared comments, we've expanded procurement to make sure we're capturing all the opportunities. from a real estate perspective in terms of, look, the environment has changed. the way the world is working has changed. let's make sure we are thinking about our real estate footprint in a fresh modern, forward-looking way to ensure we're utilizing the assets that we have to the fullest extent possible. we're understanding how we're going to get work done in the future. we're understanding how we can utilize mobility models where it makes sense to do that. so we've got a lot of work and some really good work to do here from a digital procurement real estate perspective.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
and just one last comment on that. the other thing that maybe is under-appreciated but it's worth mentioning here because again, we're typically not talking about these things as they're more longer-term, but if your question was really more about what's potentially next, longer-term and not just in '21, our next-gen investments are the largest potential digital transformation effort we've ever undergone. and we always focus on them around what they're going to do in terms of our winning in the marketplace and our sales growth and our revenue growth. but trust me when i tell you that the business cases for those investments and the progress we've been making over all these years, there's an enormous expectation for, call it automation, call it efficiency, whatever you want to call it and we don't usually talk about our tax engine, we talk about hcm and payroll.
but one of those next-gen investments is our tax engine, which again there, the early signs -- we already have a couple of hundred thousand clients migrated onto that platform. and when you see how quickly we're able to make these legislative changes in that platform and the cost structure and the cost of support again, i would be very optimistic that one of the largest transformation efforts we'll be talking about in the future when we look backwards is these next-generation investments. i'm hoping they're also going to lead to big growth incrementality and winning more market share in the marketplace, but do not underestimate the value of these investments in terms of our back-office and also our cost structure.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. no, thank you for that. that's very complete answer. if you don't mind, just one quick follow-up, you mentioned the legislative changes and a lot of the work and effort that you've put into that. and carlos, i know i ask you this all the time. so i'm going to ask you again, could we see more demand? i know you mentioned improved bookings momentum that you started to see, but could you see more demand for the service model in general here? i don't know where you're seeing maybe some switching from or more demand for work but again election year, lot of complexity, probably more changes coming. could that help you here?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
i mean, i don't see how it can't. so and usually, i'm not that optimistic or that definitive because if it were only the election, i would say, we'll have to wait and see. but i don't, again, i'm not usually a pontificator, but i just don't see how companies after all this don't reassess not just kind of how they do hcm and payroll and so forth, but so many other parts of their business model where continuity and resiliency and so forth are critical and that applies to the smallest client to the very largest clients. i think that for a lot of us, i don't think we're the only ones or the only industry or space where that's going to be a tailwind but it's hard to believe that this in a positive. now, in what quarter and how do i qualify that because you have gdp going down, i don't know, 30-something-percent in the second quarter. even if people were thinking about that, that wasn't really going to be a factor certainly in the fourth quarter.
the question is how does that net out in the math, right, because you want to somehow be able to parse that out and understand how much of is incremental. and i can't necessarily do that scientifically but intellectually, it's hard to believe that it is in a tailwind going forward for us. and then on the election side, we like -- we generally like change because -- and it doesn't matter whether one party versus the other. we're apolitical as a company. but usually when there's change there is change and for employers. employers are an instrument of policy of the government, it's how public policy gets effectuated whether it's through tax or all the various safety policies and -- you're seeing all these changes in leave policies now to help manage through the health crisis. so that's all incredible, i think opportunity for us to help our clients and when there is opportunity to help clients, that's opportunity to sell new business as well.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. agreed. thank you. have a safe rest of the summer. thanks.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
thank you. you too.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from bryan keane from deutsche bank. your line is open.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi guys, good morning. i just wanted to ask, take another crack on the margin question and looking at it from this perspective. the fourth quarter margin in es was impressive to bring it to flat and you took a lot of the brunt of the hit. just thinking about that fourth quarter versus the guide of down 300 basis points, i guess i'm a little surprised that it doesn't hold up better. can you just contrast the margins in the fourth quarter being flat versus down 300 basis points from that perspective?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
sure. i mean, i think some of it is -- kathleen will go through some of the math but the client funds interest impact is much bigger i think going forward than it was in the fourth quarter because of the laddering that we do in our portfolio. the impact for example of bookings -- we still had a lot of business starting because remember, there is a lag between bookings and starts. so i think you would all be very surprised by how much. even though we had some delays in some -- particularly for larger clients, we started a lot of business in the fourth quarter also and as kind of bookings decline now the starts and the amount of revenue that goes into the run rate declines as well as you move forward. and so you get that sales number back up again.
so i think there are a number of just kind of mathematical realities that i think that hit us in the next two or three quarters in comparison the fourth quarter. but i think that, again, we're not going to do that, like, we're not going to provide quarterly guidance, but i would encourage you to attempt to do either a first half or a second half based on the tone that you're hearing from us or even attempt to do it by quarter because the view that we have of the fourth quarter, again assuming the assumptions are correct, i think paints a very different picture than the picture may be that you're getting by looking at a '21 number. i would also argue that when we talk about '21, its fiscal '21, which happens to be only six months of '21. for every other company out there when you talk about '21, you're talking about the beginning of january of '21 where everybody expects everything already to be back to normal and that is -- in terms of assumption of things being back to normal. so it's a little bit maybe tricky in terms of the thought process and the math. but i don't know if kathleen has anything to add on that.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, yeah, it's a little bit hard to say, ok, compare one quarter to a full year particularly in a year like this when there is so much going on and there's so much linearity aspect in fiscal '21. but what i will say is in q4 we did have sales expense, our nde was actually a little bit of a help in q4 versus it ends up being a surge so that's kind of one difference one to the other. and the other thing is, from a transformation perspective in terms of benefits and how the benefits flow, well, certainly being a favorable and a help for us in each year in fiscal '20 and in fiscal '21, in q4 there is a pretty substantial impact favorability from transformation if you were to compare it to a full year fiscal '21. so it's kind of a math of how it all falls out in a quarter versus in a full year. but again, think about fiscal '20 as sorry, fiscal '21 as look, you've got this high margin revenue. you've got top line stuff that falls right to the bottom line being the zero margin pass-through and the client funds interest. you've got our continued commitment to investments. so you've got that from sales expense partially offset by continued transformation work.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. that's helpful and then just a quick follow-up; the elevated out of business losses, just trying to get a sense of how that's compared in past recessions. and then how much more do we have to go on that? i mean have you written down the majority of it and there's just a little bit left over because i know in fiscal year '21 you're saying there will be some more losses. so just trying to get an impact of magnitude of previous recessions and how much is left. thanks.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
so that really comes through in the retention. so it's not really, we don't quote, unquote, write it down, right? so that really comes through in terms of the losses from a retention standpoint. we have like maybe others some clients that have quote, unquote stopped processing and, but they're still there, and so there is a question of which of those clients come back and which of those clients don't come back. but we've modeled in the downmarket, this is really a downmarket issue. we hope that it's a downmarket issue. at least in prior economic cycle that's been the case. and i think you see it reflected in our retention rate, but it's very, very hard for us to say with any level of certainty, how that's going to exactly play out in the future. we've looked at all the prior downturns, and we know that there's probably some out of business that's still there that's going to occur. and a lot of this is, in this case is going to depend on government stimulus and whether there continues to be some support for small business or not and also just the overall level of gdp and obviously the overall pace of recovery in terms of people going back to spending on products that help small businesses survive.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from lisa ellis from moffettnathanson. your line is open.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
hi, good morning guys. i apologize. i am going to ask one more question on margins. just a clarification on the backside because i think that may be the effect of the deleveraging related to pays per control, i think a little bit steeper than we were expecting, etc. is the implication of that that coming out of this as we get back to better employment levels late in '21 that you would see a sort of similar snapback, is that the way we should be thinking about it as unemployment improves? i mean, when we're looking out into fy '22 or are there reasons that we wouldn't expect that to happen? thanks.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
no, i think that's right. and again, hate to go back to, because i think i would encourage you like i'm doing the focus on both growth rates, but also, because i know they're important in terms of models and so forth, but absolute numbers as well because if pays per control doesn't grow in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '22 we have a serious problem; like if there's not a big snapback of that number, like if there isn't a huge snapback of bookings, we have serious problems. and so the only thing that we think is not something that we want to model improving is interest rates because it just doesn't feel like is a basis for doing that, but i think if you take reasonable assumptions based on economic forecast, you do have a fairly significant snapback in terms of growth rates, if you will or improvement percentages. the question then is, what does that mean in terms of absolute numbers? and so if you still have 7% unemployment, by definition that unemployment rate is still higher than it was in the, call it third quarter of fiscal year '20 and that has some implications in terms of absolute level if you will, of pays per control and we've kind of modeled that in to our assumptions but for sure there's snapback in the numbers. there's no denying.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
good. okay, all right. and then just my follow-up is related to the peo; as you're seeing because i know you don't -- your bookings are yes, related bookings so just a kind of question on demand environment for the peo. as you're seeing companies adjusting now to the crisis and to the recession how is demand acting for the peo? meaning is it positive, because companies are looking to variabilize cost or are you seeing some companies move away from the peo because of reducing benefits? what does that demand outlook look like? thank you.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
i think the demand so far. our experience in the peo has been that it was kind of in line with the rest of the business. it looked a little more resilient in april, which you may have heard that tone from us but then may and june, pretty much in line with what was happening across, yes, in terms of bookings demand. and i think some of that is because of just the sales cycle. if you think about the peo the sales cycle resembles more the upmarket. the lower end of the upmarket than it does the downmarket, even though the average client size is small and that's because it's a high involvement product and high involvement sale because you're basically turning over all of your hcm including your benefits your workers' comp, etc.
so i think that's what we've seen in the short term. if you look at again 20, 25 years worth of history, i can't even believe i've been doing this for that long, but i started my career in the peo and every time there is an economic cycle or a change, whether it's dot com or financial crisis, whenever there is a lot of theories. and i think the secular demand and growth of the peo doesn't seem to be impacted by many things. so i would still expect that kind of solution to have a lot of legs for small and mid-size clients for a long time to come. in the interim, there could be ups and downs, because as you said if companies are quote unquote hunkering down and don't want to offer benefits -- at least in our peo part of the value proposition is benefits and so -- but so far when you look at sales results, lead generation activity, etc, there is no reason to believe that the peo won't recover in the same way that we expect the rest of the business to recover from a booking standpoint.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
terrific. thanks guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from steven wald from morgan stanley. your line is open.
steven wald -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, thanks for taking my question. could we just -- coming at some of the implicit assumptions under the guidance another angle. just curious what you guys thoughts are in terms of what you're seeing conditions on the ground wise in terms of geographic concentration. i mean certainly some parts of the country are more open than others, some industries are doing better than others, i guess, i'm just curious if you guys could sort of separate out how you guys are thinking about that on the go-forward and the unevenness of the recovery and what that means for your client base? i know you've talked about being diversified, but certainly there is a quite disparate experience level across the country right now.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
it's a great question. i think you probably saw in our comments that we said that we observed in our data that there has been a slowdown in the last few weeks, so we are looking at the data weekly and we do look at it geographically, both globally in terms of by country but also within the u.s. by state. and as you would expect part of the challenge in the last several weeks and month has been in the places where you've seen some of the comeback in terms of the virus. the resurgence of the virus in kind of the southern states and also texas and california but nothing back to kind of the full shut down that we saw in april, which is in line with what you're all seeing as well in the new and so forth. this is more about a leveling off of growth rather than kind of a decline. so we've seen it in the same metrics that i talked about in the last quarter. so i can see it in like the number of job postings and screenings and so forth that have that were on a, on an upward trend line and frankly it was certainly not a v, but it was a nice upwardly sloped trend language then it was translating into improved employment, both in our numbers, but also in the government reported numbers, but we have seen a plateauing of that as of the last two or three weeks. and so that's something that we, fortunately we relooked at our assumptions for fiscal year '21 the assumptions we have for pays per control for the first quarter are around what the pays per control exit growth rate was for the fourth quarter and based on this kind of plateauing that feels like the right place for us to be.
and the problem is we don't want to necessarily go tweak the second quarter, the third quarter and the fourth quarter because as you've seen over the last three or four months, three or four months ago we were actually thinking about opening our office in orlando -- in maitland, orlando, because everything was fine in florida and nothing was happening in florida and we didn't know what the hell we were going to do in new jersey and new york. and as we sit here today i'm sitting in the office in new jersey and we're not opening anything in florida. so i think it's unfortunately a very fluid situation and you just have to keep an eye on all of these assumptions, both at the macro level, but as you said, we have very detailed information and a heat map by state. and i would say that what you're hearing and seeing in the news is what we're seeing in the data. but what's translating into is a plateauing or a leveling off of employment short-term so far, not a decline.
steven wald -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's very helpful. maybe if i could just squeeze a quick follow-up in here. carlos, i think he has laid out at your innovation day earlier this year that the addressable market adp sits in, it's about $150 billion of revenue a year growing at 5% to 6%. obviously, that's changed given covid. but i'm just curious to get any updated thoughts you have around maybe where that stands today, but if you can really speak to where it stands today given the fluidity of the situation, how we're thinking about it coming out of it given your comments and kathleen's comments about the enhanced opportunity for the space you're in?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
listen, and there's a lot of smart analysts out there and industry analysts out there that would probably be better answering that questions. and they probably are going to need a little bit more time and information to answer that question, but i would answer it the same with i answered it earlier today, which is i don't know by how much. but it's hard to believe that past the transitory nature of the situation that that growth rate for the industry isn't at least what it is if not higher because and again, i'm not trying to be arrogant that that is only for hcm, but there are other industries that i think have, should have tailwind from these events where the acceleration of people to using cloud services and using, what i would consider to be outsourced services so that you can focus on your core business, but also have resiliency. i think and also, so that you can improve efficiency and you can improve productivity of your workforce and improve engagement of your workforce. all of those things i think are going to get tailwind and it's across multiple technology sectors that i think we're going to probably benefit on a longer-term on a medium-term and longer term basis from this unfortunate situation.
steven wald -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, thanks for taking the questions.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. this concludes our question and answer portion for today. i'm pleased to hand the program over to carlos rodriguez for closing remarks.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
thanks. so just a couple of final thoughts; one is, i know i said it before, but we have navigated through a lot of issues over many decades. i've had the experience of being through several myself, whether it's the dot com recession, what happened after 9/11, the global financial crisis, because in that case, it was really a synchronized global downturn and now this health crisis and the one thing that i would say about adp's business model regardless of i know the focus here is on the short term, but if you stay focused on the long term it's an incredibly resilient business model, financial model but also business model. the value of our products and our services is key. and one small anecdote, i think we may have mentioned it in the last call.
but as kind of this crisis unfolded we had to become, like many other parts of the economy, we had to go and talk to governors and leaders including the white house to make sure that we were deemed an essential service because we needed to stay in operation and so i don't know what better sign there is of a resilient long-term model than to be considered an essential service because we definitely, we definitely are. we're glad we were there to help our clients will still be there to help our clients. but i think that speaks volumes to the long-term viability and also upside of the business that we are a critical service an essential service to the economy into our clients. we're proud of that. and i'm proud of what our associates did to live up to that expectation.
and as to the next year again, i would just encourage everyone to think through kind of first half-second half or even by quarter because at least for me. assuming that we stay on the trajectory that we're on, which i realize is fluid but with those assumptions the fourth quarter exit rate of fy '21 is really what i'm focused on and not necessarily the short-term results of the first few quarters of fy '21 although we're going to do our best to perform as well as we can throughout that as well. and lastly, i know kathleen said in her comments, but we're very proud to have delivered $1.5 billion in cash back to the dividends and $1 billion through buybacks through, which i think is also another sign of the incredible resilience.
and i think cash flow generation capability of this business model in this kind of short-term hit that we're having to revenues and the profitability, i don't believe will impair our ability to continue that tradition of returning cash to our shareholders. and for that, i want to say that i appreciate the patience of our shareholders as well. and all of you and i thank you today for listening to us and for all your safe summer as well. thank you.

and with that, let me now turn the call over to carlos.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, danny and thank you everyone for joining the call. this morning we reported our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 results. although, we ended the year -- this year against significant headwinds related to covid-19, we believe we executed well over the course of the last 12 months and our product offerings remain well-positioned to support sustainable long-term revenue growth as we continue to help companies and their workforces through all types of environments. for the quarter, we delivered revenue of $3.4 billion, down 3% reported and 2% organic constant currency, which was better than our expectations. and for the full year, we delivered revenue of $14.6 billion, up 3% reported and 4% organic constant currency.
our adjusted ebit margin increased 10 basis points in the quarter and increased 60 basis points for the full year, well ahead of our expectations as we managed our expense base prudently to absorb the impact of a decline in revenue in the fourth quarter, while simultaneously providing an elevated level of service to our clients. with this revenue and margin performance, our adjusted eps growth was flat for the quarter and up 9% for the year. considering the unprecedented and evolving macroeconomic situation, we are very pleased with our execution in the quarter and our current positioning as employment continues to gradually recover from the steep declines our clients have experienced. the global health crisis from covid-19 has clearly evolved over these past few months and i'll start today's discussion by providing a brief update on the trends we've experienced.
when we reported our fiscal third quarter results in april, we were just starting to see some preliminary signs of stabilization after weeks of rapid deterioration. more specifically, across our own data sources, including weekly payroll, clock-in volume, job postings and background screenings, there were multiple indications that we were reaching the trough. now three months later, we do believe we saw conditions bottom in late april. whereas our pays per control was trending down mid-teens in april, it has since improved to be down about 10% as we exited the quarter. and for the full quarter, pays per control was down 0.8% better than we had contemplated in our outlook. last quarter, we also discussed our expectation for elevated out of business losses in may and june. those losses ultimately developed in line with our expectations.
this yielded a decline in our retention rate of 20 basis points to 90.5% for the full year, though if not for the elevated out of business losses in q4, we believe our retention rate would have been up for the year. in fact, despite these losses in q4, for fiscal 2020 we tied an all-time high retention for our midmarket and hit a multi-year high in our up-market. looking ahead, we have been encouraged by signs that the economic distress brought about by covid-19 has started to ease in certain countries and several u.s. states, we are seeing continued or even increasing distress in others. and over the past several weeks, we've seen the pace of employment recovery slow. accordingly, as we set our expectations for the coming year we believe that the worst is behind us but the global economic recovery over the coming quarters will be gradual.
kathleen will discuss some of our specific macroeconomic assumptions in more detail. i'd like to turn now to employer services new business bookings. we reported a decline of 21% for the year, which was in line with our revised outlook, despite the limited visibility we had in making that forecast. and although this represents a significant decline, the actual execution by our sales force was better than what this reported growth rate suggests. as we mentioned last quarter, there are two components to our bookings figure: our gross bookings we actually sold in the quarter and adjustments for previously recorded bookings. our gross bookings sold in q4, while down significantly came in ahead of our forecast, and most importantly exited the quarter with improving momentum. this gives us confidence that buying behavior is continuing to trend in the right direction, which we believe will drive further bookings recovery in the coming quarters.
furthermore, our sales force has continued to adapt to this virtual sales environment as we've invested in training state agile on sales messaging and continue to foster our channel relationships. we are also continuing to see week-on-week improvement in leading indicators such as referrals, appointments per salesperson, and demos scheduled. in addition to these gross bookings we regularly adjust bookings we have previously recognized if for example, a client is no longer expected to start within the original estimated timeframe or starting with fewer employees than originally anticipated. these backlog adjustments are ordinarily immaterial to our bookings growth. but as we said last quarter, covid-19 is causing some clients to delay implementations or to start with fewer employees than we originally signed.
we made a larger backlog adjustment in q4 than previously planned and this offset the better underlying sales performance we experienced. looking ahead, we expect we will likely see negative bookings growth in the first half of fiscal 2021 as we are still selling into an unfavorable macro environment, but we expect growth to be flat to positive in q3 with much more substantial growth in q4 driving full year bookings growth of flat to up 10%. beyond fiscal 2021, a key priority will be getting our sales productivity back to or above its previous level. within our control are the investments we make and in fiscal 2021 we are planning to continue investing in product innovation, digital sales capabilities and leading-edge sales tools to drive sales productivity higher. in addition, at this point, we are planning to add modestly to the size of our sales force and together, we believe these investments will position us well to return to our previous -- to our prior new business bookings growth trend line as client buying behavior continues to normalize.
factors beyond our control, including overall gdp trends as well as the timing and scope of workers returning to their job sites will in the meantime likely continue to impact our bookings. moving on, service has remained critical to our clients. our clients look to us for support and guidance in navigating through the complexities of key hr challenges and regulatory change. and our goal has been to serve as a trusted partner as they faced covid-19. our clients have responded very positively to the robust service we have provided. and that in turn has led to record nps scores in june as a direct outcome of our commitment to providing this exceptional level of service and we expect this favorable nps trend to have positive implications for us in the years ahead.
in response to an initial surge in service volumes related to covid-19, we redeployed hundreds of sales and implementation associates to help meet the service need. while average resolution time spent per service request remains elevated as our clients work through complex issues, we have now seen our service request volume return to more normal levels and we are happy to report that we have now deployed most of these associates back to their sales and implementation roles. we continue to keep a watch on proposed legislation that could drive another surge in client service demands and we remain prepared for such a scenario. we also continue to serve our clients through product innovation. during the quarter, we rolled out a range of solutions to help our clients through the crisis and prepare for the recovery. we implemented over 1,000 feature changes in response to 2,000 legislative updates in 60 countries and we also had over 400,000 clients run over 2 million paycheck protection program reports for a total loan volume of approximately $115 billion.
many of those clients have also now run the necessary reports to apply for their loans to be forgiven. looking ahead, a key product focus is enabling a safe return to the workplace and we're offering tools, including touchless and voice-enabled clocking, health attestation and enhanced scheduling and analytics to help clients manage their workforces as they resume workplace operations. we continue to make progress on our other major product initiatives, including the rollout of our next-gen hcm platform and payroll engines. two weeks ago we won yet another award for our next-gen hcm solution, the ventana annual digital innovation award and we remain excited about its rollout. perhaps more importantly, despite shifting our workforce to a remote environment, we remain on track to hit our r&d development roadmap milestones and just this quarter we piloted next-gen hcm and payroll in australia.
our product team also launched our new workforce management solution in the downmarket, launched a new time kiosk in the apple app store and we went general availability with wisely direct in our mid-market and down market. now taking a step back, i'd like to say that in every challenge there is a potential for upside and covid-19 is no exception. we believe that the nature of this shock in which businesses of all sizes have faced major uncertainties in managing their employees has made the hcm partnership they have with adp got much more valuable. and as companies emerge from this crisis we expect them to see even more clearly the benefits of investing in robust secure hcm offerings that include expertise and service to support their mission-critical activities. so although covid-19 has created temporary headwinds in our growth past experience has taught us to stand firm regarding our investments and strategy as part of our commitment to drive long-term sustainable growth.
the strength of our business model and balance sheet allow us to do exactly that. and we are well positioned in our product, service and go-to-market strategy. last before turning it over to kathleen, i'd like to quickly touch on our plans for our own associates. last quarter we discussed having over 98% of our workforce operating virtually including our sales force and we've been pleased with that transition and their overall performance in this environment. while we are well positioned to continue operating this way, we are in the early stages of bringing back a small portion of our workforce to the office on a volunteer-only basis.
and i'm actually pleased to join you today from our roseland headquarters, which we opened just this monday. our sales force will continue to primarily engage with prospects and clients virtually, but they are beginning to conduct face-to-face meetings in some geographies to the extent that they and our clients and prospects are ready to do so. and with all that said, i'd like to once again take a moment to recognize our associates for their outstanding effort and the sacrifices they've made. i understand the monumental task of managing work and home life is a complex situation and i also know it's not easy. a heartfelt thanks to our associates and leaders for their commitment.
i'll now turn it over to kathleen.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
thank you, carlos, and good morning everyone. during the quarter, our revenues declined as we felt the full brunt of a double-digit decline in employment among our clients combined with other recession-driven headwinds. but we believe we executed well and are well positioned to do so for the quarters ahead. for the fourth quarter, our revenue decline of 3% reported and 2% organic constant currency was ahead of our expectations as pays per control and peo performance were better than we had planned. our adjusted ebit margin was up 10 basis points in the quarter also well ahead of our expectations. we took certain cost actions in the quarter, continue to benefit from cost savings related to our ongoing transformation initiative, and also benefited from lower selling expenses, which together offset the margin impacts from the loss of high margin revenues related to covid-19.
our adjusted effective tax rate decreased 210 basis points to 22.9% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. and our adjusted diluted earnings per share was flat at a $1.14 as lower year-over-year revenues were offset by modest margin expansion, a lower tax rate, and a lower share count compared to a year ago. we ended fiscal 2020 with revenue growth of 3% reported and 4% organic constant currency, adjusted ebit margins up 60 basis points, and adjusted eps growth of 9%; all-in, a solid year particularly given the significant decline in economic activity and employment that we faced over the last few months. as i move on to es segment results, it's important to emphasize how resilient the business performance was in the context of unprecedented headwinds, including a 10.8% decline in pays per control and a 22% drop in client funds interest revenue.
during the quarter our employer services revenue declined 6% on a reported basis and 5% on an organic constant currency basis, in line with our expectations as better underlying growth was offset by incremental fx drag. our client fund balance declined 8% in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower pays per control, lower state unemployment insurance rates, payroll tax deferrals among some of our clients and the continued lapping of the closure of our netherlands money movement operation in october of 2019. combining that balance decline with a 30 basis point decline in average yield drove our client funds revenue to decline by 22% to $115 million. for the full year, our es revenue was up 1% reported and 2% organic in constant currency, a solid performance.
employer services margins were flat for the quarter, well ahead of our most recent expectations. we had the impact of lower revenues at relatively high incremental margin as we discussed last quarter, offset by prudent cost control measures across all categories. es margins were up 60 basis points for the full year. moving on to peo, also solid performance given the circumstances; our total peo segment revenues increased nearly 4% for the quarter to $1.1 billion and average worksite employees declined 3% to 548,000. this revenue and worksite employee growth were both ahead of our expectations driven by better retention performance and pass-through revenue. same store employment at our peo clients performed in line with our expectations of a mid single-digit decline. and as expected, was more resilient than the average client in our es segment.
revenues excluding zero margin benefits pass-throughs declined 5%. and in addition to being driven by lower worksite employees, it continued to include pressure from lower workers' compensation and sui costs and related pricing. peo margin declined 450 basis points in the quarter. this included about 530 basis points of unfavorability from a net expense in adp indemnity of approximately $34 million, which contrast to the $22 million benefit we had in last year's fourth quarter. as a reminder, we had experienced favorable workers' comp claim trends over the past several years, which translated to favorable reserve adjustments in adp indemnity. those trends remain positive but not as much as what was factored in our most recent reinsurance agreements. and as a result, we had a slight true up the other way this year.
let me turn now to our outlook for fiscal 2021. i'll start by discussing some of the specific u.s. macro-driven assumptions that underpin our guidance [phonetic]. the basis for these assumptions is a combination of our own trend data and third-party macroeconomic forecasts and we believe we are utilizing a balanced outlook. first, our pays per control outlook; we are assuming a decline in average pays per control of 3% to 4% for the year driven by a decline in the high single-digit range for the first half of the year, improving to a decline of mid single-digit by q3, followed by a rebound to positive mid- to high-single digit growth in the fourth quarter. this outlook corresponds to a gradual improvement in the employment picture through the fiscal year though it did not contemplate a full employment recovery.
to help translate this trend into a single number you can anchor to our guidance contemplates the u.s. getting to approximately 7% unemployment by june of 2021. second, out of business losses; our retention was negatively impacted by losses in this most recent quarter as we had a number of clients turn inactive that after monitoring and assessing we decided to write off as losses. while we believe government stimulus programs have helped many small businesses we continue to see some companies in an inactive state where they are not paying employees. and we expect continued elevated losses in the early part of fiscal 2021 as restrictions and lower demand in certain industries continue to drive fallout. as a result, we're setting our expectation for es retention to decline by another 50 basis points to 100 basis points over this coming fiscal year.
lastly on client funds interest; as discussed last quarter, our clients' balance growth is being impacted by the combination of a decline in pays per control, lower new business bookings, and out of business losses, and we had some modest pressure from companies taking advantage of the payroll tax deferral provision of the cares act. we are assuming a client funds balance decline of 6% to 8% for the year. and like pays per control we expect it to be negative for the first three quarters and then return to growth in q4. we expect our average yield to decline as well. as a reminder, in q4, we temporarily suspended our purchases of new securities and reinvestment of maturing securities in our client funds portfolio. and earlier this month, we resumed reinvesting. we have over $5 billion in securities maturing in fiscal 2021 yielding on average over 2% and we expect to reinvest them at prevailing yields that are well below that level.
as a result, we expect our average client fund yield to be down 50 basis points to 1.6% for the year. with this combination of lower balance and yield, we expect interest income on client funds to be $390 million to $400 million, down about $150 million versus fiscal 2020. and we expect interest income from our extended investment strategy to be $430 million to $440 million, down about $125 million versus fiscal 2020. with that said, without the benefit of our client investment strategy, which utilizes laddered maturities, we believe the headwind for fiscal 2020 would have been even greater. having covered the major macro topics for fiscal 2021 let me share with you how we are deploying our downturn playbook to manage expenses. we've concentrated on areas where we have excess capacity and on reducing discretionary costs, while maintaining investment in sales, product and our associate.
and as we emphasized last quarter, we continue to have the strong cash flow profile and balance sheet strength to withstand impacts to our revenue without taking immediate actions on our investments. we said we would be thoughtful and strategic in assessing the most prudent path forward, a path that balances positioning for a recovery against near-term margin performance. we have now had a quarter to assess our business capacity and needs. and during the fourth quarter, we identified businesses across adp where unfortunately we didn't believe a recovery was likely in the near-term and therefore had excess capacity in service and implementation. in addition to taking specific headcount actions we have further tightened on non-essential spend, including t&e and other discretionary spend.
we are also continuing to move forward with our transformation initiatives. for the past few years, we have highlighted for you some of the discrete material initiatives that we have worked on and their estimated level of benefit. in fiscal 2019, we executed on our voluntary early retirement program, which yielded over $150 million in annual run rate benefit. in fiscal 2020, we executed on our workforce optimization program and a procurement initiative, which together yielded approximately $150 million in annual run rate savings against our original expectations of $100 million. for fiscal 2021, we have two important initiatives to call out. first, we are moving forward with a digital transformation initiative that leverages many of the capabilities we highlighted at our february 2020 innovation day primarily to optimize our implementation and service in addition to enhancing efficiency in other parts of the organization.
as examples, we're further utilizing automation in the implementation process, deploying additional self-service features throughout our platforms, broadening the use of guided assist tools, and expanding the use of chat and chatbot. we expect this to be a multi-year effort as we work to optimize large parts of our service delivery model. our innovation agenda is running full speed ahead and that includes innovation in our client engagement. we also expanded our procurement transformation initiative and expect further benefit for fiscal 2021. we've reassessed our real estate footprint and although we had already closed over 70 subscale locations as part of our service alignment initiative in recent years. we recently closed several additional locations, including a large office in new jersey. we will continue to evaluate whether there was further opportunity for location consolidation.
between these two initiatives, our digital transformation initiative and the expansion of our procurement initiative we expect to realize a combined $125 million in savings during fiscal 2021 with over a $150 million in run rate savings exiting the year. let's now turn to our outlook for fiscal 2021. we'll start with the es segment. we expect to decline a 3% to 5% in revenue for the full year, driven by our outlook for a decline in pays per control, balance and yield pressure in our client funds interest portfolio as well as pressure from new business bookings and elevated out of business losses. compared to what we just experienced in the fourth quarter, we expect the first half of fiscal 2021 to experience a slightly greater revenue decline as the incremental impact from lower sales out of business losses and lower client funds interest more than offset the gradual recovery in pays per control that we're anticipating.
we expect revenue growth to improve modestly in q3 and then turn positive in q4. we expect our margin in the employer services segment to be down about 300 basis points for the year. and as a reminder, the revenues we lose from pays per control, out of business losses, and client funds interest are all high margin. as with revenue, we are expecting a decline in es margin during the first three quarters and an increase in the fourth quarter. for our peo, we expect revenue down 2% to up 2% for the full year with average worksite employee count flat to down 3% driven by similar factors as our es segment, namely headwinds and same-store employment, out of business, losses and bookings pressure. we expect average worksite employee growth to be negative during the first three quarters and turn positive in q4.
our revenues excluding zero margin pass-throughs are expected to be down 1% to 4% and we continue to expect lower workers' compensation and sui pricing. for peo margin, we expect to be down about a 100 basis points in fiscal 2021, driven in part by drag from higher zero margin pass-through revenues, partially offset by a favorable compare for adp indemnity. with these segment outlooks, we now anticipate total adp revenue to decline 1% to 4% in fiscal 2021 and we anticipate our adjusted ebit margin to be down about 300 basis points, as the benefits from our continued expense management and transformation initiatives are partially offsetting the detrimental impact -- margin impact of expected lost revenue due to covid-19 as well as the investments we continue to make. we anticipate our adjusted effective tax rate to be 23.1%.
this rate includes less than 10 basis points of estimated excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation related to restricted stock vesting in q1 of fiscal '21. but it does not include any estimated tax benefit related to potential stock option exercises given the dependency of that benefit on the timing of those exercises. last quarter we temporarily suspended our share repurchases as we decided it would be prudent to wait for stabilization of the overall environment. at this point, we anticipate resuming our share repurchase program at some point this fiscal year subject to market conditions and we have a slight net share count reduction contemplated in our guidance. and as a result of our outlook for lower revenue and margins and higher tax offset partially by lower share count, we currently expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to decline 13% to 18% in fiscal 2021.
as most of you are aware, we also have $1 billion in notes due september of this year. at this point, we expect to issue new debt in the coming weeks or months depending on market conditions. i'd like to conclude by saying that although covid-19 is putting pressure on our financial performance, we believe this is transitory and the long-term prospects for adp are no way diminished and may even be enhanced by the current environment. for fiscal 2021 we are remaining focused on opportunities for innovation and growth while taking a deliberate balanced approach to managing expenses and we are confident in our long-term growth prospects. i look forward to updating you on our progress.
with that, i will turn it over to the operator for q&a.

thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from david togut from evercore isi. your line is open.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you. good morning, and good to see the upgraded guidance. as we enter the critical year-end selling season, i hear the caution around factors like the partial lockdowns in europe and the us election. but can you give us some more detailed kind of insight around your expectations for new bookings, potentially of run, workforce now, and vantage? in our surveys of your customers pre-covid, we were hearing a lot of demand for workforce now, especially into the bottom of the upmarket up to 4,000 to 5,000 employees per company.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, i think that we'd like to be -- given the momentum we just demonstrated, we'd like to be really optimistic. unfortunately, we all watch the same news, and the backdrop in terms of these issues, it's not just europe, i think, there are some concerns here in the us as well. and what we saw from april -- march, april, may is that, we stick to our story that our clients are hunkering down and are unable to make decisions. it impacts us. so, we remain positive because it doesn't feel like there is going to be a full lockdown across the board nationally like there was here in the us last time. and we've clearly adapted. i mean, we've -- you can see it in the quarter, how much progress we've made in terms of being able to sell virtually and use online tools and really ramp up our digital marketing and a lot of other things that we can talk about that we've done to adjust our sales force.
but for us to tell you what our view is of run and workforce now and enterprise sales in the next two to three months, honestly, is difficult other than to stick to our story around our guidance, which is really more about the full-year and couching it in optimistic, positive and good execution terms, but also with some level of caution, because we're still dependent, i think, on the healthcare situation, and to some extent, on the economy as well.
one of the questions that you are not -- you didn't ask, but i'm sure people are wondering is about this question stimulus and that's another one that i wish we could tell you that we have kind of a scientific placeholder in our forecast around how much stimulus and whether there is stimulus or not. and we don't, but that's another factor that i think would just create the kind of overall picture that would either be supportive or not supportive of our sales efforts, because clearly, if you look at the last 20, 30 years of adp, there is some general correlation between gdp and our sales results, our new business bookings, and that is impacted by, not just the economic activity related to the healthcare crisis, but also to things like stimulus because obviously the government can offset down pressure on the economy through stimulus as it just did. but there is also uncertainty around that as well. so, i wish i could give you a more concrete.
one thing i can tell you for sure is, we're maintaining our sales investment. we're maintaining our optimism and we are gradually getting some people back into the field in terms of selling and we're certainly pivoting in a big way in terms of using the large resources we already had with inside sales to really train a lot of our traditional field sales to be able to sell virtually and i think you saw great execution and great results in the quarter as a result of that.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
i would just add one other thought here or comment here in addition to what carlos. i mean, look, obviously, we're very encouraged and we're optimistic because of the great outperformance in q1. but, as you heard us say, we're very cautious because of the various uncertainties that we mentioned, but i would also say, we're cautious because as we look back in history and as we look at how in other recessions how we recovered from that, we do see a period of choppiness. it's not all kind of a straight line up in terms of the recovery during the great financial recession. after that we had, i believe, it was six quarters of negative sales growth after that and it was quite choppy actually. so, we're expecting there to be some choppiness here as well. so, i just want you to be aware of that.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. as a follow-up, how do you see the current economic environment affecting the case for outsourcing of payroll and hr services? in other words, did the economic challenges that businesses face make them want to focus more on their core business and outsource payroll and hr services?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, i think that's safe to assume that we would probably be on the side of the ledger of businesses that would benefit ""under normal circumstances post-pandemic."" so in other words, once we get through the transitory nature of the challenge, i don't see how it's not a positive backdrop for companies like adp and outsourcers who help people, first of all, maintain business continuity. and second of all, focus on their core business as you imply. so, i think it has to, again -- but do we have, or do we -- how many points of growth is that? only history will tell, but we think it will be a positive.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. thanks very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from lisa ellis from moffettnathanson. your line is open.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson llc -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys. thanks for taking my question. wow, the recovery in bookings is pretty fantastic. i know you provided a little color around, a, using your inside sales to train your outside sales. can you just even provide a little, like, what is your sales model looking like right now? to what extent are you using digital marketing and digital onboarding? can you just give a little bit more color around kind of what happened and what changed over the course of the three months to drive that recovery?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i'm not sure that the call is long enough, though, to be able to give you all that because, one of the differences between us and some of our competitors, which i would see it as a positive if i were all of you, is that, we're very diversified both geographically and also across segments. so the answer, unfortunately, is complicated and it goes area by area. so in international, for example, we're very happy with very strong results versus expectation. but also frankly, very strong results versus the prior year. but there were a few larger deals there, i think there were few global view deals that helped. and when you look at the core best-of-breed like in-country solutions, we also outperformed there versus expectations, but not as well in terms of versus the prior year, which is obviously understandable given the pandemic. so that's international.
and then you move to the us and the story in the downmarket is different than the mid-market, it is different than the upmarket, although, across the board, we were better than expected. but the growth year-over-year varied, because i think that's the biggest surprise, which we're frankly very excited about is that, we had positive growth. but if you decompose it, it's a different story in each area. and we had tailwinds in the downmarket, i think as a result of some big recovery that was probably some pent-up demand, the ppp loans probably, frankly, saved a lot of small businesses and provided a lot of cash to small businesses to continue to kind of run their businesses and make decisions around purchasing solutions like what we provide to help them run their business better.
so it really -- by the way, our upmarket was also good and strong. so that was very encouraging. the mid-market, i think performed also better than our expectations. so i wish i could give you a simple answer. i personally see it as a positive because if it was one thing that we could point to, i think it would be problematic because that could easily change overnight, but there really isn't. it's just a lot of execution across the board.
i do think that we got a little bit of help. again, we don't have a scientific way of estimating it. but i've been consistent in the nine years that i've been in this job because of knowing our culture and how we operate, the fact that our fiscal year ended where it did, we clearly had a little bit of pent-up demand from, call it, may-june, that carried over into july. i would say that that was somewhat minor in this case because getting companies to make decisions on your timeline is probably not as easy to do now as it has been in prior years. but historically, when we have a bad year, we get off to a good start. and in some segments, that didn't affect probably international business, didn't affect the downmarket, because the downmarket doesn't really have that ability to kind of hold off on something and start it in the next fiscal year, but may have had a little bit of an impact. but we're pretty convinced that that's not a major story, but i thought i'd -- it's important for me to be consistent because i've been saying that for nine years. by the way, likewise, we have a blow out fourth quarter, we end up usually struggling at the beginning of the next fiscal year.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson llc -- analyst
okay. and then for my follow-up, i know you called out the payroll engine and adding 100 additional clients this quarter. can you just remind us or update us on sort of where you are in that overall rollout and what the kind of rate and pace of that is?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
so, i think we have a total of a couple hundred clients and i would describe that as still -- or very early, compared to adp's size. so if we were a start-up, you'd be really excited. and i think we have a $20 billion market cap right now, with only 200 clients, given what i've been seeing in the market. but the reality is that, relative to adp size and given our profile as a company and so forth, you got to take it in context. but we can't help, but be excited because two years, three years, five years, 10 years down the road, it's going to be a big difference maker. i think it is. and that was our plan when we built the business case. we've been at it for three or four years. this is a global, scalable, new payroll engine. it's incredibly exciting in terms of what it's going to do in terms of feature functionality and hopefully, client satisfaction. but also cost to maintain, cost to develop. but as you know, we have approximately 800,000 clients -- sorry, not 800,000, that's not fair, because run, this has nothing to do with run, but a large portion of adp's business is still on our current versions of our payroll engine, which by the way, all of these payroll engines are transparent to the clients. i don't know if any of you guys understand that.
but workforce now, and vantage, and lifion, and all of our products are the front-ends are really what our clients experience. it's just important to remember that this is not like the transitions we had with workforce now or even with run because this is a gross to net engine, that is really kind of underneath the hood, if you will, of what the clients are experiencing on the front-end. so that's positive too, because we don't anticipate a major migration effort, if you will, when we get to that, which is still at some point in the future.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson llc -- analyst
terrific. thank you. nice job.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from tien-tsin huang from j.p. morgan. your line is open.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks so much. good morning. really terrific new sales results. just to add to what lisa asked at the beginning there. just thinking about roi on your sales investments, did you lean in really hard in this quarter there? i'm sure everyone was motivated to drive sales, but could we see more return on some incremental investments as you go throughout the fiscal year? i was just trying to understand the timing of some of the investments you put in place. and also, if there is any callouts on pricing on new deals, especially on the enterprise side?
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, on the sales investment, what i would say is maybe think about two big buckets in terms of investment from a headcount perspective and continuing to invest in marketing and digital marketing. the headcount investment, we kind of try to do that on a very steady pace over time, and that's been consistent with how we've thought about it and approached it. it was somewhat modest headcount investment in q1 and that will ramp up during the course of the year. we're planning to continue to focus on and do that. and for sure have committed funding and resources, if you will, from a digital marketing perspective to help support the bookings.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
terrific. and then on pricing, anything -- any callouts there?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
no. it's really -- we really don't see any -- i'm sure, i know we did and i think some of our competitors did things to try to help our clients and even in some cases prospects like there was a couple of examples of people giving away like three free months, and i think one competitor was doing six free months, etc. but -- and one competitor changed their pricing online, but then changed it back a couple of months later. so, i would say there's nothing to report. there's really very little change in the pricing environment. this is not -- i don't think this is really a question of pricing. i don't think you can impact end demand in a significant way in this environment through that. that would not be -- certainly, would be our view that that's not how to drive growth.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great to hear. great to hear. just my quick follow-up, just on peo, and sort of the sales outlook there given some of the same caution and uncertainty with the election and maybe insurance. do you -- are you more bullish or less bullish on peo here as we go into this -- the second quarter here versus 90 days ago?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
i'm always bullish on the peo. i was born in the peo.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yes.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
and as you know, so the -- i think the -- as usual, my answer has to be, if you look at the short-term, we have a lot of pressure in some parts of our business because of the healthcare situation and the question is, do you want to look through that or do you want to stay focused on us? for example, in the peo, when you have clients shrinking, we, from a disciplined standpoint, have some rules around that can sometimes affect -- create adjustments, if you will, on our sales results, that puts pressure in the short-term on the sales results, i.e., call it, audits, if you will. so if a client was sold and was valued at $1,000, and 12 months later, they're now valued at $900 because they're paying fewer people and were earning -- were collecting less revenue, which, as you can imagine, is happening with a majority of our clients, that affects our peo sales results. so, i would say, that the fact that workers' comp, and sui prices, and costs have come down, which is part of the revenue picture, there's a lot of short-term transitory things. but i would say on a unit basis, our results were very good in the quarter. and we're very happy with that.
and i would say that again, if there is any businesses that are going to be even more, from a pure positioning standpoint, stronger coming out of the pandemic, the comprehensive outsourcing businesses, which peo is one of them, should be very compelling value propositions because, as people look back a year or two from now, they might be thinking, i really don't want to go through that again, like, i don't want to be figuring out how to process -- forget about payroll because that -- we have that covered. but most people -- a lot of our clients do not use us for health benefits processing or management of open enrollment, they don't use us for time and attendance, they don't use us for workers compensation. and our comprehensive solutions take care of the entire picture.
and i think if you're a small, mid-sized business, if i were you, i'd be thinking about making that change, maybe not right now because you got other things that you're focused on. but i think, six to 12 months from now, i would expect people to be seriously considering any options they have to deal with multiple things that are very critical to the ongoing operations and to their employees. but they may not have thought of pre-pandemic.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. i was going to get you on the phone and start selling them. thank you for that update.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jason kupferberg from bank of america. your line is open.
mihir bhatia -- bank of america -- analyst
hi. this is mihir on for jason. thank you for taking our questions. maybe i could just follow up a little bit on bookings. if you could maybe just talk a little bit about trends you saw in f-1q, and what you're seeing even now, i guess, between small, medium, and large? anything different worth calling out that we should be considering? and then, just relatedly on booking, was there any negative booking adjustment in the f-1q booking number?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
i'm sorry, negative adjustment in which q?
mihir bhatia -- bank of america -- analyst
in the first -- in the booking number, this quarter, like just in terms of the bookings number this quarter, like...
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
we had a minor -- i would say, we had a minor -- we talked about last quarter that we had taken some reserves because we expected to have, obviously, clients that were going to cancel their orders and so forth, the views, laypersons terms, and i think that's exactly what happened. and i think our -- we did reverse some of that reserve, but it was actually very much in line with the actual client that we had identified. we didn't do this kind of at a very high level, like, we had specific clients when we booked that reserve in our ""bookings."" we had identified a list of clients that we thought were probably going to cancel in this first quarter. and i believe the two things [speech overlap]
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah. and so, we utilized -- we basically utilized a portion of that reserve, which is a normal course of how it happens. i guess, q4 was just an outsized amount for that. we call it the backlog adjustment. it's just outside obviously because of the covid impact and a portion of that was utilized in q1, but nothing significant other than that.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
i think it's safe to say, it would not have made a difference. i mean, it clearly would have made a difference if we hadn't had the reserve.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
if we hadn't -- right.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
but if you want to know what our gross bookings performance was, it was not affected by our gross bookings performance. it did not affect our gross bookings performance. you would have basically the same picture.
mihir bhatia -- bank of america -- analyst
understood. and then just any trends between just small, medium, or large businesses, what we were seeing this quarter?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
other than noise, i think we -- probably the strongest performance was in the downmarket because much to everyone's surprise, like there is strong business formation. and we saw that as kind of -- we think we talked about it in our last call, a remarkable recovery in small business very quickly at the beginning of the pandemic, both in terms of pays per control and kind of all categories, including this kind of new business formation. and i would probably add a note of caution there that that to me is counter-intuitive. and whenever in my career i've seen something that doesn't make sense, it generally -- i think there's probably a little bit of payback at some point. i'm hoping i'm wrong because if there is a relatively quick solution to the healthcare crisis, it's possible that the government managed to get small business through this relatively unscathed through ppp and all the other things that they've done. but in general, it's a counter-intuitive kind of situation. but we'll take it. it's -- it was positive.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah. the other areas where we saw some particular strength is, i think we mentioned already on the international side, particularly canada was very strong for the quarter and also our compliance services area, so things like employment verification, unemployment claims, things like that, more compliance services-related stuff. so a very strong bookings performance in the quarter.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
that's a great point. like, we don't always talk about some of these businesses that we have that are very good businesses, that are -- we call them stand-alone businesses, and we did have some good tailwinds from some of those businesses. but again, i would tell you that they don't change the overall picture, but important to note that those were helpful.
mihir bhatia -- bank of america -- analyst
understood. and then just if i could follow up real quick on your ebit margin guidance. you had a pretty nice raise in the guidance, and i was just wondering how much of that is driven by the stronger top line outlook versus changes in your expectations for expenses. i know you mentioned an extra $25 million in transformation savings, but were there other factors because it doesn't look like it's just float income, didn't change all that much. so, anything else you could give us there? thank you.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
i would say, it's safe to assume that most of it is as a result of that. but that -- i don't want to take away from us in terms of our execution because if we have higher revenue, we also, frankly, have more clients, more employees to pay. so, to the extent that we believe we can hold the line on expenses, some companies they have to cut expenses, in our case, we just have to hold the line and that's probably good news. but i would say that mathematically you're on the right track, which is -- that's a big factor. the incremental revenue is -- a lot of it is flowing to the bottom line and helping our margins.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah. definitely that incremental high margin revenue is the biggest contributor, but also, as we said, look, we've been really focused on making sure we're doing a good job on cost control. we're keeping a close watch on headcount. we talked about investment in sales, but other than sales, we're really controlling everywhere else from a headcount perspective. very tight on discretionary costs, transformation work is coming along very nicely. we did a little bit better with the higher retention, better on bad debt expense in q1. we think we're cautious about that because we think it could come and hit us in q2 and q3. so we've built that into our expectation. but those were the contributors.
mihir bhatia -- bank of america -- analyst
understood. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from ramsey el-assal from barclays. your line is open.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
hi. good morning and thanks for taking my question. i wanted to ask about the contribution to bookings performance of delayed kind of bookings getting realized this quarter versus sort of net new bookings. i'm just trying to understand the contribution from maybe sort of a backlog of delayed bookings and how material that was. and then also to just understand what it is sort of a pipeline of these delays that should flow in, kind of continue to flow in as we get a little deeper into the year, or is there more of sort of a one-time catch up that happened in the quarter with some of these delayed deals that make sense?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
i think the only place where it's really meaningful and quantifiable is probably in the international space, where we had -- i think i mentioned a few global view deals that were delayed, if you will, but that's really not a -- i wouldn't call it -- that's not something that was in the -- necessarily in the backlog because we hadn't sold it yet. so, we don't actually book a sale until -- it doesn't go into the backlog until we get a contract. and so, these were things that were in process, if you will, or in the sales process. and maybe, we thought it was going to close in may or june, but by the way, maybe it wouldn't have with -- even without a pandemic like there's really no way to -- this is all, frankly, speculation stuff that we're -- that we do when we get into these kinds of conversations.
but i'd say that's the place where it feels like we had a few large deals that we thought we're going to close in the fourth quarter and didn't. by the way, client decisions, not us trying to move them from one quarter to the other. we want to get business as fast as we can, so we are always trying to book everything as quickly as we can. but couple -- some client delays in the international space. it's really not honestly a factor in the downmarket and very small factor in the mid-market in terms of controllability, like we can't really sway our clients that easily from one way to the other. maybe a little bit of that in the upmarket and international, but you really can't do that in a downmarket and the mid-market.
so, i would say, there is a difference between, i guess, i'm not sure what the nature of the question is, but i think i already said that there could have been some -- in some segments of our sales force, if you have a terrible year and you're in the last month and you're not going to make the year, there are sometimes, the tendency for people to hold and start that business in july. but i think you saw in our comments that august and september were also strong. so, it doesn't feel like -- and people don't like hold something from may and june and then book it at the last day of september. like, they typically put it in the first week of july.
and so, again, based on my experience, what i've seen here over the years, there was probably a little bit of that, didn't make a material difference in the sales results, and it is where it is. we had great -- we had a great start and i think great execution and, besides us leaning into our sales investments, a really big difference maker here is our sales force leaned in to drive results, right? and we're incredibly grateful to them for that.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
all right. that helps a lot. i appreciate it. and just a quick follow-up, on the -- if you could give us an update on the rollout of the next-gen hcm and the payroll engines relative to, let's say, three months ago or four months ago? how do you think covid is going to impact the rollout of some of the next-gen technology? is it going to be -- you had mentioned some delays, i think previously, but how is it looking now?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
well, we had a -- i think we had a good quarter. like, i was -- frankly, any client to me is a good client, is good news. and i think we had three or four, i think danny probably remember.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
that's right. yeah. we had a couple of good sales [speech overlap]
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so we had some -- like closed, in other words, we got people to sign contracts in the quarter. like, i don't know about anybody else, but i'm not signing a lot of contracts in this kind of environment like we just -- the whole focus of this call is how we're focused on prudent expense management, trying to keep expenses down. so when people are coming to me selling me things, i'm generally not a big signer on those types of things. it just shows i think the value of our value proposition that people are still signing up because i think they believe that it will, not only help them in the short-term, but that perhaps it can make them more efficient even in the short-term. so, i think that is a good sign, right, of the strength of our products, and the solutions, and the pitch that we have. but that was good news, i mean, we were pleasantly surprised.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah. and we have several dozen, i think, in implementation -- active implementations right now. so, the sales are continuing, the backlog, the implementations continue to scale up. so, really no significant or substantial change in the outlook on that [phonetic].
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
i think besides the sales, we actually started i think a number of clients, well, three or four, also, dan?
danyal hussain -- vice president, investor relations
yeah. we're in the double digits now.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
these are clients. so we actually sold new clients, there are some new contracts that are now going to go into the implementation process. but we had clients that were in the implementation process, a few of which delayed starting in the fourth quarter, but then we started them here in the first quarter. so, i would say, that's all good news. and on next-gen payroll, you heard what we said, we sold a 100, which, again, i think is pretty damn good news, like in this kind of environment.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
agreed. i appreciate your answers. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from steven wald from morgan stanley. your line is open.
steven wald -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you. good morning. so, i'd love to come back to the margin. i know it's beating [phonetic] over the head, but maybe just a couple of other sort of ways to look at it. it seems like the way you're looking at it going forward is, if macro cooperates, the higher margin pieces of the revenue could drop to the bottom line, drive incremental upside from here. is that the right way to think about it? and generally, should we assume that implicit in the remaining three quarters of the year, that a lower margin implicit assumption for, at least a couple of those quarters, is really more dependent on the macro than it is on your pace of investment, which i think we maybe collectively thought was going to be more robust, and the headwind relative to what it ended up being this quarter?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
so, i mean, just to clarify, remember, we outperformed not because we stopped investing, we didn't invest as much as we said we're going to invest, is because we outperformed on the top line, right, in terms of our revenue, even though some of it was clearly expense management and so forth. but i would say that the answer to that question is that, it's hard to wrap your head around our economic -- i know it's hard because most companies don't operate this way. but, for example, the better things get in terms of the macroeconomic, the more we're going to invest, and i know that's not going to make some people happy. but like, for example, our fourth quarter, like our fourth quarter, like if things play out the way we planned in terms of the original guidance, this is not -- we're not changing anything on you, but like our fourth quarter, where we have easier comps, we would also expect to have great sales results, right? and those great sales results on a comp basis will also bring with them sales expense. and to the extent, we can get some of these clients started, and our sales results improve, we're going to start also investing more and stepping on the accelerator on implementation expenses. so, this is all carefully planned, carefully controlled, as kathleen was alluding to, like this is not some kind of free-for-all in terms of expenses, but this is an amazing economic model.
i don't know if you can see what we just delivered and what we're telling you that, assuming that the situation cooperates with us, we probably will be either flat to slightly up in terms of revenue for the year. so that would mean that we'll continue our streak of adp of never being negative revenue growth, which is pretty remarkable, right? we had a massive decline in volume in the last quarter. massive declines in new business bookings and you see now -- now, granted this is not what we are targeting like we'd like to have high single-digit revenue growth. so it's kind of weird that we're excited about flat, but it's all about the context and it's all about relativity. so it's really a great economic model. but the economic model is a long-term economic model. you have to invest in sales, implementation and product to drive the results. this is not -- we're not running the business quarter-to-quarter, and what that means is, the minute we see the sunshine -- the sun shining, we're going to become boast [phonetic]. it doesn't mean that our expenses are going to get out of control, but you will see our sales and our implementation expenses gradually come up, and along with that, at some point, our service expenses as well. but that's great because the most important driver of long-term value of this company is growth. it's not what the margin is next quarter or this year.
steven wald -- morgan stanley -- analyst
i completely understood. i'm sorry.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah. just some more color from my perspective, i mean, i would just say, look, we continue to be, as we always have been, very, very focused on growth and efficiency, and becoming more and more efficient every day. so, we're going to continue to invest where it makes sense for growth and for efficiency. so, we talked about sales headcount and continuing to support that investment, investment in product, and we invest in efficiency, all the digital work that we're doing isn't -- doesn't come for free, you have to make investments to be able to drive that efficiency improvement. so, we're focused on all of that and we're going to continue to do that.
danyal hussain -- vice president, investor relations
and, steve, just one last thing to tie it back to our guidance. you're right, certain macro factors will have an outsized impact for the next two quarters. and so, what we contemplated is pressure in retention and pays per control, both of which come at high incremental margins. if ultimately those come out better than forecast then, as you suggest, it would represent upside to margin.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
and there's a few others like kathleen mentioned, bad debt expense is also something that, frankly, has been shocking in the last six months where we've had, honestly, like decreases in our bad debt expense, which makes no sense at all. so, hopefully, that will continue, but we didn't plan for that. i think we didn't roll forward three quarters of lower bad debt expense.
steven wald -- morgan stanley -- analyst
right. okay. that's all very helpful. thank you. and then maybe as my follow-up there. i think it was asked a little bit before, but carlos, you just -- you were just talking about it a little bit ago there of just kind of wanting to grow mid- to high-single digits. if we rewind to, say, back to january, and you guys talked about the markets you were in and how you were growing, sort of seemed like the way to think about it was you were generally growing in line with the market. and i think your earlier comments indicated next few years should be an uptick, but there's going to be choppiness, of course. i guess, i'm curious how you guys think of adp's positioning relative to other platforms. and obviously, you had a really strong quarter, but for the last several years, you've seen a lot of other platforms growing in excess off of much lower bases. i'm just curious how you think about it today versus six months ago versus a year ago. if we are to see this uptick in hcm demand and outsourcing demand, where you feel about adp's positioning in that market?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
well, i would answer that question just by saying that we just invested hundreds of millions of dollars in new platforms in our key markets because we intend to take market share.
steven wald -- morgan stanley -- analyst
couldn't be clear than that. okay. i'll leave it there. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from kevin mcveigh from credit suisse. your line is open.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks. hey, kathleen, you talked about kind of out-of-business and the guidance looks like it's -- it calls for kind of elevated losses in q2 and q3. did it bottom in q1 and gets better? and then, i guess, just along those same lines, can you talk about, is there a way to also frame clients that are maybe still in business, but not processing at this point? so, i guess, two different questions, just trying to get a sense of, a, where the out-of-business? did it bottom q1, and then improves in q2, q3? and then, is there a way to frame clients still in business that maybe aren't processing at this point?
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah. so on the first thing, the out-of-business, i would not say it bottomed at all. in fact, we did not see a significant impact from out-of-business in q1. i think the shoe has yet to drop there, is how i would say it. and that's what we are forecasting and guiding that we're going to see some pressure from that in q2 and q3. does it come in q2? is there more stimulus that helps support it and we don't see it in q2, and maybe doesn't come till q3? i don't know, but we're planning. i think we're cautious about it and we're planning to see that in -- that pressure in q3 -- q2 and q3, sorry.
danyal hussain -- vice president, investor relations
and on your question about clients not processing, we did mention that a number of small businesses restarted in the first quarter, but there is still a sizable chunk of companies that have gone inactive and remain in that state.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
and to be clear, there is just -- in case there was a misunderstanding there, that doesn't have -- has nothing to do with our business bookings, right? so that affects our revenue and affects our losses to some extent. but -- and this is unrelated to business bookings because the word restart might confuse some people.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, it's higher than it would be in a normal period. it's come down from where it was at the peak in probably our april, may, june, it's come down from there, but it's still higher than normal situation.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. and just to wrap that point, carlos, it's fair to say that with the stimulus, it probably helped those inactives a little bit, that maybe would have fallen into bankruptcy? is that a fair way to think about it too?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
no question about it.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
cool. and then just real quick, it looks like the midpoint of the revenue guidance for es is a 300 basis point improvement versus a 150 basis point improvement for the peo. any puts and takes to -- i know it's not one to one, but is it just kind of the client mix that -- where you had seen a little bit more upside on es as opposed to peo or just any thoughts around that?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
no, other than -- that's actually a great question, which we'll go back now and decompose that because we hadn't looked at it that way. at least i hadn't. but, i would say, my instinct would tell me that has more to do with how the operating plan was built than any macroeconomic or other major explanation. so, honestly, i wouldn't read much into that.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. and we'll take our last question from mark marcon from baird. your line is open.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
hey. good morning and thanks for taking my question. just with regards to the bookings performance this quarter, to what extent do you think it was due to the sales force basically recalibrating and being able to get out at getting more at-bats relative to a higher batting average, so in terms of thinking about the win rates? and then i have a follow-up with regards to next-gen.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
that's a great question. and i have some sense of that from looking at the data right from the quarter. and i would say that, our win rates are in line, i think a little bit better in some cases against a few competitors, which is -- makes us very happy. but, i would say, there's not a lot to report there that that is, i think good news, but consistent, if you will, in general. so, it's probably more the former rate, which is the at-bats and you could almost use the -- what i -- i call it the traffic analogy, right? so, ever since the pandemic started, whenever i go out on the roads, i do the traffic check. and traffic is much higher and has been much higher over the last two months to three months than it was in march and april, and that probably has something to do with just, obviously, just people on the streets, but people on the streets turn into people buying things and people going to restaurants and people going back to their workplaces and so forth.
so, i hate to be so crass and so simplistic, but i think that adp is a very large company, which we're very proud of and the gravitational pull of gdp and economic activity is strong in both directions. and i think we benefited a lot from, i think it's safe to say, better than most people. i mean, i think this is not an adp issue. i think most economists have raised their expectations about gdp, unemployment is lower than everyone thought, even though labor force participation is lower. in general, things are better than people thought they were going to be in, call it, may, june, at this point and we have benefited from that. i think that's -- i wish i could take more credit and give you a more complicated answer, but i think that is the -- that is actually what's happening and the traffic is up, for sure.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
great. and then, just a short-term and a long-term question. but the short-term one is, basically, just as we're here in the key fall selling season, how do you view, carlos, the kind of the mixed dynamics with regards to, hey, there is more uncertainty, there is this resurgence with regards to covid, there is the election, perhaps not a lack of stimulus but at the same time, things are more complicated, hr is more central. how does that end up impacting kind of the new sales, the bookings expectation, just here in the core selling season?
and then the longer-term question is, next-gen payroll, lifion, they've gotten really nice awards. you've obviously been inhibited by the pandemic in terms of being able to go out there and talk about it with clients. but when things get a little bit back to normal, how would you expect the penetration of those elements to go over the next year, two years, three years, like when would we see a big -- a bigger penetration? so, they've gotten really good rewards.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think on the first part of your question, it's -- of course, the last question, of course, has to be the downer question because i think that's a hard one for me to -- i've been so optimistic the whole call, so i hate to like bring us all down. but based on what i'm seeing right now, both in the us and in europe, and the fact that this is our key selling season, i wish i could tell you that i'm incredibly excited and bullish, and so forth. i just want to get through this damn thing, right, and get out to the other side. and i'm looking forward more to the third quarter and fourth quarter -- and the fourth quarter and the next fiscal year than i am to the next two months or three months because the combination of the election with -- i mean, you guys all see the same thing that we're seeing. and again, you got to apply the test of common sense and the test of common sense would tell me that this is a -- let's just try to keep us upbeat. let's just call it a fluid situation.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
it is fluid but it's going to be choppy, right? i mean, we thought we'll cover it from the last recession that it was choppy, and i'm fully expecting it's going to be choppy this time around too, particularly, right, we're in q2, we're in the fall, going into the winter, it's cold, we've got areas where there is resurgences, that people might be hunkering down again. so, q2 might be challenging, but even in normal situations -- normal years, right, bookings are going to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. i'd focus more on the full-year, the annual, and the longer-term view.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and again, of course, we also thought that the first quarter is going to be terrible, and it turned out to be home run. so, they can go -- easily go the other way, but i'm a man of like, i speak the truth, right, in terms of what i know and what i think at the time. and i spoke the truth in our last earnings call, and obviously, i was wrong because things turned out to be much better and i hope that happens here again. but that's my story and i'm sticking to it.
but one quarter or two quarters or three is not going to make a difference in adp's long-term trajectory. what matters is the second part of your question, which is, what do we intend to do? what do we expect in terms of penetration rates and rollout of kind of our next-gen platforms? and by the way, it's not just about next-gen like, i hope you guys understand that we are making some fairly sizable investments -- ongoing investments in workforce now. workforce now, now we have a version, if you will, i shouldn't call it a version, but workforce now is also on aws, in the cloud. so, we've completely rebuilt workforce now to be as modern as next-gen, as lifion, and as our next-gen payroll engine.
we also have been doing an enormous amount of work on run in the same vein, both at the guts of it, in terms of the technology stack, but also on the user experience. you know what the investments we made in data cloud. you know what we have with adp marketplace. so this is an across the board increase in investment over -- methodically, over the last six years to seven years that i'll just summarize it by saying what i said once before, our intention is to have all of these things parlayed into taking market share and growing adp faster than market and faster than the economy.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
that's great. thank you.
operator
thank you. this concludes our question-and-answer portion for today's call. i am pleased to hand the program over to carlos rodriguez for closing remarks.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
well, thank you, all of you for listening. again, in summary, i just want to once again, i think complement the -- our associates and our leadership team for incredible execution in the short-term, but i hope you also heard our commitment to the long-term in both, in terms of sales, r&d, client service, and all the things that drive growth and long-term value for our shareholders, and hopefully, for all of you who represent them.
we remain committed to expense management, to digital transformation, all the things that kathleen said, but we are somewhat beholden to, obviously, the circumstances around the economy and the healthcare crisis. but we remain optimistic that this is -- and it's the reason for optimism that this is a transitory situation that we're going to get through it, hopefully in the next three months or six months to the point where things gradually start to get back to normal, and then adp can get back to the normal growth rates that we're used to.
so, thank you, again, and appreciate your supporting and listening to us. and i hope that all of you continue to stay healthy and safe. thank you.

operator
good morning. my name is crystal, and i will be your conference operator. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to adp's first quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. i would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [operator instructions]
i will now turn the conference over to mr. danyal hussain, vice president, investor relations. please go ahead.
danyal hussain -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, crystal. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining adp's first quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call and webcast. participating today are carlos rodriguez, our president and chief executive officer; and kathleen winters, our chief financial officer.
earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. our earnings materials are available on the sec's website and our investor relations website at investor.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call, as well as our quarterly history of revenue and pre-tax earnings by reportable segment.
during our call today, we will reference non-gaap financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. a description of these items, along with a reconciliation of non-gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measures can be found in our earnings release.
today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. we encourage you to review our filings with the sec for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. as always, please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions.
and with that, let me turn the call over to carlos.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, danny, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. this morning, we reported excellent first quarter fiscal '21 results. and i'm very pleased to say that across the board, we delivered a very strong start to the year that was well in excess of our expectations.
for the quarter, we delivered revenue of $3.5 billion, down just 1% on both reported and organic constant currency basis. and our adjusted ebit margin was up 120 basis points. coupled with a slight increase in the effective tax rate versus last year in a share count reduction, our adjusted diluted eps grew 5%, much better than our expectation three months ago, which was for a meaningful decrease in eps. on this call, we'll discuss the changes that drove adp's better-than-expected start to fiscal 2021.
in q1, macroeconomic conditions continued to gradually improve and we executed extremely well in several key categories, including better-than-expected sales performance, a continued commitment to client service, and prudent expense management.
let me start by covering key macro-related trends to provide context to our results, specifically on pays per control, out-of-business losses, and client funds interest. during the first quarter, pays per control, which, as a reminder, declined 11% in the fourth quarter, was in line with our expectation for high-single-digit decline with a year-over-year decline of 9%. and in a continuation of the trend we saw into our fiscal 2020 year-end, employment in small businesses continued to show the most improvement while large businesses actually showed some degradation as we exited the first quarter. out-of-business losses performed better-than-expected, as small business losses stabilized and a substantial number of clients that had gone inactive last quarter, have restarted processing activities over the last three months.
finally, average client funds interest rates declined in line with our expectations for the quarter. but client funds balances were favorable to our expectations, declining 7% compared to our double-digit expectation.
with that said, let me shift to the highlights resulting from our own execution. we delivered positive 2% growth in employer services' new business bookings, which was significantly ahead of our expectations and marked a record q1 performance. as you may recall from our commentary last quarter, we did expect some amount of sequential improvement relative to our q4 bookings performance as economic conditions stabilize. however, we delivered a much faster reacceleration as our sales force started strong in july and carried that momentum through the end of the quarter.
we attribute the rapid reacceleration to a few key factors. first, we did see our clients and prospects show greater willingness to engage and purchase. but second, and most importantly, we took action. by maintaining our overall investment in sales and marketing, applying our best-in-class inside sales expertise to continue training our field sales force, and utilizing innovative demos and other hcm contact -- content to start conversations, we've designed a client acquisition funnel that is successful even in the current environment.
our teams delivered across the board, that's everything from the downmarket, where run continues to grow, and in fact, we've now exceeded 700,000 run clients for the first time, surpassing pre-covid levels to the mid-market, where we're seeing clients showing more interest in fully outsourced hro solutions to the enterprise space where we had strong traction in compliance-related solutions.
our international sales were also strong. as we closed several larger deals that were previously put on hold as prospects were waiting for a more stable environment to proceed. and our tax rates on many of our solutions continued to increase as well. this quarter, our workforce management solutions, also referred to as time and attendance, reached the 90,000 client milestone for the first time. and we're pleased to see that continue to grow.
our revenue outperformance was also driven by stronger retention. we are very proud to report that we had record employer services retention levels for a q1 period, and our performance likewise experienced -- and our peo performance likewise experienced stronger-than-expected retention. while our retention likely benefited from having some clients delay decisions to switch hcm vendors, given elevated uncertainty, higher client satisfaction clearly contributed as well.
you may recall that last quarter, we delivered record nps scores across our businesses as we helped our clients manage through government programs like the ppp. this quarter, i'm happy to say that across our businesses, we either maintained or reached new record nps levels. we believe these results show that our commitment to providing outstanding service to our clients is paying off, and will continue to do so.
combination of stronger bookings and retention in q1 drove better revenue performance and the high incremental profitability associated with those revenues, plus prudent expense management ultimately drove stronger margin performance as well. this is another great example of execution by our associates and in a few minutes, kathleen will cover our margin performance in more detail.
i'd like to now provide an update on the progress we continue to make in driving innovation. earlier this month, as part of the annual hr tech conference, adp was given the top hr product award. this marks a record-setting sixth consecutive year that we have been recognized at the conference for our breakthrough technology innovations, which is representative of how we remain committed to leading the industry with the premier hcm technology. this year, we were recognized for our next-gen payroll engine. and as we highlighted in our february innovation day, the benefits of this new engine include a policy-based framework that enables easy self-service and powerful transparency, that allows practitioners and employees to more easily understand the effects of regulatory, policy or potential life changes and is designed to be scaled globally.
we continue to deploy our next-gen engine to the market and we added another 100 clients during the first quarter. we remain excited about expanding its availability and driving adoption and the feedback so far has been overwhelmingly positive. ultimately, we expect a higher level of satisfaction to generate even better retention and higher win rates, supporting our long-term revenue growth trajectory. and we continue to innovate throughout our ecosystem. this quarter, the adp marketplace reached 500 app listings and we are pleased to offer an expanding suite of offerings as we continue to drive millions of daily api transactions for tens of thousands of clients that are current users. and just this past week, we hosted our annual adp marketplace partner summit, where we further strengthened our partner relations and provided actionable ideas to help our partners grow their business.
also, earlier in q1, we released our return to workplace solution that helps clients bring their employees back to work safely through a comprehensive set of tools designed to streamline and manage the process. we now have thousands of clients using the return to workplace solution and we expect usage to grow over time as more clients start to gradually bring their employees back to the office or the worksite.
as i said, we are very pleased with the start to the year. and i'd like to recognize our associates, from sales to service to implementation, and all the others who support them for their continued efforts and outstanding performance during this time. they continue to come through for our clients when it matters most.
and with that, i'll now turn the call over to kathleen.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
thank you, carlos, and good morning, everyone. we had a great q1, with the combination of gradually improving macroeconomic conditions and outstanding execution, driving better sales, retention, and overall volume. we do expect to continue to face a number of headwinds over the course of fiscal '21 as the global economy continues to recover from the effects of the covid-19 pandemic. but with our strong first quarter, we now see the potential for a better full-year outcome, compared to our outlook three months ago, and our updated guidance reflects this view.
for the first quarter, our revenue declined 1% on a reported and organic constant currency basis. clearly, a nice start out of the gates, and better than we were expecting three months ago. better bookings and retention rates were the main drivers of revenue favorability. and that, coupled with expense favorability, resulted in a year-over-year increase of 120 basis points in our adjusted ebit margin. as you will recall, we anticipated that first quarter would have a modest acceleration in bookings compared to the previous quarter, but a greater year-over-year revenue decline than we experienced in the previous quarter. and that much of this lost revenue would be at very high margin. instead, our bookings swung to a year-over-year increase, revenues declined only modestly, and our margins expanded even with the sales and implementation expense generated by a much stronger than expected bookings quarter.
several factors drove this margin favorability. first, with a more modest revenue decline than expected in q1, we saw less associated margin pressure than expected. in addition, the better retention we had in q1 also translated to lower bad debt expense than we had originally contemplated. we also continue to execute our downturn playbook with our entire organization carefully managing headcount and discretionary expenses.
and lastly, we made great progress on our digital transformation and expanded procurement initiatives in q1, and effectively reduced operating expenses and overhead faster than anticipated. we are encouraged by what we've seen so far and are making a modest increase in our expected full-year cost benefit from these transformation initiatives. and now expect $150 million in benefit for fiscal '21, up from $125 million. that revenue and margin performance together drove adjusted ebit growth of 5%.
our adjusted effective tax rate increased 10 basis points, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2020 to 21.3%, driven by lower tax benefit on excess stock compensation.
our share count was lower year-over-year, driven by both share repurchases that took place pre-covid, as well as the resumption of buybacks during the quarter. all of this combined to drive 5% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share to $1.41, a great start to the year.
now, some detail on the segments. for es, our revenues declined 3% on a reported basis and 3% on an organic constant currency basis, a great result considering this quarter included the effects of a 9% decline in pays per control and a 20% drop in client funds interest revenue, plus the impact from last quarter's lower bookings level. our client funds balances were down only 7% better than the double-digit decline expected and that outperformance was driven by the same bookings and retention-related factors that supported revenue. the year-over-year decline in average balances continued to be impacted by lower pays per control, lower state unemployment insurance rates, continued payroll tax deferrals among some of our clients and the closure of our netherlands money movement operation in october of 2019.
our average yield for our client funds interest declined by 30 basis points, about in line with our expectations in this low interest rate environment.
employer services margin was up 120 basis points for the quarter, well ahead of our most recent expectations, driven by the same factors i mentioned earlier when discussing consolidated results.
for peo, also a strong quarter out of the gate. our total peo segment revenues increased 4% for the quarter to $1.1 billion and average worksite employees declined only 3% to 547,000. this revenue growth and worksite employee performance were both ahead of our expectations, driven primarily by better retention and stronger-than-expected bookings in q1. same-store employment at our peo clients performed in line with our expectations for a mid-single-digit decline steady from last quarter. revenues excluding zero margin benefits pass-throughs declined 1% and in addition to being driven by lower wses, it continued to include pressure from lower workers' compensation and sui costs and related pricing. peo margin increased 40 basis points in the quarter. this included about a 60 basis points of favorability from adp indemnity pertaining to changes in the actuarial loss estimates.
let me now turn to our updated guidance for fiscal '21. we are very encouraged by our strong q1 performance. yet we are still somewhat cautious about the balance of the year. you'll see that the implied increase in guidance for the next three quarters builds in some ongoing momentum for the balance of the year, but does not anticipate the same level of outperformance we just experienced in q1. this reflects both our confidence in the fundamental strength of adp, as well as a realistic assessment of the lingering uncertainties ahead for the global economy, including uncertainty around the rate of continued economic improvement, the labor participation rate and the timeline for a vaccine.
for the details of our outlook, i'll start by updating you on some of our key macroeconomic assumptions. for pays per control, we continue to expect a decline of 3% to 4% for the year. and as we mentioned, pays per control performed approximately in line with our expectations in q1. we continue to assume a modest pace of improvement from this point with mid- to high-single-digit decline in q2, improving to a mid-single-digit decline in q3, followed by a mid- to high-single-digit increase in q4 on the easier compare. and as you are aware, the reported bls unemployment rate has trended better than most people's expectations these past few months. but factors like a reduced labor force participation rate are creating an offset, which is why our pays per control has actually been in line so far.
out-of-business losses outperformed our expectations and contributed to a record q1 retention levels. we are raising our retention guidance accordingly. while we have seen effectively no incremental pressure so far this year from increased bankruptcies among our clients, with continued uncertainty as to further stimulus and strain in parts of the economy remaining from partial shutdowns, we believe it is still prudent to assume some effect from higher out-of-business losses in the coming quarters.
on client funds interest, there is no material change to our expectation for average interest rates for the year, though we are revising our balanced growth higher, given the better start of the year with stronger sales and retention. we continue to expect the client funds balances to return to year-over-year growth in q4.
let's now look at our revised fiscal '21 guidance. i'll start with es. we now expect revenue to be flat to down 2% for the full-year versus our previous expectation for a decline of 3% to 5%. i'll break that down into some of its components. we now expect our new business bookings to be up 10% to 20%, compared to our prior forecast of flat to up 10%. that 10% increase in guidance reflects the impact of our q1 outperformance, as well as a slight increase in our bookings expectation over the rest of the year. we are still contemplating a modest year-over-year bookings decline in q2 as instances of partial economic lockdowns in europe plus uncertainty from the us election keep us somewhat cautious. but this q2 outlook is certainly better than what we contemplated three months ago.
we now expect our es retention to be flat to down 50 basis points versus down 50 basis points to 100 basis points previously. as again, we had stronger q1 retention than expected, and believe our strong client satisfaction will translate to continued strong controllable retention, though we continue to assume elevated out-of-business losses in q2 and q3.
and for our client funds interest, which primarily impacts the results of our es segment, we are raising our average balances expectation on the strong q1 sales and retention performance. and accordingly, raising our client funds interest range by $10 million, now to $400 million to $410 million.
we now expect our margin in the employer services segment to be down 100 basis points to 150 basis points for the year versus our prior forecast of down 300 basis points, driven by the stronger q1 performance, a stronger revenue outlook, and continued expense discipline.
for our peo, we now expect revenue to be flat to up 3% versus our previous forecast of down 2% to up 2%. and we expect an average worksite employee count down 1% to up 1% versus our previous forecast of flat to down 3%. we continue to expect average worksite employee growth to be negative during the first three quarters and turn positive in q4.
our revenues, excluding zero margin pass-throughs, are expected to be down 1% to up 1% versus our previous forecast of down 4% to down 1%. we continue to expect lower workers' compensation and sui revenues on a per worksite employee basis.
for peo margin, we now expect to be down 50 basis points to flat in fiscal '21 versus our prior forecast for down 100 basis points. this increase in our guidance is driven by stronger revenues and a more favorable benefit from adp indemnity.
moving to our consolidated outlook. we now anticipate total adp revenue to be down 1% to up 1% in fiscal '21 versus down 4% to down 1% prior. and we anticipate our adjusted ebit margin to be down 100 basis points to 150 basis points versus our prior guide of down 300 basis points.
as i mentioned earlier, we now expect about $150 million in savings from the combination of our digital transformation, as well as our procurement transformation initiatives and we will continue to manage our expense base prudently. as we saw in q1, you should expect that further upside to our revenues, whether from macro-related factors or our own execution, should drive upside to our margins as well.
in august, we refinanced $1 billion of notes maturing in 2020, and as a result, we will benefit from approximately $5 million in interest expense savings this year.
for our effective tax rate, we continue to anticipate 23.1% for the year. we resumed our share repurchases in q1 and we assume a net share count reduction in our guidance.
net of all these changes, we are raising our adjusted diluted eps guidance to a decline of 3% to 7%, which represents a much more modest decline, compared to our prior guidance of down 13% to 18%.
i'd like to wrap up with a few comments on longer-term margins. to be clear, there has been no departure from our focused and consistent approach to continue to drive margins higher over the long-term. looking beyond fiscal '21, a continued economic recovery should support employment growth and above normal pays per control growth. and we would expect such a trend to contribute incremental margin uplift to our results, all else being equal. the impact of lower interest rates will also begin to moderate in the coming years. in addition to these macroeconomic factors, we expect our underlying margin performance to continue to be supplemented by our ongoing efforts to transform our organization and client service operations and to be supported long-term by next-gen platforms that are more efficient and less expensive to maintain.
as you have seen from our q1 results, we are committed to protecting and driving margins even as we maintain our steady approach to investing for the long-term. we remain confident in our long-term growth prospects and our ability to execute, and i look forward to continuing to update you on our progress.
with that, i will turn it over to the operator for q&a.

[operator instructions] we'll take our first question from the line of bryan bergin with cowen. your line is open.
bryan bergin -- cowen inc -- analyst
hi, good morning. thank you. i'll ask two upfront here. the first one bookings. can you talk about composition of bookings in 2q versus 1q and give us a sense if you can dissect the strongest and weakest demand across client size. and then just looking at the sg&a level this quarter, can you comment on the drivers of the sequential dollar growth there? i heard the comments on accelerated investment. is that primarily sales force headcount addition or other areas of spend?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
sure. let me take the, i will take the bookings maybe and i'll let kathleen talk about the sg&a. on the bookings and i think some of this is just lumpiness, if you will, of the results because there is no, there are couple of things that happened, but it's hard to call it a trend, right, as we only have really two quarters, if you will, of kind of post pandemic results. but in essence, our mid-market business performed a lot better, so workforce now in the mid-market business did much better in this quarter than in the last quarter. and then if you remember, last quarter we talked about that we got some help from our international business and in particular we called out multinational deals and that was, i'm not sure we gave any color around that, but that was strong double digits, is the way i would put it, last quarter help, the last quarter's growth and this quarter it was kind of slightly negative. now, in the context of what's happening in europe, which really started to shut down and starting to have challenges before the us in terms of the resurgence of the virus, we're pretty happy with that, like we're pretty proud of our sales teams over there that they were able to accomplish what they did in the second quarter, but sequentially, it was not as strong as the help we got in the, in the first quarter. we also had really strong bookings in the first quarter in our downmarket business. we had some, i would call modest help from what we call client conversions or we call client base acquisitions, which we do on a regular basis, but they don't, they don't come in every single quarter. so, we got a little bit of help from that, and i think i also mentioned last quarter, i think i've been doing this for nine years mentioning that whenever we have a strong finish to a year, we typically get off to a slower start and the opposite is also true. when we have a really bad year, we tend to get off to a stronger start. a lot of our business is counted at the time of sale and start, but some of our business, as you know, like in the upmarket, we, there is some flexibility, if you will, in the sales force. we don't necessarily endorse that, but there is some flexibility for salespeople to book something in, call it july versus in may and because of the way the incentives work and so forth, sometimes we get a little bit of movement from sales into the next fiscal year if we have a bad fiscal year, and the opposite is also true, when we have a strong fiscal year, we tend to have a hard time getting started in july. but i think we've been, so this is nothing new. we've been i think transparent giving you all the kind of the color that we can around bookings. i would tell you that we cut through all that. so, we're trying to look at notable[phonetic] that would do with. for example, earnings where we're trying to see what's the core business doing excluding client funds interest, what's happening with the core business excluding pressure from pays per control. we do the same thing in bookings like what's happening in the core underlying bookings and we see very positive momentum there in terms of lead generation, digital leads coming in, activity by the sales force. so, we're optimistic that the momentum will continue into the 3rd and 4th quarter. of course the caveat being the virus have to cooperate in terms of and the vaccine rollout has to continue to stay on track. but, but i think overall if you cut through all the it's first column onetime items, but if you cut through all the noise, our momentum in the second quarter in terms of bookings was stronger than it was in the first quarter, even though it might not be what the reported number shows, and i'll let kathleen talk about the sg&a.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
sure. so, on the sg&a side, i mean you do have a lot of things within that sg&a, but i would think about it this way. the overall view or picture is that from a selling standpoint, i'll talk about kind of full year and then we can talk about linearity. but from an overall standpoint, we continue to invest in sales as we've mentioned, and that is both headcount investment as well as continuing to look at marketing investment and doing some of that. so, you've got that investment in sales, but you've also got the work we're doing around transformation which would be offsetting that investment as well as just discretionary cost control that we're very focused on doing as well. so, kind of overall you've got investment headcount and marketing, you've got transformation work that we continue to do, and discretionary cost control. that does change if you look at or not change for the skew first half to second half is a little bit different, as we do have significant bookings growth in q4, our expectation and so of course that's going to result in higher q4 selling expense for us.

our next question comes from bryan keane with deutsche bank. your line is open.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi guys, good morning. just want to make sure i understood the employees is bookings for the quarter came in line with expectations, but you guys did decide to raise the full year. so, i just want to make sure i understand the pipeline, the visibility there that's causing that raise. and then on retention to record levels. are you seeing anything in particular on the competition front that is having less of an impact in years past that's driving the higher retention? thanks so much.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
sure. on the pipeline on the pipeline question, we do have some visibility, but some of this is really about extrapolating momentum because in the down market, it's really more about headcount and productivity than it is about pipeline. whereas in the mnc in the upmarket, i mean i'm not telling anything you wouldn't be able to figure out yourself. so there, we have a fair amount of visibility in some part of our business, but in other parts of our business, we based on our experience about productivity metrics and head count and so forth, we have confidence, obviously in the guidance that we're giving in the raise, otherwise we wouldn't be giving it, but it's a couple of things that have changed since last quarter. last quarter, we had what we thought it was much better results than we had expected, and we thought we had positive momentum. and then on top of that, now we have vaccine rollout. so, that was not something that was talked about, but this is now a reality. we also had an election that was still in front of us, that's been resolved. we also thought and people speculated there would be more stimulus and now there is, even though there's even more stimulus being debated just as a reminder. there was a $900 billion stimulus package that was approved. so, i think if you look at, which we try to do, we try to do a little bit of kind of correlation regression whatever you want to call it between gdp and economic growth in our bookings, because we do believe there is some connection there like there is other things like the training of our sales force, the tools they have, the quality of the sales force, the turnover but gdp is a powerful force and the gdp numbers are looking pretty strong here on a go-forward basis, with perhaps the exception by some of our, some analysts out there of the 3rd, of our 3rd quarter, the quarter we're in right now, but if you look at 4th quarter, our 4th quarter with our, the first half of next fiscal year for us, and then the next calendar year after that, i mean even this full calendar year, gdp expectation has been raised, i think, across the board by everyone. so, i think it's partly visibility in pipeline and partly our experience like we know for example, what a reasonable expectation is for productivity per dm per sales rep. we know how many sales reps we have, we know how many new ones we're hiring, we know what we're generating in terms of leads and digital marketing, and i think we put that all together and that comes out to our guidance, and so i think we're confident in it and we're actually very excited and positive that we were able to do that and we're just glad that things are looking much better than they were last quarter and certainly better than they were looking in march and april.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
bryan, the only other, if i could just interject. the only other detail i'd add on all of that data that carlos mentioned that we do look at it on an ongoing basis is that when we look at the leading indicators in terms of the data we have, so appointments, referrals, demos, opportunities created as our sales team are including these into the system, all of those are trending better going into the second half than they were for sure going into the year and so we're feeling really in a very optimistic, as you can tell from the raised bookings guidance. we're feeling optimistic going into the second half of the year. in particular, the digital leads are up significantly. so, again, just wanted to provide that transparency for you.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
and then on the retention side, i would say there are probably two data points that i would look at. the retention obviously is incredibly strong and it's going to be record retention for the year, assuming we had the guidance that we've just provided. we've never been at these retention levels, and i think there's a number of factors. i mean, i think our product set is much stronger and it's not just the products themselves, but it's our, our commitment to moving our clients onto a newer platform. so, we have a lot more clients on newer platforms today than we had a year ago, two years ago, whether a quarter ago or a year ago. it is just a continuing progression that we've talked about now for many, many years, but we've made a lot of progress, and we know that the retention on our new platforms is higher than on some of our older platforms. so, that's, that's helping. there's probably some tailwind from, that's pandemic related, we just can't put our finger on it that clients are maybe not moving as much, but if you look at each business unit, like for example, in our down market, the retention in our downmarket as a result of better product and better execution has been going up for probably six or seven years and is up almost 500 basis points prepandemic, and now it has gone up even more. so, the fact that we've had this positive momentum in the downmarket, it's a similar story in workforce now, if not 500 basis points, but in the mid-market, we've also had three years of improving retention pre-pandemic. so, i think those are signs that there is something happening in terms of our execution and our product, right. so, execution is part of it as well. we have to deliver i think on the commitments we make to our clients to resolve issues for them and answer questions and so forth. so, a combination of better service, excellent service and really better products and migrating clients i think is, is helping. and then secondly, the other data point that i would point to, which is really on the booking side, but the combination of bookings and retention that our balance of trade is improving with several of our major competitors for the first time in a while, and i think it's again related to this effort that we've made to improve product, continue to deliver great service [technical issue] on execution and i think it's showing up now in some of these balance of trade numbers that were showing some improvement. so, the reason i bring that up is because balance of trade would be a combination of what we're bringing in terms of from some of our competitors, but also what we're losing to those same competitors. that's why we call it balance of trade. so, there's a number of metrics that would tell me that our competitive position is getting better and then resulting obviously in higher, higher retention and hopefully also growing bookings here in the future.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
helpful. thanks for taking the questions.

our next question comes from jeff silber of bmo. your line is open.
unidentified participant
thanks so much for taking my question. two-part question. first is on pricing, i believe it was last quarter, maybe the quarter before you talked a little bit about some of your competitors offering some pricing concessions to clients. i'm just wondering if that's been continuing. and as a follow-up, i'm just wondering if you're seeing any diverging trends by geography, especially in certain areas where we're seeing higher public cases? thanks.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
so, on the, let me take the second one first on divergence. yes, we would see what we would expect to see, because we are, i think we're big enough that we can really escape, again the gravitational pull of overall gdp, but also of specific geographic challenges. so, in southern california for example, we did see some challenges in terms of our bookings in the downmarket and into the mid-market there. it's still impressive if we were able to sell as much as we did. as a footnote, we sold a lot of to say that were flat, almost flat, for us is, at least we're impressed with ourselves that our bookings are flat for the first half of the year versus last year, but there clearly are pockets of challenge. southern california would be a challenge. the midwest was and the central part of the country was incredibly challenge for several months. but we've had other places that things were better as a result of maybe more economic activity or continuing opening regardless of the controversy around that and then, again europe would be a place where i would call out where i think we started to encounter some real headwinds. so, because geography for us is not just about the us, it's also global. so, the answer is yes and that you should assume that, that we would be impacted by whatever you're seeing in the news and so when you have hard lock downs in very large metropolitan markets, that would, that would affect us, but fortunately we're very diversified geography, geographically and across segments. so, remember we operate all the way from small to upmarket to international and so we are, obviously we try to find a way to keep all of these things in balance and have something helping us when other things may be working, working against us. so, we did see some of that volatility as you described. on the price, on the price side, so one of the things we did talk about last quarter, we did talk about competitors and what we heard anecdotally about competitor pricing action, but we did, we also said last quarter that we didn't get any help from price last quarter. we did get a little bit of help. it was not significant, but call it around, i think it was around 30 basis points of help, which is about normally what we would be getting in terms of revenue growth help from price. and so i think what that tells you that we're trying to signal to you there is to tell you that it was appropriate for us to pause for call it four to five months, our normal price increases. by the way our normal price increases would have been, july 1 would have been one of, one of the, one of the main time that we do pricing, price increases, and remember our price increases are much more modest than they were 5 to 10 years ago but at our scale, it does, it does matter, but we delayed those price increases. it was not appropriate to do that given the circumstances that we were, that we were under, but you fast forward to september-october, we felt that given the additional services that we were providing. so, we were providing a number of incremental services at no additional cost to our clients that i believe our competitors are not providing, and so we thought that going back to our normal modest price increases was a reasonable thing to do and we did that and you can see the impact on retention, which has been none. and so that would be i think a good sign for us.
unidentified participant
that's great to hear. thanks so much for the call.

our next question comes from pete christiansen of citi. your line is open.
peter christiansen -- citi -- analyst
good morning, thanks for the question. nice trends here. carlos, given the listed view on es bookings in retention, how would you characterize some of the trends you're seeing in the tax rate for additional add on modules, those sorts of things and times how should we think about the runway for the next two to three quarters on and how you see that evolving, particularly with some of your new r&d development, new product, and all that?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
it's a great question because there is still a lot of room for us there like we're very focused on market share and new unit growth, but we don't mind additional share of wallet and additional tax rate because that's helpful to and as you know, our bookings have generally been balanced for many, many years. about half of it coming from new logos and half of it coming from incremental attach. so, we love that business. i happened to be looking at those figures last night and it obviously varies by business unit, but as an example, in the mid-market, we're kind of in the 60% to 70% range in terms of the tax rate for things like workforce management, which we used to call time and labor management and benefits administration and we have things like data cloud and other items that we can attach as well, but i think the best color to put on that is that there is still a lot of room. i mentioned how we are doing well, not just in our new strategic platforms, but we're also doing well on some of our products that we don't always talk about a lot on these calls like retirement services, insurance services where those attach rates are very low in comparison to what i think is the potential for our client base because when you have a tightly integrated solution, it really is a much better experience for our clients. so, it's good for us, but it's also good for our clients, which is always an important, an important thing. so, i guess the color i would put there is we've got really good attach rates on some of the core hcm modules like workforce management, ben admin, so hr, payroll, ben admin, workforce management, those are kind of the core. talent management is a place where we've been seeing growing attach rates, and there's a lot of room still there for people to adopt those solutions. so, we're very optimistic, and this is a key strategy for i think my predecessor, predecessor before that which has been great for us that we have a very broad industry, part of our reason for concentrating on hcm and focusing the company away from some of the other businesses we have like the brokerage business and dealer services and so forth is, this is a growing robust space globally and there is plenty of room to grow. we definitely want to still focus on not to take our eye off of market share and logo growth, but there is an enormous opportunity for us in terms of incremental tax rate.

our next question comes from samad samana with jefferies. your line is open.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my questions. maybe stepping back for a big picture question a little bit in the time machine, but if i think back to the analyst day in 2018 and some of the company's key initiatives around the service alignment and taking cost out of the business and getting to call it mid '20s ebit margin, i guess, aside from the world being very different with what happened with covid, but i'm curious, carlos, if you could just think as far as those initiatives went and getting the margin structure of the business toward that, would you say that we're x, what happened with the rates and what covid, would we be in that shape today, and i guess maybe thinking forward, how should we think about the structural margins of this business post recovery and can it be at those long-term levels that we talked about before? and then i have one follow-up.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
yes, so let me give you a little bit of color on that because again coincidentally, i was doing my homework last night. so, i did go back. that's something that i actually have fresh in my mind so, and then you will correct me if i'm wrong, but i think our margin in 2018, which you would have seen in that analyst day was 20.7 and we're now i think forecasting for fiscal year '21. i'm not sure that we're forecasting it, but i think you can extrapolate based on our guidance. i'll just throw out a number, so call it 22.3, 22.5 somewhere in that, in that range for fiscal year '21. that's with a significant drag from client funds interest as we mentioned and some drag from covid as a result of slower than we would have thought or would have expected revenue growth. so, i would say that on the margin side, we would be well ahead of what we talked about at analyst day excluding these items. on a revenue side, clearly we're not anywhere near that and that is why we had to withdraw that three-year guidance that we had provided because obviously the covid headwinds with what happened with pays per control and just the economy in general, made it very difficult, but again it feels like this would, this is a transitory event as we've talked about now for two to three quarters, painful devastating for many people, for our country, for the economy, and for the world, but it is transitory and not an existential threat, and so we expect to get right back on the track that we were on before, and i happen to think that the fact that we were a couple of hundred basis points higher in margin even with everything that's happened, and we were in '18 i think tells you something about the structural margin opportunity in the business, but clearly a very important part of that picture is growth. we need to grow the business long-term because growth does require investment and so what you should be hearing from us is we care about margin, and we think there is opportunity in terms of structural margins here going forward, but the most important thing we can do to drive long-term shareholder value here is to also grow the topline and we're focused on that.
unidentified speaker
just to clarify samad, our formal margin expectation is 22% to 22.5%.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great, thanks. i appreciate and that's why as it to, it sounds like the business is healthier, adjusting for non-controllable factors and maybe just as a follow-up on that, on the, the bookings in this quarter and just as you think about bookings for maybe the next couple of quarters, when you think about the performance, is there a way to think about it in terms of driven by field reps versus digital inbound through marketing? are there channels so not by customer size, but are there channels that are doing better or worse in terms of bringing more customers into the top of the funnel and driving new bookings?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, then i think i will say
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah, maybe i'll just interject on before carlos responds to that. i want to interject and just follow-up a little bit on the margin story because carlos gave a really good kind of recap and summary over the last couple of years. right. when you think about, we are in the 20% margin, 20.7% to pre-covid 23% with the various big initiatives that we've pursued, you've heard us talk about that over time, but i want to add that one of those really important initiatives that we are now working very hard is digital transformation, which has been helping us. right. as we look at our transformation initiatives, we've talked about digital and procurement really driving a lot of the benefits kind of today, if you will, a lot of that procurement does get harder as you go, but from a digital transformation perspective, that's an initiative that we believe is going to be with us for some period of time because these projects are not fast projects to execute. they do take time to execute, and so we're optimistic that we've got a pipeline of projects and that they will continue to yield benefits for us.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and i think that i'll just pile on to that, your comment, i think earlier after you asked question and you summarize my comments, the business is definitely performing much better than it looks, because we have this client funds interest headwind is not just the headwind on margins, it is a headwind on revenue growth as well. it's almost a full percentage point and as an example, on the margin impact or margin, i think in es would have been up and adp overall emerging would have been up 40 basis points instead of down 30 basis points for the quarter. so, clearly on the margin side, the picture is clouded and that picture will, i mean interest rates go up and down as you know, and everyone is always convinced that rates are going to stay low forever or they're going to stay high forever depending on where they are, but we believe that at a minimum that headwind will abate unless interest rates continue to go down and then turn negative for the next 10 years, which is very unlikely as we all, i think as we all know and at least in the us that's unlikely. on your question about bookings. one thing that's important to note is we do have record leads from through digital marketing coming in. so, we have increased our investment in digital marketing. but we're very careful to do that to make sure that we're getting the proper roi. but that is something that is it's certainly helping our sales force, but they're really the message for our sales force is that we want them to meet our client, the clients and the prospects where they want to be met and they have all the tools, all modern tools that any sales force uses. i mean the reality is, i said this before, people steal our sales force and so we have to understand we have the best sales force in the industry, there is no question about it, and they have all the tools they need to compete effectively and they had obviously moved to being mostly or virtual sales force over the last six months and we made sure they have the tools to be able to do that and that's where clients want it to be met and if in six months, we anticipate that some of our upmarket and multinational clients will be ok having some digital meetings or virtual meetings, but they might want to have people visiting, some of them again. we'll be ready for that as well. assuming that it's safe and the people are vaccinated. so, so there are a number of channels that we can pursue. but you should understand that our kind of our strategy is really to meet the clients where they want to be met. as an example, in the down market. our clients rely on trusted advisors like accountants and brokers. we have very very strong partner relationships with those channels. and that's how we drive results in that channel. so, really varies channel by channel, but you should understand that we are pursuing every channel, every avenue including upping our digital marketing investments to make sure that we're getting our fair share of that without throwing money away.

good morning. carlos, you talked about net gains. i'm wondering if that's related strictly to adp having a better set of products or is that related to the competition doing something else, and just my second question, we've talked, you've talked a lot about the sales process and i'm wondering if you believe after we are through with this pandemic, get the vaccinations done that fundamentally if the sales process will change and that you'll use more digital versus face to face? thank you.

i think that, i am in the same campus. i think many other ceos of companies that are, and again, there is very, there are not a lot of companies like adp that operate all the way from the down market into the upmarket. so, there has to be balance here in terms of, it's not one clear-cut answer, but i'm in the camp for example in the upmarket. some of, my other competitors and ceos, would believe that there will be face-to-face meetings again and particularly sales meetings, but i'm also in the camp of believing with lots of others that we shouldn't assume that things are going to go back to exactly the way they were before, whether it's with the way people are working or the way people are selling. we're going to have to adapt to would, inevitably there is going to be some change. having said that, i believe i saw a statistic the other day that said that prior to the pandemic, about 10% of the us workforce was working from home and it went up to 33% at the worst part of the pandemic and then came back down to 25%, and i kind of monitor this through other sources that show that it picked up slightly again, the number of people working from home as the virus continued to surge. but you would expect that 25% to probably go back to 15%, 20% but not probably back to 10%, but remember that the other 70% never worked from home and today 75% of the people are not working from home and so, but that is a mean that we have to learn new techniques. so for example, an initial meeting or a follow-up meeting or maybe even and implementation meeting with a client, i think we've all learned that it's much more effective to do that for both parties virtually, but it's hard to believe that we're going to go back exactly to where we were before and it's also very hard to believe that we're going to stay exactly the way we are today. and again, i hate to give you a wishy-washy answer, because i think we're going to have to let that play out, but we are like a lot of other things, we are maintaining optionality and equipping our sales force to be prepared for either of those eventualities, and i think you had the first part of that question
kartik mehta -- northcoast research -- analyst
client growth, whether it's product.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
oh clients, so on the client growth side, again we are, i think i mentioned in one of my in my script that all of our strategic platforms, so if you think about run, workforce now, global view, i forgot the other one that i mentioned, that platforms that we are, that are strategic that we're investing in, not just the next-gen ones are all growing and they're growing very robustly, and i don't know that keep you understand that and part of the challenge is that we have a large company, and we have other things that maybe aren't growing as fast or we have a drag from a platform that we're trying to get off of, and we unlike some others, try to report the facts as they are, right. so, but maybe taking a little bit of liberty like others are doing and giving you a little bit more color about just the things that are going well. so, but if we did that, i mean we only focused on the growth of, for example, next-gen, it would be 800% growth or if we focused on the growth of workforce now across the board, not just in the mid-market because we also use workforce now in the upmarket, and we use workforce now in our peo, you would see robust growth even in the middle of a pandemic on the workforce now. so, i think we're making progress, but we are a large organization with large market share and clearly that exposes our clients and we have to be very good at making sure that we protect our clients, which i think we're doing a good job of as evidenced by retention, but when you look at the go forward and the growth of our strategic platforms, there is a lot of reason for optimism that we will, i think, be able to compete effectively on a go-forward, on a go-forward basis. so, i'm not sure i can give you a lot more detail than that, because this is more detail than we normally give because we like to just be straight shooters and the growth is what it is, whether it's on client counts or revenue. but if you want a little bit of additional color underneath the covers, the strategic platforms are doing very well against our competitors.

our next question comes from mark marcon with baird. your line is open.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
good morning and thanks for taking my questions. so, question is basically about next-gen payroll and next-gen hcm. the first part is this, can you talk a little bit more to give us a little bit more color with regards to next-gen payroll just in terms of the number of clients that have been sold. what percentage of the existing workforce now base has been converted and how you're thinking about that going through and the kind of what you're seeing in terms of the satisfaction, once you have that in place? you made some initial comments that sounded really positive. and then the follow-up is this basically on next-gen hcm, just in terms of what the outlook is there in terms of new sales and new bookings? thank you.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
sure. thanks for the question because if you thought i was optimistic before, prepare yourself, because you know the story on next-gen payroll and hcm is quite positive for us in terms of the future. if you look at next-gen payroll, we have i think i would say a couple of hundred, so let's say, over 200 live clients, so not just a little bit live clients, we have over 500 that are sold. i think you, we said in our comments that you may not have picked up on it that we think that it's possible even though this is not scientifically provable that up to 25% of the sales we had so far of next-gen payroll, we would not have obtained without next-gen payroll. so, i think that bodes well for i think our competitiveness in our market share and our plans are to have call it somewhere around a couple of thousands, i think for this fiscal, for this fiscal year. so, it's positive momentum. again, the caveat there is with next-gen hcm, we are generally going up to very large clients and in the case of next-gen payroll, it is really a platform that solves our kind of next-gen payroll needs across the board and we started in, call it, the core of our mid-market, so call it between 50 and 150 employees is really has been our focus. so, but having said that, it's still pretty impressive. and we're pretty, pretty happy and pretty positive. satisfaction levels are very high and i think we've just got great momentum and the sales force is obviously incredibly excited even though remember it's still this is still a back-end engine, right. so, it's still workforce now and in the future it will be lifion that are using pie as an engine, but it does provide some, some additional benefits to the client and a lot of as well as we know that that matters as well, given how some of our competitors, i think, have used fizzle in their, in their sales process and so we're able to use some now with with next-gen payroll, so very excited about that rollout and about the the progress there. on next-gen hcm, you heard about our rollout in mexico, which is really next-gen hcm with pi. so, we have call it a handful of clients now in four countries that are actually running on next-gen hcm with pi, again very early. i would like to talk about only a handful of clients isn't a lot, but what was most encouraging is that in a couple of those situations, we were able to use what we're calling a federated development process, which is one of the intentions was of the investment in the platform, which to be able to build rapidly. so, the mexico client was on-boarded in from soup to nuts in terms of building platform, getting the client and getting them on-boarded in call it six to nine months. so very, very impressive for us to be able to do that. so, we are optimistic that this will continue to hopefully help us, again competitively, and i think you also asked about how many clients we've migrated off of workforce now onto, on to pi, remember that it's really that you are not migrating clients off of workforce now. you are just changing the underlying payroll engine that is still on the workforce now. the answer to that is i think not many, like this is mostly new logo sales in the case of next-gen payroll. again, underneath workforce now. so as we go to market, it is still workforce now with the pi payroll engine beneath it and just to, again footnote, i think i said this last quarter, workforce now is a next-gen platform. we don't talk about it that way because we haven't been talking about it that way, but workforce now with pi is a next-gen platform.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
got it. appreciate it. sounds very optimistic. thank you.

our next question comes from kevin mcveigh with credit suisse. your line is open.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great, thank you. hey, kathleen, you talked about the digital transformation a couple of times. where are you kind of in that process, and i think the last number you referenced is about $150 million benefit. is that still the way to think about it in the 150 range or does that get accelerated based on some of the investments that you put forward as a result of the q2 up performance?
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah, kevin. thanks for that question. that 150 still holds. that was our estimated benefits for the year, the current fiscal year from digital and other transformation efforts. where are we journey, i'd say we're in the early days, early innings here. i mean, as i mentioned, these projects are not fast to implement projects. these are not three to four-month projects that you roll out. these are, how do we procure or build the right tools to take work out of the the system. how do we, while some of it can be a little fast or i continue [technical issues] functionality and how many inquiries [technical issues] and some of those to go faster, but some of them could be longer projects like supporting our implementation teams with tools that we're building. so, my view is we're in the early innings here. we've had some good success thus far. we continue to stay very focused on building pipeline of projects, and it's every single part of the company that we expect and that we go to, say, what are you doing to digitally transform what you do, how do you take work out of the system and its front office and its back office. so, we've got a lot more work to do there, and i think that's a really good thing.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
and just one could tell us maybe if you carlos as it relates to that. how does that impact the addressable market, because i would imagine it probably expands it in terms of average client size plus that, is there any way to frame what the transformation going to mean in terms of the addressable market longer term?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
it's a good, it's a good question and something we think about a lot right is i think one of the things we want to try to get is, we talked about share wallet, new logos, but if we can expand our addressable market, that is very helpful. and it's really a very business-by-business, but as an example, we are, i think in the early stages, i would say, still not ready. i think i'm not understanding[phonetic] about it, but we think that in the down market, there is part of the addressable market that we could do better with if we had a more kind of end to end digital product, if you will, in terms of. so, this would be a compliment to run that would compete in a segment of the market that we don't compete in today. likewise, if you go all the way to the upmarket and international, with the acquisition of celergo was intended to kind of bolster, i think, a market that, yeah, that is growing and i think it's expanded by our acquisition of celergo and in the next-gen platforms, if you will, are for sure intended to expand the addressable market. so, for example, the next-gen payroll engine, again with workforce now, would probably be have more appeal to an in-house user, even though i don't think there's a lot of those left. there are still people who use kind of in-house software, if you will. and i think that this next-gen payroll platform combined with workforce now provides more control which is something that for the last 20 years when we survey the market if you will to assess what's addressable, there was always this kind of outsourcing versus in-house, and i think what's happened is that cloud technology has blurred that line, but there is still a line there, and the ability to have the payroll platform perform some of the things that people want from a control standpoint when they are in-house, i think expands that addressable market. and then lastly, in terms of next-gen hcm, i mean clearly the big play there and the big investment was to expand the addressable market in the upmarket for us, both the larger more complex clients, but the clients who also had hr needs that we were not necessarily able to satisfy some of our older platforms. so, definitely, i think a lot of opportunity and it's a focus, a key focus of our strategy in terms of how we develop our products is to expand.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah, kevin, you could think about as our digital work our digital transformation is meant to improve and accelerate on both top line and from an efficiency productivity standpoint, from a topline perspective, whether it's the addressable market and accessing that through next-gen or other future improvements that we're making, sales cycle times, shortening that cycle time to get something through the sales process. we're working on that in our peo business, improving via digital work, improving service. so, with improved service therefore improved mpf therefore improved retention. so, it is meant to target both acceleration from a top line perspective, and as we've talked about taking work out of the system and productivity.

we have time for one more question, and our last question comes from tien-tsin huang of jpmorgan. your line is open.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks so much. good results and i appreciate the the very clear guidance as well. just a question and a follow-up or clarification. just on the kpis here carlos that you're most focused on the second half, just hearing everything you talked about, positive revisions to retention, bookings. i'm curious if there are any under-appreciated kpis at this point, the cycle that we should be tracking to gauge the sustainability of the improvement that you're talking about, as we get through the second half of the year? and just a clarification, i think you touched upon it in the, in the last comment here just a 25% of sales of next-gen payroll that would not have been obtained without, without it. are you, are those clients on a cloud platform that are looking for cloud? so, like the controls and whatnot that you're talking about that, that was the condition for, for considering i'm trying to understand how, why they didn't consider it before if that makes sense?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, look i think unfortunately i don't have that level of detail i'm afraid to say. we could probably maybe follow up to give you a little more color. that's why i tried to use the words not scientific. so our sales force, we are, we think very, very focused on the rollout of our next-gen platforms, and so as we, we try to keep close communication, close tab with our sales force on how it's going and they came to us and said, we think we got 25% more logos as a result of next-gen payroll than we would have gotten in the past. i'm guessing, there are going to be a number of different reasons for that including there may be a little bit of a sizzle factor there. right. in terms of because as you know, we run fully compliant payrolls. we help our clients with ppp loans. i mean, we were able to do everything like our existing platforms are the most robust, most comprehensive, most effective, i believe, of course i am biased, in the in the industry, but there are incremental improvements right that give people whether it's the control aspect that i mentioned or the sizzle that help sales, and it's no different than you go buy a car, and there are five different models of the same car and people buy the five different cars and, but you have to have new cars every now and then. and i think it's five years or whatever that cycle is and i think that's maybe some of what's happening here, but we'll get, we'll try to get you a little bit of additional color if we, if we can, but that wasn't intended to spark a kind of a new level of disclosure, if you will, about what percentage of our 25% came as a result of which feature, but we'll try to provide some color, either in the interim or certainly on the next call. when we're going to have many more clients on next-gen payroll we'll have a little bit more data for you. on the question you had about kpis, i would say you hit on all of them like there's a lot of important one that you just that you touched on that we watch that we share with you. the other ones that i think are important are ones around productivity both for sales, but also for our service and implementation associates and in particular on sales, that is part of why i was talking about the kind of the underlying trends improving and us being so optimistic about the future is, we are, there is no reason why our sales force cannot get to the same productivity they were pre-pandemic and then continue to increase that productivity as they had been doing for many, many years. and so that's one of those kpis we watch very carefully is what's happening to that sales force productivity number quarter-on-quarter and what's it expected to do in the 3rd quarter and in the 4th quarter and luckily it's on track, and it's something that we watch very carefully. likewise, the productivity per service rep and productivity of implementation, so as an example how many new clients can and implementation reps on board and these were all impacted by the digital transformation that kathleen was talking about, because our goal is to make it easier and better for our clients and as a byproduct hopefully reduce our operating expenses, not reduce our operating expenses and then figure out what happens after that, because the most important driver of long-term value here is client retention, and i can tell you that if we maintain these client retentions, you guys should go through the math on how much faster our revenue will grow on a normal steady-state basis with the same bookings. it's pretty powerful. right. and obviously that's incremental revenue growth that doesn't have incremental sales expense or implementation expense. so, the most important thing for us to do is to make good on our commitment to our, to our client. but having said that, those productivity metrics are important too in determining kind of our ability to drive margin into the future, because those are the two big buckets of expense, our service and implementation costs. and again, that's another item where the kpi that would really be around not just nps and retention but around productivity and the good news there is that we've been showing really good productivity improvements while we've also been driving very good retention, which speaks to the success of our digital transformation efforts.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
very clear. thanks so much.

this concludes our question and answer portion for today. i am pleased to hand the program over to carlos rodriguez for closing remarks.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think i mentioned already that it's hard to imagine where we were just a quarter ago, because i think on the same, same call a quarter ago, there was no vaccine, there was no stimulus approved, and there was no new administration in washington, we were still waiting for or looking forward to an election. so besides all of the great things that our associates are doing in terms of execution, our sales force and all of our associates in terms of helping our clients through this and helping each other, i just thank god for where we are today versus where we were last quarter because we know now we, i think we knew some of us knew that we would be ok eventually, but now we know for sure that we're going to be ok in terms of our friends, our families, but also our economy. and i think our companies and the things that we, we also value on the professional on the professional side. so, very excited about the prospects of getting through the next month or two, which i know are going to be challenging for all of us, but also looking forward to much better times ahead, to plenty of pent-up demand, to growth and productivity, to strong gdp and all the great things that are going to happen once we finally defeat the virus and move on. so, i would just close by saying thank you to the scientists, the pharmaceutical companies, and everyone else who got us to where we are today and that continue to move us forward as a country and as a globe, and i appreciate you all joining the call and listening to us today. thank you.

okay. good morning, my name is michelle, and i'll be your conference operator. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to adp's second quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. [operator instructions] i will now turn the conference over to mr. danyal hussain, vice president, investor relations. please go ahead.
danyal hussain -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, michelle. good morning everyone and thank you for joining adp's second quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call and webcast. participating today are carlos rodriguez, our president and chief executive officer and kathleen winters, our chief financial officer. earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. our earnings materials are available on the sec's website and our investor relations website at investors.adp.com where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call as well as our quarterly history of revenue and pre-tax earnings by reportable segment. during our call today, we will reference non-gaap financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. a description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measures can be found in our earnings release. today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. we encourage you to review our filings with the sec for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. as always, please do not hesitate to reach out, should you have any questions and with that, let me turn the call over to carlos.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, danny and thank you everyone for joining our call. this morning, we reported results reflecting our continued strong business performance and momentum with our second quarter revenue and margins both are performing our expectations as our business continue to demonstrate resilience in the face of ongoing economic headwinds. we reported revenue of $3.7 billion, up 1% on a reported basis and flat on an organic constant currency basis, with adjusted ebit margin down 30 basis points. coupled with a slight increase in the effective tax rate versus last year, a share count reduction, our adjusted diluted eps was flat versus last year, much better than the decrease we were expecting. during the second quarter, we continue to see signs of improvement in the overall operating environment with positive implications for pays per control, new business bookings, and retention. our pays per control metric performed slightly better than expected as it improved sequentially to a decline of 6% versus the larger declines we experienced in q1 in the latter part of fiscal 2020. underlying employment trends in q2 were consistent with what we experienced in q1 with larger enterprises somewhat slower to show improvement, but with small and mid-size businesses demonstrating a healthy level of hiring. we performed well on employer services new business bookings. even though bookings declined 7% this quarter, this was well ahead of our initial expectations earlier this year and in line with the revised expectations we communicated last quarter, and it's important to point out that our new business bookings for the first half nearly matched last year's half despite the very difficult environment. as we had anticipated more modest sales contributions from items we noted last quarter, such as new business formations and multinational deals coupled with a resurgence in virus case levels contributed to lower growth rate compared to q1, but underlying trends have remained strong including improving demand in our mid-market and hro solutions as well as continued acceleration in leading indicators and a solid sales pipeline more broadly. moreover, with the change in us administration and the continuing dynamic regulatory environment, we expect momentum for our solutions to improve as companies continue to recognize the value of partnering with adp given our deep compliance expertise and reliability, and as a final point, with what we believe to be the most challenging six months of the fiscal year behind us, we are now even more confident in our expectation for bookings performance to improve further. as a result of all these factors, we are raising our new business bookings guidance range by another 5% to 15% to 25%. pays per control and booking trends were both positive, but retention was the main highlight for us the second quarter. with es and peo retention both reaching record levels. we saw strong performance across the board with the biggest improvement for the es segment coming out of the us down market and mid-market businesses, as our client satisfaction scores remained at record levels across the board. following this incredibly strong performance in an early read of q3, we are very pleased to be able to raise our retention guidance significantly, a sign of our improving competitive position and the retention we are now expecting would represent a record high es retention for a full year.
now, onto another critical topic and one that remains a key focus for us. our product teams continue to execute well, and we reached a number of milestones this quarter. i'll start with run and workforce now, our two highest revenue platforms. for run, we continue to make a range of enhancements to make client on boarding seamless and in some cases digitally automated, improving the implementation process for tens of thousands of run clients we bring on every year. we also made further enhancements this quarter to our accountant connect platform, already a big differentiator for us, and we now provide even more insights to our critical accountant partners. for workforce now, we continue to build momentum by leveraging our next-gen payroll engine and as we discussed earlier this year, we are live with hundreds of clients who have been very pleased with the solution and continue to raise their experience very highly. in addition, we launched a new workforce management solution that along with our next-gen payroll engine enables real time punch the net payroll calculations all delivered from the public cloud. and based on feedback from our clients and sales associates, we believe a significant portion of the hundreds of sold next-gen payroll clients were incremental to what we would have sold without next-gen, which of course has positive implications for market share and competitiveness in the mid-market as long as we continue to execute. also, we continue to scale up our next-gen hcm, and this quarter we went live with our first client in mexico. importantly, we did this with enhanced speed to market as we partnered with a third party to localize and implement, which speaks to the power of our federated architecture and the native global capability of our next-gen hcm and next-gen payroll platforms. for our data cloud, data cloud platform, we had a number of exciting new launches. to support our clients around esg objectives, we launched a pay equity story board that allows clients to identify equal pay gaps and calculate effective distribution model to close these differentials across their organization. we also continue to leverage the power of data cloud outside our core hcm base and earlier this month, launched a partnership with new york stock exchange owner ice which will pair ice data services market expertise with adp's hr and compensation data. we are very excited about continuing to explore opportunities related to our differentiated and robust data set, which is the most expansive in the industry to drive both -- to drive insight both within and beyond traditional hcm use cases. this quarter, we also continued to receive industry accolades and won a number of awards for our solutions including g2 and capterra awards for the number one user rated workforce management solution. we continue to reach all-time high client counts on all of our key platforms, including the run, workforce now, vantage global view, and of course next-gen hcm, and within our hcm platform, we continue to reach new client count milestones for individual solutions such as retirement services. moving on, i'd like to once again acknowledge our associates for their ability to stay focused on finding innovative solutions and driving higher nps in what has been an incredibly challenging and dynamic environment. it's because of this execution that we were able to demonstrate such resilience -- such resilient performance year-to-date with revenue flat, adjusted earnings per share up, and retention at record levels. now, with the worst of the pandemic related headwinds hopefully behind us, and vaccine programs positioning us for continued recovery, we are increasingly focused on reaccelerating growth in the quarters and years ahead. to that end, we have already reinvested some of our q2 outperformance into product development acceleration, a digital transformation push, and selective sales and marketing expansion ahead of our key selling quarters. while it's too early to talk about fiscal 2022 in any detail, we expect our 4th quarter revenue growth to accelerate significantly and our goal will be to sustain that momentum. we are very pleased with our performance year-to-date and the fundamental strength of our business, and we are very optimistic about the quarters ahead. and with that, i'll turn it over to kathleen.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
thank you, carlos and good morning everyone. q2 was another strong quarter across every major business metrics. while we will still face some pandemic related headwinds for the balance of the year, we are more confident in our outlook given we believe the toughest part is behind us. our performance thus far into the year reaffirms the resilience of our business model, the strength of our product, and the ability of our sales and service teams to perform even in the toughest of environments. we remain confident in our ability to execute, as we move forward. in the second quarter, our revenues grew 1% on a reported basis, flat on an organic constant currency basis, which is significantly better than our expectations coming into the year and better than even the revised expectations we had as of last quarter. once again, es retention rates represented favorability and did very -- as did very strong performance from our peo. we managed expenses prudently while making important incremental growth and productivity investments and delivered margins that were better than our expectations. our adjusted ebit was down just 1% despite pressure from a decline in client funds interest. our adjusted effective tax rate increased 20 basis points compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020. our share count was lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases. and as a result, our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.52 was flat versus last year's second quarter.
moving on to the segments. for es, our revenues declined 1% on a reported basis and 2% on an organic constant currency basis, representing continued sequential improvement driven by record level retention and the more modest 6% decline in pays per control versus 9% last quarter. client funds interest declined 23%, as average yield declined 50 basis points versus last year. our balance growth, however, improved significantly to be flat this quarter, supported by better retention, better pays per control, and the lapping of our netherlands money movement operation closure in october of 2019. employer services margin was flat for the quarter significantly ahead of our expectations, supported by stronger revenue and prudent cost control. our peo also had another very strong quarter. total peo revenues increased 5% to $1.2 billion with average worksite employees improving sequentially to 570,000, down 2% year-over-year. the strong results were also driven by better retention, which was at record levels, as well as slight sequential improvement in pays per control, though it remains down mid-single digits versus last year. revenues excluding zero margin benefits pass-throughs improved to up 2%, well ahead of our expectations. this outperformance was driven partly by better wse performance, but also due to favorability in wages paid for wsa during the quarter. peo margin increased 100 basis points in the quarter driven by better revenue as well as continued expense discipline. given our over performance in the first half of the year, we have taken the opportunity to ramp up certain investments to supplement growth and productivity coming out of the pandemic. relative to our expectations heading into the year, we are investing to accelerate certain r&d initiatives. we are also increasing investment in digital transformation as we continue to apply technology to enhance self-service and take work out of the system. additionally, we are investing further in sales headcount and in certain marketing programs ahead of our key selling season in the back half of the year.
let me turn now to our updated guidance for fiscal 2021. as we've said, with two quarters now behind us, we feel more optimistic about the full year. although we still anticipate certain pandemic related headwinds to persist for the rest of the year, we do expect some of these headwinds to moderate. for pays per control, we continue to expect a decline of 3% to 4% for the year. for the first half of the year, pays per control performed slightly better than our expectations, but with the improvement seeming to moderate into the calendar year end, we are making no change to our full year outlook at this point. out of business losses have been better than expected throughout the first half. and at this point, we see minimal risk for a significant deterioration during the year given what we've seen early in q3 and with stimulus potentially providing additional support to small businesses. on client funds interest, while the us treasury yield curve has recently steepened, there is no material change to our expectation for our realized average yield for the current fiscal year. however, we are again revising our balance growth higher primarily on stronger client growth.
let's now look at our revised fiscal 2021 guidance. for es, we now expect revenues to be flat to up 2% for the full year versus our previous expectation for flat to down 2%. that's driven by a few factors. having had strong bookings performance six months into the year and seeing continued improvement in leading indicators, we now expect our new business bookings to be up 15% to 25% compared to our prior forecast of up 10% to 20%. this additional 5% raise reflects the incremental investments we've made in sales and marketing as well as an overall increased confidence for the next two quarters, particularly as our clients and prospects continue to deal with changes in legislation governing the workplace, making the payroll and hcm solutions we offer and the compliance expertise we provide even more compelling. we now expect our es retention to be up about 100 basis points versus flat to down 50 basis points. this improvement is driven by both the strong q2 performance as well as reduced concern about q3 losses as early signs indicate continued strong performance. this full year outlook would represent a new record es retention level, and we are very focused on achieving that goal. and for our client funds interest which primarily impacts the results of our es segment, we are again raising our outlook on a higher average balances expectations following the strong q2 retention performance as well as continued recovery in wages paid. there is no change to our expectation of an average yield of 1.6%. we now expect our margin in the employer services segment to declined 50 to 100 basis points for the year, representing a 50 basis point improvement versus our prior forecast. for our peo, we now expect revenue up 3% to 5% versus our prior forecast of flat to up 3%, and we expect average worksite employees flat to up 2% versus our prior forecast of down 1% to up 1%. we continue to expect our average worksite employee metric to be negative in q3 and then turn positive in q4. our revenues excluding zero margin pass-throughs are now expected to be up 3% to 5% compared to our prior forecast of down 1% to up 1%. this significant increase is due to factors consistent with what we described for the second quarter. higher wse count but also higher wages and therefore more revenue on a per wse basis. for peo margin, we now expect to be up 50 to 100 basis points in fiscal 2021 versus our prior forecast for down 50 basis points to flat. this raise is driven primarily by stronger revenue performance. for our consolidated outlook, we now anticipate total adp revenue to be up 1% to 3% in fiscal 2021 versus down 1% to up 1% prior, and we anticipate our adjusted ebit margin to be down 50 to 100 basis points versus our prior guidance of down 100 to 150 basis points. we now expect our effective tax rate to be slightly lower at 23% for the year, and we continue to assume a net share count reduction in our guidance. net of all these changes, we are raising our adjusted diluted eps guidance to be down 2% to up 2% versus our prior guidance of down 3% to 7%. we are very pleased to have been able to raise our guidance again given the combination of better than expected macro conditions and our strong execution six months into the fiscal year. we remain confident in our strategy, growth prospects, and ability to execute. coming into the fiscal year, we had braced for a number of economic headwinds, but stayed focused on our strategy and growth, and we maintained our investment in our product, our sales force, and our associates in order to support our key goals of delivering excellent client solutions and growing market share. as we have done since the pandemic started, we plan to continue to support investment in product and sales. we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress and with that, i will turn it over to the operator for q&a.

thank you [operator instructions] and we will take our first question from ramsey el-assal from barclays. your line is open.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
hi, thanks so much for taking my question this morning. i wanted to ask about the increase in in-person engagement with the sales force. can you contrast for us the productivity you're seeing from those in-person meetings relative to the remote meetings? is that something that we should consider to be an incremental driver of productivity, maybe beyond what we are expecting, as we go forward?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, i think that's right. i think you would look at it really as incremental, because if you recall like our first quarter, we had pretty robust sales results really, with almost a 100% of our sales force working virtually at that point. so we expect that the increased activity. if you listen to the tone of our comments that, it's really incremental, and hopefully gets us quickly back to the same productivity levels we were pre-pandemic, which we are approaching in the third and fourth quarter here, and then hopefully beyond that.
because, obviously, part of our model before was that, we expected some incremental improvement in productivity each year, in addition to increases in headcount, and we combined those factors in addition to new products and other things that's what drove our new business bookings growth. the combination of increases in headcount and increases in productivity.
so, you're right, that's -- the path is, this will help us get quickly back to our previous productivity, and hopefully allow us to get above that, which is, i think, important for us in terms of our long-term growth expectations.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
okay. and i wonder if you could comment too on the the environment around potential tax reforms. as i recall, when the corporate tax rate fell that was translated into lower client interest balances for you or client funds balances for you. i know it's early days, and everything needs to move through congress. but, can you comment on the degree to which some of these changes may or may not be factored in your budgeting process or what you're expecting here in terms of tax changes going forward, and the impact on your business?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
i think for corporate -- i think if you're referring to really the -- what's currently on the table, there's a lot of discussion about a lot of different things, including an increase in the tax rate for the higher income individuals. but right now, from what i -- and there's obviously discussion about capital gains taxes as well. but right now the thing that is probably most prevalent in discussions is corporate income tax rate. and i'm trying to think through. i don't believe that, that has really any direct impact on our balances. it obviously has an impact on adp corporate itself. but i don't know, dan, if you have.
danyal hussain -- vice president, investor relations
yes, ramsey. you're definitely right about the individual tax brackets having an impact on our float balance. so, back when we had the previous corporate tax reform in the individual bracket changes, it was a headwind, i think about a percentage point were in that ballpark. so, in theory, what will drive a tailwind to our growth will depend on the actual change in rates here, and what that means for overall individual income taxes. so, it would be a contribution if not factored in -- to our outlook at this time. but, obviously, it's something we would benefit from.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
terrific. thanks for taking my questions this morning.
danyal hussain -- vice president, investor relations
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from dan dolev from mizuho. your line is open.
dan dolev -- mizuho securities -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my question. i got just a quick housekeeping, and then longer term strategic question. you're guiding, i think, to 4q eps slightly below the street. is there any margin pressure to pull up in the fourth quarter?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
well, i think, if you -- from our prepared comments, you'd probably see that the pressures are what i would call, self-inflicted in the sense that we believe there is an opportunity for us to make some investments that improve our long term growth prospects, both for 2022 and beyond. and i think kathleen particularly mentioned the two or three things that we're investing in.
so, the answer is, no, there is no mysterious margin pressure. in other words, the business continues to move in the right trajectory. like, almost every metric we have has improved. in fact, i'd say every metric we have has improved sequentially, even the pays per control. even though it was modest, it's still rounded to 6% down. we know now, after watching the data at the beginning of q4 that, that's heading in the right direction. and we can all tell from what's happening with unemployment that, that's going to also continue to improve fairly quickly here.
so when you really add it altogether, we're in a very strong position, have very strong momentum. and people who have known us for a long time, know that, when we experience that, we try to reinvest some of that. and i think that's exactly what you're seeing in the fourth quarter. so i would say that those are conscious decisions that we are making.
dan dolev -- mizuho securities -- analyst
got it. thank you. and...
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yes, that's exactly right. and i'll just add in. in addition to what i think is smartly doing those investments in the fourth quarter, and accelerating some of that. we've also got some year-over-year comp things going on, right, as you would expect with selling having been down q4 last year versus q4 this year. we'd see incremental year-over-year selling expense in q4 as well.
dan dolev -- mizuho securities -- analyst
got it. again, just my follow-up is, i was very impressed to see bookings back to fiscal 2019 levels, really strong. can you maybe talk a little bit about how next gen payroll engine is helping bookings?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
it's a relatively modest contribution because, despite our level of excitement about, really, all of our next gen platforms -- and even role, which you could argue that, that's a next gen solution as well. again, it's just because of the size and scale of our company. like, right now from a dollar impact standpoint it's really not -- that's not what's moving the needle. really across the board, really in every business unit, in every channel and every category, our bookings have and has been improving again sequentially every quarter, and they continue to do that this quarter.
so, we believe that medium to long term, that's the key to us sustaining our multi-decade growth rates is these next gen platforms. but i just continue to caution everyone too -- because we want to give you the updates, and we want to continue to focus on next gen. and i like, i appreciate the question because it's important to separate what's driving the quarters, and what's driving the next fiscal year versus what's driving the next three to five years. and i would say that next gen payroll is going to be increasingly important in the next year or two from a bookings standpoint, and we'll start to probably make a difference, and we'll then give you that color in terms of what difference its making.
but, we should be cautious about revenue impact, just because of the recurring revenue model. just takes a while for that to get into the revenue growth numbers. but it was positive, but really not -- now would really move the needle.
danyal hussain -- vice president, investor relations
and i would just add, dan. we shared that we filled hundreds of clients on our next gen payroll engine with workforcenow. just for context, that compares to typically few thousand clients that we sell in the mid-market. so, it's still a piece of the overall puzzle. but as that scales to become the majority and then ultimately, all of our mid-market sales, then you will truly feel the incremental benefit.
dan dolev -- mizuho securities -- analyst
got it. so.
danyal hussain -- vice president, investor relations
it's actually yet to come, is really the message there.
dan dolev -- mizuho securities -- analyst
thank you. great stuff. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from eugene simuni from moffettnathanson. your line is open.
eugene simuni -- moffettnathanson llc -- analyst
good morning. thank you for taking my question. so, i wanted to ask about down market. and great to see the introduction of roll to target the micro customers. i was hoping you can speak a little bit more broadly about evolution of competitive landscape through the pandemic down market, how run has done? and coming out of the pandemic, what opportunities exist for adp to continue gaining share in this segment, as i believe it has done prior to the pandemic?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
well, i mean, i think there is a number of moving parts. and i think it probably depends on people's business model. so, as you know, our business model is really more about providing not just the software but provide the support, right. you call support, you call service, you can call it compliance. and i think what we saw this year with all of the activity that the government had around the various stimulus programs to help companies and individuals, and so, that created a lot of complexity for employers. it appears that we're entering into an environment where, despite the pandemic hopefully fading, there will be increased levels of government activity around employment and incentivism and that kind of thing. i think that's a good environment for adp and for our down market business because most small businesses, don't have the time or the inclination to really focus on these things and to take care of these things. so it works for some clients and we believe that that's why we're rolling out roll, no pun intended, but once you get to even a little bit, slightly larger you do end up running into issues that you need help with, and you need support and you need advice and much of that can be automated, but you still need it.
so for example, a lot of our ppp support reports were automated. so it doesn't mean that somebody have to get on the phone and have a discussion about your ppp report, but you have to be focused on providing the support and the compliance in addition to just the software. so i think that helped us this year. and again, so to answer your question, how do we believe we're set up competitively right now. i think we're set up excellently, competitively, because we now have very simple solutions for the micro market where people want to self buy, self install and don't have complexity, maybe don't have issues with taxes or compliance or don't want to ask questions, because it's not priced or built to ask questions, but we also have the ability to provide this assistance that is important for even small clients.
for sure, it's important for mid-sized clients and for the larger clients, but i think what really got highlighted this year is that small clients need a lot of help and need a lot of assistance. and you can see in our growth rates, in our retention in our client satisfaction like in all of our metrics in our small business division that we happen to be in the right place at the right time i think to be able to help our clients, and then, hopefully now benefit from the tailwind of the demand that that's going to create on a go-forward basis.
so anyway long-winded way of saying, i think we're in a great position, because of our business model.
eugene simuni -- moffettnathanson llc -- analyst
got it. excellent. and then a quick follow-up from me on the global business. so just thinking about what we're seeing now i think is some kind of bifurcation of the recoveries in u.s. and abroad. strong expectation for u.s. recovery in your business. in global is it growing, is it going slower? and is the implication that global might be kind of a headwind to growth over the next couple of quarters?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
as usual, for us, things are a little more -- when you peel the onion back there is a little bit more complexity because you're just -- the image you have is correct, but it hasn't really translated into the results. our results have actually been quite good internationally, both in terms of bookings as well as just the performance of the business overall in terms of revenue, pays per control etc.
some of that is that a large portion of our business is in europe, and there were a lot of government programs there as well to help companies and to prevent high levels of unemployment. and so for example, our pays per control metric never got to the negative levels that we saw in the u.s. in europe, so that was a benefit. at the same time, our bookings have been quite strong. and i have to admit that i've been looking for kind of the explanation for that other than really good execution on the part of our sales force as they moved into a virtual environment because they had to sell virtually there as well.
but i would say it's strong differentiation of our products. again, the service aspect to our solutions, the ability to provide support and to provide compliance and help all of those things probably helped our bookings performance internationally as well. so i would say that our global business actually is probably one of the bright spots. i would say, despite what is obviously a very difficult environment, and we obviously -- our feel for our businesses in not just europe which just now happens to be improving again, particularly in the u.k., but we're having challenges now in toronto, we're having in canada and in brazil.
we're having challenges, obviously, as you know in india as well, but it has not translated into negative results. so i think it's a testament to the resiliency and the strength of the business model. but i don't want to take anything away from the fact that it also obviously shows great execution by our international leaders as well.
eugene simuni -- moffettnathanson llc -- analyst
got it. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from bryan bergin from cowen. your line is open. please check that your line is not on mute.
bryan bergin -- cowen & co. -- analyst
hi. sorry about that. question for you on es versus peo performance. it seems like pays per control appear to be a key difference. can you just dig in more on the mix aspects that seem to drive a pretty notable disparity of performance between those two? and should we expect that difference to persist in 4q or do you expect more even performance?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
i don't believe, we've provided like that data, so i'm surprised you came with that conclusion. but we -- maybe it's part of our tone. so there isn't a huge difference between es, pays per control performance and peo. they both have been improving every quarter sequentially. and remember the peo doesn't -- we generally stay away from very, very small clients, so we don't have a lot of clients that are one to two employees or five employees.
the average size client in the peo i think is somewhere around 40. and so by definition, it tends to skew a little bit bigger than maybe our average client size for sure for small business. so actually, i was looking at these figures last night, and it makes perfect sense kind of where we are, which is that the peo is performing a little bit better in terms of absolute level of pays per control and has been improving sequentially just as es has as well.
so, and again i am probably not allowed to say this, because i might get in trouble, but last night i got a note from the peo that we experienced a first positive pays per control week. now, the problem with pays per control is that it does vary based on payroll cycle. so if you have weekly payrolls or biweekly payrolls so you and i can't read anything into that, but it's the first time we've had a positive pays per control in any week over the last 12 months. so that's a very positive sign.
bryan bergin -- cowen & co. -- analyst
okay. and then just on margins. you showed outperformance here again in the quarter. but at the same time you've followed that incremental headcount investments, higher incentive comp, and i think elevated implementation costs. can you just talk about the drivers there? and then how do we connect the elevated implementation cost with more efficient digital onboarding commentary?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
well, the efficient digital onboarding. i think we were pretty clear was in fps. we'd love to at some point in the future, extend that into the mid-market and maybe someday into the upmarket. but as you know, like you know better than us, because you talk to a lot of other competitors, there's not a lot of digital onboarding going on for example of large complex erp installations, not to pick on any competitors, but it's pretty. i know the image is that the stuff all kind of gets installed itself, but most of -- many of our competitors use third parties.
so there is still quite a lot of implementation activity and expense, whether it's done by the seller of the solutions or if it's done by a third-party we happen to have a model where we do a lot of our -- it ourselves. and so as bookings pick up and demand picks up, we need to add to our capacity for implementation. in particular, in the mid-market the upmarket and also global, which as i mentioned has been strong.
so that doesn't mean that we're not adding in the down market also. but in our small business segment as we alluded to, and as i think you pointed out, the digital onboarding capabilities obviously reduce the need to grow headcount as much as we otherwise would have, but even in small business we have a lot of growth in bookings. and so it's a matter of the trade-off of how much can we onboard digitally versus how much we still need some help with, in terms of people being involved in.
in terms of some of the other items that we alluded to. i mean, some of this is just kind of natural to the business model. as we bring on more clients, we obviously expect productivity improvements every year, whether it's in sales or implementation or everywhere, but we are seeing a recovery of our business and very strong gdp forecast.
and so we're anticipating improved prospects for bookings and for revenue and for growth, and we need to make sure that we have the right staffing levels based on the productivity metrics that -- and the productivity goals that we have to be able to handle that business, so we can maintain our high clients of level -- or high level of client satisfaction that we've experienced. and then we have some natural growth and expenses like i think kathleen alluded to sales expense is clearly something that grows as you have sales success and as grows -- as sales grow year-over-year.
so i wouldn't read too much into it other than that, we made some conscious decisions to reinvest in some specific things in the fourth quarter to really position us well for '22 and beyond. but most of this is just kind of natural stuff where, again, as our revenue growth picks up over time. we still have a great incremental margin business where we would expect to have good operating leverage, as we grow those revenues.
bryan bergin -- cowen & co. -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from mark marcon from baird. your line is open.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird -- analyst
good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. wondering if you can talk a little bit about the investments in q4, just in terms of next gen wisely marketing and advertising. just how much incremental spend will there be? and and are you seeing signs with regards to wisely that the interest is picking up, and therefore that's a great place to invest?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
i don't -- doesn't feel like it's appropriate to give you -- i think you asked for the numbers. i don't know that how...
mark marcon -- robert w. baird -- analyst
no, just to follow...
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
you can probably do the math yourself. like in terms of -- when you look at the trajectory that we're on, you could probably back in into some rough -- this is not in the hundreds of millions of dollars, again, but, again i respect the short-term orientation that we have here and then you guys are trying to -- but i would not read as much as you may be reading into these fourth quarter investment because we've done this in all the way back to my.
gary taught me everything you i know. and you knew gary, i think as well, mark. and we are a long-term oriented company. and we-- when we see opportunities to improve and to invest in things that are either going to drive our bookings or drive our client satisfaction or drive our efficiency, that's what we are going to do. and we've been doing that all along. so this is -- it's not like we hadn't invested, we've been telling you that we've been investing for the last three quarters. and that was a conscious decision.
we took a little bit of a beating for that, at the beginning of the year. fortunately, we had positive surprises on the revenue side and on pays per control and other things, but we committed that we were going to invest through the downturn and that's what we've done. and now, we feel like there are few things that we can do that i would call, i don't want call them housekeeping items but they're not -- these are not in the hundreds of millions of dollars, but they put some pressure on our fourth quarter margin.
and we knew that it would create some questions. even though, it really has nothing to do with '22 or kind of our future expectations of either revenue growth or operating leverage. but i get, i understand the question, but i don't think that-- maybe dany you can give you a little bit more color, but i am not sure that giving you an exact number is probably the right approach.
danyal hussain -- vice president, investor relations
i mean you've been telling..
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah, i would just say...
danyal hussain -- vice president, investor relations
mark..
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
sorry, dany. i would just say, think about it as kind of these are tweaks to the amounts we're spending in q4 versus kind of wholesale changes to the program here. so it's somewhat modest. and as carlos said, it's not in the hundreds of millions of dollars here.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird -- analyst
okay. i appreciate.
danyal hussain -- vice president, investor relations
and -- on your wisely question, mark. the one thing we did see was stimulus drove some uptick in card spend per card. other than that during the pandemic, there hasn't been any real notable changes in the wisely growth trends. so really it's the per card economics that have seen a slight tick up recently.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. and i think, it's something that we've been excited about. but again, it was hard to get excited about. there was a lot of natural tailwind because people wanted more digitally oriented payment methods in the last three quarters, but from a focus standpoint like for the first couple of quarters of the year, we were focused on a lot of things. and this may not have made it all the way to the top of the list, but it was on the top of the list kind of pre-pandemic, if you recall. and so i think, i would this is more of a reemergence of some of the themes and some of the things that we had been talking about that excite us because i think, the wisely opportunity is a big ones.
so i'm glad that the team brought this forward in terms of as an investment opportunity because we were excited about it, call it 12 to 18 months ago, we should -- just as excited about it today. but admittedly, it wasn't our number one focus, and in the middle of the pandemic, if you will, at the beginning of the pandemic.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yeah. and then just one last comment is, we always look very hard at the timing and amount that we spend on marketing and advertising. but with economic activity continuing to have momentum and pick up and client engagement picking up, we felt this was the right time to increase that a little bit as well.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird -- analyst
i really appreciate that color. and it is completely consistent with the long term track record. going back to our -- even before, gary. can you talk a little bit about this, dan or -- can you just remind us what the sensitivity on the pays per control to revenue is?
danyal hussain -- vice president, investor relations
it's 25 basis points of revenue impact for every 1 percentage point change in pays per control.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird -- analyst
thank you so much. i appreciate that. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from kevin mcveigh from credit suisse. your line is open.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great, thanks. hey. carlos, i think you alluded to kind of a record high client count 900,000 or so. can you give us sense of where that splits across enterprise mid-down market? and how that fits relative to historical trends in the business?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, i can give you some -- i'll give you some color. we don't -- i don't think that's something that we've disclosed in terms of the actual breakdown by business, but i can give you a general idea. so we had 0 6% growth the 900,000 and we had call it growth of somewhere around that for run our wfn growth was around that as well. and global view was around that as well. so they -- from a client, pure client growth standpoint if you look at our strategic platforms, they grew in that neighborhood from a client growth standpoint, which we see as really great news given the very difficult environment that we're in.
obviously, when you look at it mathematically the overall growth rate and the overall number, it's driven in large part by our small business division, because that's where we have the bulk of the absolute number of clients. but i wanted to give you a little bit of color around if you look at wfn -- if you look at workforcenow across our multiple channels, does remember we sell workforce not just in the mid-market, but we saw it in the upmarket, and we saw it in the peo, the peo platform as well. we also have that platform in canada. and so that gives you some sense of how well that platform is growing, which is really satisfying to us. so hopefully that helps a little bit.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
no, that's helpful. and then just -- on the retention, real quick. i think you took it up to a 125 basis points, up from a 100. can you just refine that a little bit? is that a q4 exit run rate or is that the full year number? does that mean fourth quarter is even higher than that or that has been in from a ppm number. and then just any thoughts if you could just maybe frame that a little bit more specifics big development?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
you've stumped us...
danyal hussain -- vice president, investor relations
i think, we said in the opening remarks, kevin, that it's on the q3 performance being stronger than expected.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. but i think, it's generally -- it's been consistent. like it's really, frankly, remarkable, which is why we keep emphasizing some caution because we hope if there is no plan, we're not going to give it back and we're not hoping for a give back. but in this business like people who've been following us for a long time, like when we have a 10 to 20 basis point move in retention, it's a big deal.
so to have this kind of retention on top of the retention that we had last year is pretty remarkable. and so we're pretty excited about. and i think the key for us is trying to determine, like when i look at the retention figures, there is a lot of improvement in what's called the controlled losses. so the ones that are related to kind of service issues and so forth. so we're excited that we might be able to hold on to some of this gain, but at the same time we're realistic enough to acknowledge that some of the stuff that was related to out of business and government stimulus there might be a little bit of give back there, but it's been pretty consistent.
like every -- it seems like, every quarter, the improvement has been in that same neighborhood year-over-year, hence why we kind of tweak the full year, because we're probably going to end up in the range that we gave you, which is a little higher than we had before, but it wasn't -- we weren't trying to like send any kind of message about the fourth quarter in particular.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
it's helpful. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from tien tsin huang from jp morgan. your line is open.
tien tsin huang -- jp morgan -- analyst
hey, thanks so much. and a lot of good questions already. just thinking about the retention. feels like it's industry wide to some degree. so just trying to better understand your new sales, the reacceleration. is it driven more from upselling and new business formation? then any surprises in the the net switching or the balance of trade from a head-to-head standpoint?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
i don't have a lot to report on that. we obviously watch all that stuff like you were referring to the balance of trade. and as you said, it's hard for me to tell about retention in terms of the rest of the industry. you guys would be the experts on that because there is -- my casual review of some 10-ks makes it kind of hard to compare like. some people would say, retention of their annual recurring revenue cloud revenues, which is not the same as the retention for their company, so it's hard for me to say.
i mean, some of it i would say it's probably more variable than you think based on what i'm seeing in terms of the variability of growth rates because it's clearly been a huge part of our ability to outperform. i mean this is a pretty remarkable revenue performance given what we've been through, and given the pays per control headcount. and by the way nobody has brought up yet, but we have a huge headwind on client funds interest, which is going to abate here in the fourth quarter and is going to abate next year as well.
there may still be a little bit of headwind, but this was really the worst quarter that we had, and these nine months were bad. it was a $130 million drag just from client funds interest. so when you put everything into the pot, without really good strong retention it's hard to outperform the way we have. and we've done some work on the relative performances of us versus some of our competitors, and we feel pretty good about that and about our -- the potential for retention to be one of the needle movers there.
there might be some other factors that i am not -- that we're not -- we haven't thought about. but no, i don't think there's anything else really big out there like. we've done a little bit better against some of our -- the usual competitors that you know about in terms of balance of trade, but there's others that are still challenging for us.
and so, net-net we're pretty comfortable with where we are, and determined to continue to drive our growth. i think all of us are probably benefiting from the overall economic growth. and the fact that it seems like maybe there are some either in-house or regional providers that are -- because you can see our -- we're growing our units in workforcenow and in run.
and so we're -- it seems like we're all -- have some ability to grow in this environment, which is i guess good for everyone.
tien tsin huang -- jp morgan -- analyst
yeah, i'm glad you said all that. we shouldn't take it for granted. just quickly on client satisfaction notably higher. would you attribute it, carlos, more to the, of course the support efforts you guys have invested in, but the next gen platforms and some of the digital initiatives? or are you also seeing just clients maybe building it more better goodwill with adp spending more time with them during these tough times during the pandemic? just trying to i understand that. because it seems like it could be -- if that carries over, we could see some compounding in the retention.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, i think it's a great question. and i -- we obviously are trying to figure that out. because it's very important to the long term value creation of the company. and it's all the things you mentioned because you obviously know the business well enough that you hit on all. the question is how much is each of those, right. like the last one that you mentioned about the goodwill, there is no question that of being there, like there were two or three months where people could not talk to anyone other than us about what to do.
what to do about the ppp loans that the government was offering around tax credits, because if you buy software from someone, you can't call them to ask them those questions. i just want to remind everyone, you can call them to ask them about the software, and you can send in a ticket to get your software issue resolved, but you can't call to ask about tax deferrals or tax credits or ppp reports or any of that kind of stuff.
so we clearly built a lot of goodwill. but on the other hand business is business, and goodwill doesn't last forever. so we're not planning on living off of that for the next 5 or 10 years. so that brings me back to kind of the basics of client satisfaction, which is we have to be there for our clients when they need us. not just during the pandemic, but at all times.
so i would say that the second major factor besides the goodwill that i mentioned, and some of the digital initiatives like make things easier for our clients and improve our user experience is that we did not panic at the onset of the pandemic. and if you recall, we took some lumps for that because we really maintained our investments both not just in r&d but we maintained our investments in headcount and in implementation.
that doesn't mean that we didn't have some drift down, as a result of some turnover, which we did and our headcount did decline because we had a temporarily a drop in volume, if you will, but that was really, really important to be able to kind of get through this period and be able to deliver on our commitments to our clients. and back to the comments i made about productivity before, that's one of those things that we watch very carefully because we want to improve productivity, but we won't -- we can't be naive and think that if our -- obviously if our headcount is 10% lower we have higher net income, the problem is, what would your client satisfaction be and your retention?
and so that's the magic of being able to figure out what's that right balance, and you have tools to figure that out. you have monitoring systems to understand what the client satisfaction levels are in relation to how quickly you're getting back to people to resolve their problems for example, and how well trained your people are. so there is a number of different factors that we look at, but the key is to be committed to delivering high levels of client service, which we are, and i think we just proved it.
if we can do it during the pandemic, we can do it anytime.
tien tsin huang -- jp morgan -- analyst
yes. got it, thanks so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jason kupferberg from bank of america. your line is open.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning, guys. thanks. i just wanted to start with the bookings question just to make sure you've got the expectations right here. just trying to do the math on the q4 implied guide. i think it would be about 90% growth so i wanted to see if that's accurate. obviously, you've got the super easy comp there. and maybe as part of that can you just talk about some of the activity you've seen through the first month of the quarter? i mean, i assume you've got pretty high visibility here, just given that you raised the low end of the full-year guidance range for the bookings?
danyal hussain -- vice president, investor relations
hey jason, it's danny. you don't have the weightings by quarter, but what's implied for the fourth quarter is over a 100% bookings growth. and for april, we're tracking right in line with expectations.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. and i would say that you should not read anything into that other than what we said, which is, we're still really positive. we believe we're going to continue to get sequential productivity improvements, but the percentage growth rate is really related to the base effect is really when you get down to right. whether it's 110 or 150 or 190.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
right.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
is not that. i know, you know, it's not that important, because i think you are trying to get to a number. becauuse you're using the percentage to get to the number. but..
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
you should probably. if i were you, i would look at maybe, call it the second quarter or maybe 2019 fourth quarter or something. it's got to be something else that would give you something good as a proxy, where we don't want to expect to be back to 100% productivity levels in the fourth quarter, but we should be getting close to like where we were in 2019. and there may be other small moving parts there from 2019. so i don't want to go out on a limb and say that's the right analog. but anyway i think that's hopefully helpful.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah, that would as the peer comp certainly would matter more. i just wanted to make sure people kind of have the right numbers in their models for the quarter. and then just a quick follow-up on the pays per control. i think you mentioned it was a little worse than you anticipated in q3, and you tempered your q4 expectations a little bit. i'm just curious, which part of the portfolio is driving that. it just seems maybe a little incongruous with the u.s. employment data that we're seeing at a high level, which obviously has continued to outperform expectations?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, it's a 100% timing-related because we can see in the data. we have other datasets like to show us, like for example, job postings and background checks and screenings and so forth. and so, you shouldn't read anything into it, and we did not temper our fourth quarter at all. in fact, we kind of tried to clarify that we've kept the full year the same despite the third quarter being a little bit softer in part because we think we're on the same positive trajectory that i think that we thought we were on.
so we're seeing the same thing you're seeing in terms of employment and unemployment. and we would fully expect these pays per control numbers to improve rapidly here. and remember that we're talking today about numbers that were through the end of the third, sorry, through the end of march, and those numbers are for three months.
so if you look at the third month, in march, is different than it was for january, and january, february. i know it's hard to remember to think back that far and how bad things were, that was a completely different picture than the picture we had in early april and maybe in the last, very last week of march. so i wouldn't read anything into it other than timing.
danyal hussain -- vice president, investor relations
yes. and jason, i'll just add.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yes, just to clarify, it was just a slight tweak to the q4 number and holding the full year at down 3% to 4%. so, it's really very minor tweaks.
tien tsin huang -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay, perfect. thank you, guys.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from pete christiansen from citi. your line is open.
peter christiansen -- citigroup -- analyst
good morning. thanks for the question. carlos, i think, the high customer stat scores, the goodwill, truly a testament to adp's capabilities, and certainly the service business model. but i guess, clients need certainly change. and we've been hearing from some of our other companies that talent acquisition has been i guess, even more challenging than in the past.
and i recall at the last analyst day that adp had really been making a lot of strides in improving its recruiting management tools, so on so forth. how would you think that you stack up competitively in that area, particularly in recruiting management tools? and, do you think that could be another vehicle or vessel to maintain the high retention levels that you're currently experiencing?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
absolutely. i think that you're right. i mean, some of this obviously is cyclical, in the sense that, 12 to 18 months ago, people were looking for other tools other than client acquisition tools. so, you have to be careful about not shifting with the wind that's fairly jump, to be consistently able to help people throughout the whole life cycle of hcm. and right now, that happens to be an important one.
and so, i would say that there is two things. one is, we build our own tools, as you said, around recruitment management, and we also have an rpo business and we have other tools to help with the talent acquisition process. we also partner, and we have some really strong partnerships. i'm not sure i should -- i don't know if i mention the names of the companies or not, but the names that you hear a lot of advertising about, we have a very strong integration and partnerships with some of those companies to really make it easy, in particular in small business, but also even in the mid-market, for people to to use those tools to really help with the recruiting needs that they have.
but we feel, we've been making -- we have made significant investments in our recruitment management platform, and our talent acquisition platforms. nothing to do with the pandemic, so that -- you could call it fortuitous, that we had done that before the pandemic. and we would expect that those would be contributors to our overall value proposition and to our revenue -- sorry, and to our bookings growth, because those are generally tools that create incrementality around your bookings number.
in other words, what you can charge clients is typically there is a core set of solutions, and then, recruitment management, things like time and attendance or workforce management, those tend to be more incremental around the basic package, if you will, of hcm. so, we're positive, we're bullish on it. and i think we're very -- just as a reminder, our app marketplace is -- creates a very easy and seamless way for people to use different solutions in hcm.
and this would be a category that we would have a lot of partners in that app marketplace, that allow you to get all the other benefits you mentioned about adp's business model, and still be able to fulfill your talent acquisition needs, if you don't believe that adp has what you need, which we believe you do. but if you don't, you can always get through one of our partners.
peter christiansen -- citigroup -- analyst
that's helpful. and apologies if this was addressed earlier. but given the change in the yield curve, has there been any thoughts on potentially extending duration of the portfolio or any other investment selection choices, as you head into '22?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
probably not worth mentioning. the -- as you know in the yield curve, like right now, five and seven year is a little bit better than two and three, just because of the way the fed is managing the curve, if you will. so, i think there are always tact -- i would call them tactical opportunities, but no. i mean, i think our duration has been in the same range since i've been ceo.
and i would anticipate that not changing. and we're not changing our laddering strategy, and we're not changing our client funds interest strategy. the good news is that, it appears, the worst is behind us in terms of drag from client funds interest, which was painful. i think we had a $50 million drag just this quarter. so, again, not to beat a dead horse, but it just shows the strength of the business that -- we didn't mentioned that to you. and we overcame that drag $130 million for the year.
so, we're looking forward to better times ahead. and i did see an interesting chart. again, i probably shouldn't say this, but, we had $16 billion in balances in 2008, and we have $635 million in client funds interest -- i'm sorry, $685 million, not $635 million -- in client funds interest. so, it just shows to you the magnitude. i mean, you all know what's happened to interest rates, but that was 2008. that wasn't like in a different century or in a different country. like, that was here.
and so today, our balances are call in the mid $20 billion number for the year i think, that's the expectation. so, i think, you could probably do the math yourself in terms of -- if we do believe that there's going to be some inflation here, and if you look at the inflation breakevens, and you look at some other things that are going on, we're looking forward to better times ahead for client funds interest.
peter christiansen -- citigroup -- analyst
and the adjusted ebitda margin was 19% back then, and you're already above that. that's great.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
thank you so much.
operator
thank you. and we have time for one more question that comes from jeff silber from bmo capital markets. your line is open.
jeffrey silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
i pass, as my question are already been asked. thanks very much.
operator
thank you. and this concludes our question and answer portion for today. i am pleased to hand the program over to carlos rodriguez for any closing remarks.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
so, as you can tell from our comments, we continue to, i think, have the same level of optimism as we had last quarter. and we're really thankful for the performance of our sales organization, and also our frontline associates in terms of what they've been able to do for our clients. and at the risk of ending on a negative note though, all of this positive and all of this positivity and enthusiasm we don't want to overlook the fact that we still have some challenges, and some people still have some challenges in other parts of the world.
this is a u.s. headquartered company with over 80% of our revenues in the u.s. so, that's probably why you're hearing all of this optimism, but we're not only in the u.s. we have associates in india, in brazil, in canada, and in europe, and the situation is not the same there. even though the businesses are performing well we -- just as back in the spring of last year, it was enormous suffering and challenges here in the u.s. among our associates the same thing is happening for some of our associates in some other parts of the world, in particular in india.
and we are not going to forget them. we're doing everything we can to help them. we appreciate what the u.s. government is doing along with the indian government and local governments to help as well. and we look forward to have it helping them get through the same difficult situation that we managed to get through and they too will have their vaccination rates pickup in all of those parts of the world, and they too will emerge from the pandemic. but it's clear, that its going to take a little bit longer, and we should all remember to be there to help them and to support them in any way we can, and adp will do exactly that.
but having said that, we are really close to seeing the situation in the rearview mirror here, and we're really anxious to see our growth rates reaccelerate to where we were pre-pandemic here at some point in the future, and getting back to the business. and to helping our clients with their challenges, and helping our associates build careers, and helping all of you and our other shareholders and stakeholders get a fair return for their investment.
so again, as always, we appreciate your interest in adp, and we appreciate you tuning in. and we will be back in a quarter with our outlook for fiscal year '22. thank you.

operator
good morning. my name is crystal, and i'll be your conference operator. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to adp's third quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. [operator instructions]
i will now turn the conference over to mr. danyal hussain, vice president, investor relations. please go ahead.
danyal hussain -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, crystal. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining adp's third quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call and webcast. participating today are carlos rodriguez, our president and chief executive officer, and kathleen winters, our chief financial officer.
earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. our earnings materials are available on the sec's website, and our investor relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call. during our call, we will reference non-gaap financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors, and that exclude the impact of certain items. a description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-gaap measures to their most comparable gaap measures can be found in our earnings release. today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. we encourage you to review our filings with the sec for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.
and with that let me turn it over to carlos.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, danny. and thank you everyone for joining our call. this morning, we reported another strong set of quarterly results that were ahead of our expectations, with a revenue growth of 1% and adjusted ebit margin down 90 basis points. combined from margin adjusted, diluted eps diluted eps decline of 2%. this of course, was the final quarter, before we begin to lap the impact of the pandemic and i'm very proud of our organization's ability to have delivered positive revenue and earnings growth for the first nine months of the fiscal year despite unprecedented challenges in the economy and the labor markets.
i'll start with a review of some of our key performance drivers, and an update on the operating environment we've been experiencing. this quarter our employer services new business bookings reaccelerated and we delivered 7% growth, a strong result for the team. the improved year-over-year growth compared to the second quarter was driven by every business unit.
importantly, we ended the quarter on a particularly strong note with record march sales performance that was well above pre-pandemic fiscal 2019 levels, which we see as a positive signal for client engagement in the quarters ahead. the selling environment will likely continue to evolve month-on-month and with differences on a regional basis, as covid cases and the reopening trajectories stabilize. we are optimistic that with vaccine deployment progressing steadily our clients are in the best position since the pandemic started to begin making buying decisions again.
also encouraging is that we started to hold more in-person sales meetings with over a third of our field sales force, having conducted at least one in-person meeting this quarter. we expect in-person engagement to pick up over the coming quarters as well. with our q3 performance and the trajectory we see in q4, we're pleased to narrow our bookings range around a higher midpoint. we now expect growth of 20% to 25% for the year versus 15% to 25% prior.
achieving this growth rate would put us at first full year sales productivity, close to 90% of pre-pandemic levels, which would be an incredible achievement for our sales associates. our retention which has been a key driver for our strong results this year was a positive development once again and performed slightly ahead of even our revised and elevated expectations. retention remains at record levels.
many of you have been asking about how sustainable this improved retention performance is for adp, it's a great question and hard to answer with precision given the unpredictable environment we're all in. but our belief is that during the pandemic, there have been some temporary benefits from client hesitancy to make major decisions plus lower out of business losses given government support in north america and europe. but we also believe there will be enduring benefit resulting from the record client satisfaction we've seen, as our product and service both have continued to improve.
next quarter, we expect to be in a better position to talk about retention expectations for fiscal 2022. but clearly, we feel very good about what we've achieved this year. on the back of our record q3 performance, we are pleased to raise our guidance and now expect full year retention to be up at least a 125 basis points from 2020 versus our prior guidance of up a 100 basis points. as a reminder this guidance would put us in record territory for the year.
moving to the overall employment picture, our pays per control metric performance was softer than expected as it improved only modestly from q2 and rounded again to a decline of 6% for q3. but that said, we are encouraged by the recent trends in employment data, particularly in the u.s. as more of the economy reopens. as of april, we've now started to lap the pandemic affected pays per control figures and have been pleased with the positive year-over-year growth we've seen so far in q4. so we're making no change to our full year pays per control outlook of down 3% to 4%.
i'd like to now provide an update on some of our key product and strategic initiatives. in february, we announced the launch of roll a new payroll and tax filing product for small businesses. roll combines a simplicity of an ai-driven chat-based interface with the power and scale of our payroll and tax filing expertise, solved digitally and delivered through an app-only interface.
with this offering, we believe we can expand our reach into the u.s. small business market beyond the businesses we've historically targeted with run. as the target clients for roll users are with -- is with simpler needs, who prioritize a mobile first fully chat-based interface. this is a different set of users compared with the target clients for a more comprehensive run solution. we look forward to sharing roll's progress with you in the quarters ahead.
parallel to this, we're also making great progress in increasing the amount of digital onboarding we're conducting with run, and we've continued to scale up this capability since we discussed it with you during our innovation day in the early 2020. this quarter alone 15,000 or over one-third of our new run clients on-boarded themselves digitally, enabling a better experience for the clients, as well as cost savings for adp. this initiative is just one of many digitally enabled efforts we are making to drive improved efficiency at adp. and as we've mentioned in the past, we have more to look forward to as our digital transformation continues.
our next gen payroll engine also continues to scale up and demonstrate success in the mid-market. in this quarter, we sold hundreds of more clients and continued to expand our capability set to accommodate more complex payroll needs. we now have over 400 clients live on workforcenow with our next gen payroll engine and we expect to accelerate this further in the coming quarters.
in addition to its improving position in the mid-market workforcenow continues to scale nicely into the enterprise market. and this quarter, adp was recognized as a customers' choice leader in gartner's voice of the customer for cloud hcm suites from north american companies with 1,000 or more employees. this is the great milestone for the team and strong validation of the flexibility of workforcenow, as we've continued to sell it to larger clients in recent years, while of course concurrently scaling implementation and service of our next gen hcm platform.
ultimately these product enhancements are all designed to drive growth, and i'm happy to report that this quarter, our client count reached 900,000 a remarkable achievement, particularly during the pandemic. this is a testament to both the strong retention we've experienced this year, as well as better than expected year-to-date sales performance. we're very proud of our execution so far this year and we look forward to putting the impact of the pandemic behind us.
on that front, we recognize there is a lot of interest in our potential growth and earnings profile for next year. as you can appreciate, it's still early to discuss fiscal 2022 with any precision given the dynamic environment and the fact that we're still going through our operating plan process for next year, but kathleen will share some additional perspective on fiscal 2022 in a moment.
i'd also like to share that we plan to host a virtual investor day later this calendar year, where we plan to update you on our strategy and discuss our post-pandemic aspirations. we are tentatively aiming for november, and we'll share a date shortly. for now, we remain focused on maintaining our very positive momentum as we close out this fiscal year.
and with that, i'll now turn the call over to kathleen for more detail on the quarter and the outlook.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
thank you, carlos, and good morning everyone. q3 represented another strong quarter for us with our performance on both revenues and margins driven by excellent execution across the organization. our revenues grew 1% on both a reported and organic constant currency basis, which represented a slight acceleration versus q2. we delivered this growth despite incremental drag from client funds interest versus q2, as well as some incremental pressure related to our usual seasonal q3 revenue drivers such as annual w-2 forms, i'll share more on these in a moment.
as anticipated, we also experienced a margin decline as we continue to make additional growth and productivity investments. and as we experienced a more significant client funds interest revenue decline compared to prior quarters, but the 90 basis points of margin decline was better than our expectations. combining this revenue and margin performance, our adjusted ebit was down 2% to $1.1 billion. our adjusted effective tax rate increased slightly compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020, as we had less contribution from excess tax benefit on stock comp, but our share count was lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases. and as a result, our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.89 was down a modest 2% versus last year.
for our employer services segment revenues declined 1% on a reported basis and 2% on an organic constant currency basis, demonstrating steady growth rates compared to last quarter, despite additional pressure from two sources as i just mentioned, both of which were fully anticipated. first, with greater pressure from client funds interest our q3 has a seasonally larger client funds balance than other quarters of the year, and as a result, it skews more to cash and cash equivalent investments where interest rates have been pushed down to near zero. as a result, our client funds interest declined 32% versus last year, with average yield down 70 basis points more than offsetting our strong balance growth, which improved to 6%. second, with a headwind related to seasonal q3 revenues, like the annual form w-2, which effectively makes our q3 slightly more sensitive to pays per control, and employment turnover trends than other quarters.
looking past these two headwinds, underlying es performance showed sequential improvement, driven in part by continued record level retention that was partially offset by slightly lower than expected pays per control. employer services q3 margin was down 120 basis points compared to last year, ahead of our expectations. we continue to invest in headcount to support our growing client base.
we also started lapping lower incentive costs from last year, and we experienced greater pressure from the lower client funds interest revenue, compared to the first half of this year, but at the same time, we kept our focus on prudent cost control and continue to execute on our transformation initiatives. our peo also had another very strong quarter. average worksite employees increased sequentially to 594,000. this was flat on a year-over-year basis, and this strong result was supported by retention outperformance and a slight sequential improvement in pays per control, which was more impactful than what we experienced in our es segment.
although peo sales growth still lags that of our es segment we did see an improvement in sales performance in q3, and are encouraged that unit sales growth for the peo was positive. our peo revenue growth meanwhile was very strong at 7%, and revenues excluding zero margin benefits pass-throughs grew 10%, both ahead of our expectations. once again, this strong performance benefited from higher payroll for wse, supported by employee mix.
additionally this quarter our revenue per wse was further supported by more favorable sui rate environment, as some states have started to increase sui rates. workers' comp rates remained a headwind in the quarter. peo margin increased 100 basis points in the quarter driven by revenue growth and continued expense discipline, as well as roughly 50 basis points of contribution from workers' compensation reserve true-ups.
i'll turn now to our updated guidance for fiscal 2021. with only one quarter remaining, we're pleased to raise our guidance midpoints for several key metrics, and narrow our guidance ranges for others. beginning with the es segment, we now expect revenue to be up 1% -- to be up about 1% for the full year versus our previous expectation for flat to up 2%. there is no real change in our revenue expectations, and this revised outlook includes the impact from the following drivers.
we now expect our es new business bookings to be up 20% to 25%, compared to our prior forecast of up 15% to 25%. this reflects q3 sales performance that came in slightly ahead of our expectations and are better line of sight into q4. we're very happy to raise our bookings guidance again. and although, this doesn't materially change our revenue expectations for this fiscal year, it does add to our optimism about next year.
we now expect our es retention to be up at least 125 basis points versus up 100 basis points prior. similar to our updated bookings guidance, this improvement is driven by our q3 performance and encouraging visibility into q4 retention. we are raising our client funds interest expectations slightly, and now expect $415 million for the full year. we've seen the interest rate environment improve compared to what we had contemplated last quarter. however, those improvements only apply to our new fixed income purchases over these last few months of the year there is no material change to our expectation for 1.6% average yield in our client funds portfolio for fiscal year 2021.
we are encouraged by the signs of improvement in the u.s. labor markets. but as we mentioned, over this last quarter, pays per control did underperform our q3 expectations modestly. we have tempered our q4 expectations slightly as a result, but our full year fiscal 2021 outlook remains a decline of 3% to 4%. for our expected employer services margin for the year, we are narrowing to a decline of 50 to 75 basis points. while we experienced stronger than expected margin performance in q3, we will reinvest some of this on discrete projects in q4, to further accelerate our growth, investing, for example, in our next gen rollout wisely card program, and additional marketing and advertising.
for our peo segment, we now expect revenue up 5% to 6% versus our prior forecast of up 3% to 5%, and we expect average worksite employees to be up 1% to 2% versus our prior forecast of flat to up 2%. we also expect our revenues, excluding zero margin pass-throughs, to be up 5% to 6%, compared to our prior forecast of up 3% to 5%. our top line raise for the peo is driven primarily by the strong q3 performance we experienced, and slightly higher payroll per wse assumptions for q4.
last, per peo margin, we now expect to be up about 75 basis points in fiscal 2021 versus our prior forecast range for up 50 to 100 basis points. our visibility into q4 has improved, and year-to-date, we've seen stronger revenue performance, and better than expected contribution from workers' compensation true-ups, offset by greater pass-through revenue.
for our consolidated outlook, we now anticipate total adp revenue to be up to 2% to 3% in fiscal 2021 versus up 1% to 3% prior, and we anticipate our adjusted ebit margin to be down 50 to 75 basis points, an improvement of our prior guidance of down 52 to 100 basis points. there is no change to our expected effective tax rate of 23% for the year, and we continue to assume a net share count reduction in our guidance.
net of all these changes, we are updating our adjusted diluted eps guidance to be flat to up 1% versus our prior guidance of down 2% to up 2%. as you know, with q4, we will begin to lap the impact of the pandemic, and we recognize there is a lot of interest in what our growth rate will look like, as conditions continue to normalize. with that said, we're still going through our planning process. as usual, we will provide fiscal '22 guidance when we report our fourth quarter results, but i'd like to share some preliminary considerations.
the most important factor for us in accelerating growth is driving strong, new business bookings, and we expect our sales productivity to improve further next year, as in-person visits increase and clients and prospects continue to reengage more fully. as that productivity continues to progress toward pre-pandemic levels and beyond the contribution it makes to our revenue growth will likewise, continue to build.
pays per control should provide a tailwind, and the magnitude of contribution will depend on the pace of global employment recovery. we've provided sensitivities to pays per control in the past, and we'll share a pays per control assumption next quarter. client funds interest will likely remain a headwind if the current rate environment holds, there should be much less of a headwind than we are experiencing in fiscal 2021. and on retention, improving economic activity could mean greater client switching levels compared to this year, but we're not seeing pressure yet, and will remain focused on holding onto the gains we've achieved. we'll share our assumption about it next quarter.
clearly, there are a number of moving pieces, but the net effect should be favorable. the 2% to 3% revenue growth we expect to deliver this year demonstrates the resilience of our business model. and we look forward to building from this higher revenue base, and accelerating our growth back to pre-pandemic levels as quickly as we can. we are going into next year from a position of strength, and our aim is to deliver an improved market position, stronger top line growth, and margin expansion, while maintaining the steady cash flows that have allowed us to increase our shareholder distributions consistently for more than seven decades. more on all of this will come next quarter, and we look forward to updating you then.
i'll now turn it back over to the operator for q&a.

[operator instructions] we will take our first question from the line of eugene simuni with moffettnathanson. your line is now open.
eugene simuni -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
good morning thank you for taking my question. maybe to start with a little bit of a high-level macro question. so kathleen, you just highlighted that there is significant amount of secular growth that's coming out in the hr services industry from the pandemic. can you speak a little bit more about where you guys are seeing the indications that the secular growth is actually helping financial performance of adp? and how much of that is incorporated in your fiscal year 2022 guidance? and where can we see that effect in the numbers?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
i think there are probably a couple of highlights. kathleen probably has a couple of other she can mention. but like i think we mentioned in our prepared remarks, what we're seeing around workforce management in terms of time tracking and scheduling and so forth, we also mentioned some of the products we've developed for return to workplace. so there are a number of things that are probably related to what's likely to be a more hybrid work environment for white-collar employees at least on a go-forward basis, which probably requires people to think about their investments in hcm in terms of what they can do to maximize the recruiting and the retention and engagement of that hybrid workforce.
so i think that is one. the other one is there's always been a secular uptrend in terms of regulatory-related, and this is on a global basis, demand for hcm products. in other words, the more complexity there is around being an employer, the greater the demand for the wide array of services that we provide. that secular trend has probably gotten a bit of a boost based on, in the u.s., the change in administrations, right, which -- we've had that secular growth for seven years that adp has existed. but there are times where it's stronger in terms of a tailwind and sometimes where it's weaker.
and i would say that we're heading into strong secular tailwinds here as a result of some of the increased attention on regulatory actions. and you probably all saw, i think it was yesterday or the day before, that the president signed a number of executive orders, most of which are aimed at employer-employee-related relationships that increase the amount of tracking and of reporting and of compliance necessary on the part of employers. so those are a couple that i would mention. i think our retention rate also shows, in an indirect way, secular demand improving, right, in the sense that people have kind of rethought dropping or switching from their hcm vendors.
but that one is a little difficult to be 100% sure about because we do expect some normalization in that retention rate.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yes. i think that really covers a lot of it. i mean to kind of summarize and categorize what carlos said, when you think about the complexity, number one, of being an employer, the ongoing and pretty significant changes that we see from a regulatory standpoint, so complexity, regulatory change, the dynamic environment as the way people work and employer-employer relationship -- employer-employee relationship changes, it's a very dynamic environment. all of that is -- you can just see in the bookings number that we have.
our bookings, and i'm sure we'll get into the discussion on this, but the growth is pretty broad-based. i mean, certainly, we saw some channels stronger than others, but it's pretty broad-based. and i think that's because of all of the dynamic change and complexity that we see. and in particular, our comprehensive solution, our outsourcing solutions have seen quite significant growth. so we're really encouraged about the macro trends that we see in the space.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
and again, i think that it's -- i've always never known what is defined as secular versus not secular, but there's huge demand now for talent. what's happening in the labor markets, obviously, that's a huge tailwind for all of us in the hcm space in terms of recruiting tools and engagement tools to try to hold on to people, but that could also be something that wanes in six months. that was a little harder to tell. but generally speaking, the war for talent has always been also a secular tailwind to our industry as well.
eugene simuni -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
got it. got it. great. and then for a follow-up, related and talking about the bookings growth and looking at your guidance, the 10% to 15% growth next year, can you just quickly speak to kind of two or three key swing factors that you see that will define whether we're going to end up on the lower end or higher end of that range as we kind of turn the corner and the recovery and go through this period?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so actually, i could probably give you three that would probably account for kind of the way we think about this. so number one, obviously, is what we just talked about is the secular and cyclical tailwinds or headwinds. so if the economy continues with the momentum it's got, we're feeling pretty good. obviously, if we end up having more challenges because of the pandemic or otherwise, but right now, the amount of -- even the existing government stimulus, even if there's no additional stimulus, is pretty strong and also the pent-up demand and all these -- the reopening, that feels like a very good backdrop for us from a bookings growth standpoint.
and then as long as we have that background or that backdrop that's positive, it really comes down to really two things, is sales force productivity at the sales quota carrier level times number of sales quota carriers. and i hate to be so simplistic, but at our size, because we have new products and we're rolling out -- you heard how excited we are about all the new things that we're putting out there, but we sell a lot of business every year. so for a smaller company, when they end up having like a new product launch, that can cause all kinds of growth -- and by the way, likewise, if you don't have any new products, but for us, what i would consider to be a steady eddy.
so we really grow through methodically improving and adding new products, making tuck-in acquisitions, etc., a lot of those. but the key formula for us is we cannot hit our sales plan unless we have the headcount and we are continually improving our sales force productivity, and that's exactly what our plan is. and we had some good news over the last four quarters where our sales force productivity at the average quota carrier level steadily improved throughout the year to reach 90% for the full year, but we exited the fourth quarter in kind of the mid-90s, if you will, in comparison to pre-pandemic level. so it feels like we're getting back to ""trend"" from an average sales productivity standpoint.
and if we can get back to that trend and we deliver on our headcount additions, we should be able to hit our new business bookings number.
eugene simuni -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
got it. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of pete christiansen with citi. your line is now open.
pete christiansen -- citi -- analyst
good morning. thanks for the question. carlos, you talked about a lot of new logo wins this year, which is pretty impressive. but i was curious to hear how you think about how this may have changed your -- or adp's cross-sell, upsell opportunity set. i'd imagine the runway there has expanded quite a bit. and perhaps how are you thinking about the strategy, that land-and-expand strategy, to really take advantage of this opportunity?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so one of the -- in case somebody asked that we -- one of the questions we sometimes get is -- and it's related to what you're asking is the mix of how much is new logo sales versus how much is add-on sales. and it's really been very steady over many years. it was only during the aca period where we had a little bit of a tilt more toward incremental add-on sales, but it's for a long time been around 50-50, and it's still kind of in that neighborhood. so that, i think, bodes well because the more clients we add, the more opportunities we have to pursue that land-and-expand, i think, approach that you just described.
so i would say that we're bullish on the opportunity to continue to go back to the new logos that we sold, which, in many cases, we sell with multiple modules, but there's always additional room for new products as well to go back to that existing client base. so i think that underlying logo growth, i think, is another kind of supportive factor, if you will, for our new business bookings because we do get about 50% of our bookings from our existing client base.
pete christiansen -- citi -- analyst
that's helpful. and as a follow-up, i was just -- i was hoping you could juxtapose the globalview business versus the rest of the es. i know they haven't been totally in sync during this recovery. what are you seeing there of late trend-wise? and as you look toward the outlook, is that part of the business considered a laggard behind the remainder of the es? or is there some variability there that investors should be aware of?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
it's actually a little bit of the opposite. maybe we may have confused some people, i think, in prior calls, but i think globalview's probably -- could be at the top of our list in terms of performance this year. like large multinational companies have been, i think, looking for ways -- i think this pandemic raised probably some issues and concerns around control, i think, for the hr leaders that probably raised some issues around engagement and making sure that you're connected to your global workforce and that you had global reporting, etc..
there's a lot of factors that probably went into what was incredibly strong demand and very positive sales growth. so i would say -- again, we don't disclose individual product lines, but i would say that globalview sales were one of the stronger line items, i think, for us. and i'll add that to your question about differences between the businesses, i think all of our businesses really performed well. it's kind of hard. it really comes down to trying to point out which ones were spectacular versus just good.
and i would say that globalview and even our international business really were standouts. and really, it's very impressive because some of the situations in europe, for example, were very challenging in terms of dealing with the pandemic, but it didn't really stop people from looking for solutions and it didn't stop our sales force from finding them even though they had to do that from -- obviously, from a remote workplace. so i guess summary is globalview is a shining star for us.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yes. they saw a good momentum as we closed out the year. in fact, it was a particularly strong close with a good number of multinational deals on globalview coming through at the end of the year. and we're looking at fiscal 2022 for them to be a big contributor again.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
and again, the only -- again, it doesn't make a huge difference in the overall adp revenue numbers, but these strong bookings, remember, will really translate into revenue in, call it, six to 18 months because these are large -- typically large multinationals that take some time to implement. but that should be a positive thing for us kind of looking forward, if you will, in that six-to 18-month horizon.
pete christiansen -- citi -- analyst
thank you great color, and really nice execution good job. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of james faucette with morgan stanley. your line is now open.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great.thank you very much. good morning. i wanted to ask quickly, and i think it's tied into some of the comments you made around your guidance. but specifically, how are you thinking about like the well-publicized difficulties employers are having attracting employees and that kind of thing? how is that factoring into your guidance and your formulation? and are you expecting a resolution of that as we go through the fiscal year? just trying to get a little bit of color how you're putting the macro environment into forecast.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
well, i mean i would probably put that in the bucket of secular tailwinds or cyclical tailwinds depending on your view of whether it's short term or longer term. but it does seem like if this kind of resolves itself, there's a couple of scenarios. but if it's transitory in terms of the friction of getting people into the right jobs, and then six months from now, some of this has passed, by the time we get to that point, unemployment might be down in the kind of a 4% to 5% range, which then creates a whole another wave of needs for employers in terms of finding talent and kind of fighting for talent.
so it feels to us like this is a multiyear cycle here where employers are going to be really scrambling to find people, and i think that generally creates conversation opportunities. so we don't have a magic formula necessary -- necessarily, and we're not a staffing firm, but we do have tools and we have technology and we have people that can help our clients be more competitive as they look for solutions, as they look for the right employees in the right place at the right time at the right pay level.
that's our sweet spot. and so i'd say we're right in the middle of this, what i would call, super cycle of demand for labor that is probably short term related to kind of friction where people are just not in the right places and people are probably also -- there's some hesitations still. there's issues with child care and elder care. there's a number of factors. it is -- we assume like other economists that this will be -- that part will be transitory, but that the need for people will not be given just the, obviously, low unemployment rate, which we will be at by the end of, call it, calendar year 2022.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's really helpful, carlos. and then just as it relates to sales productivity, you highlighted that you're expecting and seeing improvement there. at the same time, you indicated that there, you're being able to get your salespeople in front of more accounts and potential accounts. how closely tied do you expect those two things to be as we go through the rest of fiscal year?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
again, since we're in uncharted territory, it's a little hard to give a scientific answer because last year, we were not able to get in front of a lot of our -- or actually most of our process until recently, and yet we delivered, i would say, very solid and strong bookings results. so i think some of this is really about us being able to adapt, which is our job, to what the market wants, right, what the clients want and what the prospects want. and the fact of the matter is that about half of our -- half of the workforce out there, which probably translates into half of our clients, they actually kept going to workplaces.
they kept making things, delivering things and going to workplaces. the rest of the -- some of us white-collar employees didn't. so that segment of the prospects and clients, they expect us to be available if they want us to meet with them in person. we're not going to go force anyone to meet in person. we're happy to meet them where they want to be met, whether it's virtually online or in person. but we want to be ready for whatever the market wants and whatever the market demands, and that's exactly our plan.
but to answer your question, it's really hard to know which factor is the most important factor. we think that being able and willing and available to meet in person with prospects is an important element of our sales success for fiscal 2022, but i can't really put a number on it because we were successful in 2021 without doing that.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yes. i think the key is that we're just going to have to make sure we can continue to be nimble just as we were in fiscal 2021, right? if there are certain regions or points in time where we finally have to scale back a little bit into face-to-face, i think we're nimble enough to do that. we've proven we could do that. but we're certainly ready and have been out there doing face-to-face and hope that, that continues.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks kathleen, thanks carlos.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of dan dolev with mizuho. your line is now open.
dan dolev -- mizuho -- analyst
hey guys, great results. thanks for taking my question. so can you discuss how the retention has varied by sort of the three -- in es by the three subsegments, smb, mid-market and upmarket? and what happens to the smbs once the ppp rolls off? so how should we think about kind of your guidance for retention versus like those three vectors? and then i have a very short follow-up.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
that's a good question. i think kathleen may probably have a little bit of additional color, but i would tell you that this -- i think your insinuation that the ppp loans may have something to do with these elevated retention rates is something that we've heard kind of out there in terms of as a buzz. and again, that's very hard to like put our finger on in terms of how to quantify that and what's the impact. but for sure, one of the strongest areas we've had in retention is our downmarket business.
and that is why i think we've prudently planned for some giveback on that next year. having said that, i would tell you that this year, fiscal 2021, and the two months before that, were probably the greatest example of adp's business model in terms of ability to deliver. we call it service, you can call it compliance, you can call it whatever you want. but when the chips were down and people needed help and needed to talk to someone about their ppp loan, they weren't calling their banker, they didn't have to apply for a loan and they didn't have to go through a bank, but you can go do your own channel checks to see how many banks were actually answering the phone or giving people advice because they were completely overwhelmed as we were, but we actually figured out a way to handle it.
and we were there for our clients. and so i think that what we just did over the last year -- and i get it, i'm a pragmatist, so memories are short, and we have to continue to impress and continue to deliver for our clients. but i think we just proved to hundreds of thousands of clients and, hopefully, to prospects from a reputation standpoint that if you want to have someone who's a partner at adp, if you want software, you can buy software. but if you want great technology and great software, but you want someone who's going to be able to deliver on the service side, then you should be with adp.
and so i think that, that is going to have some -- there's going to be some factor in hopefully allowing us to hold on to some of this retention on a more permanent basis because i think the -- when the chips were down, i think people saw the difference between not having someone that you could get help from and having someone that you can reach out to and get advice and get your problems solved. but the bottom line is we clearly are prudent and aware that some of this normalization could result in some lower retention rates, particularly in the down market as you are, i think, alluding to.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean that covers a lot of it. in fiscal 2021, look, we saw strong retention across almost all of our channels, our businesses, particularly in small business and mid-market as well though, and even actually on the international side where the retention is very high. we saw it inch a little bit higher there as well, too. so pretty much strong across the board. but look, we want to be prudent from a planning perspective. and while we haven't seen any change yet in terms of switching or -- along those lines, i do think it's prudent to plan that there's going to be, i'll call it, a little bit of giveback in fiscal 2022.
i think we are going to hold on to some of the gains. we're certainly attempting to do that. we want to do that. but i do think it's prudent to plan for a little bit of giveback, which we've done, and that would be primarily with regard to small business segment normalizing back to pre-pandemic levels.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
but to be clear, there's no -- i'm not aware of a particular -- there's nothing that ties a client to us or anyone else because of the ppp loans. what i've heard the theory that some people have is somehow some kind of psychological thing that it will just make things more difficult if you switch. and i'm obviously not a small business owner. so we talk to small business owners, and we're just not hearing that. but it feels logical that could be a factor. but to be clear, there's no particular trigger that on november 15, we're going to lose 100,000 clients because their ppp loans have been repaid or expired. that's not the way the program works.
dan dolev -- mizuho -- analyst
understood. and then my quick follow-up, and i think it somewhat ties to this is the margin guidance. what i'm hearing this morning from investors is it might be -- it may be slightly light of expectations. i mean, is that somewhat tied to the mix shift next year? or is there anything else that you could call out on the margin guidance?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
well, listen, after 10 years of doing this, i've never heard anyone say that your margin guidance was too aggressive and too high. so let me just start off with that comment. and part of that is that we're always trying to balance short-term and long-term investors. i'm not sure which ones you were hearing from. but our intent here is to continue the machine, right, and the momentum that has led to multiple decades here of compounded growth and creation of value over a very long period of time, and that requires delivering short-term results as well as long-term results.
and those long-term results, i think, require some investment, including on the r&d side. but in particular, this year, really, the biggest factor is selling expense and sales investment, which has happened to us in the past. so we've had other times in, call it, 2000, 2001 or 2002 and then 2008, 2009, 2010, because i was around for those, where as we reaccelerate and take advantage of demand back to the secular growth opportunity, the way our business model works is we incur a lot of upfront selling and implementation expense.
now there are some accounting rules that allow you to defer some of that. but generally speaking, you get elevated selling expenses and implementation expenses, and it's pretty significant. so i would say that, that is a significant part of what would have maybe otherwise been higher margins for 2022. but when that business then is on the books, that's a high incremental margin business that then in 2023, 2024 and then for the next 12 to 13 years, that's how long we keep our clients on average, creates an annuity.
so as you can imagine, we never turn down the incremental opportunity to add business, never, because of just the way the value creation model works. and we're going to make hay while the sun is shining here. and with 6%, 7% gdp growth last quarter and what's likely to be incredibly strong gdp in the next year or 2, we're going to take every possible opportunity. and unfortunately, that requires some selling expense and some implementation expense in addition to the ongoing investments in technology and some of the other things that we do.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yes. so just big picture, the way to think about margin for next year, and we're very happy that we're able to kind of guide to this 25 to 50 basis points of margin expansion, i mean, look, we always look to do better than the plan, but that's what we're comfortable with right now. the way to think about it is, look, we're going to have operating leverage to a greater extent in fiscal 2022, obviously. but we've also got the investments that we want to continue to make, as carlos just articulated, in product, in sales and in digital transformation importantly.
and we do have some offsets. carlos mentioned the sales expense. but we also have things like return to office and ramping up t&e versus what we were -- where we were in fiscal 2021. so kind of all that goes into the mix. net-net, we've got this 25 to 50 basis points margin expansion. we're going to do our best to deliver on that and continue to work our digital transformation, and it's possible to do even more.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
and one -- just one other factor because if you have any doubts about adp's ability to drive margin, just one small thing hasn't come up yet, but we had this like small little problem this year with interest rates where it created a $110 million headwind in net contribution and almost $125 million in top line and bottom line in terms of client funds interest revenue. so our revenue growth would have been almost one point higher, and our margin for this year in a pandemic would have been up 70 basis points instead of down 40 basis points had we not had that headwind.
now we did have a headwind. so it's always hard to say if we didn't have this and we didn't have that. but that's a pretty easy thing to isolate that has no operational -- nothing to do with operations. we have no control over, and we have to just ride that cyclical wave, which hopefully that cyclical wave is heading in a very positive direction for us over the next two to three years. but i just want to make sure you understood that because i think that tells you just how much control we have over our expenses and over our business model and over our long-term value creation objectives.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
and that -- to clarify, interest does continue to be headwind for us in fiscal 2022, a very modest headwind compared to what we experienced in fiscal 2021. but it doesn't help us, whereas in years past, it was a significant help to us.
dan dolev -- mizuho -- analyst
got it. thank you for the detail, appreciate it.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of ramsey el-assal with barclays. your line is now open.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my question. i wanted to follow up on your comments on retention. and you're prudently planning for retention to increase as the market normalizes. whether it does or not, we'll see. but can you describe your toolkit on the sales or technology side that you can use to prevent attrition? i mean i'm sure a lot depends on the underlying sort of reasons for the attrition. but can you be more proactive on that front and sort of stem the tide a bit if push comes to shove?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
absolutely. i think -- and again, i -- we probably have a couple of examples we could give of things that we've done over the last year, but it's usually a methodical multiyear approach to making our products -- like when we talk about innovation, innovation is partly about new business bookings, but it's also about making our solutions easier to use and more intuitive. and you heard in our comments, and we shouldn't gloss over it, like the ux experience investments we've made in both run but now in some of our other platforms is a significant factor in today's world of whether or not a client sticks with you or not.
so we get that. that's why however many years ago, we kind of got it and we said we need to become a technology company in addition to the services company that we are. and so i'd say, number one is you have to have great products. they have to be easy to use and they have to have no friction. that will help with retention. i think the other thing that i think you can point to are really just around availability. so our business model and our promise is not just technology and software, but it's to help with compliance and it's to help with advice and it's to provide expertise.
and that really means that we have to have well-trained associates who are there to answer questions, whether it's chat, whether it's by phone, it doesn't matter, however the client wants to reach us. but the stuff we do is complicated. and being an employer is complicated, and it requires help. and you can either get the help from us or you can call an attorney or you can call a consultant, but most people do not just do this stuff on their own. and we happen to package the two things together, great technology with great service.
so i'd say if we have great technology and we have great service, we're going to be able to hold on to hopefully a lot of that improvement we've had in retention, even if we have a little bit of giveback in the downmarket.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
i see. just not a question of running analytics at the right time. it's really more of a longer-term kind of blocking and tackling and product innovation approach.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
we run plenty of analytics, too. so we have -- for example, we have a lot of data around -- like we track individual clients how many times they call. we actually can monitor. we have voice recognition that tells us certain keywords that people use when they're -- because we record all phone calls, and that really gives us deep insight into clients that are at risk. and then we have special teams that can follow up with those clients to make sure that whatever problem they have has been resolved.
but that's -- i would call that trench warfare, which -- but if you want to get into those details, i can go in the trenches with you. but we have very deep analytical tools that really give us a lot of insight. for example, in our downmarket, i mean our clients don't call that often because, hopefully, they don't have problems very often because we do a nice job of preventing problems. but one of our small business clients has -- we detect has multiple calls in a month. that requires a reach-out to that client or a deeper investigation and a triage to make sure that we don't lose that client because that's usually a sign that there's something wrong with that client.
and we have other techniques and other approaches and other tools to identify what we would call hotspots. we also monitor pricing very carefully. when we do our price changes, which i guess is code for price increases, we do that very carefully using a lot of analytical tools to make sure that we do that in the smartest possible way, if you will, to maximize retention.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
okay. thanks for that. and a quick follow-up for me. how would you characterize the demand environment for off-cycle or on-demand payroll? is this something that you see getting quite a bit more popular? or will it sort of remain kind of a niche service over time?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
i mean it's clearly popular because i know a lot of people are talking about it, and so that always leads to popularity, right? as soon as someone talked about it, it becomes popular. i think that it's -- again, like a lot of things we've been saying over the last two or three years, some of these things are inevitable, are going to happen, and we're preparing for them. so things like real-time payroll, and this one that you're referring to is kind of one that we just heard over the last couple of days. that's something we've been thinking about for many, many years, and we have solutions where someone needs to get paid -- like, for example, in california, if someone is terminated from their job, you have to give them their final paycheck like immediately.
and so that is difficult to do through the normal process. so we have solutions for that, that we've had for quite some time. so i think the increasing popularity is probably more related to increasing discussion about it but also to technological advances that allow more options, right, in terms of instant payments and/or faster payments. so i would say the answer is yes, that is an important thing. and for certain sectors, like if you have a high turnover hourly workforce, your ability to provide that solution is crucial, but we have that ability to provide that solution. but you can't, for example, sell a client in california and not be able to provide instant pay upon termination. so it's -- you have to have that.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
got it. alright. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of bryan bergin with cowen. your line is now open.
bryan bergin -- cowen -- analyst
hi. good morning. thank you. can you talk about how you're thinking about the cadence of the pays-per-control projection you've assumed during fiscal 2022? and what does the 4% to 5% build imply in the base relative to pre-pandemic levels?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
we're digging for that. i think the quarterly -- i mean, again, it's probably -- when you look at the comps, the fourth quarter will have weaker-than-expected growth. but i don't know, danny, if you have the...
danyal hussain -- vice president of investor relations
yes. bryan, it's just a mirror image of what we saw effectively last year. and so there's a stronger q1 performance in ppc that's baked into our assumptions and it gradually tails off. but we don't have an explicit guidance for you on what this means for reported unemployment rate, the same way that we gave you that guidance last year at the outset.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
and the average for the year for pays-per-control, refresh my memory, is 4% to 5%.
danyal hussain -- vice president of investor relations
4% to 5%.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i would anticipate -- if i were you, i would probably assume that for the fourth quarter, it's going to be back to, i don't know, 2%, 3% or somewhere in the lower range because we're growing over the 8%. and in the first three quarters, particularly the first quarter, it will be higher.
bryan bergin -- cowen -- analyst
okay. follow-up then on m&a. how are you thinking about areas of potential acquisitions for capabilities? and then also, can you comment on how the market has been for book of business acquisitions? curious, covid has changed that dynamic during fiscal 2021 and into fiscal 2022?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
we've had actually pretty good success in terms of client-based acquisitions. you -- again, you're right that i myself was surprised that there was an opportunity to do that and that we were able to execute on it. but we had one that i think we mentioned last year in the fourth quarter and kind of spilled a little bit over into the first quarter, but it was mostly, i think, fourth quarter. we had one the year before that, that was significant also in the fourth quarter. and this year, we've had a number of, what i would call, smaller ones, but they add up.
and so i would say that the news there is good and is ongoing, and we've created a nice ability to do these conversions and make it good for us in terms of growth. and back to the question around cross-sell, we usually have a much broader set of solutions than other people that we are making these acquisitions from, which creates upside opportunity, right, in terms of value creation for us. on the kind of overall m&a comment side, i would say that we've -- where we've been most active is looking in some of our international locations and markets where i think we have very little market share and we still have needs, for example, for add-on products, whereas in the u.s., we're not really looking to add additional platforms for either benefits or payroll and so forth.
so it really has to be things that are adjacent, right, in the hcm space but not duplicative because, as you know, we've been on this kind of simplification push for many, many years and trying to build things organically and invest in technology organically. so that doesn't mean that we won't acquire because we have. in a couple of years -- we just haven't done anything for a couple of years, but we do welcome the opportunity to add additional ancillary as long as they fit into our technology road map and they're not disruptive or add-on, and we're not doing it just to get the ""revenue pop"".
but on the international side, we typically don't have those factors at play as much, and that's a place where we're still excited and we still see a lot of greenfield opportunity to expand through m&a.
bryan bergin -- cowen -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of kartik mehta with northcoast research. your line is now open.
kartik mehta -- northcoast research -- analyst
good morning carlos. you talked about the peo business. obviously, it performed well in the fourth quarter, and it seems like trends are coming back. i'm wondering if you've seen any secular changes. i know that word maybe you don't like. but any secular changes in demand for the product or if you anticipate any changes because of what we've gone through with covid?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
i mean, again, my experience tells me that -- because i actually ran that business for many years at adp, and now i've been watching it for -- i can't believe i'm going to say this, for 25 years. and when you head into this kind of economic environment, it's usually a positive secular tailwind for -- i guess back to like -- it's not that i don't like that word, but i would say that there have been positive secular trends for the peo for 20 to 30 years. and then they can get enhanced, i think, by cyclical factors like a strong economy.
so people sometimes say that the peo will do well or outsourcing will do well when there's a recession because people are looking to save money. and that -- there is some truth to that, but it's not what the data supports or shows, right? it's usually when you have very strong economic growth and strong gdp and people are scrambling for talent and they're competing for offering the right benefits. that's when peos and outsourcing tend to, i think, do better. so i would say that based on experience, which you have to discount because we just went through a pandemic.
so most of our experiences, we should park somewhere outside the door because we may end up being wrong. but all things being equal, this kind of economic environment is usually very strong for the peo. and as for the last 18 months, what we saw there is it's a long cycle sale and it's a high involvement decision. so i think we've been clear that we've had good, great results there from a booking standpoint and probably better than we would have thought was possible but definitely not as strong as es in kind of the early stages of the recovery of our bookings.
we expect that to reverse, and that is our plan in 2022. in other words, we expect very strong bookings and strong recovery on the peo. and we're seeing some signs of that in the fourth quarter because what happened is in this kind of hunkering down mode, we saw very high retention in our peo but not as much -- it was more difficult to sell new clients. but the existing clients, i mean, it was unbelievable value that we delivered to them because it was beyond just ppp loans. it was how do i downside my workforce or how do i put people on furlough and what are the rules in this state around benefits.
i mean our people were busy. i mean all of our people, all of adp were busy this year, while maybe other people were less busy, but our people were busy. and in the peo, they were extra busy. so i think that, that bodes well. and those anecdotal stories and that reputation along with kind of some of these cyclical tailwinds, i think, bode well for the peo here in the next year or two.
kartik mehta -- northcoast research -- analyst
and just as a follow-up on the es business, have you had to do anything out of the ordinary in terms of price competition or just providing promotions?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
have we done anything, are you saying? or is the market?
kartik mehta -- northcoast research -- analyst
yes. i guess have you had to do anything to -- because of what competition has done. so have you had to do anything out of the ordinary on the es business?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
no.
kartik mehta -- northcoast research -- analyst
perfect. thank you.
operator
thank you. our last question comes from the line of mark marcon with baird. your line is now open.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
good morning everybody. thanks for excusing me in. i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the strong bookings performance and just unpacking that in terms of where you -- i heard the 50-50 mix in terms of upsells versus new logos. but as it relates to new logos, where were you seeing the strongest success? was that downmarket in terms of the new business formations? was that across the board? and who do you think you were winning the most against?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
by the way, we would always squeeze you in, mark. there's no question about that. a couple of highlights. we think -- we mentioned in our prepared comments, but our non-peo hro solutions, so these would be kind of mid-market and upmarket outsourcing solutions that are, what i would call, more comprehensive, if you will, really, were probably one of the real highlights. and i think that was, again, related probably to people realizing probably within months after the pandemic that like this stuff is hard to do, especially if you have to pivot very quickly, right?
you have to make sure your systems are still up. like you can't have a server in a closet somewhere that you're using to run payroll because you still do this internally. and then people who go to the office to key in the payrolls like this stuff, there's just a lot of people all of a sudden woke up and realized from a business continuity standpoint and from a support standpoint, i need help, and it needs to be more than just a software, right, and basic service. so these hro solutions really were an incredible bright spot.
and then i think kathleen mentioned our upmarket and our esi bookings results were also very, very strong. yes, new business formation helped in the downmarket, and we're very -- like we're pleased with all of our results on the booking side. it was across the board very strong performance. but i would say that there were other places that had even stronger where i talked about globalview, our tax filing and compliance business, which does a lot of stand-alone business, where, again, companies realize that having a bunch of people subscale doing this stuff, you don't even know where they are and if they can get to the office or if they can do it from home, but it's mission-critical, are looking to outsource or did outsource a lot of that stuff to us.
and then we did have a couple of what i would call, volume-based businesses like employment verification and screening and a couple of things that -- rpo also came back a little bit. but it was really across the board, honestly, like -- so those are a couple of just...
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yes. strong across the board, carlos hit all those right points. in particular, sbs really led the way, our downmarket really led the way in recovery during the course of the year. and in fact, danny, you can correct me if i'm wrong on this, but i believe sbs had their biggest q4 ever, including the retirement and insurance solutions.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and i wrote it down somewhere, but i can't find it. i think we had record q4 bookings in a number of different categories, but that also probably happens other years, too, where we have so many things, we're so broad that there's always a few bright spots. but honestly, compared to what we would have expected at the beginning of this year, to be saying we had record bookings in any business line is really good news.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
and just with regards to the new logos, in terms of if it wasn't moving to an outsourcing solution that was previously done in-house, was there any sort of commonality with regards to competitive takeaways and wins that you ended up seeing as a source?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
i mean i'd say that when i look at the -- what we call the balance of trade data, i would say that we -- again, i like to think we're doing a little bit better. we don't provide a lot of color and disclosure around that because i don't think it's helpful, and i'm not looking to pick a fight with any specific competitor. but i'd say that we're pleased with our progress, like the combination of stronger retention, which means we lose less to some of those competitors that you're talking about, and our strong bookings performance means we won more against some of those competitors.
i think if you probably paint the picture that there's probably a few competitors where our balance of trade improved, which it did, and admittedly, in some couple of competitors, it didn't, right? it stayed -- but i don't think there's really any place where we went backwards that i'm aware. i'm trying to think back. but i think the balance of trade situation, we're very focused on this. we're trying to become more focused on logos and units and more focused on our competitors because our competitors are focused on us, and we're sick and tired of it.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
understood. and then along those lines, you've made a number of product enhancements and you've highlighted a number of them, including in terms of workforce solutions, workforce planning, time and attendance and then, obviously, highlighting next gen payroll. just wondering, which ones do you think are going to have the greatest incremental contribution? i know it all leads to sales force productivity, but just which ones should we look for the greatest benefit from?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
well, that's a tough one because it's like picking your favorite child.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean i have a view. i think what we do from an investment perspective in ongoing kind of refresh and modernization and ux on all of our strategic platform is critical. and we're doing that all the time, and that's just critical to our ongoing satisfaction with our products, as we talked about earlier, and our nps scores. so that constant refresh from a u.s. ux perspective is really, really important. but carlos, you may have other things you want to...
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
no. i think that's well said because i'm excited about all of them. i think that the next gen payroll is -- literally could be the biggest mover in the last multiple decades for adp for us. but it really -- it's really workforce now and roll and other things that are in front of it that are ""visible"", right, because that's really just an engine. it's a gross to net engine. but the added flexibility that it provides and the process improvement that it provides in the back office could be a step change, game changer for adp in terms of our competitiveness and in terms of our efficiency.
but the truth is, and i state client-focused, i think kathleen is right, the most important thing the client sees is what they interact with, right? and i think that is mostly around the ux and our front-end solutions. so i think that's probably the right place to focus.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
great. just next gen payroll, what's the plan for this year in terms of percentage of workforce now that ends up getting converted or that should be on it?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
we're not really -- we're probably dabbling in a few conversions. that's really not our number one priority yet. we started kind of in the lower end of our mid-market to begin with, so -- and call it, the 50 to 150 is where we're really -- we call it core major accounts, kind of in the lower end of major accounts. and we're pretty happy, as you could tell from our tone and what we've talked about in the last couple of quarters, with our progress there. and we have a plan. i don't think it's really great for us to share it because i think competitors listen to these calls, too.
but we have a very methodical plan to eventually get to 100% of our core sales being on next gen payroll, while at the same time then gradually moving into the other parts of major accounts, call it, the 150 to 1,000 and then selling 100% of those clients onto next gen payroll. and then as we're going along, we will start some conversions. but it's not a huge priority because, again, remember, workforce now is the front end on both of these. and this is all intended to be transparent. this is not one of those migrations that you heard about five, seven years ago at adp where we disrupt everything.
and the clients are going to see very little change other than some enhancements in terms of self-service capabilities and other things that, obviously, we think are going to be net positives from both a selling and a client retention standpoint. but generally speaking, their experience will not change in a significant way.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
terrific. congratulations
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. this concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. i am pleased to hand the program over to carlos rodriguez for closing remarks.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
well, thanks. i appreciate everybody joining the call today. i think in the prepared comments, we talked about what a year this has been. i'm sure every company has the same view in terms of the challenges that they faced. but i'm just incredibly grateful to our associates for what they did, first and foremost, for our clients. when the chips were down, we really delivered. it started obviously in the fourth quarter of last year with all the government regulation changes that needed to be put in place and the huge volume of inquiries we were getting about ppp loans, etc., but it really continued into this fiscal year as well.
and it was just an incredibly challenging environment while people have personal challenges, right, including health challenges in their family. and so, again, i'm just -- i just look back to we're a mission-driven company and you can see it in the culture. and i'm grateful for my predecessors and the culture that was built over all these decades that allowed us to -- it wasn't without incident and it wasn't easy, but we really got through it. i think we delivered for our clients. we delivered for the economy because we are a mission-critical service in the economy, and i just couldn't be prouder of our associates, including our back-office associates to support our frontline associates as well as our sales force who, as we talked about a lot today, continue to plow through and allow us to continue to grow our business despite where unprecedented headwinds.
so -- but first and foremost, i'm just so glad that despite, obviously, we have some short-term challenges here with the new delta variant and so forth, but i mean, clearly, we're heading in the right direction and we're very optimistic both for ourselves, for our families and for our associates and for our clients, and we look forward to better times ahead here over the next couple of quarters where inevitably, we'll have some ups and downs and some challenges here and there, but it's great that everything is on the right track, at least in the united states.
and we're hoping that other parts of the world follow closely behind given that we have a very significant business in europe, asia and latin america as well. and we appreciate your interest in adp and your support, and thank you for tuning in today.

operator
good morning. my name is sarah, and i will be your conference operator. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to mr. danyal hussain, vice president, investor relations. please go ahead.
danyal hussain -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, sarah. and welcome, everyone, to adp's fourth quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. participating today are carlos rodriguez, our president and ceo; and kathleen winters, our cfo. earlier this morning, we released our results for the fourth quarter and full year. our earnings materials are available on the sec's website and our investor relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call. during our call, we will reference non-gaap financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. a description of these items, along with a reconciliation of non-gaap measures to their most comparable gaap measures, can be found in our earnings release. today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. we encourage you to review our filings with the sec for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.
i'd also like to share that we intend to host our investor day on november 15. at this time, we're planning to keep it virtual for most of our attendees. but given positive reopening trends, we do have capacity here in our roseland, new jersey headquarters to host our sell-side analysts live, and we look forward to seeing our analyst community in person soon.
with that, let me turn it over to carlos.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, danny, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. we reported very strong fourth quarter results, including 11% revenue growth and 5% adjusted diluted eps growth, capping a year in which revenue and margin outperformed our expectations in every quarter. for the full year, we delivered 3% revenue growth, the high end of our guidance range. and i'm happy to say we reached $15 billion in revenue, a big milestone for the company. as we've discussed all year, we took a consistent approach to investing this year while also prudently managing expenses. as a result, our adjusted ebit margin was down only slightly, and we were able to deliver 2% adjusted diluted eps growth for the year, ahead of our guidance and well ahead of our expectations at the start of the year. i'll first cover some highlights from the quarter.
our new business bookings results were very strong, and our momentum in the market continues to build. compared to last year's fourth quarter, we grew our employer services new business bookings by 174%, which was slightly ahead of our expectations. and for the full year, we delivered 23% growth in es bookings, toward the higher end of our guidance. we are very pleased with this outcome from our sales team, which booked $1.5 billion in new business in a year with a high degree of economic uncertainty. this full year es bookings performance represented an average quota carrier productivity level of roughly 90% of our fiscal 2019 pre-pandemic levels when we delivered $1.6 billion in es bookings. and our sales productivity continued to trend favorably in q4. at this point, most of our u.s. peo quota carriers have conducted some in-person meetings, and we expect that to keep trending positively as our clients and prospects show increasing preference for doing so.
we also reopened additional sales offices in this quarter, and our current plan is to have most of our major u.s. sales offices back open by the end of september. our retention was likewise an area of very strong performance with better-than-expected fourth quarter results. our es segment experienced a full year increase of 170 basis points to a record 92.2% retention. our peo segment also experienced record retention for the year. and as we've seen all year long, client satisfaction remained incredibly high. kathleen will share how we have approached our assumptions for next year's retention, but in q4, the trends remained strong. in addition to impressive retention performance, our peo continued to benefit from the overall resilience of our client base. and in the quarter, we had 12% revenue growth, driving us to 7% full year growth, which was ahead of our expectations and guidance.
this was a result of record retention as well as stronger hiring and payroll trends within our peo, which we believe reflects the very high quality of our client base. and our es pays-per-control turned positive in the quarter with 8% growth. this was in line with our expectations, and we continue to see some gradual rehiring amid what seems like a supply constrained labor market. for the full year, we ended up rounding to negative 3% pays-per-control growth, right in the middle of our guidance range and the assumption that we held all year long. during the quarter, we also continued to advance our market-leading solutions and achieved some new milestones i'd like to highlight. i'm excited to announce that this quarter, we launched and began rolling out a new user experience for run, representing the most comprehensive refresh we've done since its launch. run is already the leading solution in the market with 750,000 clients that use it to help with payroll, time, hr, insurance, retirement and other means.
it's a powerful hcm product, and we look forward to maintaining its positive momentum. we're also looking forward to rolling out similar ux refreshes on our other major platforms in the near future. this year, we also made a number of enhancements to our workforce management solutions. workforce management, which includes time, attendance and scheduling offerings, represents one of the most critical parts of our hcm suite. this year, we launched timekeeping plus scheduling, an entirely new native solution for the run platform. and for our workforce now platform, we rolled out advanced scheduling, enabling clients to perform more complex workforce management tasks such as skills-based scheduling.
i'm also proud to share that this quarter, we reached 100,000 workforce management clients for the first time as the pandemic reinforced the need for robust workforce management solutions for our clients while they navigate the new norm of increasingly flexible schedules and work arrangements. our suite of hro solutions also continued to deliver steady growth for us this year. i already mentioned the strength in our peo business, which had its average worksite employee count grow to 616,000, up 12% from last year's count and which now serves 14,500 businesses. and in addition to these employees covered by our peo, we have over two million client employees on our other hro solutions within our employer services segment where we've seen robust demand all year long as clients look for ways to outsource parts of their hr function to a best-in-class provider like adp.
also, this quarter, we enhanced our return to workplace suite by adding a vaccination status tracker, allowing our clients to easily assess and track vaccinations within their workforces to facilitate planning decisions. our clients continue to appreciate the efforts we've made to help them navigate the pandemic. and our next gen agenda continued to progress nicely. our next gen hcm platform continues to deliver competitive takeaways in the market. during the quarter, we also expanded our global footprint by going live in ireland. and in the u.s., we are quickly adding to our implementation capacity for our pipeline of sold clients. for next gen payroll, we've now sold over 1,000 next gen payroll clients on workforce now. and roll by adp, which also utilizes our next gen payroll engine, is off to a great start where we are running ahead of our expectations so far as we drive micro businesses to this mobile-first solution.
and as a final highlight, we ended the year with over 920,000 clients, up 7% from the 860,000 we had a year ago and no doubt supported by these continuous improvements we've been making to our product portfolio. i have to say that fiscal 2021 stood out as one of the most challenging years in adp's history, and i'm very proud of how we executed. it's hard to overstate the amount of effort took across the organization to quickly adopt and manage through the pandemic while providing excellent service to our clients. and in the end, our organization and financial results both demonstrated the extraordinary resilience that is expected from us. as we look ahead to fiscal 2022 and beyond, our focus is on reaccelerating our growth through an intense focus on market-leading innovation, further simplification of our product portfolio, continued digital transformation and an unwavering commitment to best-in-class service.
and with that, i'll now turn the call over to kathleen for more detail on the quarter and outlook.
kathleen winters -- chief financial officer
thank you, carlos, and good morning, everyone. our fourth quarter represented a strong close to the year with 11% revenue growth on a reported basis and 9% growth on an organic constant currency basis, solidly ahead of our expectations. our adjusted ebit margin was down 120 basis points, better than expected. and as a reminder, we did have some comparison pressure versus last year's lower selling and incentive compensation expenses that drove the comparative decline. our 5% adjusted diluted eps growth was strong and in addition to the revenue and margin performance, benefited from share repurchases. for our employer services segment, revenues increased 10% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic constant currency basis as we lapped last year's pandemic-affected q4. we continued to see contributions from excellent retention, strong new business bookings and growth in pays-per-control, offset by lower client funds interest.
es margin was down 90 basis points due primarily to higher selling and incentive compensation expenses versus the prior year. our peo also had another very strong quarter. average worksite employees increased to 616,000, up 12% on a year-over-year basis on both continued retention outperformance and contribution from solid employment growth. our peo revenue grew 12%, an impressive performance as we once again benefited from higher payroll per wse as well as stronger workers' comp and sui revenue per wse compared to the prior year, partially offset by lower growth in 0 margin pass-throughs. peo margin was up 340 basis points in the quarter due to an elevated workers' compensation reserve true-up last year. we are very pleased with our strong finish to the year. for fiscal 2021, a year heavily impacted by a pandemic, we drove strong bookings growth, solid 3% revenue growth, delivered positive eps growth and continued to invest for sustainable growth and digital transformation.
i'll turn now to our outlook for fiscal 2022. beginning with es segment revenues, we expect growth of 4% to 6%, and this outlook is a product of several underlying assumptions. we expect our es new business bookings growth to be 10% to 15%. this strong growth would be driven by two factors: sales headcount growth, which we typically aim to do; and benefits from continuing recovery in sales productivity as we trend back to and surpass pre-pandemic levels by the back half of the year. please note, beginning this year, we will no longer be reporting our employer services new business bookings growth on a quarterly basis. instead, we will focus on our full year bookings growth, which better normalizes for the inherent variability in this metric. this also aligns to how we focus internally on bookings trends over a full year period.
we'll, of course, continue to update the full year bookings guidance quarterly. and as we do so, we'll continue to provide color on our quarterly es bookings performance. we believe our annual bookings disclosure and guidance remains an industry best practice. moving on to es retention. we are not yet seeing any specific indications from our clients that we should expect an increase in switching behavior. however, we believe it is prudent planning to expect that a portion of the retention gains we saw over fiscal 2021 will reverse as companies reopen and reengage in the marketplace. for the purpose of our outlook, our initial assumption is that we'll experience a decline of about 75 basis points for the year, representing just under half of last year's improvement. if this proves out, our resulting fiscal 2022 retention rate would still be a record compared to pre-pandemic levels.
but as i think we all can appreciate, there is still uncertainty in this environment given the unusual year we just experienced, and we believe this to be a prudent middle-of-the-road assumption to make. we will update you in the quarters ahead as we gain further visibility, particularly during the calendar year-end period where we've historically seen the most switching. our pays-per-control outlook for fiscal 2022 is for 4% to 5% growth and above normal growth rate that assumes a continued gradual recovery in the overall labor market. labor markets appear to be tight at the moment, but we do expect overall employment to continue trending in a favorable direction from where we are today. and then for our client funds interest revenue, most of which sits in the es segment, we expect some modest pressure. the interest rate environment remains favorable to what we were experiencing earlier -- in the earlier part of the pandemic.
but we are still expecting to reinvest at lower yields than what we are earning on securities that are maturing this coming year. we are also providing for the first time an added disclosure for our expected average yield on new purchases for the remainder of the fiscal year, which we believe to be useful for you in understanding the direction our average portfolio yield is headed as the portfolio turns over. currently, that expectation is for a 1% yield on new purchases. all this said, we are expecting balanced growth of 8% to 10% and an average yield of 1.4% versus 1.5% last year. together, this would net us $405 million to $415 million in client funds interest revenue for fiscal 2022. for our es margin, we expect an increase of 50 to 75 basis points, and there are a few factors considered in this outlook.
as a starting point, we are benefiting more fully from operating leverage in fiscal 2022 than we did last year while also recognizing higher sales expenses and continuing our steady investment in product, implementation and service. additionally, we expect incremental margin benefit from the continuation of our digital and other transformation initiatives in fiscal 2022 as we continue to increase the utilization of digital tools to improve efficiencies throughout the organization. however, the benefit from our transformation initiatives is expected to be largely offset by a year-over-year increase in facilities and other return-to-office expenses as well as higher t&e expenses. moving on to the peo segment. we expect peo revenues to grow 9% to 11% and peo revenues excluding 0 margin pass-through to grow 10% to 12%.
the primary driver for our peo revenue growth is our outlook for average worksite employee growth of 9% to 11%. we expect peo margin to be down 25 to 75 basis points in fiscal 2022 compared to the very strong margin results in fiscal 2021. this is driven partly by an assumption for stronger sales growth and associated selling expenses. putting it together, our consolidated revenue outlook is for 6% to 7% growth in fiscal 2022, and our adjusted ebit margin outlook is for expansion of 25 to 50 basis points. at this time, because of some comparison differences in the prior year, we expect the first quarter to have revenue growth just above the guidance range with the remaining three quarters in the range. we expect adjusted ebit margin flat to down slightly in the first half, with most of the margin expansion coming in the later part of the year.
we expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 to improve very slightly to about 22.5% next year, assuming no change in the corporate tax rate. our outlook also reflects the impact of additional corporate interest expense. during our fourth quarter, we enhanced our capital structure by issuing $1 billion in 7-year notes, the proceeds of which we're planning to use for additional accretive share repurchases over the coming quarters. this added about $3 million in interest expense in fiscal 2021 with a full run rate of about $18 million in fiscal 2022. at the same time, we're also contemplating further reduction in our share count beyond the typical level we would have expected to achieve driven by these incremental share repurchases. net of this higher interest expense, lower tax rate and additional share repurchases, we expect growth in adjusted diluted eps of 9% to 11%.
as we enter fiscal year 2022, despite the continuing challenges around the pandemic, we are very encouraged by the signs of a continued recovery in the global economy as well as the ongoing secular growth trends in hcm. as the world of work evolves, we believe we are very well positioned to continue adding value for our clients and differentiating ourselves in the market. we look forward to updating you on our progress.
i'll now turn it back over to the operator for q&a.

[operator instructions] we will take our first question from the line of samad samana with jefferies. your line is open.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. congrats on the really strong start to the new fiscal year. so, carlos, maybe, i want to unpack the drivers of the strength on the new bookings side. i know productivity is clearly one, but how should we think about the product side and within the product portfolio, where that strength was in terms of driving new bookings?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
so, even though what we really talk about is es bookings, i just want to start off by saying that the peo bookings were incredibly strong. i don't know how else to put it, so kind of, call it, orders of magnitude in terms of growth rate higher than even es bookings growth for the quarter. so that was really good to see. so that kind of assigned -- to your question about products, that i think the market is really searching for solutions coming out of this pandemic that help them with, obviously, people issues and so on, but there's also a talent crunch. so people are looking to obviously attract and retain people in this environment, where every company, including adp, is going through some of these challenges in terms of attracting our own internal talent.
and then you have another dynamic, which is, if there are shortages of labor in various categories there -- we're hearing that there's also shortages of talent in kind of the hcm category in general, that should create a little bit of an advantage for the critical outsourcers. right? so, as you know our model is we provide great technology and software, but we also do the back office work and we take accountability for outcomes. and i think when people are struggling to hire people to do the work in their hr department or their payroll department or their benefits department, we're here to help. and so i think those outsourcing solutions are getting a lot of tailwind.
we also saw, because of the easy comps, and i think you've heard it in don's comments, some of the things like our recruitment process, outsourcing business and our screening and selection business, which were really at very low bookings levels last year at the same time, have rebounded for obvious reasons incredibly well. but having said that, it was really across the board. we had very strong growth in workforce now. we had very strong growth in the upmarket. we had strong growth even in the downmarket, although last year at the same time, i think we mentioned that we had, what we call, client-based acquisitions, not technically an m&a deal but we were able to buy large book of business that we converted, that really some of that flowed through our bookings. so it made that comparison a little harder on the sbs side. but if you back that out, it was equally strong on the sbs side as well.
so i would say that, like, that could give you a little bit of color, but it really was across the board. it just shows how connected we are to the economy and to gdp when it comes to bookings, which is something that we've had as a theory here for some years now and we just have a very strong recovery in a very strong economy and it's a great environment for our sales force.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
that's very helpful. and then don, maybe one for you on the retention side. so, obviously, it's really impactful and to raise the outlook one quarter in, i think, signals the strength that you're seeing. but just help me unpack the slight uptick in the smb side moving a little bit more toward normal in terms of business failure. should we think that, that -- the offset there is even better than expected retention in the midmarket or on the enterprise side? can you maybe help us think about it across the customer size spectrum, how to balance those different moving parts?
don mcguire -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure. i think it's fair to say and we commented on it that the retention is at an all-time record for a q1. so that's fantastic and better than we had expected. the expectation as we went into the year was to see, particularly in the smaller business segment, to see that slip back a little and indeed it has, but it hasn't slipped back nearly to the extent that we had anticipated. so we're even better there against what we had previously thought. of course, then that means that we did have and continue to have good retention levels in the midmarket and the upmarket. so we expect that to continue.
however, as you know the cyclicality of our business and the seasonality of our business, we will need to get through the calendar year end, which is when we see most of the switching activity because of the drivers in the new starts to the year, etc. so we are positive and we did take our retention estimate up for the year and we'll see if it holds and perhaps is better than we expected.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great, thanks, gentlemen. look forward to seeing you at the analyst day in person in a few weeks.

our next question comes from jason kupferberg with bank of america. please proceed.
mihir bhatia -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. this is actually mihir bhatia on for jason. don, firstly, congratulations on the role. maybe you can talk a little bit about your priorities in the cfo role and how they could maybe look a little different than under kathleen. and then just relatedly, should we expect an update to multi-year targets at next year's analyst day? and then i have a follow-up. thank you.
don mcguire -- chief financial officer
yeah, so i guess what i would say is i've been with adp for a long time now. and i guess what i've observed in the roughly 23 years i've been with this company is that adp has always had a very strong financial organization with a strong finance leader and i want to make sure that we continue that. and so i'm sure we will. i think that the priorities that we have are well set out in our strat plan in previous investor days, etc. so we'll probably provide everyone with an update on those things when we get together on november 15. but let's wait till then. and i don't think you're going to see any dramatic changes. we pretty much have a well-discussed and well-disclosed trajectory and plan, and we will update you on that on november 15.
mihir bhatia -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
understood. thank you. and then, just if i could ask about just your sales force spend, just clearly seeing some very strong momentum in the market. so i was wondering if you have any plans for sales force growth in fiscal 2022 and which part of the market those adds would be concentrated in? also anything notable to call out in terms of just the mix of new logos versus cross-sells in your bookings for the quarter or in the forecast? thank you.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
i think in this kind of environment, given the very first comments we made about the economy and you have both the economy as a tailwind and you have now, in the u.s., i think an administration that is kind of more inclined to regulation and to particularly employer regulation. and so you have, i think, a very strong backdrop for what i would say is the foreseeable future. in that environment, historically what adp would do is, we would add as much sales capacity as possible. that doesn't mean that we indiscriminately hire because we've got people to hire and onboard and train and so forth and we have to make those people effective. but i would say that we have a strong appetite for growing our sales force, but also for growing our investment in marketing, whether it's digital marketing or more traditional advertising. and that's exactly what we plan to do.
having said that, i would tell you that we've had challenges, i think, like everyone else in terms of hiring. it's a very difficult labor market. so i hope that we can fulfill those expectations or those dreams, if you will, of growing our sales force as fast as possible, but that's the only thing that i could see getting in the way. we obviously have the capital, we have the -- i think the desire and we have, i think, the experience to be able to execute once we hire those people to get the sales, get the clients implemented and then hopefully derive the benefits of that revenue for, in many cases, 15, 20 years depending on which business unit we're in. so i guess i would say, strong appetite for both headcount growth but also other investments in sales, whether it's marketing, digital marketing, sales tools, all across the board.
mihir bhatia -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst

and next question comes from tien-tsin huang with j.p. morgan. your line is open.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, thanks so much. good results here. just on the peo side, i'm curious, how much of the general improvement there is secular versus cyclical. and i know, carlos, you talked about putting more sales energy there as well. so just curious what's changed.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
so, at the risk of -- because i think it's -- we had a strong feeling that the peo business was going to be strong coming out of this pandemic. it has been strong coming out of prior critical recessions, and this was a different recession. so i have to be careful about any specific predictions but we had some challenges, i think, coming out of the pandemic with -- the price that we were selling in the peo were slightly smaller and just ballparked at around 10% smaller. so let's say that the average -- i'm just going to make up the numbers, let's say, the average new clients [technical issues] in the peo was 30 worksite employees, and all of a sudden, prior to the pandemic -- and that's been ""growing"" slightly over the years, all of a sudden, it came down to like 27. so a 10% decline. so even if you sell 10% more units, if the units are 10% smaller, you basically end up in the same place. so that's a little bit of what we were expecting. we believe that's 100% related to the economy and to what was happening with the pandemic.
now, what we've seen in the recovery is both the unit growth is still strong as it was prior year and now our unit size has recovered. and so the combination of those two things has created really, really strong growth in the first quarter in the peo. the only caveat that i would add also is that we did have a kind of a transition into a new year, as you know, our fiscal year ended on june 30 and in some cases, our businesses tend to perform really extremely well in the first quarter when they come out of a year where -- i wouldn't call it underperformance, because it was still a good year last year, given the circumstances, but clearly the peo, we were very, i think, clear that the peo had been trailing in terms of recovery when it comes to bookings, what we were seeing in es and now -- and we expected. the horse race now -- the horse and the lead has changed. so now the peo is the one leading the race.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good color. thank you, carlos.
operator
our next question comes from kevin mcveigh with credit suisse. your line is open.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great, thank you and congrats on the results, and don, welcome. hey, i wondered could you give us a sense, carlos, from a sales perspective, despite the tight environment, you're still delivering, is there any way to think about the go-to-market strategy this cycle as opposed to last and how maybe technology and maybe more of a mixed downmarket helps drive that process? i guess what i'm saying is, is there more leverage in the sales force today than you've ever had and is there any way to maybe put some parameters around that?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
i think there is definitely more leverage in the sales force than we've ever had because, i mean, i think maybe what you're alluding to, our sales force, like a lot of other of our competitors, had to go to 100% virtual for a number of months and i'm sure every competitor handle it differently in terms of how long they were virtual versus when they went back in the field. but that process, which we had been learning about for 20, 25 years, like, we had almost a third of our sales force already selling, what we call, inside sales, so they were able to sell virtually. they had been in a building, but it didn't really matter whether they were in a building or in their homes, they were still able to sell very effectively. so that was an easy transition for that portion of our sales force. and then we -- really with the appropriate tools and some training and some learning from our inside sales force, we really moved our entire sales force to sell virtually.
so i'd say now, we're really in a period where we're going to sell based on however the client wants to be sold. and so, if the client wants a combination of an initial video call on zoom or webex, we'll do that. if the client wants an in-person visit, we'll do that. if they want to close the deal with an in-person, but start with a video, we can do that. so i think there's no question that the sales force leverage has increased for us. but admittedly, probably, for our our competitors as well, our reach has definitely been extended. there is no question about that in terms of tools, but also philosophically. i think our -- we are now, i think, able to sell in a -- i mean, to use a cliche, an omnichannel way. we're also investing heavily in digital marketing.
so, you mentioned the downmarket, i would just add that because of some of the comparisons that the downmarket had, that was not what drove the sales results this quarter. it was actually all the other businesses. so -- but we do see the underlying strength in small business, but because of the difficult comparison, it's not reflected in the percentages, so not trying to minimize the strength in the momentum in the downmarket, i'm trying to emphasize the strength everywhere else in the portfolio. and the rest of the portfolio also can benefit from digital tools, digital marketing. but it's not quite as leveraged as it is in the downmarket.
so i think it's a combination of a lot of different things, but the overall, i think, comment would be, there is no question that there is increased leverage in the sales force and you're seeing it in terms of the productivity numbers. i mean, we are frankly very positively surprised by the rebound in kind of, what we call, average sales force productivity. so the actual sales rep level, how much are they selling today versus what were they selling in fiscal year '19 and that is back to and above that level, which is very, very pleasing to us.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
that's helpful. and then just one real quick one on retention. what -- was the boost kind of all q1 overperformance? because i know the q2 december is a big quarter in terms of retention and things like that. or is it just more optimism over the balance of the year or a little of both? is there any way to frame how much of that boost was maybe q1 overperformance as opposed to how you're feeling over the balance of the year?
don mcguire -- chief financial officer
yeah, maybe i'll take that. i think our retention -- certainly, we're very happy with the q1 record we have, but i think it's also heavily linked to the success we've had over the last few years with our improvements in nps. and as our nps continues to go in the right direction and improve, we're seeing general increases in retention to go along with that. i think that's what we would expect and that's what we want to see happen. so i think there is some relationship there. the -- but no doubt that the retention is very good and we're benefiting still, i think, from a little bit of some of the concerns coming out of the pandemic that clients may have about switching during a time of still virtual for many. so we're benefiting from that as well and we acknowledge that.
but as i said, we're very happy with the retention and the progress we're making with our products and our service that go along to driving those retention numbers. we will see a little bit of a step back, perhaps, in the downmarket, but as we said so far, it's serving up better than we expected.
danyal hussain -- vice president of investor relations
hey, kevin, it's danny. and just to clarify, because we did share in our prepared remarks, that the raise was primarily a function of the q1 results. obviously, we had visibility into october as well.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
that makes sense. thank you.

our next question comes from ramsey el-assal with barclays. your line is open.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
hi, gentlemen. thanks for taking my call this morning. i wanted to ask about margins. and forgive me if you addressed this in some detail, i missed a bit of the call earlier. but it -- they came in really strong this quarter, well above our model. can you speak to the drivers of the beat and also to their sustainability as we move forward?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
sure. let me start off by saying that the margin in the first quarter was a record for us and it was above last year as we just reported. but if you go back to last year, last year was above the prior year and so it's quite impressive that we had margin improvement last year, given that we were one quarter into a pandemic, but it's even more impressive that we had margin improvement again. having said that, that's the victory lap. so then, the other part of the comment is we had way higher revenue than we had anticipated, which is incredibly gratifying and we're very happy about that and it was really in both es and peo. and it was in a bunch of different places, slightly better pays-per-control, retention was better. you heard all the comments. we have just a lot of things working in our favor here.
the expenses have not caught up to the revenues. and so right now we are trying to add capacity, both for implementation and service, particularly ahead of our year-end period. and so, like other companies, the most important thing for us is to be able to execute on our commitments to our clients and to be able to start all the business that we've sold. and so i would say that that's a dynamic that's factored into the margin performance. but i don't want to take anything away from the organization or anything away from the operating leverage because it's pretty impressive, what the organization was able to accomplish. but, had we known where we were going to be in terms of topline and volumes, we would have more headcount today than we have. and there is some catching up to do.
now to put a fine point on that, don't think of, we have to add hundreds of millions of dollars of expense, we're just a little bit behind and that's why you see [indecipherable] some of that yet, i may as well address it head on, that for the rest of the year, when you look at the eps in the guidance, we really are not raising by much more than what we had in terms of our performance in q1. and that's because we are going to continue to invest in both sales and distribution, but also in service and implementation and that delay in hiring or deferred hiring helped us in terms of the margin in the first quarter. i strongly believe we still would have had a very strong margin performance in the first quarter even had we hit our headcount numbers for service, implementation and volume-related businesses. but i thought i should kind of put that out there, because it seems like an obvious question as well.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
that's great. and i appreciate your candor there. a quick follow-up for me. i was wondering about the human resources and human capital management products. can you talk about how the cross-selling process into your base of kind of payroll customers is organized? i'm just trying to figure out sort of how you go about that cross-sell process. and i guess, how much of a runway do you see for attach rates with those products?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
there really isn't a simple answer to that -- to the first part. i mean, we'll come back to the, i think, the second question about the attach rates. let me answer that one first. the attach rates are -- there's a couple of products that we have, what i would call, good attach rates; acceptable, i should say, it's a ceo speak for, they could always be higher, like our benefits admin tools, our time and attendance systems. but most of our products and our workers' compensation tool in the downmarket also has a high attach rate. but almost everything else that is ""beyond"" payroll, so hcm, in addition to kind of our core payroll solutions, we're way under-penetrated in terms of attach rate. so there is a lot of potential, i think, for that to improve as well.
so on the first part of your question, in terms of how we cross-sell, as i started saying, there isn't a simple answer, because there isn't a simple answer. in some of our businesses, we have very distinct organizations, like in the downmarket we have a large downmarket sales force that works with accountants and other kind of third-party channels and also sells directly, and then we have a sales force that sells our retirement solutions, our 401(k) product and our insurance services solution. those are distinct sales forces that basically share leads with each other and they have incentives to do so. that downmarket business also feeds business to our peo through also incentives. but there is a separate and distinct sales force in the peo as well.
when you get into the upmarket and then into the midmarket, you start to get some portion of our sales force, which is able to sell multiple products or, what i would call, bundles. but even then, you still have specialized sales forces in certain circumstances depending on, i think, the specialization or the complexity of the product. but in all cases, we have primary sales -- what i would call, primary salespeople, so the quarterback, if you will, on an account. now i'm talking about upmarket and midmarket and those quarterbacks are really in charge of making sure that when it's appropriate and when a client has a need, that we bring in our specialized sales people that have specific knowledge about some of our other hcm solution.
so i wish it were -- i wish i could give you a simple answer, but that's actually part of the secret sauce, right, in terms of our ability to grow and outperform some of our competitors is to be able to do that well. and i'd like to say that i invented this, but this is something that goes all the way back to the frank lautenberg days and to my predecessors gary, art and josh and this is a well-oiled machine in terms of our sales and distribution, and specifically on what you just described about the cross sell. and to, again, put a fine point on it, roughly 50% of our bookings come from cross-sell and roughly 50% of our bookings come from new logos each year.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
very helpful. appreciate it. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from kartik mehta with northcoast research. your line is open.
kartik mehta -- northcoast research -- analyst
carlos, i just wanted to get your thoughts. you've talked obviously a lot about new sales. and i'm wondering, outside of this wage inflation that you're seeing, is the cost to acquire clients going down, especially on the smb side now that there is a new way to sell to them? or do you think the cost to acquire clients as we move through this pandemic will go back to what it was?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
i wish i had a crystal ball in terms of answering where it's going to go, but i think just from a mathematical or technical standpoint, the cost to sell [phonetic] is definitely going down because of this productivity increase. right? so this is the same leverage that you're seeing in so many industries and so many businesses, including ours and the revenue happens on the bookings as well. right? when you get higher volumes, it basically indicates higher -- i mean, unless you add a lot of expense, by definition, you get higher productivity. so you see this being reported in the press all the time about how worker productivity is up. well, part of the reason why worker productivity is up is because revenues have recovered, volumes have recovered, and it's the same people, right, or you're adding a few more people. now, what maybe people aren't focusing on, is that worker productivity went down, right, as the pandemic kind of set in and people's revenues went down.
so i mean, i hate to make it so simplistic mathematically, but some of that is what's happening now. so you do have to be careful about jumping to any medium to long-term conclusions because right now, our cost to sell compared to last year and the year before is definitely coming down as a result of a very large increase in bookings, without a similar increase in expenses. we still, though, are not back to where our cost to sell was pre-pandemic and we hope to get there but that will require even a little bit more productivity during this year, but that would be -- our expectation is that whether it's the gdp or interest rates or employment, there's a regression to the mean here, it's a very large economy, adp is a large company, but the economy is massive and it tends to regress to the mean on a lot of things and we also tend to regress to the mean. so i think some of these things will work themselves out and then you have to just get past the base effect from the comparisons and so forth to really understand where you are and we won't know that until we're on the other side, unfortunately, i hate to say.
kartik mehta -- northcoast research -- analyst

james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah. thank you very much and thanks for all the color this morning. i guess maybe i want to ask the obvious headline question and i'm just wondering how the reported current tightness in the labor market is factored into your guidance and how are you anticipating that, that changes through the coming fiscal year. and i guess maybe a product and service-related question tied to that, are you seeing incremental sales opportunities with some of the tech that you can provide to your clients for hiring, etc.? and is that having any impact on how you're thinking about your outlook and forecast? thanks.

thanks for the question. the second part of your question, i think, kind of answers the first part. the answer is yes. like, i think, part -- again, part and separate how much is just pure gdp growth, new business formation, etc. but the last part of your question, there is no question that part of our growth is driven by what you are alluding to, which is everyone now is looking for help in terms of hiring, attracting people and frankly also trying to hold on to them. this is a great environment for us. the combination of strong gdp and an administration that is more inclined toward regulation and then a tight labor market for people who do the things that we do. by that, i mean payroll staff and hr staff prospects in our clients, that's all a very good backdrop for us.
so i'm assuming that this is not going to resolve itself overnight in terms of the tightness in the labor market. so we should anticipate some tailwinds here and some help for some period of time until that changes, and i hate to use the r word, but some day, at some point in the future, it doesn't seem anywhere near future, given what's going on with government stimulus and government policy. but some day, that might change, but we don't see that on the horizon right now.
on the very first part of your question, though, in terms of the tight labor markets, i would say, the overwhelming impact of tight labor market is positive on adp. i mentioned one of the challenges we have, which is tight labor market affects our own internal associates in terms of, we have to hire service people, implementation people, so it's harder for us, like it is harder for anyone else. but that pales in comparison to the upsides, like a tight labor market drive new bookings, as we just talked about to the last part of your question, but it also could create inflationary pressures, which drives our balanced growth. it should drive interest rates higher, which is one of the most under-appreciated stories, i think, of adp is the potential upside in our flow [phonetic] business.
and the reason it's underestimated is because there's been nothing for 10 years. because i've been here for 10 years and there's been nothing but pain and headwind and just when i thought we were coming out of it, we go into a pandemic. and we have more pain and rates go even lower than they were before. but i'm pretty sure they're not going any lower now, although, i think we may have to file an 8-k after saying that. right? i'm making a statement on interest rates, but they may -- whatever, hover around here, go down a little bit there. but it feels pretty certain that the long-term -- medium and long-term trend now for interest rates will be at least for gradual increases. and i'm not suggesting that -- there's still underlying demographics that may keep us from getting back to the same kind of 10-year rate that we had 15 years ago or 10 years ago, but i think everyone knows when you look at real interest rates that there is upside on interest rate.
so the tight labor market helps in a number of ways. it creates activity for our sales force. every time there is activity in those conversations, we're going to win our fair share. so that's a great backdrop. it creates opportunities for our balances. i think it creates opportunities for the peo because some of our billings are actually driven by -- as a percentage of wages and whenever you have wage inflation, if you're billing on percent of wages, to some extent, that will help. that's not like an infinite thing because we won't just allow our revenue to go up indefinitely. we'd have to adjust those rates, but in the medium term, we will see, i think, some tailwind from -- in the peo from higher wages and wage growth, which is an inevitable outcome of a tight labor market.

our next question comes from bryan bergin with cowen. your line is open.
bryan bergin -- cowen -- analyst
hi, good morning. thank you. i had a follow-up first on retention. curious, within the record 1q retention performance, can you just dig in a little bit more as far as the drivers there between the still lower out-of-business closures versus potentially better competitive win rates? and anything broadly, you can comment on around client switching behavior or client reengagement to assess hcm solutions?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
on the first part, i'm not sure how much more color we could give you. we have a fair amount of detail in terms of losses in retention around what we call non-controllable losses which are, broadly speaking, out-of-business, bankruptcies, etc. and those have started to trend back up again, they're not back to normal levels, but they started to trend back. i think that's not surprising because there's still a lot of liquidity and a lot of stimulus, if you will, even if it's not new stimulus. so when you have consumer spending doing what it's doing, and you have activity doing what it's doing, it tends to be supportive of small businesses, rather than the normal turnover that you have that's natural in the small business sector. so i guess with hindsight, like, if three or six months ago when we were putting together our plan, we had a crystal ball, we would have probably -- and we had experience with the pandemic, we probably would have planned the downturn in retention to be slower. so we've been positively surprised by how long it's taking for those losses to regress back to normal.
having said that, we don't know that they're going to regress 100% back to normal because there is other parts of our retention that are controllable. we call it controllable. and in our controllable losses, we see those going down as well. and i think don made a comment that it should not be lost on you, which is that, our client satisfaction scores as measured by nps are the highest they've ever been, and i give credit to the organization for, during the pandemic, being able to get through what was an incredibly difficult time for them personally in terms of they were trying to help our clients. we also had a huge increase in volume because of all the government stimulus programs and the ppp loans, etc. and this happened all over the world, it wasn't just in the u.s.
and fortunately, we maintained relative stability in our headcount. we didn't do mass layoffs and let a bunch of people go. so the combination of maintaining investment and also being able to have people -- i don't know how to describe it, but made heroic efforts to help our clients, we were able to maintain those nps scores and actually have them go up and they're staying at very strong levels and we believe that there is a correlation between strong nps and retention. so we may be able to see kind of new record highs for retention on a permanent basis. but it's way too early to make that prediction.
bryan bergin -- cowen -- analyst
okay. and then just follow-up on next-gen hcm platform. can you provide an update on new sales there and to the pipeline of sold clients versus live clients? any metrics or updates you're willing to share?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
sure. i think we talked about over the last couple of quarters, as we kind of entered into the pandemic, we obviously had a couple of particularly large clients that were in industries that were particularly hard hit. so we got thrown a little bit off course, if you will, in terms of our implementations and our starts. we also, i think, started to focus on implementation tools. i think we had -- i don't know how many we said we had sold and as we started implementing and starting these clients, we recognized that we still had some work to do in terms of implementation tools and making sure that if and when we want to use third -party integrators to help us with that, that we need to build out those tools. so it's been quite a lot of focus on that effort and we feel good about it.
we actually -- i think we also talked about investments in the last quarter that we made to bring in some third parties to help us with the evaluation and, in some cases, the build of that to make sure that as we now kind of enter a -- hopefully a period of time, we can really accelerate the implementations and the growth and the starts of those clients. but it's fair to say, and i think we said in the last couple of quarters, that our focus turn more to making sure that we have a strong foundation and then we had the right implementation tools to be able to get the business started that we intend to have in the next year or two, which is hopefully quite a lot of business. and you'll hear more details about this when we get to our investor day on november 15.
bryan bergin -- cowen -- analyst
okay, thank you.

our next question comes from eugene simuni with moffettnathanson. your line is open.
eugene simuni -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
hi, thank you very much for taking my questions. i have just a couple on the peo, so i'll ask them upfront. one is, if you look broadly at your hro offerings of peo and non-peo, can you compare and contrast for us a little bit to kind of the peo solutions and the non-peo fully outsourced solutions? how are you seeing them growing relative to each other and to demand and are you seeing any switch in between clients who might be using that hro solution without benefits switching into the peo? so that will be the first.
and the second, i was just curious how you're positioning the peo franchise to really win market share in a post-pandemic environment, given the secular growth seems to be very favorable? but, but how do you actually make sure that adp wins share?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
so on the first question, i think i said it in my early comments that all of the hro solutions, the critical outsourcing solutions, are very, very strong across the board. right? upmarket -- because we have hro solutions in the upmarket, we have them in the midmarket and we have them in the downmarket. in the downmarket, we -- and in midmarket we have peo. we also have what you're alluding to, which is a non-core employment, what i would call -- we call it comprehensive services. as the name implies, it provides a kind of broader assortment of services in addition to our traditional software and our traditional tax and other services. there is, to my knowledge, a lot of switching from clients that are, what i would call, typical clients of adp that have payroll benefits, admin, maybe tlm, etc., whether it's in the downmarket or in the midmarket into these hro solutions.
there is not a lot, to my knowledge, of switching across because it typically -- again, if we're doing our job from a sales standpoint, you're really trying to find the right fit for the client. in some cases, the client wants you to do their benefits admin and provide their benefits, provide their workers' comp and their 401(k). in other cases, the client wants you to only do the administrative back office of the payroll department and the hr department which would be the non-peo solutions. so i think if we do our job well, which i think we do in the sales process and in the upgrade process, those clients tend to stay on those -- on whatever solution they have chosen. but to be clear, both of them are growing at this point at rates that are multiples of our growth in employer services. and so it's quite impressive in terms of the tailwind and the growth rates that we have in all of the hro businesses.
on the last part of your question, which i think was about positioning peo in terms of market share and so forth, we have -- i think it's 630,000 roughly, we reported worksite employees -- average worksite employees this last quarter. that's triple what it was 10 years ago in the first quarter of fiscal year '11. and so -- and that's a higher market share than it was 10 years ago. so i don't know what -- how else to answer that question other than to say that we have a proven track record of execution to continue to drive growth in the peo that's faster than the market. so i don't think there's any question about our positioning or our ability to drive market share as evidenced by our ability to execute.
eugene simuni -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
and our last question comes from mark marcon with baird. your line is open.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
hey, good morning, carlos. and don, look forward to working with you. on next-gen payroll, can you give us an update in terms of the rollout there please?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
so next-gen payroll, we're equally excited as we are about next-gen hcm in terms of what this holds for the future for adp. the challenge for us in terms of as we communicate in -- on november 15, we'll try to figure out a way to address this issue, like we have $15 billion in revenue. so as well as next-gen hcm are going and next-gen payroll is going, it just doesn't -- this is a future impact for adp, so it's not in the next quarter. and i know you're not asking a question necessarily about the next quarter, mark, but i think it was a good opportunity to kind of throw that out there, that what's driving the performance of adp this quarter, this year and for the next two to three years is not going to be that from a financial standpoint. but in terms of positioning the company for the future in terms of growth and creating competitive differentiation and ability to drive new bookings, they are absolutely critical.
so i would say that those measurements, we're still happy and excited by the progress we're seeing with both next-gen hcm as well as next-gen payroll. we have not gone to general availability. so we're selling a lot of next-gen payroll but we're only selling it in, what we call, the core of major accounts right now of the midmarket, which is kind of 50 to 150 and this is no different in terms of the playbook that we use with our transition from our old platform to run in a downmarket and some of our more legacy platforms in midmarket to then our next-gen workforce now version which we're on now.
so we're doing the same thing with next-gen payroll and the same thing with next-gen hcm, which is we're doing it very carefully. we have a very large installed base and we are not -- we're going to eventually move some of those clients and begin to move some of those clients, but we're happy with the business and the cash flow that we have and the client satisfaction scores that are at record levels on our existing platform. so we do not have any -- this is not -- we're not panicking. there's no sense of crisis and there is no -- we have urgency, but no crisis because i want to make sure people hear that. like i don't want you to think that we don't have a sense of urgency, because the faster we get these two solutions to scale, the faster we beat the competition.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
i appreciate that. and thanks for the color there. on the peo growth, can you talk a little bit about two different dimensions? one would be the growth that you're seeing kind of in the established states relative to some of the less mature states and to what extent are you seeing less mature states really catch on, particularly given the legislative and regulatory backdrop? and then secondly, how should we think about just health insurance costs, now that elective surgeries are starting to come back, elective procedures are starting to come back? what sort of impact would that end up having just on the overall pricing? i know that you're not necessarily impacted directly from a margin perspective, but just thinking about the demand environment.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. it's a great question. i'll take the second part of the question. so hopefully, you'll forget about the first part, because we don't have -- we try to prepare for everything and that one, we'll have to follow up with you on in terms of what regions or what states were strongest in terms of our -- so i'm going to suspect that they were all strong because honestly, like, the peo results were off the charts, so there can't be any state that wasn't in strong double-digit growth, but will follow up on that question.
on the healthcare rates question, you're right, that we're not directly impacted, but you're also right to imply that we're indirectly impacted because it does matter. right? it matters to our clients, what they're paying for healthcare. and i hate to be so simplistic, but i think with dr. regression to the mean and large economies, the healthcare world and insurance companies are also similar in terms of they regress. right? so losses have an uncanny way of regressing to the mean. that's why i always caution people when all of a sudden someone thinks that they have this big decline in either workers' comp costs or healthcare costs, it usually doesn't work that way. it's usually something that explains it and it usually regresses back to the mean.
so i think if i can try to answer what i think is the implication of your question, there was a temporary decline in things like elective surgery and frankly healthcare in general. people even stopped going to their primary care physicians and so forth. that decreased healthcare costs temporarily. and i hate to use that word transitory that is now the favorite word it seems to talk about inflation, but it's very clear that, that was transitory and that healthcare costs will come back. and so i think to the extent you had below-normal renewals, which would be our situation, right, because we don't take risk on healthcare, so we wouldn't see it in our margins and in our cost structure, but to the extent that we had below-normal renewals, we would expect those renewals to go back to normal because we would expect as healthcare costs go back to normal slowly, that those costs would have to be passed through.
when you look at the healthcare insurance companies as much as -- as much criticism as they get, they are largely pass-through entities. they're paying hospitals and providers and other healthcare costs, prescription drugs, etc. and it's really not a business where you can say, ""oh, we can't pass this 10% increase in healthcare costs"" because their margins aren't even 10%. and so that business is very, very straightforward, which is they try to earn a markup or margins for doing what they do in terms of managing networks, etc., but in the end, they have to pass those costs through. we have to also, because we're a taxable entity as well and i think those who take risk on healthcare will probably see those costs go up over some period of time.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
appreciate the comments. look forward to seeing you on the 15th.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer

this concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. i'm pleased to hand the program over to carlos rodriguez for closing remarks.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
so there's not much more i can say as we really had terrific results. i want to thank don for joining and i think you're all going to be very happy to meet him and get the benefit of his experience in adp, more broadly, besides just in the finance organization because he has kind of real world business experience within adp as well.
the -- i just want to end the way i usually end which is thanking our organization and particularly our frontline associates, because i'm not sure what's going on at other companies, but we would not be able to get our goals accomplished without people going above and beyond. i think we mentioned the tight labor market and that we're a little bit behind in terms of our hiring. that means our people are working extra hard. and economists says that's an increase in productivity. i'd say that's just people working hard and we really appreciate it, our clients appreciate it, i think our shareholders appreciate it.
i don't think a lot of them listen to this call, but you should be aware that, whether it's here or in other companies, there's a lot of people out there that are pushing really hard to deliver and many of us, whether we are as consumers or buyers of products and business and so on, we're frustrated by what's happening in terms of supply chain and some of these other things, but all i see is a bunch of people working really, really hard to try to, like, fulfill the needs of our clients. and i think that's happening across the whole economy and i think we need to show a little bit of patience with with each other, because this will all, i think, normalize as this variant now recedes. i mean you're seeing already in some of the mobility data, things will slowly get back to normal, people will come back into the labor force and this great economy that we have will function the way it's supposed to function.
but in the meantime, i want to thank our associates for what they've done so far, whether it's this last quarter and what they're going to have to do to get through this year-end, which is going to be very challenging, given the volumes we have and the capacity we have. so, for that, i thank them, but i also thank all of you for listening and for being supporters of adp. thank you.

operator
good morning. my name is michelle, and i'll be your conference operator. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to adp's first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. i would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] thank you.
i will now turn the conference over to mr. danyal hussain, vice president, investor relations. please go ahead.
danyal hussain -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, michelle. and good morning everyone and welcome to adp's first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. participating today are carlos rodriguez, our president and ceo; and don mcguire, our cfo.
earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. our earnings materials are available on the sec website and our investor relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call.
during our call, we will reference non-gaap financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that excludes the impact of certain items. a description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measures can be found in our earnings release.
today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involves some risks. we encourage you to review our filings with the sec for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.
and with that, let me turn it over to carlos.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, danny. and thank you everyone for joining our call. i'd like to start by welcoming don mcguire, our new cfo. don has been with adp since 1998 when he joined the adp canada team as a vp of finance. he's held a series of roles with increasing responsibility, most recently serving as president of our international business where he has done a phenomenal job of driving growth and profitability in a very complex environment. i know he's looking forward to meeting all of you.
now, moving on to the quarter. we are pleased to have delivered a very strong start to the year with 10% revenue growth and a 140 basis points of margin expansion, resulting in a 17% increase in adjusted diluted eps. while we did expect our q1 revenue growth to be above our prior full-year guidance range, this result was still above our initial forecast and underscores the strong position we are in as we emerge from the pandemic. i'll let don go through the details after i cover some highlights.
our es new business bookings results were very strong, representing another record q1 bookings amount and we're ahead of our expectations with outperformance driven by continued strength in our hr portfolio and our international business. with this impressive bookings performance across the enterprise, we're pleased to raise our es bookings guidance for the year after just one quarter, as we're now feeling even more confident about our sales momentum.
even stronger was our peo bookings performance, which was also well ahead of our expectations and a key reason that we're raising our guidance for average worksite employee growth for the year, as don will outline for you.
as you will recall, we've been sharing our sales productivity trends over the course of the pandemic, and i'm pleased to report that in q1, we were well above pre-pandemic levels. we reached this result several months sooner than we expected and we expect this to continue as we look ahead.
our es retention remained incredibly strong as well. as we shared last quarter, we believed it was reasonable to assume a slight step back in retention from the record 92.2% level we experienced last year. but in q1, we did not see meaningful deterioration. instead, we actually saw further improvement in our overall es retention to a new record q1 level despite a modest decline in our small business division, where out-of-business losses started to trend back to more normal levels compared to the below-normal levels last year. we're continuing to assume a slight decline in our retention outlook for the year, but clearly, we are pleased with our performance so far and the upward revision in our retention outlook reflects the strong q1 performance. our es pays-per-control was solid with 7% growth in the quarter, about in line with our expectations.
we fielded a number of questions these past several months about what we think might drive workers back into the labor force. while we don't have an answer to that question, what we can tell you is that we continue to see positive trends. our clients are eager to hire and we are seeing workers return to the labor force, even if it's gradual. as a result, we expect to benefit from above-normal -- an above-normal level of pays-per-control growth over the course of the year.
in addition to the very strong es performance, our peo delivered another stellar quarter with 15% revenue growth and 15% average worksite employee growth, even better than the high expectations we had coming into the quarter. there were multiple drivers to the outperformance in the peo, including the strong level of hiring within the client base, resilient retention and the improved bookings performance i mentioned earlier. we are very pleased with the momentum we see building in the peo and we're raising our full year guidance accordingly.
in addition to the financial highlights, there are a few product highlights i wanted to share with you. first, i'm excited to share that we completed the initial rollout of our new user experience for run. as we shared with you last quarter, this represents the most comprehensive refresh we've done since the launch of run and we're very proud that in a matter of a quarter, we were able to seamlessly move hundreds of thousands of clients to a new and better user experience. early signs indicate that client satisfaction scores should trend even higher than the record levels we already have in our small business division. so it's a really great outcome and represents a very strong execution by the team.
i'd like to also share that at the annual hr tech conference a few weeks ago, our innovative diversity, equity and inclusion tool on the data cloud platform was named a top hr product. this recognition adds to adp's long-standing history of award wins at the conference, marking an unprecedented seventh consecutive year adp has been honored for its innovative hcm technology. you can probably tell from the number of times we've highlighted data cloud, that our velocity of innovation has increased significantly there.
with this de&i solution as an example, we've seen over 50% of active users of this solution take action and realize positive impact on their de&i measures. i'm proud that we provide solutions that drive real positive change for our clients. this seven-year track record demonstrates that innovation is part of adp's dna and that we have a strong growing agile r&d team committed to delivering solutions in the market that continue to push the boundary of what hcm solutions can do for employers and their employees.
as i said before, we're very pleased with the fantastic start to the year. we look forward to sharing even more of the adp story with you at the upcoming investor day in november.
and now, i'll turn the call over to don for more detail on the quarter and the outlook.
don mcguire -- chief financial officer
thank you, carlos. and to everyone on the call, good morning and nice to meet you.
our first quarter represented a strong start to the year with 10% revenue growth on both a reported and organic constant currency basis. our adjusted ebit margin was up 140 basis points, much better than expected, and was supported by higher revenue and overall cost containment. our tax rate was up slightly in the quarter versus last year, but we also benefited from the elevated pace of share repurchases following our debt issuance in may. combined, those factors contributed to a 17% increase in our adjusted diluted earnings per share.
moving on to the segments. our employer services revenue increased 8% on a reported and organic constant currency basis. our strong q1 es bookings performance and record retention contributed to this performance, though, as a reminder, we did continue to lap some of the lower revenues we had last year in some of our volume-related businesses, including recruiting and background screening. our clients funding interest represented only a slight headwind in the quarter as our 40 basis point decline in average yield was offset by fantastic balanced growth of 22%, driven by client growth, employment growth, higher wages and the lapping of the payroll tax deferral last year. es margin increased 150 basis points on strong revenue performance and overall cost containment.
as carlos mentioned, our peo had another terrific quarter. average worksite employees increased 15% year-over-year to 629,000 and revenues excluding zero-margin pass-throughs grew 20%, supported once again by favorable mix trends within the peo employee base, as well as improving sui rates. total peo revenue grew 15%, which included a modest drag from lower zero-margin pass-through growth and worksite employee growth, as expected. peo margin was up 70 basis points in the quarter, driven by operating leverage.
overall, our q1 results reflect a very strong start to the year and delivered ahead of our expectations on practically all fronts.
let me now turn to our updated outlook for fiscal 2022. for es revenues, we now expect growth of 5% to 6%, which we're raising 50 basis points at the midpoint. this is driven by several underlying factors. we're raising our expected range of es new bookings growth to 12% to 16%. as we mentioned, we had a better than expected performance in q1 and reached pre-pandemic productivity earlier than we had forecasted. we haven't made significant changes to our rest of year outlook at this point, but if momentum remains as strong as we've seen it, then we may see opportunity to deliver additional upside.
we are also raising our es retention and we are now assuming a decline of 50 basis points off of fy '21s all-time highs versus our prior outlook of a decline of 75 basis points. as with bookings, this is primarily a function of the strong q1 performance. our continued assumption is that as clients continue to reengage in the marketplace, we may experience a slight decline over the course of the year. we expect to have significantly more clarity once we get through the calendar year end period where we typically see most of the switching activity. for u.s. pays-per-control, we're making no change to our outlook of 4% to 5% growth. we continue to expect a gradual recovery in the overall labor market, and the 7% growth in q1 was about in line with our expectations.
and then for our client funds interest revenue, we're raising our outlook by about $15 million to a range of $420 million to $430 million as we're raising our balance growth assumptions by about 4% to growth of 12% to 14%. our outlook for client funds yield, meanwhile, is unchanged despite the improvement in the yield environment, primarily as our stronger balance performance actually created a temporary mix shift to overnight investments until new securities are gradually purchased. but that said, the favorable shift in the yield curve is clearly helpful to us and will certainly benefit our multi-year client funds outlook, all else equal.
for es margin, we now expect an increase of about 75 to 100 basis points, up from our prior range of 50 to 75 basis points. while we did outperform meaningfully on margin in q1, we are also seeing some additional expenses over the rest of the year, including higher headcounts in our outsourcing businesses. meanwhile, we continue to expect transformation initiative benefits, including our digital transformation to offset a year-over-year increase in facilities, t&e expenses and other return-to-office expenses.
moving on to the peo. we now expect peo revenues to grow 11% to 13%; average worksite employees to grow 11% to 13%; and revenues excluding zero-margin pass-throughs to grow 12% to 14%. this 2 percentage point ratings across the board is a function of both our strong q1 bookings and overall performance, as well as an expectation from stronger hiring within our peo base to contribute over the remainder of the year. our peo is very well-positioned to capitalize on growing levels of client demand coming out of the pandemic. and if we continue to drive outsized bookings performance over the rest of the year, that could represent further upside to our outlook.
following our strong start to the year, we now expect a range of flat-to-down 50 basis points for the year for an improvement from our prior expectation of down 25 to 75 basis points on our margin. as a reminder, we are growing over a very strong margin result in fiscal 2021 and are also expecting elevated selling expenses this year from strong bookings performance.
putting it all together for our consolidated outlook, we now expect revenue to grow 7% to 8%. following the strong 10% q1 performance, we now expect the remaining quarters to grow closer to 7%, which is higher than our prior forecast. for adjusted ebit margin, we now expect an increase of 50 to 75 basis points. as we shared last quarter, we expect our margin improvement to be back half-weighted, most specifically in the fourth quarter. our current expectation is for a slight margin decline in q2 and q3. we're making no change to our tax rate assumption. and with these changes, we now expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 11% to 13%.
as i think you've heard us say a couple of times now, we are very pleased with our q1 results and we're happy to be raising our guidance this early in the year. this is still a dynamic environment and there are a wide range of potential outcomes, and we believe our guidance is appropriately balanced, given these conditions. however, should our associates continue to drive better than expected sales results, client satisfaction, efficiency and service implementation, we would see opportunity to deliver additional upside to our outlook.
before we move to q&a, i wanted to share two things. first, i look forward to meeting everyone, perhaps virtually for now, but eventually in person as we get back out on the road to meet our shareholders and the investment community. and second is that we are very much looking forward to our upcoming investor day in a couple of weeks on november 15. having run one of our largest businesses for years, i can tell you, there is always much happening here at adp underground. and although it all tends to roll up to a very stable financial picture, i can tell you, there is really a lot of excitement among our associates for the things they're working on. we hope to share some of that excitement with you in november.
and with that, i'll now turn it back over to the operator for q&a.

[operator instructions] we will take our first question from the line of samad samana with jefferies. your line is open.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. congrats on the really strong start to the new fiscal year. so, carlos, maybe, i want to unpack the drivers of the strength on the new bookings side. i know productivity is clearly one, but how should we think about the product side and within the product portfolio, where that strength was in terms of driving new bookings?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
so, even though what we really talk about is es bookings, i just want to start off by saying that the peo bookings were incredibly strong. i don't know how else to put it, so kind of, call it, orders of magnitude in terms of growth rate higher than even es bookings growth for the quarter. so that was really good to see. so that kind of assigned -- to your question about products, that i think the market is really searching for solutions coming out of this pandemic that help them with, obviously, people issues and so on, but there's also a talent crunch. so people are looking to obviously attract and retain people in this environment, where every company, including adp, is going through some of these challenges in terms of attracting our own internal talent.
and then you have another dynamic, which is, if there are shortages of labor in various categories there -- we're hearing that there's also shortages of talent in kind of the hcm category in general, that should create a little bit of an advantage for the critical outsourcers. right? so, as you know our model is we provide great technology and software, but we also do the back office work and we take accountability for outcomes. and i think when people are struggling to hire people to do the work in their hr department or their payroll department or their benefits department, we're here to help. and so i think those outsourcing solutions are getting a lot of tailwind.
we also saw, because of the easy comps, and i think you've heard it in don's comments, some of the things like our recruitment process, outsourcing business and our screening and selection business, which were really at very low bookings levels last year at the same time, have rebounded for obvious reasons incredibly well. but having said that, it was really across the board. we had very strong growth in workforce now. we had very strong growth in the upmarket. we had strong growth even in the downmarket, although last year at the same time, i think we mentioned that we had, what we call, client-based acquisitions, not technically an m&a deal but we were able to buy large book of business that we converted, that really some of that flowed through our bookings. so it made that comparison a little harder on the sbs side. but if you back that out, it was equally strong on the sbs side as well.
so i would say that, like, that could give you a little bit of color, but it really was across the board. it just shows how connected we are to the economy and to gdp when it comes to bookings, which is something that we've had as a theory here for some years now and we just have a very strong recovery in a very strong economy and it's a great environment for our sales force.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
that's very helpful. and then don, maybe one for you on the retention side. so, obviously, it's really impactful and to raise the outlook one quarter in, i think, signals the strength that you're seeing. but just help me unpack the slight uptick in the smb side moving a little bit more toward normal in terms of business failure. should we think that, that -- the offset there is even better than expected retention in the midmarket or on the enterprise side? can you maybe help us think about it across the customer size spectrum, how to balance those different moving parts?
don mcguire -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure. i think it's fair to say and we commented on it that the retention is at an all-time record for a q1. so that's fantastic and better than we had expected. the expectation as we went into the year was to see, particularly in the smaller business segment, to see that slip back a little and indeed it has, but it hasn't slipped back nearly to the extent that we had anticipated. so we're even better there against what we had previously thought. of course, then that means that we did have and continue to have good retention levels in the midmarket and the upmarket. so we expect that to continue.
however, as you know the cyclicality of our business and the seasonality of our business, we will need to get through the calendar year end, which is when we see most of the switching activity because of the drivers in the new starts to the year, etc. so we are positive and we did take our retention estimate up for the year and we'll see if it holds and perhaps is better than we expected.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great, thanks, gentlemen. look forward to seeing you at the analyst day in person in a few weeks.

our next question comes from jason kupferberg with bank of america. please proceed.
mihir bhatia -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. this is actually mihir bhatia on for jason. don, firstly, congratulations on the role. maybe you can talk a little bit about your priorities in the cfo role and how they could maybe look a little different than under kathleen. and then just relatedly, should we expect an update to multi-year targets at next year's analyst day? and then i have a follow-up. thank you.
don mcguire -- chief financial officer
yeah, so i guess what i would say is i've been with adp for a long time now. and i guess what i've observed in the roughly 23 years i've been with this company is that adp has always had a very strong financial organization with a strong finance leader and i want to make sure that we continue that. and so i'm sure we will. i think that the priorities that we have are well set out in our strat plan in previous investor days, etc. so we'll probably provide everyone with an update on those things when we get together on november 15. but let's wait till then. and i don't think you're going to see any dramatic changes. we pretty much have a well-discussed and well-disclosed trajectory and plan, and we will update you on that on november 15.
mihir bhatia -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
understood. thank you. and then, just if i could ask about just your sales force spend, just clearly seeing some very strong momentum in the market. so i was wondering if you have any plans for sales force growth in fiscal 2022 and which part of the market those adds would be concentrated in? also anything notable to call out in terms of just the mix of new logos versus cross-sells in your bookings for the quarter or in the forecast? thank you.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
i think in this kind of environment, given the very first comments we made about the economy and you have both the economy as a tailwind and you have now, in the u.s., i think an administration that is kind of more inclined to regulation and to particularly employer regulation. and so you have, i think, a very strong backdrop for what i would say is the foreseeable future. in that environment, historically what adp would do is, we would add as much sales capacity as possible. that doesn't mean that we indiscriminately hire because we've got people to hire and onboard and train and so forth and we have to make those people effective. but i would say that we have a strong appetite for growing our sales force, but also for growing our investment in marketing, whether it's digital marketing or more traditional advertising. and that's exactly what we plan to do.
having said that, i would tell you that we've had challenges, i think, like everyone else in terms of hiring. it's a very difficult labor market. so i hope that we can fulfill those expectations or those dreams, if you will, of growing our sales force as fast as possible, but that's the only thing that i could see getting in the way. we obviously have the capital, we have the -- i think the desire and we have, i think, the experience to be able to execute once we hire those people to get the sales, get the clients implemented and then hopefully derive the benefits of that revenue for, in many cases, 15, 20 years depending on which business unit we're in. so i guess i would say, strong appetite for both headcount growth but also other investments in sales, whether it's marketing, digital marketing, sales tools, all across the board.
mihir bhatia -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst

and next question comes from tien-tsin huang with j.p. morgan. your line is open.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, thanks so much. good results here. just on the peo side, i'm curious, how much of the general improvement there is secular versus cyclical. and i know, carlos, you talked about putting more sales energy there as well. so just curious what's changed.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
so, at the risk of -- because i think it's -- we had a strong feeling that the peo business was going to be strong coming out of this pandemic. it has been strong coming out of prior critical recessions, and this was a different recession. so i have to be careful about any specific predictions but we had some challenges, i think, coming out of the pandemic with -- the price that we were selling in the peo were slightly smaller and just ballparked at around 10% smaller. so let's say that the average -- i'm just going to make up the numbers, let's say, the average new clients [technical issues] in the peo was 30 worksite employees, and all of a sudden, prior to the pandemic -- and that's been ""growing"" slightly over the years, all of a sudden, it came down to like 27. so a 10% decline. so even if you sell 10% more units, if the units are 10% smaller, you basically end up in the same place. so that's a little bit of what we were expecting. we believe that's 100% related to the economy and to what was happening with the pandemic.
now, what we've seen in the recovery is both the unit growth is still strong as it was prior year and now our unit size has recovered. and so the combination of those two things has created really, really strong growth in the first quarter in the peo. the only caveat that i would add also is that we did have a kind of a transition into a new year, as you know, our fiscal year ended on june 30 and in some cases, our businesses tend to perform really extremely well in the first quarter when they come out of a year where -- i wouldn't call it underperformance, because it was still a good year last year, given the circumstances, but clearly the peo, we were very, i think, clear that the peo had been trailing in terms of recovery when it comes to bookings, what we were seeing in es and now -- and we expected. the horse race now -- the horse and the lead has changed. so now the peo is the one leading the race.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good color. thank you, carlos.
operator
our next question comes from kevin mcveigh with credit suisse. your line is open.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great, thank you and congrats on the results, and don, welcome. hey, i wondered could you give us a sense, carlos, from a sales perspective, despite the tight environment, you're still delivering, is there any way to think about the go-to-market strategy this cycle as opposed to last and how maybe technology and maybe more of a mixed downmarket helps drive that process? i guess what i'm saying is, is there more leverage in the sales force today than you've ever had and is there any way to maybe put some parameters around that?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
i think there is definitely more leverage in the sales force than we've ever had because, i mean, i think maybe what you're alluding to, our sales force, like a lot of other of our competitors, had to go to 100% virtual for a number of months and i'm sure every competitor handle it differently in terms of how long they were virtual versus when they went back in the field. but that process, which we had been learning about for 20, 25 years, like, we had almost a third of our sales force already selling, what we call, inside sales, so they were able to sell virtually. they had been in a building, but it didn't really matter whether they were in a building or in their homes, they were still able to sell very effectively. so that was an easy transition for that portion of our sales force. and then we -- really with the appropriate tools and some training and some learning from our inside sales force, we really moved our entire sales force to sell virtually.
so i'd say now, we're really in a period where we're going to sell based on however the client wants to be sold. and so, if the client wants a combination of an initial video call on zoom or webex, we'll do that. if the client wants an in-person visit, we'll do that. if they want to close the deal with an in-person, but start with a video, we can do that. so i think there's no question that the sales force leverage has increased for us. but admittedly, probably, for our our competitors as well, our reach has definitely been extended. there is no question about that in terms of tools, but also philosophically. i think our -- we are now, i think, able to sell in a -- i mean, to use a cliche, an omnichannel way. we're also investing heavily in digital marketing.
so, you mentioned the downmarket, i would just add that because of some of the comparisons that the downmarket had, that was not what drove the sales results this quarter. it was actually all the other businesses. so -- but we do see the underlying strength in small business, but because of the difficult comparison, it's not reflected in the percentages, so not trying to minimize the strength in the momentum in the downmarket, i'm trying to emphasize the strength everywhere else in the portfolio. and the rest of the portfolio also can benefit from digital tools, digital marketing. but it's not quite as leveraged as it is in the downmarket.
so i think it's a combination of a lot of different things, but the overall, i think, comment would be, there is no question that there is increased leverage in the sales force and you're seeing it in terms of the productivity numbers. i mean, we are frankly very positively surprised by the rebound in kind of, what we call, average sales force productivity. so the actual sales rep level, how much are they selling today versus what were they selling in fiscal year '19 and that is back to and above that level, which is very, very pleasing to us.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
that's helpful. and then just one real quick one on retention. what -- was the boost kind of all q1 overperformance? because i know the q2 december is a big quarter in terms of retention and things like that. or is it just more optimism over the balance of the year or a little of both? is there any way to frame how much of that boost was maybe q1 overperformance as opposed to how you're feeling over the balance of the year?
don mcguire -- chief financial officer
yeah, maybe i'll take that. i think our retention -- certainly, we're very happy with the q1 record we have, but i think it's also heavily linked to the success we've had over the last few years with our improvements in nps. and as our nps continues to go in the right direction and improve, we're seeing general increases in retention to go along with that. i think that's what we would expect and that's what we want to see happen. so i think there is some relationship there. the -- but no doubt that the retention is very good and we're benefiting still, i think, from a little bit of some of the concerns coming out of the pandemic that clients may have about switching during a time of still virtual for many. so we're benefiting from that as well and we acknowledge that.
but as i said, we're very happy with the retention and the progress we're making with our products and our service that go along to driving those retention numbers. we will see a little bit of a step back, perhaps, in the downmarket, but as we said so far, it's serving up better than we expected.
danyal hussain -- vice president of investor relations
hey, kevin, it's danny. and just to clarify, because we did share in our prepared remarks, that the raise was primarily a function of the q1 results. obviously, we had visibility into october as well.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
that makes sense. thank you.

our next question comes from ramsey el-assal with barclays. your line is open.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
hi, gentlemen. thanks for taking my call this morning. i wanted to ask about margins. and forgive me if you addressed this in some detail, i missed a bit of the call earlier. but it -- they came in really strong this quarter, well above our model. can you speak to the drivers of the beat and also to their sustainability as we move forward?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
sure. let me start off by saying that the margin in the first quarter was a record for us and it was above last year as we just reported. but if you go back to last year, last year was above the prior year and so it's quite impressive that we had margin improvement last year, given that we were one quarter into a pandemic, but it's even more impressive that we had margin improvement again. having said that, that's the victory lap. so then, the other part of the comment is we had way higher revenue than we had anticipated, which is incredibly gratifying and we're very happy about that and it was really in both es and peo. and it was in a bunch of different places, slightly better pays-per-control, retention was better. you heard all the comments. we have just a lot of things working in our favor here.
the expenses have not caught up to the revenues. and so right now we are trying to add capacity, both for implementation and service, particularly ahead of our year-end period. and so, like other companies, the most important thing for us is to be able to execute on our commitments to our clients and to be able to start all the business that we've sold. and so i would say that that's a dynamic that's factored into the margin performance. but i don't want to take anything away from the organization or anything away from the operating leverage because it's pretty impressive, what the organization was able to accomplish. but, had we known where we were going to be in terms of topline and volumes, we would have more headcount today than we have. and there is some catching up to do.
now to put a fine point on that, don't think of, we have to add hundreds of millions of dollars of expense, we're just a little bit behind and that's why you see [indecipherable] some of that yet, i may as well address it head on, that for the rest of the year, when you look at the eps in the guidance, we really are not raising by much more than what we had in terms of our performance in q1. and that's because we are going to continue to invest in both sales and distribution, but also in service and implementation and that delay in hiring or deferred hiring helped us in terms of the margin in the first quarter. i strongly believe we still would have had a very strong margin performance in the first quarter even had we hit our headcount numbers for service, implementation and volume-related businesses. but i thought i should kind of put that out there, because it seems like an obvious question as well.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
that's great. and i appreciate your candor there. a quick follow-up for me. i was wondering about the human resources and human capital management products. can you talk about how the cross-selling process into your base of kind of payroll customers is organized? i'm just trying to figure out sort of how you go about that cross-sell process. and i guess, how much of a runway do you see for attach rates with those products?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
there really isn't a simple answer to that -- to the first part. i mean, we'll come back to the, i think, the second question about the attach rates. let me answer that one first. the attach rates are -- there's a couple of products that we have, what i would call, good attach rates; acceptable, i should say, it's a ceo speak for, they could always be higher, like our benefits admin tools, our time and attendance systems. but most of our products and our workers' compensation tool in the downmarket also has a high attach rate. but almost everything else that is ""beyond"" payroll, so hcm, in addition to kind of our core payroll solutions, we're way under-penetrated in terms of attach rate. so there is a lot of potential, i think, for that to improve as well.
so on the first part of your question, in terms of how we cross-sell, as i started saying, there isn't a simple answer, because there isn't a simple answer. in some of our businesses, we have very distinct organizations, like in the downmarket we have a large downmarket sales force that works with accountants and other kind of third-party channels and also sells directly, and then we have a sales force that sells our retirement solutions, our 401(k) product and our insurance services solution. those are distinct sales forces that basically share leads with each other and they have incentives to do so. that downmarket business also feeds business to our peo through also incentives. but there is a separate and distinct sales force in the peo as well.
when you get into the upmarket and then into the midmarket, you start to get some portion of our sales force, which is able to sell multiple products or, what i would call, bundles. but even then, you still have specialized sales forces in certain circumstances depending on, i think, the specialization or the complexity of the product. but in all cases, we have primary sales -- what i would call, primary salespeople, so the quarterback, if you will, on an account. now i'm talking about upmarket and midmarket and those quarterbacks are really in charge of making sure that when it's appropriate and when a client has a need, that we bring in our specialized sales people that have specific knowledge about some of our other hcm solution.
so i wish it were -- i wish i could give you a simple answer, but that's actually part of the secret sauce, right, in terms of our ability to grow and outperform some of our competitors is to be able to do that well. and i'd like to say that i invented this, but this is something that goes all the way back to the frank lautenberg days and to my predecessors gary, art and josh and this is a well-oiled machine in terms of our sales and distribution, and specifically on what you just described about the cross sell. and to, again, put a fine point on it, roughly 50% of our bookings come from cross-sell and roughly 50% of our bookings come from new logos each year.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
very helpful. appreciate it. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from kartik mehta with northcoast research. your line is open.
kartik mehta -- northcoast research -- analyst
carlos, i just wanted to get your thoughts. you've talked obviously a lot about new sales. and i'm wondering, outside of this wage inflation that you're seeing, is the cost to acquire clients going down, especially on the smb side now that there is a new way to sell to them? or do you think the cost to acquire clients as we move through this pandemic will go back to what it was?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
i wish i had a crystal ball in terms of answering where it's going to go, but i think just from a mathematical or technical standpoint, the cost to sell [phonetic] is definitely going down because of this productivity increase. right? so this is the same leverage that you're seeing in so many industries and so many businesses, including ours and the revenue happens on the bookings as well. right? when you get higher volumes, it basically indicates higher -- i mean, unless you add a lot of expense, by definition, you get higher productivity. so you see this being reported in the press all the time about how worker productivity is up. well, part of the reason why worker productivity is up is because revenues have recovered, volumes have recovered, and it's the same people, right, or you're adding a few more people. now, what maybe people aren't focusing on, is that worker productivity went down, right, as the pandemic kind of set in and people's revenues went down.
so i mean, i hate to make it so simplistic mathematically, but some of that is what's happening now. so you do have to be careful about jumping to any medium to long-term conclusions because right now, our cost to sell compared to last year and the year before is definitely coming down as a result of a very large increase in bookings, without a similar increase in expenses. we still, though, are not back to where our cost to sell was pre-pandemic and we hope to get there but that will require even a little bit more productivity during this year, but that would be -- our expectation is that whether it's the gdp or interest rates or employment, there's a regression to the mean here, it's a very large economy, adp is a large company, but the economy is massive and it tends to regress to the mean on a lot of things and we also tend to regress to the mean. so i think some of these things will work themselves out and then you have to just get past the base effect from the comparisons and so forth to really understand where you are and we won't know that until we're on the other side, unfortunately, i hate to say.
kartik mehta -- northcoast research -- analyst
thank you very much. appreciate it.

our next question comes from james faucette with morgan stanley. your line is open.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah. thank you very much and thanks for all the color this morning. i guess maybe i want to ask the obvious headline question and i'm just wondering how the reported current tightness in the labor market is factored into your guidance and how are you anticipating that, that changes through the coming fiscal year. and i guess maybe a product and service-related question tied to that, are you seeing incremental sales opportunities with some of the tech that you can provide to your clients for hiring, etc.? and is that having any impact on how you're thinking about your outlook and forecast? thanks.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
thanks for the question. the second part of your question, i think, kind of answers the first part. the answer is yes. like, i think, part -- again, part and separate how much is just pure gdp growth, new business formation, etc. but the last part of your question, there is no question that part of our growth is driven by what you are alluding to, which is everyone now is looking for help in terms of hiring, attracting people and frankly also trying to hold on to them. this is a great environment for us. the combination of strong gdp and an administration that is more inclined toward regulation and then a tight labor market for people who do the things that we do. by that, i mean payroll staff and hr staff prospects in our clients, that's all a very good backdrop for us.
so i'm assuming that this is not going to resolve itself overnight in terms of the tightness in the labor market. so we should anticipate some tailwinds here and some help for some period of time until that changes, and i hate to use the r word, but some day, at some point in the future, it doesn't seem anywhere near future, given what's going on with government stimulus and government policy. but some day, that might change, but we don't see that on the horizon right now.
on the very first part of your question, though, in terms of the tight labor markets, i would say, the overwhelming impact of tight labor market is positive on adp. i mentioned one of the challenges we have, which is tight labor market affects our own internal associates in terms of, we have to hire service people, implementation people, so it's harder for us, like it is harder for anyone else. but that pales in comparison to the upsides, like a tight labor market drive new bookings, as we just talked about to the last part of your question, but it also could create inflationary pressures, which drives our balanced growth. it should drive interest rates higher, which is one of the most under-appreciated stories, i think, of adp is the potential upside in our flow [phonetic] business.
and the reason it's underestimated is because there's been nothing for 10 years. because i've been here for 10 years and there's been nothing but pain and headwind and just when i thought we were coming out of it, we go into a pandemic. and we have more pain and rates go even lower than they were before. but i'm pretty sure they're not going any lower now, although, i think we may have to file an 8-k after saying that. right? i'm making a statement on interest rates, but they may -- whatever, hover around here, go down a little bit there. but it feels pretty certain that the long-term -- medium and long-term trend now for interest rates will be at least for gradual increases. and i'm not suggesting that -- there's still underlying demographics that may keep us from getting back to the same kind of 10-year rate that we had 15 years ago or 10 years ago, but i think everyone knows when you look at real interest rates that there is upside on interest rate.
so the tight labor market helps in a number of ways. it creates activity for our sales force. every time there is activity in those conversations, we're going to win our fair share. so that's a great backdrop. it creates opportunities for our balances. i think it creates opportunities for the peo because some of our billings are actually driven by -- as a percentage of wages and whenever you have wage inflation, if you're billing on percent of wages, to some extent, that will help. that's not like an infinite thing because we won't just allow our revenue to go up indefinitely. we'd have to adjust those rates, but in the medium term, we will see, i think, some tailwind from -- in the peo from higher wages and wage growth, which is an inevitable outcome of a tight labor market.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst

our next question comes from bryan bergin with cowen. your line is open.
bryan bergin -- cowen -- analyst
hi, good morning. thank you. i had a follow-up first on retention. curious, within the record 1q retention performance, can you just dig in a little bit more as far as the drivers there between the still lower out-of-business closures versus potentially better competitive win rates? and anything broadly, you can comment on around client switching behavior or client reengagement to assess hcm solutions?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
on the first part, i'm not sure how much more color we could give you. we have a fair amount of detail in terms of losses in retention around what we call non-controllable losses which are, broadly speaking, out-of-business, bankruptcies, etc. and those have started to trend back up again, they're not back to normal levels, but they started to trend back. i think that's not surprising because there's still a lot of liquidity and a lot of stimulus, if you will, even if it's not new stimulus. so when you have consumer spending doing what it's doing, and you have activity doing what it's doing, it tends to be supportive of small businesses, rather than the normal turnover that you have that's natural in the small business sector. so i guess with hindsight, like, if three or six months ago when we were putting together our plan, we had a crystal ball, we would have probably -- and we had experience with the pandemic, we probably would have planned the downturn in retention to be slower. so we've been positively surprised by how long it's taking for those losses to regress back to normal.
having said that, we don't know that they're going to regress 100% back to normal because there is other parts of our retention that are controllable. we call it controllable. and in our controllable losses, we see those going down as well. and i think don made a comment that it should not be lost on you, which is that, our client satisfaction scores as measured by nps are the highest they've ever been, and i give credit to the organization for, during the pandemic, being able to get through what was an incredibly difficult time for them personally in terms of they were trying to help our clients. we also had a huge increase in volume because of all the government stimulus programs and the ppp loans, etc. and this happened all over the world, it wasn't just in the u.s.
and fortunately, we maintained relative stability in our headcount. we didn't do mass layoffs and let a bunch of people go. so the combination of maintaining investment and also being able to have people -- i don't know how to describe it, but made heroic efforts to help our clients, we were able to maintain those nps scores and actually have them go up and they're staying at very strong levels and we believe that there is a correlation between strong nps and retention. so we may be able to see kind of new record highs for retention on a permanent basis. but it's way too early to make that prediction.
bryan bergin -- cowen -- analyst
okay. and then just follow-up on next-gen hcm platform. can you provide an update on new sales there and to the pipeline of sold clients versus live clients? any metrics or updates you're willing to share?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
sure. i think we talked about over the last couple of quarters, as we kind of entered into the pandemic, we obviously had a couple of particularly large clients that were in industries that were particularly hard hit. so we got thrown a little bit off course, if you will, in terms of our implementations and our starts. we also, i think, started to focus on implementation tools. i think we had -- i don't know how many we said we had sold and as we started implementing and starting these clients, we recognized that we still had some work to do in terms of implementation tools and making sure that if and when we want to use third -party integrators to help us with that, that we need to build out those tools. so it's been quite a lot of focus on that effort and we feel good about it.
we actually -- i think we also talked about investments in the last quarter that we made to bring in some third parties to help us with the evaluation and, in some cases, the build of that to make sure that as we now kind of enter a -- hopefully a period of time, we can really accelerate the implementations and the growth and the starts of those clients. but it's fair to say, and i think we said in the last couple of quarters, that our focus turn more to making sure that we have a strong foundation and then we had the right implementation tools to be able to get the business started that we intend to have in the next year or two, which is hopefully quite a lot of business. and you'll hear more details about this when we get to our investor day on november 15.
bryan bergin -- cowen -- analyst
okay, thank you.

our next question comes from eugene simuni with moffettnathanson. your line is open.
eugene simuni -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
hi, thank you very much for taking my questions. i have just a couple on the peo, so i'll ask them upfront. one is, if you look broadly at your hro offerings of peo and non-peo, can you compare and contrast for us a little bit to kind of the peo solutions and the non-peo fully outsourced solutions? how are you seeing them growing relative to each other and to demand and are you seeing any switch in between clients who might be using that hro solution without benefits switching into the peo? so that will be the first.
and the second, i was just curious how you're positioning the peo franchise to really win market share in a post-pandemic environment, given the secular growth seems to be very favorable? but, but how do you actually make sure that adp wins share?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
so on the first question, i think i said it in my early comments that all of the hro solutions, the critical outsourcing solutions, are very, very strong across the board. right? upmarket -- because we have hro solutions in the upmarket, we have them in the midmarket and we have them in the downmarket. in the downmarket, we -- and in midmarket we have peo. we also have what you're alluding to, which is a non-core employment, what i would call -- we call it comprehensive services. as the name implies, it provides a kind of broader assortment of services in addition to our traditional software and our traditional tax and other services. there is, to my knowledge, a lot of switching from clients that are, what i would call, typical clients of adp that have payroll benefits, admin, maybe tlm, etc., whether it's in the downmarket or in the midmarket into these hro solutions.
there is not a lot, to my knowledge, of switching across because it typically -- again, if we're doing our job from a sales standpoint, you're really trying to find the right fit for the client. in some cases, the client wants you to do their benefits admin and provide their benefits, provide their workers' comp and their 401(k). in other cases, the client wants you to only do the administrative back office of the payroll department and the hr department which would be the non-peo solutions. so i think if we do our job well, which i think we do in the sales process and in the upgrade process, those clients tend to stay on those -- on whatever solution they have chosen. but to be clear, both of them are growing at this point at rates that are multiples of our growth in employer services. and so it's quite impressive in terms of the tailwind and the growth rates that we have in all of the hro businesses.
on the last part of your question, which i think was about positioning peo in terms of market share and so forth, we have -- i think it's 630,000 roughly, we reported worksite employees -- average worksite employees this last quarter. that's triple what it was 10 years ago in the first quarter of fiscal year '11. and so -- and that's a higher market share than it was 10 years ago. so i don't know what -- how else to answer that question other than to say that we have a proven track record of execution to continue to drive growth in the peo that's faster than the market. so i don't think there's any question about our positioning or our ability to drive market share as evidenced by our ability to execute.
eugene simuni -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
and our last question comes from mark marcon with baird. your line is open.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
hey, good morning, carlos. and don, look forward to working with you. on next-gen payroll, can you give us an update in terms of the rollout there please?
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
so next-gen payroll, we're equally excited as we are about next-gen hcm in terms of what this holds for the future for adp. the challenge for us in terms of as we communicate in -- on november 15, we'll try to figure out a way to address this issue, like we have $15 billion in revenue. so as well as next-gen hcm are going and next-gen payroll is going, it just doesn't -- this is a future impact for adp, so it's not in the next quarter. and i know you're not asking a question necessarily about the next quarter, mark, but i think it was a good opportunity to kind of throw that out there, that what's driving the performance of adp this quarter, this year and for the next two to three years is not going to be that from a financial standpoint. but in terms of positioning the company for the future in terms of growth and creating competitive differentiation and ability to drive new bookings, they are absolutely critical.
so i would say that those measurements, we're still happy and excited by the progress we're seeing with both next-gen hcm as well as next-gen payroll. we have not gone to general availability. so we're selling a lot of next-gen payroll but we're only selling it in, what we call, the core of major accounts right now of the midmarket, which is kind of 50 to 150 and this is no different in terms of the playbook that we use with our transition from our old platform to run in a downmarket and some of our more legacy platforms in midmarket to then our next-gen workforce now version which we're on now.
so we're doing the same thing with next-gen payroll and the same thing with next-gen hcm, which is we're doing it very carefully. we have a very large installed base and we are not -- we're going to eventually move some of those clients and begin to move some of those clients, but we're happy with the business and the cash flow that we have and the client satisfaction scores that are at record levels on our existing platform. so we do not have any -- this is not -- we're not panicking. there's no sense of crisis and there is no -- we have urgency, but no crisis because i want to make sure people hear that. like i don't want you to think that we don't have a sense of urgency, because the faster we get these two solutions to scale, the faster we beat the competition.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
i appreciate that. and thanks for the color there. on the peo growth, can you talk a little bit about two different dimensions? one would be the growth that you're seeing kind of in the established states relative to some of the less mature states and to what extent are you seeing less mature states really catch on, particularly given the legislative and regulatory backdrop? and then secondly, how should we think about just health insurance costs, now that elective surgeries are starting to come back, elective procedures are starting to come back? what sort of impact would that end up having just on the overall pricing? i know that you're not necessarily impacted directly from a margin perspective, but just thinking about the demand environment.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. it's a great question. i'll take the second part of the question. so hopefully, you'll forget about the first part, because we don't have -- we try to prepare for everything and that one, we'll have to follow up with you on in terms of what regions or what states were strongest in terms of our -- so i'm going to suspect that they were all strong because honestly, like, the peo results were off the charts, so there can't be any state that wasn't in strong double-digit growth, but will follow up on that question.
on the healthcare rates question, you're right, that we're not directly impacted, but you're also right to imply that we're indirectly impacted because it does matter. right? it matters to our clients, what they're paying for healthcare. and i hate to be so simplistic, but i think with dr. regression to the mean and large economies, the healthcare world and insurance companies are also similar in terms of they regress. right? so losses have an uncanny way of regressing to the mean. that's why i always caution people when all of a sudden someone thinks that they have this big decline in either workers' comp costs or healthcare costs, it usually doesn't work that way. it's usually something that explains it and it usually regresses back to the mean.
so i think if i can try to answer what i think is the implication of your question, there was a temporary decline in things like elective surgery and frankly healthcare in general. people even stopped going to their primary care physicians and so forth. that decreased healthcare costs temporarily. and i hate to use that word transitory that is now the favorite word it seems to talk about inflation, but it's very clear that, that was transitory and that healthcare costs will come back. and so i think to the extent you had below-normal renewals, which would be our situation, right, because we don't take risk on healthcare, so we wouldn't see it in our margins and in our cost structure, but to the extent that we had below-normal renewals, we would expect those renewals to go back to normal because we would expect as healthcare costs go back to normal slowly, that those costs would have to be passed through.
when you look at the healthcare insurance companies as much as -- as much criticism as they get, they are largely pass-through entities. they're paying hospitals and providers and other healthcare costs, prescription drugs, etc. and it's really not a business where you can say, ""oh, we can't pass this 10% increase in healthcare costs"" because their margins aren't even 10%. and so that business is very, very straightforward, which is they try to earn a markup or margins for doing what they do in terms of managing networks, etc., but in the end, they have to pass those costs through. we have to also, because we're a taxable entity as well and i think those who take risk on healthcare will probably see those costs go up over some period of time.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
appreciate the comments. look forward to seeing you on the 15th.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer

this concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. i'm pleased to hand the program over to carlos rodriguez for closing remarks.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
so there's not much more i can say as we really had terrific results. i want to thank don for joining and i think you're all going to be very happy to meet him and get the benefit of his experience in adp, more broadly, besides just in the finance organization because he has kind of real world business experience within adp as well.
the -- i just want to end the way i usually end which is thanking our organization and particularly our frontline associates, because i'm not sure what's going on at other companies, but we would not be able to get our goals accomplished without people going above and beyond. i think we mentioned the tight labor market and that we're a little bit behind in terms of our hiring. that means our people are working extra hard. and economists says that's an increase in productivity. i'd say that's just people working hard and we really appreciate it, our clients appreciate it, i think our shareholders appreciate it.
i don't think a lot of them listen to this call, but you should be aware that, whether it's here or in other companies, there's a lot of people out there that are pushing really hard to deliver and many of us, whether we are as consumers or buyers of products and business and so on, we're frustrated by what's happening in terms of supply chain and some of these other things, but all i see is a bunch of people working really, really hard to try to, like, fulfill the needs of our clients. and i think that's happening across the whole economy and i think we need to show a little bit of patience with with each other, because this will all, i think, normalize as this variant now recedes. i mean you're seeing already in some of the mobility data, things will slowly get back to normal, people will come back into the labor force and this great economy that we have will function the way it's supposed to function.
but in the meantime, i want to thank our associates for what they've done so far, whether it's this last quarter and what they're going to have to do to get through this year-end, which is going to be very challenging, given the volumes we have and the capacity we have. so, for that, i thank them, but i also thank all of you for listening and for being supporters of adp. thank you.

operator
good morning. my name is michelle, and i'll be your conference operator. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to adp's first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. i would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] thank you.
i will now turn the conference over to mr. danyal hussain, vice president, investor relations. please go ahead.
danyal hussain -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, michelle. and good morning everyone and welcome to adp's first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. participating today are carlos rodriguez, our president and ceo; and don mcguire, our cfo.
earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. our earnings materials are available on the sec website and our investor relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call.
during our call, we will reference non-gaap financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that excludes the impact of certain items. a description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measures can be found in our earnings release.
today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involves some risks. we encourage you to review our filings with the sec for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.
and with that, let me turn it over to carlos.
carlos rodriguez -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, danny. and thank you everyone for joining our call. i'd like to start by welcoming don mcguire, our new cfo. don has been with adp since 1998 when he joined the adp canada team as a vp of finance. he's held a series of roles with increasing responsibility, most recently serving as president of our international business where he has done a phenomenal job of driving growth and profitability in a very complex environment. i know he's looking forward to meeting all of you.
now, moving on to the quarter. we are pleased to have delivered a very strong start to the year with 10% revenue growth and a 140 basis points of margin expansion, resulting in a 17% increase in adjusted diluted eps. while we did expect our q1 revenue growth to be above our prior full-year guidance range, this result was still above our initial forecast and underscores the strong position we are in as we emerge from the pandemic. i'll let don go through the details after i cover some highlights.
our es new business bookings results were very strong, representing another record q1 bookings amount and we're ahead of our expectations with outperformance driven by continued strength in our hr portfolio and our international business. with this impressive bookings performance across the enterprise, we're pleased to raise our es bookings guidance for the year after just one quarter, as we're now feeling even more confident about our sales momentum.
even stronger was our peo bookings performance, which was also well ahead of our expectations and a key reason that we're raising our guidance for average worksite employee growth for the year, as don will outline for you.
as you will recall, we've been sharing our sales productivity trends over the course of the pandemic, and i'm pleased to report that in q1, we were well above pre-pandemic levels. we reached this result several months sooner than we expected and we expect this to continue as we look ahead.
our es retention remained incredibly strong as well. as we shared last quarter, we believed it was reasonable to assume a slight step back in retention from the record 92.2% level we experienced last year. but in q1, we did not see meaningful deterioration. instead, we actually saw further improvement in our overall es retention to a new record q1 level despite a modest decline in our small business division, where out-of-business losses started to trend back to more normal levels compared to the below-normal levels last year. we're continuing to assume a slight decline in our retention outlook for the year, but clearly, we are pleased with our performance so far and the upward revision in our retention outlook reflects the strong q1 performance. our es pays-per-control was solid with 7% growth in the quarter, about in line with our expectations.
we fielded a number of questions these past several months about what we think might drive workers back into the labor force. while we don't have an answer to that question, what we can tell you is that we continue to see positive trends. our clients are eager to hire and we are seeing workers return to the labor force, even if it's gradual. as a result, we expect to benefit from above-normal -- an above-normal level of pays-per-control growth over the course of the year.
in addition to the very strong es performance, our peo delivered another stellar quarter with 15% revenue growth and 15% average worksite employee growth, even better than the high expectations we had coming into the quarter. there were multiple drivers to the outperformance in the peo, including the strong level of hiring within the client base, resilient retention and the improved bookings performance i mentioned earlier. we are very pleased with the momentum we see building in the peo and we're raising our full year guidance accordingly.
in addition to the financial highlights, there are a few product highlights i wanted to share with you. first, i'm excited to share that we completed the initial rollout of our new user experience for run. as we shared with you last quarter, this represents the most comprehensive refresh we've done since the launch of run and we're very proud that in a matter of a quarter, we were able to seamlessly move hundreds of thousands of clients to a new and better user experience. early signs indicate that client satisfaction scores should trend even higher than the record levels we already have in our small business division. so it's a really great outcome and represents a very strong execution by the team.
i'd like to also share that at the annual hr tech conference a few weeks ago, our innovative diversity, equity and inclusion tool on the data cloud platform was named a top hr product. this recognition adds to adp's long-standing history of award wins at the conference, marking an unprecedented seventh consecutive year adp has been honored for its innovative hcm technology. you can probably tell from the number of times we've highlighted data cloud, that our velocity of innovation has increased significantly there.
with this de&i solution as an example, we've seen over 50% of active users of this solution take action and realize positive impact on their de&i measures. i'm proud that we provide solutions that drive real positive change for our clients. this seven-year track record demonstrates that innovation is part of adp's dna and that we have a strong growing agile r&d team committed to delivering solutions in the market that continue to push the boundary of what hcm solutions can do for employers and their employees.
as i said before, we're very pleased with the fantastic start to the year. we look forward to sharing even more of the adp story with you at the upcoming investor day in november.
and now, i'll turn the call over to don for more detail on the quarter and the outlook.
don mcguire -- chief financial officer
thank you, carlos. and to everyone on the call, good morning and nice to meet you.
our first quarter represented a strong start to the year with 10% revenue growth on both a reported and organic constant currency basis. our adjusted ebit margin was up 140 basis points, much better than expected, and was supported by higher revenue and overall cost containment. our tax rate was up slightly in the quarter versus last year, but we also benefited from the elevated pace of share repurchases following our debt issuance in may. combined, those factors contributed to a 17% increase in our adjusted diluted earnings per share.
moving on to the segments. our employer services revenue increased 8% on a reported and organic constant currency basis. our strong q1 es bookings performance and record retention contributed to this performance, though, as a reminder, we did continue to lap some of the lower revenues we had last year in some of our volume-related businesses, including recruiting and background screening. our clients funding interest represented only a slight headwind in the quarter as our 40 basis point decline in average yield was offset by fantastic balanced growth of 22%, driven by client growth, employment growth, higher wages and the lapping of the payroll tax deferral last year. es margin increased 150 basis points on strong revenue performance and overall cost containment.
as carlos mentioned, our peo had another terrific quarter. average worksite employees increased 15% year-over-year to 629,000 and revenues excluding zero-margin pass-throughs grew 20%, supported once again by favorable mix trends within the peo employee base, as well as improving sui rates. total peo revenue grew 15%, which included a modest drag from lower zero-margin pass-through growth and worksite employee growth, as expected. peo margin was up 70 basis points in the quarter, driven by operating leverage.
overall, our q1 results reflect a very strong start to the year and delivered ahead of our expectations on practically all fronts.
let me now turn to our updated outlook for fiscal 2022. for es revenues, we now expect growth of 5% to 6%, which we're raising 50 basis points at the midpoint. this is driven by several underlying factors. we're raising our expected range of es new bookings growth to 12% to 16%. as we mentioned, we had a better than expected performance in q1 and reached pre-pandemic productivity earlier than we had forecasted. we haven't made significant changes to our rest of year outlook at this point, but if momentum remains as strong as we've seen it, then we may see opportunity to deliver additional upside.
we are also raising our es retention and we are now assuming a decline of 50 basis points off of fy '21s all-time highs versus our prior outlook of a decline of 75 basis points. as with bookings, this is primarily a function of the strong q1 performance. our continued assumption is that as clients continue to reengage in the marketplace, we may experience a slight decline over the course of the year. we expect to have significantly more clarity once we get through the calendar year end period where we typically see most of the switching activity. for u.s. pays-per-control, we're making no change to our outlook of 4% to 5% growth. we continue to expect a gradual recovery in the overall labor market, and the 7% growth in q1 was about in line with our expectations.
and then for our client funds interest revenue, we're raising our outlook by about $15 million to a range of $420 million to $430 million as we're raising our balance growth assumptions by about 4% to growth of 12% to 14%. our outlook for client funds yield, meanwhile, is unchanged despite the improvement in the yield environment, primarily as our stronger balance performance actually created a temporary mix shift to overnight investments until new securities are gradually purchased. but that said, the favorable shift in the yield curve is clearly helpful to us and will certainly benefit our multi-year client funds outlook, all else equal.
for es margin, we now expect an increase of about 75 to 100 basis points, up from our prior range of 50 to 75 basis points. while we did outperform meaningfully on margin in q1, we are also seeing some additional expenses over the rest of the year, including higher headcounts in our outsourcing businesses. meanwhile, we continue to expect transformation initiative benefits, including our digital transformation to offset a year-over-year increase in facilities, t&e expenses and other return-to-office expenses.
moving on to the peo. we now expect peo revenues to grow 11% to 13%; average worksite employees to grow 11% to 13%; and revenues excluding zero-margin pass-throughs to grow 12% to 14%. this 2 percentage point ratings across the board is a function of both our strong q1 bookings and overall performance, as well as an expectation from stronger hiring within our peo base to contribute over the remainder of the year. our peo is very well-positioned to capitalize on growing levels of client demand coming out of the pandemic. and if we continue to drive outsized bookings performance over the rest of the year, that could represent further upside to our outlook.
following our strong start to the year, we now expect a range of flat-to-down 50 basis points for the year for an improvement from our prior expectation of down 25 to 75 basis points on our margin. as a reminder, we are growing over a very strong margin result in fiscal 2021 and are also expecting elevated selling expenses this year from strong bookings performance.
putting it all together for our consolidated outlook, we now expect revenue to grow 7% to 8%. following the strong 10% q1 performance, we now expect the remaining quarters to grow closer to 7%, which is higher than our prior forecast. for adjusted ebit margin, we now expect an increase of 50 to 75 basis points. as we shared last quarter, we expect our margin improvement to be back half-weighted, most specifically in the fourth quarter. our current expectation is for a slight margin decline in q2 and q3. we're making no change to our tax rate assumption. and with these changes, we now expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 11% to 13%.
as i think you've heard us say a couple of times now, we are very pleased with our q1 results and we're happy to be raising our guidance this early in the year. this is still a dynamic environment and there are a wide range of potential outcomes, and we believe our guidance is appropriately balanced, given these conditions. however, should our associates continue to drive better than expected sales results, client satisfaction, efficiency and service implementation, we would see opportunity to deliver additional upside to our outlook.
before we move to q&a, i wanted to share two things. first, i look forward to meeting everyone, perhaps virtually for now, but eventually in person as we get back out on the road to meet our shareholders and the investment community. and second is that we are very much looking forward to our upcoming investor day in a couple of weeks on november 15. having run one of our largest businesses for years, i can tell you, there is always much happening here at adp underground. and although it all tends to roll up to a very stable financial picture, i can tell you, there is really a lot of excitement among our associates for the things they're working on. we hope to share some of that excitement with you in november.
and with that, i'll now turn it back over to the operator for q&a.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from mark marcon with baird. your line is now open.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
good morning. congratulations on the strong results. wondering if you can talk a little bit about what you think is the sustainability of the margin improvement that you've seen, particularly in light of the catch-up, not for the remainder of this year but just as we think a little bit beyond this year. that's the first question and then the second question would just be you're seeing an improvement with regards to your retention rate.
can you talk about how much of that do you think is due to the service center consolidation versus maybe leveraging some of the enhanced assets that you have such as the data cloud? thank you.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
thank you for the question. i think on the sustainability front, i think that just to kind of refer you back to jan's comments about remaining committed to the commitments we made at our 2018 investor day, where i think we laid out multi-year, i think, commitments around margin expansion. so i'd refer you back to that because it's, again, we want to kind of stick to the way we normally do things here, which is we provide guidance one year at a time, but i think that will give you some sense of i think our expectations of what the business is capable of doing over multiple years.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
you did, carlos. you're outperforming this year and so i didn't know if that outperformance this year would thereby potentially impact kind of a cadence on a go-forward basis, if that makes sense.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
i appreciate that. so, let me again go back to maybe some of the things that jan was, i think, talking about in his comments that are important. probably a good thing for us to talk about on the call today, we are committed to the, i guess, the outcomes that we talked about in june of 2018 but we're also committed to doing it in a thoughtful and careful manner, which is the way i described in my comments around this ""transformation effort"" that we are undergoing here. what that means is that as an example in the case of this service alignment initiative or the voluntarily retirement, these are fairly large projects that affect a lot of people, a lot of parts of the business.
and frankly, we're -- in both cases, we're doing these things for the first time. and so we have plans and we have contingency plans and we have plans on top of the plans and then what we do is we react to then the circumstances. and i think what's happened here, as jan described, is -- it worked out great on a spreadsheet that we were going to back fill a certain percentage of the people who were in voluntarily retirement. and i just want to point out that we -- even though it was good for associates and it was good for the company, we did lose a lot of knowledge and experience as a result of this voluntarily retirement.
and it was important to plan carefully around that and to make sure that we continue to execute around client service and the other things that are important to maintain retention and other parts of the business. so, it's not just about cost cutting. it's about strengthening the business. and what that means is that sometimes you get that a little bit -- it's not perfect the perfect science in terms of the spreadsheets.
and i think we really got a lot of benefit in the first and second quarter that we didn't anticipate. so, we're just trying to be transparent here in the sense that i'm very committed to making sure that besides achieving the cost reduction goals, which we clearly have, that we also continue to achieve the client service, the associate satisfaction, and the retention goals that we also have that are incredibly important to the sustainability, back to your sustainability point. so, i could probably go in a lot of other details on things that helped us in the quarter but i think i would just have us -- i would bring us back to kind of our longer term commitments and i think our public commitments around the 2018 investor day. and as excited as we are about the quarter, i don't think that it fundamentally changes -- well, it was hard not to be excited.
i mean, it was a great quarter. we've clearly done incredible -- made an incredible progress at our cost structure while still improving our client satisfaction scores while still improving retention. there's a lot to like in the quarter, but we're here to try to build a long-term sustainable, successful business. and that means that we have to do it in a thoughtful and careful manner.
one of things that i've been very worried about is making sure that we are backfilling at an appropriate rate to maintain those those client satisfaction scores.
jan siegmund -- chief financial officer
and maybe, mark, i take the retention question. i would point you to two things. so some of our broader product portfolio helps us, data cloud certainly an attachment to that, adding value to our clients. but the two most impact -- important point is that i can see is, a, the client satisfaction and client service scores really nice -- develop nicely and we see a strong correlation between client satisfaction, net promoter scores, and retention.
so, service has been really stable and improving over time and that it's a very broad-based improvement in our nps scores in the business. and secondly, maybe a little bit more more detail, as you know, we finished and finalized the upgrading of our major account time base, which had put pressure onto our retention rates. and now with our clients being on the current workforce now, we have seen really for many quarters now steady improvement in the retention rates as we grow over the impact of that migration effort. those are probably the two most important factors that have driven the good retention this year -- this quarter.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
great. congratulations on the strong quarter.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator 
thank you. our next question comes from tien-tsin huang with j.p. morgan. your line is now open.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks. good results here. i just want to clarify the margin again, if you don't mind. how much of the raise was due to the transformation initiative, the retirement savings coming sooner than expected or just finding more savings than originally expected? maybe can you go through those numbers again, jan?
jan siegmund -- chief financial officer
yeah. it's a little bit hard to completely decompose every source of margin expansion because the fundamental source of our productivity is growing our labor force slower than revenues. and so we have a number of factors and initiatives that drive toward that. we had an early retirement program that help but we had also, for example, in i.t.
infrastructure a fundamental reorganization that improved the processes, we have reduced call volumes. the transformation office has really a myriad of initiatives that all really aim for the same thing, driving labor productivity, if you want, because that's our business model. we're highly levered. we're not capital intensive, and so we're focusing on our big costs lack of labor productivity.
and so that's no.1. so, these initiatives are it's really academic to isolate them because it -- they overlap in the thinking. and no. 2 is we did see in the second quarter and i think we tried to indicate that in the first quarter also that catch up on the refill has been a little bit slower.
and that's not because we wanted it to be slower but it is -- it has just happened that way in the execution, which benefited the margin but it's really not where we wanted the business to come out. so i think in my comments, i said we're estimating the full range of verb impact to be still $150 million on a run rate basis but split the middle here kind of, let's say, it's maybe $120 million this year of impact of verb, if that's helpful.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
versus the $100 million before. ok. ok. and then just one quick follow up on the bookings side, understood that there was a little bit of slippage.
have those deals since closed? is that what's giving you confidence that you can still deliver the 6% to 8%, because we all know that the comps have been tough. you've been clear about that. so just trying to better understand your confidence there. thank you.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
so i think that we do have some visibility, obviously, into what's happening in january here. and i think that one of the things that i mentioned in my comments was with the calendar. and it's a little it's not -- it's a little embarrassing because we did have a little bit of a miss in our planning process of some changes in the calendar that moved the number of selling days from year over year. so as an example, last year the way the calendar fell, we had a number of days around the holidays that were with -- that this year we didn't have in terms of ability to sell.
and so i think that gives us some comfort that we had some movement from one quarter to the other because we do have some visibility into the january results. so i think some of it is pure calendar but again at the risk of -- we don't want to be the company that talks about weather causing issues. now this isn't a weather issue but calendars are also something that you have to be careful. it's a slippery slope of always blaming the calendar and we typically wouldn't even bring it up, but it was pretty clear as we laid out, started looking after the quarter ended at the calendar that we had an issue from a planning standpoint.
and we didn't anticipate that, and hence, we didn't communicate it to -- because we didn't know. we didn't figure it out. we didn't communicate it externally.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
fair enough. thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from ramsey el-assal with barclays. your line is now open.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. so just to be clear, the implication is that on the booking side, the deceleration this quarter was really more due to the calendar and to timing. so should we anticipate next quarter kind of a snap back to a healthier level?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
well, that's a good follow-up question, which i can't answer because we only have one month done. and so i was trying to give as much color without breaking our protocol of we provide guidance once a year. we don't provide quarterly guidance and we really don't talk about the quarter that we're in the middle of now. so i think i would just refer you back to our confirmation of our 6% to 8% guidance for es new business booking,s which i think gives you some sense that we anticipate that the third quarter will have some bounce back because that's just mathematical.
i'm not providing any change in guidance, but i also would caution you that february and march are still in front of us.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
fair enough. fair enough. i wanted to ask also about the early retirement program and the backfill hiring. could you give us any incremental kind of color commentary on whether the early retirement -- the folks who opted in for early retirement, were they localized in any particular part of the organization.
is there any -- is a slowdown in the backfill hiring related to the fact that there were certain skills maybe that left the organization that are sort of more difficult to bring back in or is it just -- was it broad based? any additional color there would be helpful.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
great -- good question. i think one of the challenges from a planning standpoint on a voluntarily retirement program, which for the record is the first time adp does it. so not making excuses but we don't have a ton of experience in terms of -- we tried to talk to experts and other folks to help us anticipate what the take rate would be and in what areas and so forth. but there is a certain amount of uncertainty just because it's ""voluntary."" and so it was impossible for us to predict exactly where it was going to end up happening.
i would say that it was as you could would expect, it was broad based since it is voluntarily early retirement program and our associate tenure and experience tends to be spread across the entire organization. so i think it was -- there may have been one or two places where there was a little bit more a higher percentage than in other areas in terms of the take rate. but i think in general, it was broad based geographically and broad based by function and by business unit with slight variability within. and so the real issue here has been our inability to predict how quickly we would be able to backfill those positions.
there's no other kind of problem or underlying issue other than we've never done this before and we anticipated and put in the plan and communicated in our guidance a certain pace, and we've not been able to achieve that pace. and i think the final comment i would make on that is that it feels to me like that has been strictly a question of execution on the hiring itself. but as jan said, some of it could be since there's no scientific way to parse all of these different factors, the business has been performing very well. jan mentioned that we have had reductions in call volumes.
we have had improve -- we're confirming our guidance on retention so you can see that we're feeling good about the progress around retention. so all of those things i think ease the pressure to backfill quickly. so it's partly a combination of the execution on the back-fills and the business is just performing better. and we just need to wait a couple more quarters to, i think, let that all play out but our plan currently is to try to catch up, as we mentioned in our comments, on some of that backfill hiring to make sure that we have the right number of implementation people and service people to maintain the high client satisfaction scores.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
got it. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from james faucette with morgan stanley. your line is open.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you very much. i wanted to just ask a quick follow-up question on the bookings from the previous quarter. clearly the calendar played a big role, but were you seeing any other implications from whether it be the weakness in the overall economy or -- i'm sorry, in the stock market or government shutdown in the month of january that was having any impact on bookings activity at all that you could be perhaps attributable to something other than the calendar? and then also as for as -- i wanted to touch on acquisitions, and that's obviously been part of hbp strategy for a while.
so just an update on how [inaudible] acquisition is going. that integration and any surprises that you've seen either for better or worse. thank you.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
i'll let jan talk about the acquisitions. but on the on the topic of kind of general environment and the impact on our new business bookings, we usually have some i guess anecdotal stories and i'm sure some people in our sales force will take some exception because they probably heard some noise around uncertainty and government shutdown and so forth. but i think that based on the experience i have which we haven't been having been through so many cycles that i have an infinite amount of experience but it doesn't feel like there is a main major factor, at least in our business results. and again, i hate to keep going back to our january results because we typically don't talk about our results in the current quarter.
but those -- it feels more like a calendar issue than an issue around shutdown or the economy or the stock market. it has to have some impact somewhere, especially on a few larger deals. larger companies tend to become a little bit more cautious and pull in their horns when they see trouble on the horizon. but you saw our adp national employment report this morning, you see other factors out there that indicate a slowing of growth and a slowing of positive trends but not anything that smells or feels to us like a major economic slowdown.
so i would have to say that we have yet to see anything of the sort that would lead us to believe that there's something happening in the general environment. there have to be at least one or two large deals where maybe some specific industries a couple of large companies decided to maybe delay a decision or whatnot, but it hasn't gotten to my level. i haven't heard about that yet.
jan siegmund -- chief financial officer
and just as an add on and a reminder, adp has really no exposure to servicing the federal government in our services so we had also zero impact on the shutdown relative to our services because we don't serve the federal government in any meaningful way. no. 2, [inaudible] -- just as a reminder, [inaudible] was an acquisition that we -- is augmenting our multinational offering, strengthening what is already a very differentiated service that we have and it's performing really well. so we had no surprises on the negative side relative to the product and the software.
it will become our go-forward platform for all of our services and in the streamlined business portion of our multinational thing. the pipeline is strong and we're ahead of our own business case. so we're really pleased with that acquisition.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from james schneider with goldman sachs. your line is now open.
james schneider -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question. i guess, first of all, not to beat a dead horse on the bookings front, but can you maybe talk about the menu business environment and the selling season as it relates to the kind of competitive environment you're seeing, both on the mid-market and upmarket as well as on the down, where you've been executing very well? maybe talk about whether anything's really changing from a competitive or pricing standpoint that may be affecting any deal closures or whether you still have confidence this really is just a calendar thing.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief operating officer
i think the mid-market and the upmarket remain highly competitive, which i think we've talked about in prior quarters, but it's no different than it has been in any other quarters. so again back to beating a dead horse. i think that we feel like there's some some other issues that i think may have led to the weakness in terms of our bookings because the competitive environment seems to be consistently competitive. i was in atlanta last week meeting with some salespeople and to try to get some firsthand exposure to the things that we're encountering out in the marketplace in the mid-market, the upmarket and i also talked to some folks in the down market and i feel -- we feel good about our product lineup.
we feel good, as we always have, about our excellent sales force and their ability to execute and i think we feel that despite some of the noise in the system, we feel pretty good about where the economy is. so it's hard really to pinpoint anything specific around competition or the economy or anything else to give you any additional color. i wish there were something that we could point to concretely so that we can then deal with it. but there's really there's really nothing that we see in our way of being able to continue to achieve our objectives.
jan siegmund -- chief financial officer
i think maybe a little bit more detail maybe too much sausage making here but no. 1 is, you will recall, that we in the last few quarters strengthened our enterprise segments offering by also now offering workforce now into the enterprise space and that's a strategic move that has played out well and has resulted in a nice new logo growth for the enterprise space. so we're very pleased with that progress that we have been making. and another comment regarding pricing, actually i think the more broader discounting and also credits declines, all or indicators of the health of the business, have been improving in the quarter.
i think largely driven also by an improvement in the service quality that's now starting to resonate in the market and helping also sales. so there's a there's a bunch of positive things kind of underlining helping a little bit.
james schneider -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's helpful. and then then, i guess, on the flip side of that, you continue to raise your revenue guidance and obviously, i'm guessing that a big part of that is better retention. even though you don't disclose it quarterly, but is it fair to say that you would expect, given everything you just said on the call about client satisfaction, that you'd be biased toward the the upper end of their retention guidance for the full year?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
no. i think you have -- yes we have a lot of optimism about our business and about the progress but we really do try to hit it down the fairway in terms of our guidance. like we really do have issues around fx in the second half. i mean, we have -- again we -- fx could change because we can't predict what rates are going to be at the end of the third quarter.
but based on what we know today, we're going to have some fx headwinds, we have some acquisitions that we lap, and we have specific things that we anticipate will will slow our revenue growth a little bit, as we've mentioned in the in the comments. so we really -- it's hard to get these things all 100% correct, but we give you what we know.
james schneider -- goldman sachs -- analyst
fair enough. thank you.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
and also sorry -- one more and just because it's a fairly important one i think young touched on it and i'm really getting a question about it yet, which by the way i appreciate because it's complicated but the peo did have an unusually strong quarter in terms of its growth rate as a result of this kind of sui pull forward, which it's real sausage making and it really flips around in the third quarter. so there's really no change. it's just a timing issue that we pulled some revenues into the second quarter versus the third. it's really an accounting issue and i wouldn't spend a lot of time on it, but it is important to know that so that you don't multiply times four because that is definitely a very isolated and very identifiable benefit to the second quarter that we do not get in the third or the fourth.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from samad samana with jefferies. your line is now open.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my questions. so, carlos, i think you mentioned in a couple of times that the company hasn't been able to achieve the backfill ramp as expected. i'm curious.
is the company struggling to attract talent or is there something that isn't in adp's control as far as not being able to back-fill it fast enough or is it that we're on a tight labor market and you're having trouble hiring? i guess, maybe just double click on that for a little bit -- for us a little bit. and then how reliant is your guidance for the rest of the year on backfilling or catching up on this backfill? and is there at some point where your guidance is at risk?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think i tried in my comments that maybe didn't come across clearly in terms of second half of my comments that i don't think it's a matter that we haven't been able to. i think i spent a few minutes also talking about how it's possible that we didn't need to and it's just hard to know at this point in time how much scientifically is one thing versus the other. the improvements we've had in client satisfaction, the reduction in call volumes, the improvements in business execution, all of those things take off pressure in terms of the immediacy of the need to backfill. and so that could be a factor in this.
so not i'm not ready to say that we have been unable to attract people and backfill. we hire thousands of people per year because we, like all companies, have a natural rate of turnover as a result of normal retirements and also just people departing for other opportunities. so again a not going to get into the sausage making in terms of how many people we hire every year. but suffice to say that it's thousands of people and we're talking about here in terms of backfilled is in the hundreds.
so absolutely not a factor that we can't attract talent.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and then maybe just one follow up on the product side, you mentioned selling workforce now in the enterprise as well. and we've heard some feedback that the company is no longer actively selling vantage. is that something that that's happening where workforce now is replacing vantage as well in the enterprise focus then.
and is that leading to any kind of change in maybe the buying patterns in the enterprise where or is that sometimes push out. thanks again for taking my questions.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
well, we really -- we saw that after getting some extra help and doing some analysis on market needs, we saw the workforce now opportunity in the upmarket as really an incremental opportunity in a segment of the market that we weren't serving as well as we could with vantage and some of the other solutions that we have. so the answer is no. we're still selling vantage in the market. it tends to be to a higher average sized client that's slightly more complex and the workforce now solution tends to be a slightly smaller average sized client and slightly less complex within the enterprise space.
i'm talking -- these are all large clients. so i'm talking all about the upmarket but there are just different segments of the upmarket and i think yan mentioned that based on our logo growth, we have some sense that it's incremental. i'm not going to -- we're not gonna get into details of how much is one versus the other but i think overall, it feels like the pie got a little bit bigger by us selling workforce now. we always -- we've been selling workforce now force for many years but our -- i think our level of execution and focus on that was not as high as it's been in the last, call it, 12 to 18 months.
and it seems to be working very very well, particularly against certain competitors.
jan siegmund -- chief financial officer
yeah. we continue to invest into vantage. so absolutely vantage is part of the lineup in our enterprise space among the workforce now and globalview and streamline for that -- for multinational solutions so.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. appreciate you guys taking my questions. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jason kupferberg with bank of america merrill lynch. your line is open.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey. thanks, guys. so obviously a lot of focus on bookings here. i was hoping you could give us some of the -- just forward revenue sensitivity to a 1% change in bookings growth.
i feel like in the past you had talked about some of those kind of rules of thumb there.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
about $15 million in revenue. remember that clearly if this is a timing issue from quarter to quarter it's really not that big of a deal for us longer term because retention is a bigger driver. i think retention is four times the impact. for 1% of retention, it's a much bigger number it's $50 to $60 million.
jan siegmund -- chief financial officer
five times.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
sorry. five times the impact, i'm being told. so that's why -- from a business execution standpoint, we have to have our new business bookings grow over time at the rate that we have put out there in order to grow the business overall. but the retention rate is, which we haven't gotten many questions about, is equally, if not more, important.
and we experienced that firsthand two or three years ago. we've now fixed that, very proud of it and we're trying to take a little bit of credit right here.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. that makes sense. and i was just curious on the downmarket bookings in es because i think you did highlight that as a bright spot. do you feel like you're taking share down market with new business creation, particularly strong salesforce productivity?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
a little bit of, i think, all of the above. i think that we have -- our downmarket business also includes our insurance services business, it includes our retirement business, our 401(k) business and also includes -- we have some time-and-attendance products, so it's really broad based. i think it's just a business that has again been executing exceptionally well after having gotten a much more simplified environment following the upgrades to our new platform run several years ago. they've just continued to create positive momentum and we have been incredibly competitive in the marketplace.
and we can't point to any one factor but some of the things we've talked about around account connect and the partner to work with the partners and the channels. i mean, all those things are blocking and tackling in the trenches and they've just done a terrific job.
jan siegmund -- chief financial officer
the sps business has, i think, just crossed 600,000 clients on runs, so they're celebrating a big milestone for them.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. just one last quick one. you talked about some of the factors driving slower revenue growth in the second half and currency and many lapping were obviously part of the call out there.
but on a kind of underlying organic constant currency basis, how much do you sell should we be thinking about it? i know you had the sui pull forward, so that'll impact peo but outside of that, are there any meaningful factors?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
again, that really does get into the into real sausage making. i'm not sure that other than some of the highlights that we've given you, what other stuff we can get down to that level of detail other than kind of helping you with the math in terms of probably better to focus on first half versus second half. jan probably has a couple of other things that he could add, but i would encourage you -- again, because of the variability from quarter to quarter, to at least look at it on half versus half, first half versus second half.
jan siegmund -- chief financial officer
yeah. i'm trying to -- i'm looking at the factors. there are like a lot of ups and downs here but the fx impact, obviously we isolated the biggest ones that are different from the first half versus the second half. so i think i'm looking here, the fx had been pressure for our revenues about half a percent.
we're expecting that meaningfully higher for the rest of the year and like 30, 40 basis points higher, for example. and then m&a is tapering out, and that's going to give you a few basis points of pressure on the revenue growth as well.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
it's on my list here. i think john probably went through all of them but we talked about the peo pull forward on sui, we talked about fx, we talk about m&a. there's probably a small -- i don't know that we can quantify it exactly but even if we have a bounce back in the third quarter around our new business bookings, there's clearly a revenue implication from the prior quarter right from the current quarter that we're talking about now on the third and fourth quarter so that has a little bit of an impact as well.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. that's very helpful. thanks guys.
christian greyenbuhl -- vice president, investor relations
and, jason, just just to confirm your your question earlier. so, the $15 million that we gave you is a 1% change in new business bookings translating to an annualized $15 million.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. thank you for clarifying.
operator 
thank you. our next question comes from lisa ellis with moffettnathanson. your line is now open.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. first question is on the peo consolidation. obviously paychex has made a couple of acquisitions in the peo space and there remain hundreds of small players in that space.
but i know in the past, carlos, you've mentioned some hesitation around the ability to consolidate that space, given different risk parameters. can you just update us on your view on growth in the peo business and whether that in your view needs to be organic or whether there is an opportunity to do some inorganic consolidation as well?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
thanks for the question, lisa. it's a good question. i think in the case of the peo, one of the things that's a little different from the peo from the rest of our business, and i think that would probably be true for everyone out there, is that when you make an acquisition, you're buying, obviously, platforms, you're buying people, existing clients, but you're also buying historical underwriting decisions. and so i would kind of compare it to -- maybe not a great comparison to a bank or insurance company in the sense that whether or not you're taking risk, you are buying a book of business that you didn't underwrite yourself.
and so that doesn't mean that you can't get comfortable, which is probably what paychex was able to do. you go in and you take samples of clients that have been brought into the book of business, you look at underwriting standards and so it's not it's not it's not possible to do acquisitions in the peo or in banks or an insurance company. that happens, obviously, all the time. but it's generally not adp's style, given that we work so hard to make our business perform as the rest of the adp businesses.
so the things we do, for example, with ace insurance around reinsurance is to really have the revenue growth and the margins and the profit of the peo behave like the typical processing business in adp, that tends to make it hard for us to go out into the marketplace looking for peo acquisitions. it doesn't mean that we're not open for business, so we -- i think we are. we do have this inherent advantage versus some peos in the sense that we have our own internal referral systems because of the thousands of salespeople that we have out on the street. and so we think that that's -- that fuel for our organic growth is something that we should pay more attention to than inorganic growth.
but i'd say we were open to that idea -- into that concept but i think the best way to put it is that the bar is higher than maybe for other types of acquisitions in our company.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
terrific. thank you. and then my follow up is related to cash cards. i know that offering in that acquisition that you've made about a year -- year and a half ago now, it's targeted at this disbursement market, the contract worker market, which elsewhere across the payments world is kind of going like wildfire.
so i'm just wondering can you give us just an update on the progress with that acquisition and the monetization of that product, the traction you're seeing with that product in your base?
jan siegmund -- chief financial officer
thank you, lisa. the global cash card acquisition was the second major acquisition now. it has annualized in the adp portfolio. there's another one that we are very happy about.
we -- it's a fairly strategic move for us to augment our payment capabilities as a leading payroll provider in the country and in the globe really. and we had very good sales success with the global cash card. it augmented our capabilities and the integration of our existing card business with global cash card and the strategic initiatives that we had in our business plans are all making very good progress.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
terrific. thank you.

thank you. and our next question comes from jeff silber with bmo capital markets. your line is now open.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thanks so much. you had commented earlier about the tone of business from your clients. i'm assuming you were mostly referring to the u.s. i know europe is relatively small component of your portfolio, but can you talk about what's going on there?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
that's come off. again, it's all -- thank you. it's a good point because relative to the size of adp, you could say that it's not a huge percentage. it's a pretty good sized business.
we have a very large business in europe that's performing quite well. and so even though there you could argue that there's some deceleration kind of second derivative deceleration, the business is clearly better than it was three years ago, four years ago or five years ago. there is -- unemployment is decreasig. employment is rising.
the environment -- the business environment -- again, there's headlines and then there's the facts on the ground. i think that the economy may not be as good as it was nine months ago, but it's performing pretty well, and i think that's showing in some of our results. i think we had coincidentally to your question, a good quarter in terms of our international bookings, particularly in europe and particularly in france. so we see some some positive pockets and some optimism in europe and that certainly helps our overall performance for the company.
so we're very very happy about that.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
i didn't mean to insult your european business. sorry about that. thanks so much.

thank you. and our next question comes from david grossman with stifel financial. your line is now open.
david grossman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thank you. so, carlos, just based on your comments earlier, it sounds like there's a possibility at least that you may be able to operate with lower headcount without impacting client deliveries. so, if i'm understanding that correctly, how would you use kind of that excess margin? and what does that tell you, if anything, about the incremental potential operating leverage in the business?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief operating officer
that's a great question because i think there was a comment in our script about ""competing demands."" and so we believe that we have an opportunity as we've communicated in our 2018 investor day for improvements in margin in the -- structurally in the business. on the other hand, we're running the company for the long term. i think i mentioned this in the call last quarter that we're turning 70 years old in june of this year and our intention is to continue to invest and build a business that will endure for another 70 years. and so that means that you have to be cautious about becoming too greedy and being too focused on the short term.
and our board is not going to let that happen and we're not gonna let that happen. so i think the -- we're going to be very careful about making sure that whatever improvements we gain from a margin standpoint are not compromising our client satisfaction, not compromising our retention rate, and not compromising our investments in product and r&d.
david grossman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. thank you for that. and i guess the other question gets back to the kind of durability of the model. and i know you said that you're not seeing any signs of economic weakness.
that said, aside from slowed income, which i know there have been some changes in the dynamic since the last recession, but is there any other changes in the business that may suggest it could perform differently if there were another recession in the next 12 to 24 months? and perhaps you could speak specifically to the peo, which i think it grew to the last recession, and just curious whether or not you have any updated thoughts on that, if there was a slowdown and how it may impact that business unit as well.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
it's a great question because we spent a lot of time thinking about making sure that our business is enduring and we spent certainly some amount of time about what our reaction would be to any kind of slowdown. so, i think that the most important thing heading into a slowdown would be to do the things that we are doing now and we're not doing them because we expect a slowdown. we're doing them because it was the right thing to do. having high client satisfaction scores, having strong retention, making sure that you're properly invested in your sales engine, and most importantly, having great products.
and so one of the things that i'm excited about is our next-generation solutions and some of the other investments we've been making in r&d over multiple years are really just -- are in front of us. they're not behind us. so, we only have handfuls of clients and we expect in a few years to have many more and we expect that to make us more competitive and we expect that to lower our cost structure as well. and so if it just so happens that we have a recession in two years and it just so happens that we have our new products really coming to market and getting the traction we expect them to get, then i would expect that we would on a relative basis outperform where we would have performed in the past and where we would see our competitors performing.
so that is, again, one ray of optimism, i think, is that we've been making some investments in the business that they weren't intended to address a recession but they would be particularly handy in case of a recession.
david grossman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
and how about in the context of the peo, would you expect similar performance as we did 10 years ago? or is it just the business is more mature, more heavily penetrated so that would be a lot to expect from that particular business?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
well, i would hope that it would continue to perform the same way because it is a business like some of our businesses where an economic slowdown sometimes creates more discussions and more opportunities. it doesn't mean you can't -- that you don't have to go execute against those and get those deals and get those contracts, which sometimes gets harder in the upmarket as people restrain budgets. but there is an argument to be made potentially that in the peo in a downturn people do look for alternatives and outsourcing opportunities to stabilize and control their own costs, and that creates some opportunities for the peo. it's probably going too far to say that the peo is countercyclical, but it has performed well in the last couple of downturns because we've been through two downturns now since we've owned the peo, and it's performed quite well in both in both settings.
and in just a couple of last thoughts on their previous comments as i thought more about it. heading into a recession, clearly the comment about our ability to run the business with less headcount is accurate and i think that is incredibly helpful, like having a leaner organization with less less complexity, and executing really well is an incredibly important part of having an organization that's prepared for any kind of downturn so that we can weather that.
david grossman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
got it. thanks very much.
operator
thank you. and we have time for one more question. our final question comes from kevin mcveigh with credit suisse. your line is now open.
great. thank you.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thank you. hey, carlos, you've been working hard on the retention. i wonder if you could just give us a little update on that.
you read from the guidance, where kind of most of the progress has been being kind of down, mid, upmarket? and then any thoughts on just the longer term where that can get to?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think -- i hate that -- i know this is terrible to do so but i'd just take you back to our 2018 investor day, where i think we provided some some ideas around where we think retention will go in the next several years. there are some structural issues around retention, particularly in the down market, where out of business i think creates natural turnover in the client base but we still have quite a bit of control of losses in all of our businesses. so i think from the practical answer mathematically is that there's quite a bit of potential still in terms of retention improvement. but the guardrails around that are the reality of history, where i think over long periods of time adp has been able to improve retention structurally over long periods of times, which is very impressive, and that's due probably to a combination of execution higher attach rates and more stickiness of products, associates performing.
there's probably a number of factors but these things have happened in, call it, 20, 25-basis-point increments not one or two percentage points in one year. and so i think it's probably a multi-year, multi-decade effort to just continue to ratchet up retention because any improvements in retention, obviously, are incredibly important in terms of the business model profitability and the lifetime value that we create at the client level. it really makes a huge difference for the economics of the business. so, we're going to continue to focus on it.
and i guess, the simple answer is we still think there's a lot of upside opportunity on retention but it requires us to have great products, which we are just now i think focused on rolling out into the market in certain areas. if you take the example of our downmarket and now our mid-market, you would argue that adp has a lot of potential for improvement in retention.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
and can you remind us, is there a way to quantify how much of the retention is just business failings as opposed to competed away?
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
i think we'll get back to you on that one in terms of overall for adp. if memory serves me correctly, in our downmarket business, it's between 5% and 10% of the overall losses, somewhere in that ballpark are what we call uncontrollable, so bankruptcies and companies going out of business because small businesses start and then they they kind of go out of business. you've seen the stats around what the average life expectancy is for a company that's less than 50 employees or five years it's -- there's a natural churn in that space. as you get into the mid-market, the upmarket, and international, the structural retention rates are much higher.
the potential rates are incredibly high. and on a multinational business, and globalview specifically, 98% to 100% retention is really kind of the expected retention rate there. it's quite a quite a resilient business.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
awesome. thank you.
operator
thank you. this concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. i am pleased to hand the program over to carlos rodriguez for closing remarks.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
so we appreciate your questions today. and as you can see, we're very pleased with the start of the year and we're happy, i think, not just because of the strong financial performance, which we clearly had, but mostly -- most importantly we're very happy about having been able to accomplish that while continuing to improve our client satisfaction scores and in some cases having those reach record high levels. as always, i want to thank our associates. i think they're the ones that are able to -- that allow us to deliver these kinds of record client satisfaction results, which then allow us to deliver the financial results and the great service that we deliver to our clients.
and appreciate their patience and everyone's patience as we continue to enhance and refine our products, our service tools, and as we go through our transformation efforts because i know that change is not easy but clearly our associates have embraced it and we're executing well against the transformation initiatives. we'll obviously continue to be confident in the strategy that we've laid out here over the last couple of years and also the -- what we've been talking about for the last few quarters about the performance of the business this year. and we feel good -- very good about the momentum for the rest of the fiscal year. so with that i thank you for joining us today and i thank you for your continued interest in adp.

after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] thank you. i will now turn the conference over to mr. christian greyenbuhl, vice president, investor relations.
please go ahead.
christian greyenbuhl -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, daniel. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining adp's second-quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call and webcast. with me today are carlos rodriguez, our president and chief executive officer; and jan siegmund, our chief financial officer. earlier this morning, we released our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
these materials are available on the sec's website and our investor relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the quarterly investor presentation that accompanies today's call as well as our quarterly history of revenue and pre-tax earnings by reportable segment. during our call today, we will reference non-gaap financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors, and that exclude the impact of certain items in the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2019 as well as the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2018. description of these items and a reconciliation of these non-gaap measures can be found in our earnings release. today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and as such, involve some risk.
we encourage you to review our filings with the sec for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. as always, please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions. and with that, let me turn the call over to carlos.
carlos rodriguez -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, christian, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. this morning, we reported our second-quarter fiscal 2019 results with revenue of $3.5 billion, up 8% on both the reported and organic constant currency basis. we are pleased with this revenue growth, which was slightly above our expectations and which was aided in part by the continued strength of our employer services downmarket and multinational solutions and our peo. our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 30% to $1.34 and benefited from our strong revenue growth as well as adjusted ebit margin expansion, a lower adjusted effective tax rate, and fewer shares outstanding.
our results this quarter continue to highlight the underlying strength of our business model. as we continue to experience the benefits of operating efficiencies enabled by our ongoing transformation efforts, we also continue to see improvements in our cost base across our businesses and back-office functions. we remain excited with the progress of our investments in technology, including our next-gen solutions and we are also pleased with the performance of our recent acquisitions. as we continue our efforts to accelerate our investments to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our products and services, we also continue to see improvements in our overall client satisfaction scores.
with these positive trends across our businesses, we are reaffirming our expectation of 25 to 50 basis points of improvement in es revenue retention for fiscal 2019. moving on to employer services' new business bookings. this quarter, we saw bookings growth below our expectations with 1% growth for the quarter. as can happen in some years, the timing of the december holidays and our own selling calendar played a larger-than-anticipated role, which resulted in a number of deals, particularly within the mid- and upmarket, pushing into the third fiscal quarter.
while we see a similar pattern from time to time, the impact this year was a bit more pronounced than typical. and it's also important to remember that new business bookings has inherent variability quarter to quarter. with that said, we continue to see strong bookings performance in our downmarket, multinational, and hro businesses, and largely pleased with our product positioning, win rates, and overall sales strategy. for these reasons, despite the lower-than-expected growth this quarter, we are maintaining our forecast of 6% to 8% es new business bookings growth for fiscal 2019.
now, i would like to expand on my earlier comments regarding the progress of our transformation initiatives and then touch on some strategic and operational business highlights. first, looking internally, as we discussed at our june 2018 investor day, we have launched a number of initiatives across the organization with the objective of enhancing both our operating efficiency and our go-to-market strategy. as you can see from this quarter's results, our efforts to streamline operations while also enhancing the client experience, are paying off. we are clearly seeing the benefits of these transformation efforts help our overall margin performance.
in addition, we feel good about the progress we are making as we transform our service and we continue to see broad-based positive trends in our client satisfaction scores, which for some of our businesses are now at record-high levels. i am pleased with what we have achieved to date and with our ability to remain on track as we tackle various competing demands. i am especially proud of how our associates are helping us manage through these change initiatives in a thoughtful and careful way. now, moving on to an area of key strategic differentiation, our leading data analytics and benchmarking solution, adp data cloud.
as the world of work evolves and companies and their employees increasingly demand greater access to timely and insightful data, we believe that adp is well-positioned to leverage our broad-based hcm data set to further empower our clients' frontline managers and key decision makers. with these capabilities in mind, we recently expanded the use of adp data cloud to deepen our relationship with key distribution channel partners. one example of this is through our current cpa-centric data product, accountant connect, which gives cpas the ability to see their clients' payroll reports, tax forms, and notifications while also providing them with the essential practice management tools all in one place. we are always looking for new ways to leverage the strength of our data and the breadth of our hcm services to generate additional opportunities for growth.
and at the beginning of november, we excited -- we announced an exciting new partnership with intuit, which now further strengthens the services we offer to accountants. through this initiative, we have expanded our integration with quick books, adding an enhanced general ledger interface that maps directly through accountant connect. this new cloud-based interface combines the financial and transactional capabilities of quick books with the deep data pool available through adp's data cloud, and will help accountants save time while also providing access to award-winning compensation insights to help improve their client's business as we head into tax season. we are proud to be able to provide product and insights like these to our clients to further empower them.
last week, we were equally proud to be selected as one of fortune magazine's world's most admired companies for the 13th consecutive year. i am pleased that our efforts have been consistently recognized, especially as we make steady progress on our transformation amid a dynamic business environment. it is an honor to once again be among the most-admired companies in the world and this is a testament to the commitment of our associates, clients, and partners to drive innovation as we work together to change the world of work. overall, we are pleased with our progress and remain confident in our long-term strategy as we continue our efforts to deliver on our transformation initiatives.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to jan for his commentary on the second-quarter results in fiscal 2019 outlook.
jan siegmund -- chief financial officer
thank you, carlos, and good morning, everyone. our consolidated revenue this quarter was a $3.5 billion, up 8% on a reported and organic constant currency basis. and as carlos said, this was slightly ahead of our own expectations. this quarter, we continue to experience the incremental benefit from the sales momentum we generated last year as well as the steady improvement in the performance of our peo.
the peo results were particularly strong in part to a better due to better contribution from benefits workers' compensation and sui revenue than we had anticipated. but there was also an unrelated pull forward in sui revenue from the third quarter, which i will discuss in more detail in a few moments. our earnings before income taxes and adjusted ebit both increased 26%. adjusted ebit margin was up about 320 basis points compared to last year's second quarter and included 30 basis points of pressure from acquisitions.
this margin improvement was ahead of our expectation and benefited from a few key drivers. in addition to the solid performance from our revenue growth and operating leverage, this quarter we also benefited slightly from lower growth in our distribution expenses as a result of lower-than-expected second-quarter new business bookings performance. with that said, we also continued to benefit from the execution on efficiencies efforts within our i.t. infrastructure and through our broader transformation initiatives, including our voluntary early retirement program.
as we mentioned last quarter, we have continued to benefit from a slower ramp in our backfill hiring related to the voluntary early retirement program. and we expect some of the benefit to moderate over the back half of the year. as a result, while we continue to estimate a run rate of about $150 million in savings from this program, we now anticipate achieving slightly more than our original estimate of $100 million of benefit in fiscal year 2019. as carlos mentioned, we're executing on a number of different initiatives and the timing of costs or benefit can move around from quarter to quarter.
and as a reminder, as we proceed and refine our plans, the impact of some of these initiatives may overlap. but ultimately, our focus remains to deliver against the multi-year commitments we laid out at our june 2018 investor day. our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.6% and included a small benefit from the unplanned stock compensation tax benefits. this tax rate compares to over 25.6% adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter of last year.
adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 30% to $1.34 and in addition to benefiting from our strong revenue and margin performance and our lower tax rate was also supported by fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. now for our segment results. for employer services, revenues grew 7% for the quarter, 7% organic constant currency and we were ahead of expectations. retention is improving in line with expectations and we continue to see the benefits from last year's stronger-than-expected new business bookings, each contributing to our stronger-than-expected revenue performance this quarter.
our revenue growth in our international businesses, which we now disclose quarterly in our form 10-q, was also strong this quarter and was aided by a solid double-digit growth in our multinational offerings, which continued to do very well. interest income on client funds grew 21% and benefited from a 30-basis-point improvement in the average yield earned on our client fund investments and the growth in average time fund balances of 5% compared to a year ago. this growth in balances was driven by a combination of client growth, wage inflation, and growth in our pace for control, offset by pressure from corporate tax reform and lower state unemployment insurance collections. as a reminder, we had some pressure on our client fund balance growth related to the corporate tax reform that we now fully lapped.
but other sources of pressure like sui rate changes and fx will put added pressure on our balance growth for the remainder of the year. our same-store pays for control metric in the u.s. grew 2.3% for the quarter. moving on to employer services margin.
we saw an increase of about 460 basis points in the quarter, which includes approximately 50 basis points of pressure from the impact of acquisitions. this very strong performance is a result of the same factors i mentioned earlier regarding our consolidated results, including operating leverage across all of our businesses, efficiencies in our i.t. infrastructure, slower growth in our selling expenses, and the impact of our transformation initiatives, which continue to help in improving our underlining efficiency. our peo revenues grew 12% in the quarter.
and po revenues, excluding zero margin, benefits pass-throughs grew 15%, both above our expectations. average worksite employees increased 9% to 545,000. we were pleased to see continued solid performance on our worksite employee growth in particular with some signs of normalization in the retention compared to the pressure that we had seen last year among our large ipo clients. for revenue, the outperformance was attributable to two factors.
first, we saw favorability in benefits workers compensation and sui revenue relative to our expectations, which is not unusual and is part of our normal variability. second, as i mentioned earlier, there was a pull forward in a portion of our sui revenue this quarter, which benefited our total peo revenue growth rate by about 200 basis points. and this will, therefore, come out of next quarter's peo growth, yielding no net impact for the full year. the peo segment's margin increased 70 basis points for the quarter and benefited from operating leverage and selling efficiencies, partially offset by the growth of a pressure from adjustments to our loss reserve estimates related to adp indemnity.now onto our fiscal year 2019 outlook.
for employer services, we're increasing our revenue guidance to 5% to 6% from our previous guidance of 4% to 6%. with two quarters now coming in their head of expectations, we feel better about our position for the year but we continue to anticipate a deceleration in the back half, driven in part by a combination of the impact of this quarter's new business bookings performance, incremental pressure from fx, and the lapping of certain acquisitions. we continue to anticipate growth of 2.5% in our pace for control metric. finally, due to our margin outperformance this quarter, we are raising our es margin outlook and now anticipate full-year es margins to expand 175 to 200 basis points from our prior forecast of 150 to 175 basis points.
our outlook also continues to contemplate 50 basis points from acquisition drag of the year -- for the year. moving on to the peo. we now expect 9% to 10% peo revenue growth in fiscal year 2019 compared to our prior forecast of 8% to 9%, and we continue to expect 8% to 9% growth in average worksite employees. we now anticipate 8% to 9% growth in peo revenues, excluding zero margin benefit pass-throughs as we have been realizing better worker's compensation and sui revenues relative to our prior expectations.
for our peo margins, with better-than-expected performance in our peo margin this quarter, we now expect margins to be at least flat compared to our prior forecast, the decrease of down 50 to 25 basis points, and meanwhile continue to -- we meanwhile continue to anticipate grow over pressure from adjustments to our loss reserve estimates related to adp indemnity to result in 50 basis points of growth over pressure on a full-year basis, unchanged from our prior forecast. moving on to the consolidated outlook. we continue to anticipate total revenue growth of 6% to 7% for fiscal year 2019. we now expect the growth in average loan fund balances to be about 4% compared to our prior forecast of up 3% to 4%, and we continue to expect growth in our client fund interest revenue of $90 million to $100 million, and for the total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy to be an increase of $70 to $80 million.
the details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our investor relations website. we now anticipate our adjusted ebit margin to expand 125 to 150 basis points compared to our prior forecast of 100 to 125 basis points. driven by the strong execution that we have seen so far this year, this outlook continues to include approximately 30 basis points of pressure from acquisitions.with that said, as you can see, our guidance implies a slower pace of margin expansion in the latter half of fiscal year 2019 as we continue to expect lower top-line revenue growth while we, at the same time, maintaining our investments into the business and continue to catch up on our backfill hiring plans related to our voluntary early retirement program. with the impact of the first half stock compensation-related tax benefit, we're tweaking our adjusted effective tax rate expectation to 24.4 in fiscal year 2019.
that's compared to our prior estimate of 24.5. and with these adjustments to our outlook, we now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow 17% to 19% from our prior forecast of 15% to 17%. we continue to please -- be pleased with our overall execution.and with that, i will turn it back to the operator to take your questions.
