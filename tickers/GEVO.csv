operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question is from amit dayal with h.c. wainwright. your question, please.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
thank you. hi, pat. good afternoon, everyone. appreciate you taking my question.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
hey, how you're doing?
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
good. thank you, pat. so i'll save some of my questions around the project for the call tomorrow. but just in terms of the timeline you've provided, the first half of 2022 for the financial close of net-zero 1, is this sort of a typical timeline for something like this? and could this potentially be accelerated if things fall in place for you as you expect?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
i would say that the critical timeline runs through getting the engineering estimates done. we got to know what the capital cost is and what we're asking for in terms of debt support. you got to have that pinned down or you can't do a debt financing. we also have to have a bunch of the permitting stuff done and all kinds of things.
that time frame to get that stuff done, we're working on getting it done by the end of this year. and in which case then, we should be able to do the bond offering in the early part of next year. but because that's talking about a year from now or it could be less than a year from now, right? but because it's so far out, there's uncertainty around it. so the lawyers advised me to give it a wide range, first half of the year.
boom, that's the answer. do i want it sooner? hell, yes, i want it sooner. i want it done. and i'm the most impatient person on earth when it comes to it.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
understood, pat. thank you for that. and then our model currently for net-zero 1 has some level of utilization coming online by 2024. is that a reasonable assumption?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
amit, say that again. i missed the first part of the question.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
yes. i was just saying, our financial model right now that is published publicly, we have you doing some level of utilization from net-zero 1 coming online by 2024.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
yes.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
is that still a reasonable assumption?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
it is. that's the right assumption.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
ok. perfect.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
yes. so in other words, even if we finance in the first half of the year, we still plan to get the plant online in 2024. we've obviously built ourselves some slack in there. and this is one of these things where you got to do the design right and get it right, that allows you to plan right, secure equipment properly.
it could be that we can build things in modules, which shortens up the construction timelines. that's the sort of stuff we're figuring out. but yes, we are aiming at that first part of 2024 like you have in your model.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
ok. understood. and then with respect to net-zero 2 and net-zero 3, i mean, you're obviously considering those options right now. but is this, clarity on this probably comes in 2022, or could we see more clarity and progress around these efforts earlier than 2022?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
i would expect that we have progress in 2021 on those things. so we'll get the contracts signed. we'll have the sites. and i would expect to have the net-zero 2 site and customers announced in 2021.
and do i think we can get a net-zero 3 in that time frame? i think it's pretty much probable. now we all heard tim cesarek talk a few weeks ago on the fireside chat. he threw out the number of, he can see us doing six plants in short order. well, that's true, but we got to go through the work and duties.
so i can see us having multiple plants in play at the same time. the firms we're working with on the engineering side and the constructing side, they're capable of execution on that kind of scale. the trick is, you've got to get that design right because it leverages over into the net-zero 2 and net-zero 3. we can't be changing things or messing around with things.
people will often ask me, why don't i just take over an ethanol plant. anybody know where the pipe diagrams are for that plant? it's like we got to go learn that. are you kidding me? each one is individually different. what we want to do is make it as cookie cutting as possible so we can accelerate these timelines.
that's what we're shooting for. and we're pretty stubborn about it because we think it is the best way to generate the most cash for the company over the long run because we want those cash flow streams. they're worth a lot of money.
amit daya -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
understood. and just looking at the burn rate for 2021, what should we expect in terms of all these efforts that you're putting in place to get the permitting and the engineering, et cetera, done. like what should be the burn rate for 2021 that we should think about?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
i think for the burn rate for gevo, inc. is in the $25 million-ish range, something like that. and then we'll have project stuff that's capitalized. and that will show up differently as a cash number.
we'll have to give guidance on that, i suppose, at some point. but it's kind of your normal project stuff. it's in that kind of a bucket. but of cash burn to do the development, the resources, we're adding staff, for example, and more people to go do things.
that would show up, we wind up with probably $25 million, $26 million of burn at the corporate level. so that's the gsa, r&d, including the engineering stuff, the actual corporate engineering. project stuff, permitting, project-focused work, that's all going to be in a capitalization bucket for the project. that's the development expense.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
understood. yes. just one last one for me, pat, on the renewable natural gas opportunity. the initial effort seems to be just for your upcoming facility and your own consumption, et cetera, to lower your carbon intensity.
but could this develop into a larger sort of ambition for the company in terms of actual revenue scaling beyond what your initial efforts are?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
that's a very interesting question, a very insightful question, actually. because what's happened is that we started working on the rng project in northwest iowa because we were thinking about putting that rng over to luverne. but the demand for our products outgrew the scale of luverne, and we would have had to redo a whole bunch of permits in minnesota and all kinds of stuff that would have dragged out our timelines. so we started thinking about that greenfield plant in net-zero 1.
and as we started thinking it through, we realized we could make net-zero 1 energy sufficient, generate our own biogas on-site. well, that diminished the need for that northwest iowa rng. on the other hand, we had already done a whole bunch of the development work. the way we think of it is this, so in these last 18 months, we learned how to be developers for renewable natural gas.
we are going in renewable natural gas business. that's just a fact. we're going to be doing that. this 355,000 million btus is initially going to go to california.
that's where we're going to sell it. there'll be a time in the future once the net zero plant starts up or maybe when we start luverne back up or maybe when we get to our net-zero 2 or 3 site, we can use that natural gas there, too, if we need to. so it gives us optionality that i kind of like. but it shouldn't be lost on anybody that we do, in fact, have the capability to develop projects when not everyone can.
and we see how to get it done and how to monetize it. if we sell to california, in which we plan on doing in the early days, good, the plants pay back very quick. that's really attractive. and then that's a good thing.
so it's one of these very interesting games. when i think of gevo, i think of renewable energy transformed to energy-dense liquids. that's no joke. we're wiping out the fossil-based footprint by displacing fossil-based natural gas.
more of it's better. we could actually drive, if we took that gas up to net-zero 1, we could make a large negative greenhouse gas emission liquid transportation fuel. that's kind of astounding.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
all right. understood. that's all i have. thank you so much.
i'll see you in the quarter.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
sure.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from poe fratt with noble capital markets. your question, please.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
yeah. good afternoon, pat.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
hey, poe.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
if i just get one quick one out of the way. what's your current share count right now?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
i believe it's 198 million shares.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
ok. so it hasn't changed much since the end of january.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
no. it hasn't changed at all since the end of january.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
yeah. no, i was thinking maybe some of the warrants might have been exercised because i think you still had some warrants out there, right?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
yeah. you know what? the number that i have is still the same old number on my slides that show up. carolyn?
carolyn romero -- chief accounting officer, vice president, and controller
yes. they're the same.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
ok. and then on the rng, pat, you said $70 million to $75 million as far as capex. and you're working on the financing. have you figured out, is it 70-30 as far as debt/equity? and how much equity are you going to end up putting into that plant?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
ok. we're going to talk about this tomorrow at the fireside chat, but here's the preview. we don't have to put any more cash into it. we already did the development work.
in fact, we're going to get a rebate, so to speak, in that when we close that deal, we'll get money back. so it's already kind of a done deal and the financing is arranged. and we'll be talking more about that tomorrow when lynn's on here. he's the guy who did a great job getting it all organized and getting it financed.
and so that cash flow should be, we should be seeing that. it will be meaningful cash flow by the fourth quarter. we'll start seeing some of it early next year. but construction starts like, we're going to break ground like, but it's getting organized right now, getting organized.
so it's very soon we'll be breaking ground. we'll do an announcement and we'll have to see what kind of ribbon-cutting ceremony and stuff like that or a groundbreaking ceremony and things like that. lynn's done a great job of getting it all organized. chris ryan has done a great job at figuring how to do development of r&d and get it done.
it's good. it creates a different business opportunity for us.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
yeah. just two quick ones. do you have an estimate on how much cash you might be able to get out of that once the financing is done? and then also the start-up, is it first quarter of 2022 or fourth quarter of 2022?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
it will start up. hello. who is that?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
oh, it's lynn, sorry.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
oh, great, lynn's ok. go ahead.
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
yes. we'll start up in first quarter, but the cash is a little bit back-end loaded because of the way the lcfs credit system works. but we're expecting cash distributions out of the project in the order of $10 million on very conservative assumptions around carbon score and the cost to complete. we think we can do a lot better on the capital cost.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
what's the range of outcomes, do you think? i know we took a really conservative approach as we did it for ourselves because we're thinking about really long term and how to use it with net zero plants. but if we just sold to california and it all worked well, what's that $10 million turn into?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
well, the range is about $9 million to $16 million depending on the carbon intensity score. and the returns can vary from 30% to the high 60s, depending on those things, as well as the capex.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
does that help you, poe?
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
yes. no. and i think you've had like $20 million in it or you had about $20 million outlays before everything?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
we don't need to put any more cash into it because we've already spent about $8 million on the development, including equipment and engineering and such. and we'll pull that back out. we have zero net cash coming off of the balance sheet to complete the construction of the rng project.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
ok. great. and then can you give me a budget for your feed work, either a cost estimate or a budgeting on how much you're going to spend on the feed work?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
for net-zero 1, that's $15 million.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
ok. and then, pat, it was helpful you gave sort of the soft cost and the hard cost, the hard cost of net-zero 1 of $650 million and then soft costs are about $150 million as it stands right now.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
right.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
can you -- and you need to get that cost estimate to plus or minus 10%. are you currently at plus or minus 50%? i saw a footnote on your presentation that said it was plus or minus 50%. can you help me reconcile that goal versus where you are now?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
yes. so we're doing, the different parts of the process are at different statuses. so we changed, as we started thinking about how to build out net-zero 1 and get ourselves off the dirty fossil footprint of energy, we are realizing, gosh, we should throw a water treatment plant in. well, we got to go do that and figure that out.
and then how do you integrate it? what's the best way to maximize the protein and oil. so we've worked on a deal there with a partner we'll announce later and had to figure that out. and so what we do is we say things like that, it's plus 50%. some parts of the process are already, they're pretty well nailed down.
other parts, we're still going, is this chunk like this? and where does it lay out? and how does it interact with the rest of it? so it's the putting of the pieces together that creates the uncertainty and to get it right. but we also, this is actually the work entailed, actually getting bids on equipment and figuring out the real cost. that's a nontrivial thing. this is a giant plant.
so that has to be done as well. so it's a mixed bag is what we got here. and the trick of it is that we want to keep, we pin down the scope, that's good. that's extremely helpful.
we had inside our battery limit. inside our battery limit, for everybody listening, means that's inside, think of it as inside our fence lines, under our control part of the plant, part of the build. things that are outside the battery limit would be things external to us. there still might be some costs we have to pay attention to.
for instance, we'll be doing a wind farm in partnership with juhl energy. but that's separate with different financing. the inside our battery limit, we got a water treatment plant. we got a protein plant.
we're going to be taking out the vegetable oil, large amounts of it. we want all that stuff because that offsets the acquisition cost of corn, right? it's correlated. it's an internal hedge kind of a thing. it's worth a lot of money.
and then we got the hydrocarbon stuff. we're partnered with axens on much of that because they've built a whole bunch of these kind of plants where you take the petrochemical-based butylene into hydrocarbons. well, that's real similar to what we're doing, except for we're starting with isobutanol. you got to make isobutanol and isobutylene.
once you go from there, then it works. well, great, they've done 120 of these plants before, sorry, 25 of these plants before. so that's all good. so it's all about putting all the big pieces together and figuring it out.
and it just takes time. and that's where we're at. so it's not a, oh, we're at this part is, it's a mixed bag, different parts, different places working through.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
ok. and maybe i'll ask the cash burn question a little bit differently. have you determined how much equity you're going to put into net-zero 1, what that figure is actually going to be? or is it still a moving target because the capital cost estimates haven't been completely finalized?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
at the ceo level, i just simplify it and say, we're doing 100% of the equity in net-zero 1 unless someone makes us one helluva sweet deal. and then in which case we'd share that cash flow stream. now remember, we're greedy. we view that cash flow stream as roughly $100 million a year of ebitda at the project level.
and so why would we share it? oh, and i get that people, a strategic would add value. yes and no. it depends on what the deal is. and so i liken it like this.
i live in colorado and i'm a baker. i'm baking a cake at high altitude. it's tricky. i got all my ingredients.
i don't need extra cooks in my baking kitchen right now helping me bake. you want to put frosting on it after the thing is baked? hey, we'll come to it. we'll look at it and see what the deal is at that time. and so it could be that we do add additional people into the mix of equity prior to close.
it could be that we do. and we're going to want to look at that very, very carefully. but getting in too early, then you got too many cooks in the kitchen. that's how you ruin timelines.
so i like where we're at on that front. now, lynn, you can give a little more example of what you're thinking about and what you've modeled.
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
sure. the debt work that we've done with citi has been pretty exhaustive to confirm that we can qualify for private activity bond issuance. that's a tax-exempt bond issuance. those markets are very attractive for the types of projects that we're sponsoring, the net-zero 1.
we expect to be somewhere around two-thirds leverage. at the end of the day, we're expecting that we could be putting in somewhere in the neighborhood of $250 million of equity if we invest 100% of the equity in that project. and i'd also note that the returns that pat cited are oftentimes not giving credit to a range of fees that we would not charge to the project if we're 100% equity. if we're a partial equity, we'll charge for licensing fees, operations and maintenance fees, project management, certain overhead recoveries.
if we're 100% equity, consolidated, those fees only come to gevo and add to the irrs that are being cited.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
great. that's helpful, lynn. and that $250 million equity, that is a 2022 event, right?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
that's right.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
do you have an idea of sort of where you think you'll end the year 2021 from a cash perspective? you have $531 million now. do you have an idea of sort of what you think your cash on hand or on the balance sheet will be at the end of this year?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
well, pat, i'll just say that we're budgeting the development of net-zero 1 as though we're going to complete it and close financing at the end of 2021. that won't happen, but that's the way we're budgeting it. and it's including long-lead equipment deposits to maintain that completion schedule that pat cited earlier in 2024. we're going to probably have about $45 million out the door.
that will recover when we close the financing of net-zero 1.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
yes. ok. and then --
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
so if you're doing our cash then, you'd add it up and say, he told you it was going to be $15 million to do the feed engineering, right? he told you we'd lay out probably, we budgeted for $45 million outlay, which we may or may not do, but that's what we budgeted for capital equipment long-lead items. and then we told you that it's like $25 million, $26 million of corporate burn-related expenses, and all the other work. so that's the kind of numbers subtracted off of $530 million. that's kind of the number you'd wind up with.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
that's really helpful. pat, is it $15 million on the feed or $50 million, sorry.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
$15 million.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
$15 million.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
one, five.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
one, five. ok. great.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
yeah. and then one clarification i want to make, you asked about the phase and stuff and design is that, of course, this design, when we're talking about it this way is, it's about a process design. it's about going through the details, the mass, and energy balances. these are engineering exercises to figure it out.
we're optimizing the process along the way, right, because we want to minimize the carbon footprint so we maximize the carbon score that we get. that's how we make the most money. so you go through and look at everything in the design phase, you go through and look at every single unit operation and ask, is it the right one? does it have the right horsepower on that engine or on that motor? is it the right pipe size? it's the right detail, detail, and put it all together. and then you got to source the equipment and come up with it.
that's why it takes so much work. and so when we talk about it, we talked about it as engineers to each other here a few minutes ago, but other people listening might not grasp that. of course, we have a process design. it's about pinning down the exact detail so we can spend money to go buy it.
this stuff doesn't come off the shelf, so anyway.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
ok. great. and then i think, pat, before on the rng project, you had been sort of saying that the offtake customer might be somebody who would be recognizable and that would be sort of a significant move. are you prepared at this point to talk about that or will we have to wait until the financing is finalized?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
yes. that will be, we got to finalize that contract. renewable natural gas is worth a lot of money in california right now. so that gives us the confidence to just move ahead on the project anyway.
and then we'll announce that customer partner when we're ready here.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
ok. and then just a couple more, if you wouldn't mind. it looks like you've identified sites for net-zero 2 and 3 and then along the line. one intriguing thing to me was that you added a site on your map in florida.
can you talk about florida from the standpoint of --
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
yes. sure. yes. so what's happening to us is that as the demand increases, now remember, we're dealing with people under confidentiality agreements, right? so our customers all talk to us under confidentiality agreements.
and then other partners talk to us under confidentiality agreements. we're always restricted in what we can say. however, corn in the midwest is a sustainable low-cost way to get these carbohydrate residuals that we can turn into our hydrocarbon products. and we also have good wind resources up there.
we got good biogas resources up there. it makes sense. stuff makes sense up in the midwest. in florida, there are several feedstocks that have potential interest.
there's molasses-type things and there's sugar residues from various types down there. and so people have approached us with sites. and so we're going through the work to evaluate them. you'll see them in other places that popped up on our map, too, where same kind of thing, where people are saying, hey, we can supply you with carbohydrates, would you want to build a site? and we say, yes, you show me the sustainability.
you show me the cost. you show me the risk associated with that acquisition of that carbohydrate source and we'll look at it. but the one in florida has risen to the rank of, we got to evaluate it. so it shows up on our map.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
ok. great. and then could you help me understand the significance of the mou that you signed with hcs and how that fits into the overall plan?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
yes. yes. ok. so yes, with hcs, that's haltermann carless.
haltermann carless is a specialty fuel manufacturer. we announced a deal with them where we would be licensing our technology to them for production of hydrocarbons in speyer, germany. and it'll be leveraging their site. now we will work with them to arrange the isobutanol production in germany or somewhere along the rhine river presumably or somewhere in europe.
we still have to go do that work. you'll notice in that press release, it had talked about jet fuel in germany, ok? and it talked about the size of the project. we'll co-market it to them because we're real particular about how you place the stuff in the market and hold it sustainable and all the rest, so think net zero concept in europe. the difference in europe is that you don't have to have the isobutanol plant next to the hydrocarbon plant.
for instance, you can float the stuff down the rhine river. in the u.s., you can't do that, of course, because you don't get the credits for it. the epa requires the plants to be integrated in order to get the rfs credits, the rins. so there, we can do stuff like that and separate it.
maybe someday here, we can separate things. but there, it seems to be economical in the work and it's jet fuel in germany.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks. you just mentioned one thing that actually i wanted to bring up. rin prices are going through the roof it seems like.
can you help me understand whether that impacts any of your development plans?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
impacts our development, oh, yes, our development plans, you mean broadly?
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
yeah. plans just broadly or does it have any impact on your strategic outlook?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
what we do is, we tend to do like averages and futures types calculations when we're looking at our own economic projections. but rin price goes up, that's good for us. so the way to think of our business is, we win if anything green goes up in value. rins, lcfs, tax credits, we win.
that's just more margin to us, right? and oil price goes up, we win. if corn price goes up, you know what's interesting about that is protein price goes up and so does the oil price. and so that's one. it isn't clear-cut.
it's not a loss. and it might even be a win depending upon exactly how it happened and under what circumstance. so it's one of these very interesting dynamics that we have. we've tried to derisk the project on all those fronts.
but on the rins, we get 1.6 times the rins. i mean, this is, again, one of the nuances of making an energy-dense liquid. we are 1.6, ethanol gets one. why? we're energy-dense so we get 1.6 times.
so that matters. so when you see these rin prices going up through the roof, now multiply by 1.6, that's what we would get credited to us. so it matters.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you so much. and i look forward to tomorrow's presentation.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
sure.
operator
thank you. and i don't have any further questions in the queue. i would like to turn it back to pat for his final remarks.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
thank you all for listening to us and join us for the fireside chat tomorrow. we'll be asking lynn a bunch of questions, and shawn severson will be moderating, but i can't help myself and i'll jump in. i now thank you for your support in the company. we appreciate it.
we are off to a good start of this year. things are working and making progress. it's actually such a change and a blessing from last year. and now we are driving to get this done and get these plants online, net-zero 1, and i want net-zero 2 and i want net-zero 3 as well so.
and i want that r&d done, and we're going to be evaluating whether to make it even bigger. so that's what we're focused on. thanks for listening today. bye.

welcome to gevo's fourth-quarter 2020 earnings conference call. my name is carmen, and i'll be your operator for today's call. [operator instructions] please note that today's conference is being recorded. i'll now turn the call over to geoff williams, gevo's vice president, general counsel, and secretary.
please go ahead, mr. williams.
geoff williams -- vice president, general counsel, and secretary
good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining gevo's fourth-quarter 2020 earnings conference call. i would like to start by introducing today's participants from the company. with us today is patrick gruber, gevo's chief executive officer; and carolyn romero, gevo's chief accounting officer. earlier today, we issued a press release that outlines the topics we plan to discuss today.
a copy of this press release is available on our website at www.gevo.com. i would like to remind our listeners that this conference call is open to the media and that we are providing a simultaneous webcast of this call to the public. a replay of today's call will be available on gevo's website. on the call today and on this webcast, you will hear discussions of certain non-gaap financial measures.
non-gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with gaap. reconciliation of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures is contained in the press release distributed today, which is posted on our website. we will also make certain forward-looking statements about events and circumstances that have not yet occurred, including, but not limited to, projections about gevo's business development plans and operating activities for 2021 and beyond. these forward-looking statements are based on management's current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions and are subject to significant risks and uncertainty, including those disclosed in gevo's form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020, that was filed with the u.s.
securities and exchange commission, and in subsequent reports and other filings made with the sec by gevo, including gevo's quarterly reports on form 10-q. investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. such forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and gevo disclaims any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. on today's call, pat will begin with a discussion of gevo's business developments, and then carolyn will review gevo's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2020.
following the presentation, we will open up the call for questions. i'll now turn the call over to pat. 
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
thanks, geoff. hello, everyone. i'm going to keep this relatively short today because tomorrow we're doing another fireside chat. those who join us will hear lynn and i discuss more information around the financing, projects, how to think about them, et cetera.
but back to reporting on this year. now we've had quite a change from a year ago, so i'm going to run through a partial list. now we sold out the capacity to a large commercial plant using take-or-pay contracts that are suitable for use in backing of project debt financing. now these contracts add up to more than 45 million gallons per year of hydrocarbons.
that offtake caused us to think bigger sooner. we also paid off all of the whitebox debt. we advanced the development of our renewable natural gas project. we figured how to make net zero hydrocarbon products by using a mix of renewable energy with our process.
and of course, that's targeted for our net zero plant in, targeted for lake preston, south dakota. we have $530 million of cash on the balance sheet and no material debt. that money should enable us to develop multiple plants and make the full equity investment in our net-zero 1 plant rather than being dependent upon a third party. we also have the cash and the balance sheet that should allow us to sponsor significant equity investments in future net zero plants such as net-zero 2 or net-zero 3 projects.
we've worked with citigroup to figure out, and they have figured out and vetted a potential bond offering that we may use to finance our debt for the net-zero 1 project. that's taken a lot of work to actually work through that. and they have a really attractive solution in mind. we have work to do to get ready for it still.
now we shut down our ethanol plant. it lost money given that the market wasn't very good and it wasn't a great focus for us. we've been told by some new investors that they now understand that we aren't an ethanol company. well, that's good.
that eliminates confusion. we aren't an ethanol company. we're all about the renewable energy into energy-dense liquids, hydrocarbons, net zero footprint. we developed our customer pipeline.
it's grown quite a lot from last year and it's grown even more since. importantly, we proved that we can establish pricing in take-or-pay contracts that works for our customers and ourselves and results in meaningful take-or-pay contracts. these take-or-pay contracts are backed by the balance sheet or letters of credit from our customers. that's a big deal and a big accomplishment.
we announced our net-zero 1 project. this project slated for lake preston, south dakota will produce roughly 400 million pounds per year of value-added, protein-rich animal feed, roughly 30 million pounds of corn oil, 45 million gallons per year of energy-dense liquid hydrocarbons. these hydrocarbons are drop-in gasoline and jet fuel products that when burned have a net zero greenhouse gas emission across the whole of their life cycle, measuring all the way from capturing the co2 from the atmosphere, accounting for the farming and agriculture, accounting for all the energy sources, the transportation of the products. the hydrocarbon products produced at our plant are expected to be more than minus 70 in their carbon footprint score.
but when burned as a fuel for transportation, the whole cycle would be net zero, according to the leading science-based life cycle model called greet that's been developed by argonne national lab. so how does it get to net zero? it's all about two things. paying attention to how things are grown, that is the growing practices such as low-till and no-till, along with precision agricultural techniques, where farmers only apply the chemicals that are needed, not excess. and two, eliminating dirty electricity and fossil-based natural gas from our production processes.
net zero is being designed to be off the grid from dependence on fossil-based energy. we are putting in a water treatment plant that is expected to generate enough biogas to meet the thermal demands of the plant and provide enough excess gas so we can generate about 30% of our electricity with a combined heat and power unit. we plan on meeting the need for the other 70% of our electricity from a related wind project that we are developing with juhl energy. we don't want dirty electricity that's typical of the grid in this country.
we don't want it. we also expect to use our green electricity to generate green hydrogen for our production processes. we haven't decided yet if we'll make excess hydrogen to take to the marketplace. our negotiating power has strengthened as well.
this means that strategics approach us differently now. we expect that if and when we work with strategics, we'll be able to make a more balanced deal. that's a major change from our previous position when we had our hat in our hand. yes.
several parties are in discussion with us. no, we can't give more detail at this point. so what's going to happen this coming year in 2021? we expect to sign more take-or-pay customer contracts in support of net-zero 2 and net-zero 3. we already have attractive production sites chosen and options are under loi.
we expect to announce the specifics for these sites after we announce the next set of offtake contracts. we expect that net-zero 2 and net-zero 3 would look a lot like net-zero 1. we expect to start construction of our renewable natural gas project with a size of 355,000 million btus. this project would take manure from more than 20,000 dairy cows and convert it to renewable natural gas.
this project will cost about $75 million, and we project a return of more than 30% irr using conservative estimates. the project is expected to come online and start generating profit in the fourth quarter of next year. in the near term, the gas will be sold to the california market. once net-zero 1 starts up, we may take a portion of that gas up there to drive the carbon scores even lower or maybe we just keep on supplying the california market.
that's the future economic optimization question. in order to close the project finance deal for net-zero 1, we need to have the capital cost estimate to the plus or minus 10% or so level. this engineering work and design work is under way. our engineering partners have upwards of 50 people working on our design and capital cost.
we are grateful to have the money to do it properly. the capital cost of net-zero 1 is currently expected to be about $650 million, inclusive of the production plants, water treatment plants and energy complex. on a fully installed project finance basis, the project total would be roughly $800 million because of the interest during construction and the reserves and such that are required to do a debt financing. the irr for this $800 million project is expected to be better than about 20%.
we need to get the engineering design work done and pin down the capital cost to the appropriate precision to enable the debt financing of net-zero 1. that's a prerequisite. we have to know what it is, plus or minus 10% before we could do a debt deal. this will take to the end of 2021 to complete and get it right.
we'd expect to close a bond deal in the first half of 2022. it's possible that the capital cost of net-zero 1 project could go up or down depending upon adjustments, the scope of equipment costs, or what we work through in the design of that plant. well, that's what all this design work is about right now, pinning down the capital cost with the very best optimal processes that deliver the returns we want. net-zero 1 is expected to take about two years to build.
this is normal. it's a big capital deployment. one good thing is that the engineering and design cycle for net-zero 2 and 3 would be much, much shorter. we expect that those plants will be based upon net-zero 1.
it shouldn't be lost on anyone that our business is significantly derisked. we have money to execute our plans in a real sense. yes, it's quite a change from last year. last year, we had to raise money to keep the lights on.
our team did well developing the business, advancing the technology. now if we raise more money, the purpose will be to take more of the large cash flow streams we expect from our net zero projects or from an r&d project. tomorrow, lynn smull and i will be doing a fireside chat with water tower research where we will be discussing project economics and financing for both net-zero 1 project and the rng project. we will be answering a whole bunch of investor questions.
information on registration can be found in the investors section of our website, investors.gevo.com. now i will turn the call over to carolyn, who will take us through the financials. carolyn?
carolyn romero -- chief accounting officer, vice president, and controller
thank you, pat. gevo reported revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 of $0.5 million as compared to $6.9 million in the same period in 2019. during the fourth quarter of 2020, hydrocarbon revenue was $0.4 million compared with $1.0 million in the same period in 2019. hydrocarbon sales decreased because of the lower shipments of finished products from our demonstration plant at the south hampton resources, inc.
facility in silsbee, texas. during the fourth quarter of 2020, revenue derived at the luverne facility from ethanol sales and related products was $5,000 compared to $5.9 million during the same period in 2019. as a result of covid-19 and in response to unfavorable commodity environment, we terminated our production of ethanol and distiller grains back in march of 2020, which resulted in lower sales for the fourth quarter. cost of goods sold was $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus $9.4 million in the same period in 2019.
cost of goods sold included approximately $0.9 million associated with production of iba and related products and maintenance of the luverne facility and approximately $1.1 million in depreciation expense. gross loss was $1.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 versus $2.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. research and development expense increased by $1.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019, due primarily to an increase in consulting and personnel expenses. selling, general, and administrative expense increased by $0.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019, due primarily to an increase in consulting and personnel costs, offset by a decrease in investor relations and marketing costs.
for the fourth-quarter 2020, we reported a loss from operations of $7 million compared to $6.2 million for the same period in 2019. in the fourth quarter of 2020, cash ebitda loss, a non-gaap measure that is calculated by adding back depreciation and noncash stock-based compensation to gaap loss from operations, was $5.1 million compared to $4.0 million in the same quarter of 2019. interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $0.5 million, a slight decrease compared to the same period in 2019 as a result of lower amortization of original issue discounts and debt issuance costs, and the conversion of $2.0 million of 2020/'21 notes to common stock during july of 2020. during december 2020, we converted the remaining $12.7 million of 2020/'21 notes into common stock.
for the fourth quarter of 2020, we reported a net loss of $18.1 million or a loss of $0.15 per share based on a weighted average shares outstanding of 120,017,120. this compares to a loss of $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 or a loss of $0.50 per share based on weighted average shares outstanding of 13,659,944. during the fourth quarter of 2020, we incurred a $1.4 million noncash loss related to the conversion of $12.7 million of 2020/'21 notes into common stock. during the three months ended december 31, 2020, we recognized a noncash loss totaling $8.6 million due to changes in the fair value of our 2021 notes embedded derivative liability, resulting from the increase in the price of our common stock prior to the conversion of the $12.7 million of the 2021 notes.
adding back these noncash losses resulted in a non-gaap adjusted net loss of $8.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 or a non-gaap adjusted net loss per share of $0.07 based on a weighted average shares outstanding of 120,017,120. this compares to a non-gaap adjusted net loss of $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 or a non-gaap adjusted net loss per share of $0.50 per share based on a weighted average shares outstanding of 13,659,944. now i will turn it back over to pat to wrap things up.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
thanks, carolyn. let's open up the call for questions. operator?
",2020-Q4,GEVO,0.6339,0.9995,
,,":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of amit dayal with h.c. wainwright. your line is open.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon, everyone. i appreciate taking my questions. pat, did you say that you are pursuing $10 billion worth of off-take agreements?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
we're more than pursuing them. that's what's being worked on and actively negotiated in various forums. that's a three-fold increase. this is a game-changing kind of a thing for us considering where we had been and what we're doing.
people are figuring out that we have a solution here. so it's going to be exciting. and we're going to be in the position of having to supply product for multiple plants that wants to dang good thing. we did a greenfield cookie-cutter plant in our designing the way we're doing it, we got.
ok, it was foresight, lucky, where we did good. and my people did a really good job. so it's kind of exciting space we're in, and as always, i never know when we're going to get the darn agreements done. some of these are really big deals in with not that many customers.
and so they'll take time, but we're stacking them up in multiple net-zero plants. it's pretty exciting.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
are these agreements with -- are these potential agreements with the airlines or with players in sort of the middle of the value chain? like, who are these agreements being negotiated with?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
i think it would be fair to say i can't comment on this stuff like that. we are sworn to secrecy about these things. i know we get this question. everyone wants to tell us who is it, really? we can't do that.
now, there -- but i will say this, it's a mix of those.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
ok.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
so if you could just ask me about it's a mix.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
ok. and then i guess i'll ask the obligatory feedstock-related question. as you are getting visibility into the size of these opportunities, how are you thinking about managing feedstock requirements, etc.?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
well, it's interesting because these are carbohydrates the feedstock. these are incredibly abundant. so for example, the corn supply here in the u.s. is, what, 14.2 billion bushels a year ago.
and it's increasing, and we use the carbohydrate portion, we separate out the protein. a billion gallons of require several percent of corn supply. and, of course, that's really not an accurate count. because we're separating, it's close for an accurate count, but we're separating out all the protein that goes with it.
so there's more than a feedstock availability, especially when ethanol was being a little bit of a combat, but the ethanol supply has gone down a bit. so we're in pretty good shape in terms of feedstock. and that puts us at a comparative advantage compared to some of the other feedstocks that are out there for renewables. of course, around the world, it's not corn.
in germany, we would work with something else. and india is definitely molasses and things like that. so and i think in south america, as we get going, you'll see us work with molasses and other products. so carbohydrates are a great feedstock, because they're so ubiquitous in such large amounts, especially compared when one's looking at oil fields or one of those other things.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
so just as you know, so these net-zero plants don't essentially have to be in the u.s., they could be in other geographies.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
sure, they can. it's a concept. so what we're doing is building plants and building in the renewable energy infrastructure that goes with them. because of the way we process things, we have the ability to take input like a water treatment plant and put that water treatment plant and it makes biogas fields that do the thermal demand for the plant displacing the fossil-based natural gas.
of course, we want renewable electricity. electricity is the thing that causes -- in between existing natural gas. that is the thing that causes the bulk of our footprint, this is true of all energy. when we're trying to drive the footprint down on greenhouse gases, it is about electricity that seems to be lost on the world at large.
and the same thing is true with the natural gas, it's fossil-based, both of them. look electricity is 60% fossil-based in this country and around the world, it's about the same. so there's an enormous amount of work to do. so we think of it as, every time we do a net-zero plant will have done something about renewable energy.
and in fact, our company is, in fact, a developer of renewable natural gas. that's a fact. you're a co-developer of when we did a project last year, we're going do another round or net-zero plant. and you know what, we're going to continue to be active in the renewable energy.
and it was a different mentality about what needs to be done to solve these greenhouse gas problems and make money while we do it.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
the green bonds for the rng that you issued, is that allowing you to pay a lower interest rate versus in regular bond, i guess?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
hey, lynn. are you on the line lynn?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
there's an interest rate. and i thought we published it. it's been -- it's public stuff, so it's there.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
ok. i'll check that. i'll look at that.
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
yeah.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
no problem. i guess my other question was around, you know, how much we need to factor in -- with respect to the interest burden related to this. but i can look that up also? but you said the payments on this will begin in 2q '21? right?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
yeah. so what will happen is -- yeah, so -- yeah. and what we'll do is, you'd have to, you know, what you should do is call lynn and talk to him and find out more color on it. and the thing that i'm paying attention to is, i want this plant built and again get it complete by the end of the year, i want to operational in the first quarter of next year so that we can get all of our qualifications done to get stuff certified.
so to start generating cash, get that done. i want the money in the door by the end of -- in the third, fourth quarter next year, whenever that timing works out. and i want the cash coming in the door. and when we're talking about $9 to $16 million of cash that might sound small to people, but dang, that's like real money.
we want it and that's after, the debt service and all the rest. so that's -- i want it.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
what's the delta? what accounts for the delta between the $9 million to $16 million in the range? like what could be the difference between you're coming in at $9 million or $16 million?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
the way you have to go through california and get certified as to what exactly the pathway is, and they look at your dairies, and they'll judge them in some way. and we're trying to give it -- be conservative. so in the worst-case scenario, we say it's $9 million. we think it's more like $16 million.
and so we're just giving ourselves a range. so we can hit something that's reasonable. but you got to go through this. whenever you got to go through the certification process, which is normal.
you got to get their blessings to say, yep, that's legit. it depends on how they're looking at things at that time. you know -- and because it's in future world, we just say, ok, we plan on nine, hoping to get 16. you have the cash out.on the revenue side, what that means on the revenue side is like $23 million and $28 million revenue.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
ok. so this will get narrowed down once you get the certification, basically.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
that's it. well, we would know. we would know that -- we will know. if they do what they have done in the past, it's the high side.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
ok. understood. and i guess my last question was around, what the expected cash levels would be as you exit 2021? i don't know if lynn is online, but i can follow up with him if he's not available.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
yes. i follow up and maybe that we have some long-lead-time items. i think we talked about that once before where we may have to put money down along need equipment for net-zero plants that might be -- tie up $20 million or something. but i don't know.
we have to ask him exactly and watch the site through that as we get further along. lynn, you're here.
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
yes. i'm sorry. i was dropped. so back.
what was the question?
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
the question was, what do you -- where do you expect to be with your cash position as you exit 2021?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
ballpark?
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
yes.
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
about $490 million.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
ok. understood.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
ok. now, look  yeah, everybody, everybody for that has a big error bar around. it depends upon if we do long lead equipments and pay for them or not. don't write that one in stone.
ok? and so it depends upon what we do.
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
yes. the question, as i understood, it was expectation, and expectation to me is based on the development costs that we incur as we develop net-zero 1. yes, it does depend on a lot of things, especially, around long lead equipment deposits to advance the construction schedule. that's the big uncertainty.
so there is an error bar around that. but that's the point estimate.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
yeah. there you go.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
thank you for that. just one last one. i guess the amendment with scandinavian airlines bag, was this related to volume or pricing or something else?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
volume.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
ok.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
well, it was volume that came back for more. and i think we'll see more of that in the future and from others.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
understood. that's all i have. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of shawn severson with water tower research. your line is open.
shawn severson -- water tower research -- analyst
thanks. hi. pat, i'm trying to understand when you talk about $10 billion, i mean, when would all these -- the pipeline want to start? i mean, something like  someone say that they want to start taking delivery in 2027 or 2030, or are you talking about basically the fact that you could build plants which maybe you can speed up many in parallel to facilitate?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
it's soon. nobody, now it's in the game of wanting sooner, faster, and all the rest. and it is about gasoline, alco-jet and jet fuel, both. and we can't do them fast enough.
so we got to go through the cycle random pin things down. and then the net-zero 2 plant, i think, is it'll be done in -- in overlapping with net-zero 1, is the hypothesis. net-zero 3 to be done exactly at the same time potentially. so it depends on when we get the contracts done, it's going to get interesting.
and then we got to think about how to do even bigger chunks all at once because it's that kind of a pipeline. and so it's getting to be interesting. people want the stuff fast. so net-zero 1 is expected to come online in first part of 2024.
i think it'd be interesting to see, could we push it and get the net-zero 2 online in 2024 as well and the net-zero 3, maybe. this is how we're thinking about it and why we're going to such detailed work to get it right on this engineering is so we can cookie-cut these things to make them work with certainty.
shawn severson -- water tower research -- analyst
are you seeing any interest or inclination in that pipeline? will they want you to work with those strategic, or are you basically operating fine on your own? obviously, signing off, take agreements, you're operating fine on your own. but i was trying to understand if there's a nuance there that they're saying, hey, we want the big partners in this or just the mentality of these customers.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
no. they're just like -- they get it -- is that -- we're interesting and unique as a company because we do development of our own renewable energy. we've learned how to do it. we are the experts in the fermentation chemistry side of things.
we've run these big processes in our past lives. everybody knows that. so everyone bets us. and they look at it and they go, well, you guys know how to do stuff, we don't know how to do.
so are people interested in investing? yes, there'll be times when we can take project investment in or there's -- people who have been approaching this around corporate investments as well. and it's just, we got to figure out the right timing. and so it's going to get interesting. but as far as execution goes, no, that's not easy.
we know how to do that in the engineering firms that we work with. and there's lots of them that we're working with, it's a big group of them. they are pretty good at this stuff, too. and my folk are really good project managers and leaders.
and so you got to remember that we've been here and done this before in our past lives. and so this isn't like a new rodeo for us. but, no, people look at us internally and go, god, you guys are self-sufficient. the other thing that you got to remember, and everyone should remember, and this is a fundamentally different about us than most other companies.
most of the companies make some kind of a soup as a product that has to get refined. and so they need a refinery, we don't. we make it deliberately the jet fuel and the octane and that we can change if we want to make more stuff for gasoline, we can do that. and without changing anything in the plant, just change the conditions, walk around, and make more jet fuel.
so in that sense, we're like a chemical plant. this is a fundamental difference, and it is important when you think about how this marketplace can unfold. we've got a competitive advantage, i believe.
shawn severson -- water tower research -- analyst
another question about the kind of the pipeline. how diverse is that? and are you kind of nuanced that you said there are some large ones in there? but just how diverse is that group? and for modeling purposes, should we assume that most of the plants and the offtake agreements have similar economics?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
yes. the way we think of it as every net-zero plant of 45 million gallons generates ebitda stream of plus $100 million. that's how we think of it internally. and it would have -- i'd have to do the math.
you have to do the math to figure out each -- what cost, the life of the contract, six to seven years. so 6.5 years, $1.5 billion of revenue across the life of the contracts, divided by 45 million gallons is $5. and whatever it is, $0.10 to $0.15 a gallon.
shawn severson -- water tower research -- analyst
and so what i mean -- there's a big variation in these contracts, i guess, is what i meant. so we when we look at -- we sign up contracts and it's starting to fill up, we should take very similar economics -- use the same economics for all of them.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
yes, we do.
shawn severson -- water tower research -- analyst
yes. ok. ok.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
yes. and we found a sweet spot on pricing, where it works for everybody. it works well, keeps the customers incentivized to work with us because they get some of the green value. it's interesting.
shawn severson -- water tower research -- analyst
just to clarify the diversity in that pipeline.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
yeah. the diversity of the pipeline, so what do you mean in diversity?
shawn severson -- water tower research -- analyst
is this 30 or three that are in there? you know, trying to say these smaller --
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
there's probably other $10 billion. i think it's like i'm going to call it $15 billion to $20 billion.
shawn severson -- water tower research -- analyst
got it. ok. that's helpful. thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of craig irwin with roth capital partners. your line is open.
craig irwin -- roth capital partners -- analyst
good evening, and thanks for taking my questions. so, pat, i understand the enthusiasm your customers out there. jet fuel is the one fuel that really has the least environmental compliance of all the liquid fields, its high sulphur, high emissions, high particulars, and really one of the best opportunities for environmental remediation with clean fuels. can you maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing as one of the leaders in this industry on the regulatory front? now, i think many of the customers out there are asking today in anticipation of regulatory action.
what do you see as possibilities on the horizon that could bring the rest of the industry along with the thought leaders that have that have already signed up as your customers?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
yeah. so i think what'll happen, there's several things you're exactly right. jet fuel needs work. they can't get to there -- the industry can't get to the goals without having sustainable aviation fuel available.
and there's a couple things that are happening. one is that the industry itself is pushing to go up from the 50% blends to the 100%. and that's going to take a mixture of stuff people like us. we could go make more than all the components as well.
but there's lots of guys who can do that. i think mixing and matching is probably the right thing. the key is to drive to low carbon, the lower the carbon, the better. how you count perverts matters, a upturn.
and you got to do it in a fair basis. and legit, otherwise, you start doing really weird, you know, people do weird behaviors. so there's a bunch of things like that that are being cooked. and then the important ones are around, there's some bills proposed, like for blenders tax credits, that would give like $1.50 a gallon for jet fuel produced in the states.
and that would help the economics. the airline industry itself does not want to pay a premium for these fields. they know they have to buy them, the model that we have for selling fuels allows them to share in the environmental benefits. and so we aren't quite as dependent upon those people which is why we get some of these contracts, and maybe others don't.
remember, we're getting on a ticker-pay basis for real ticker-pay basis. and that makes us a slightly different than most.
craig irwin -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. excellent. so then just, economics or something that's going to be a little bit of a wiggle, as production comes online, and today really everything's based on forecasts, but can you maybe talk us through just the basic process that you see, when you talk to regulators, traditionally, for example, carb starts with production today, and looks at what you can achieve versus that baseline. so if you start off with, i don't know, whatever it is 600 ppm, probably of sulfur in jet fuel, and you can bring that down to 500 ppm by mixing in 20% clean fuels, that move down and the baseline is where the economic value is uncovered.
and that's how much bigger move down in sox submissions and you're going to get in almost any other investment out there environmentally. i mean, are these the things that are factoring into these regulatory considerations out there, and some of the some potential economic compliance values that will impact the credit values as we look out onto the horizon? because i assume there will be credits at some point for the compliance value of these fields.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
yeah, that's a really good point. so what craig is asking about is that there's going to be the nox and sox and the particulates are big deals. the sulfur problem is something that is hard to deal with, and it come -- its inherent with petroleum-based products. you're right, we can eliminate that.
and it's a clear cut, we can avoid it, we don't have it. and so that's a good thing. and likewise, with particulates, we can get rid of those. and those are usually these aromatic compounds.
you're right, they're valued. what i think is going to happen is we're going to see more regulation upon those things, actually, in fact, even as part of the clean air act, and i know you know this already is that's already there just hasn't been implemented yet, will the new administration start to push that stuff, probably should. they have been delaying it for how many years, a decade already. they should clamp down, that would benefit guys like us, and we normally don't talk about those benefits.
now, that said, one of the ways that we price our product is that we do an index like to jet fuel or gas and some of these, like a premium gasoline, and we get paid a premium on top of that just for its technical properties, which in part are related to its lack of -- particulate lack of sulfur. so in our pricing models, we're starting to see value for that already, which is pretty darn interesting, because it's way early on. so it's our customers problem. they see it.
it's coming at them, and they're trying to figure out what to do.
craig irwin -- roth capital partners -- analyst
excellent, excellent. and then congratulations on the progress on net-zero 1. i know we're really in a capital phase now, and a lot of this is going to be value is going to be -- value is going to be realized as production comes online. what would you say we can look at today for best indicators of the economics of production of that plant when it comes online? it's difficult to compare a tenant scale up, but is there anything else out there and a broader universe built that maybe we can look at and say, this has been done before and we understand it now?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
yeah, you got it. there is. the last time a plant of the scale that was done that was a non-ethanol fermentation. that did a combination of genetically modified yeast and a new fermentation system and then had to make it work right to do chemistry was back when we did pla, plastics at cargill so that we genetically engineer  the yeast fermentation plant was giant.
in fact, at the time, it was the world's biggest fermentation plant, the team i have at gevo were the leaders of that they did it. they were the guys are still with me at gevo. this helps us. there's like the lessons we learned about what works, what doesn't with the problems with the pitfalls, this is knowledge, you can't get any other place, because you got to know how to do this stuff at large scale and the subtleties that go with it.
well, my group has been never done it before. that gives me enormous comfort. and chris ryan, my chief operating officer, he led that. ron borchardt, my head engineer, he's the guy who built those plants.
and so we have them here. and they've been working with it ever since. and that's been on our mind and the lessons we've learned. and so it is in this net-zero plant that we're talking about is on the order of that kind of a plant at that we did back in the day at cargill.
and it'd be a little bit smaller than one of the giant ethanol plants.
craig irwin -- roth capital partners -- analyst
excellent. well, congratulations on the progress. i look forward to tracking things going forward. and i'll hop back in the queue.
thank you.
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
thanks, craig.
operator
thank you. i'm not showing any further questions. i will now like to turn the call back over to pat for closing remarks.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
we have made great progress. i wish i could tell you all the details that i know. you'll get really, really excited. and i just can't.
and it'll be fun to unfold them. and it takes patience for me, too. i want to see more of these investments, these contracts with customers done i want to see, they're exciting, and more than one net-zero plant. that's a nice problem to have.
and it'll also be interesting to see, as that volume stacks up on take-or-pay contracts. it really does end the debate about what will people pay for this and are they interested. really, if you're sitting on the sidelines watching, so it's going to be fun to see the impact on others around us and what happens. and then the engineering, we keep plugging along, and we'll get her done.
it takes an enormous quantity of work. we're doing something unusual here integrating renewable energy called regal energy island into our plant because, remember, we got to do the optimization at the wind. we're going to be making hydrogen. we're having a debate about, how much hydrogen we should make.
and besides, we think that's the very best way to store some energy from the excess wind we'll have. there's a question of should we sell the stuff. yeah, we got a lot of things to sort out about, how to conduct the integration. thank god, the technology itself is solid and worked out.
so with that, thanks for joining us. everybody, have a good evening.

hello, and welcome to gevo's first-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. my name is towanda, and i will be your operator for today's call. [operator instructions] please note that this conference is being recorded. i would now turn the call over to geoff williams, gevo's vice president, general counsel, and secretary.
please go ahead, mr. williams.
geoff williams -- vice president, general counsel, and secretary
good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining gevo's first-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. i would like to start by introducing today's participants from the company. with us today is patrick gruber, gevo's chief executive officer; and carolyn romero, chief accounting officer. earlier today, we issued a press release that outlines the topics we plan to discuss today.
a copy of this press release is available on our website at www.gevo.com. i would like to remind our listeners that this conference call is open to the media and that we are providing a simultaneous webcast of this call to the public. a replay of today's call will be available on gevo's website. on the call today and on this webcast, you will hear discussions of certain non-gaap financial measures.
non-gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with gaap. reconciliation of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures is contained in the press release distributed today, which is posted on our website.we will also make certain forward-looking statements about events and circumstances that have not yet occurred, including, but not limited to, projections about gevo's operating activities for the remainder of 2021 and beyond. these forward-looking statements are based on management's current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those disclosed in gevo's form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020, which was filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission, and in subsequent reports and other filings made with the sec by gevo, including gevo's quarterly reports on form 10-q.
investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. such forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and gevo disclaims any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. on today's call, pat will begin with a discussion of gevo's business developments. carolyn will then review gevo's financial results for the first quarter of 2021.
and following the presentation, we'll open up the call for questions. i'll now turn the call over to pat. 
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
thanks, geoff. well, we're on track to accomplish our goals for this year. the engineering of net-zero 1 is on track. the debt solution with citi to finance net-zero 1 is actually ahead of schedule.
we still have a lot of work to do, but so far, the net-zero 1 project is looking very good. we broke ground on rng project. it should come online next year. this project is targeting production of 355,000 million btus per year and should generate free cash flow for gevo of approximately $9 million to $16 million on an annualized basis beginning in late 2022.
tim cesarek, our chief commercial officer, has managed to increase our customer contract pipeline by several-fold. we now are discussing and negotiating upwards of $10 billion of take-or-pay offtake agreements on a revenue basis. recall that for each 45 million gallons of contracted product sales, which is the current approximate design capacity of our net-zero plans. the sum of the anticipated product sales revenue during the expected take-or-pay contract terms of six to seven years should be about $1.5 billion.
it's real money, real business. so if we were able to ink several other contracts in our pipeline, it would mean several more additional plants will be needed to be built. these take-or-pay contracts are sure we've to obtain because they require the customer to back it with their balance sheet or some other credit support method. we expect to announce the customers and volumes when we can after the contracts are signed.
i think it's likely that we could have more than one net-zero plant being built at the same time in the coming years. based on our current modeling assumptions, we believe that the ebitda for a net-zero plant should be more than $100 million per year once operating. we believe that subsequent net-zero plants would likewise model out to be in that same range, as we get more plants booked with take-or-pay contracts will be interesting to see how strategic investors in wall street view this. we would hope that the increased visibility into more potential cash flow streams will result in better recognition of value for gevo and his shareholders.
now, with strategic investors, it's a slightly different perspective. as the tangible demand in the form of take-or-pay becomes bigger, then it becomes even more undeniable adds to the potential for our business. the more take-or-pay contracts make the more net-zero plants we will need and the more attractive we should become to strategic investors. next, i want to address questions from several investors about what our proposals in our definitive proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders to be held on june 9th, 2021.
the questions are specifically on proposal number four, which is an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the total number of authorized shares of common stock. this proposal seems to have created confusion for some stockholders, namely a reaction that this proposal means that there would be immediate dilution to current stockholders. proposal number four is asking stockholders to approve an amendment to the company's certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 250 million to 500 million. this increase doesn't mean we are issuing these new shares immediately.
i want to be clear that we're not asking shareholders to approve an offering of common stock at this time. that's not what we're doing here. it's important to remember that gevo has used most of its existing authorized shares of common stock over the years. the board of directors believes it is in the best interest of the company to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock in order to give us greater flexibility considering a planning for future potential business needs, including but not limited to potential strategic transactions, strategic partnerships, business combinations, of course, financing, the construction up to three production facilities, as well as other general corporate transactions.
now, i will turn the call over to carolyn, who will take us through the financials. carolyn?
carolyn romero -- chief accounting officer
thank you, pat. gevo reported revenue in the first quarter of 2021 of $0.1 million as compared to $3.8 million in the same period in 2020. during the first quarter of 2021, there were no hydrocarbon revenue compared with $0.1 million in the same period in 2020. hydrocarbon sales decreased because of lower production volumes at the south hampton resources inc.
facility in silsbee, texas. during the first quarter of 2021, no revenue was derived at the luverne facility from ethanol sales and related products, compared with $3.7 million during the same period in 2020. as a result of unfavorable commodity environment during the three months ended march 31, 2020, we terminated our production of ethanol and distillers' grains, which resulted in no sales over the current period. cost of goods sold was $2.0 million in the first quarter of 2021 versus $8.1 million in the same period in 2020.
cost of goods sold included approximately $0.9 million associated with the maintenance of the luverne facility and approximately $1.1 million in depreciation expense. growth loss was $1.9 million for the first quarter of 2021 versus $4.3 million for the first quarter of 2020. research and development expense increased by $0.8 million, during the first quarter of 2021, compared with the same period in 2020 due primarily to an increase in personnel and consulting expenses. selling, general, and administrative expense increased by $1.2 million during the first quarter of 2021, compared with the same period in 2020 due primarily to an increase in personnel and consulting expenses.
preliminary state project costs increased by $2.6 million, during the three months ended march 31, 2021, compared with the same period in 2020 due primarily to increase consulting and research and development expenses related to our r&d and net-zero projects. within total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2021, we reported approximately $0.8 million of non-cash stock-based compensation. for the first quarter of 2021, we reported a loss from operations of $9.9 million, compared to $8.0 million for the same period in 2020. in the first quarter of 2021, cash ebitda loss, a non-gaap measure that is calculated by adding back depreciation and non-cash stock-based compensation to gaap loss from operations was $7.8 million, compared with $6.2 million in the same quarter of 2020.
there's no interest expense for the three months ended march 31, 2021, a decrease of $0.5 million as compared to the same period in 2020, due to the conversion of all of our 12% convertible senior notes, due 2020, 2021 to common stock during 2020. for the first quarter of 2021, we reported a net loss of $10.1 million, or a loss of $0.05 per share on weighted average shares outstanding of 183,566,524. this compares to a loss of $9.3 million in the first-quarter 2020 were a loss of $0.64 per share, based on weighted average shares outstanding of 14,472,798.in the first quarter of 2021, gevo recognized net non-cash loss totaling 0.1 million due to changes in the fair value of certain of our financial instruments, such as warrants and embedded derivatives. adding back these non-cash losses, resulted in a non-gaap adjusted net loss of $10.0 million in the first quarter of 2021, while non-gaap adjusted net loss per share of $0.05.
this compares to a non-gaap adjusted net loss of $8.5 million in the first quarter of 2020 or a non-gaap adjusted net loss per share of $0.59. now, i will turn the call back over to pat to wrap things up.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
thanks, carolyn. so that overall things are on track and looking good. we have the catalysts that are coming up between the off-take agreements and such. i'm pretty pleased with where we are.
let's open up this call for questions. operator?
",2021-Q1,GEVO,0.9994,0.9745,
0.7017,,":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of sameer joshi with h.c. wainright.
sameer joshi -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
good afternoon pat, carolyn, thanks for taking my questions. so, with this increased scope to 46 million gallons per year, how does that impact or affect the subsequent net-zero projects that you would do? will those be of so larger size as well? and what is the plan going forward?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
well, so let me comment first to just say that one thing we just put up and published on our investor presentation on our website, all the stuff that i just set out loud, so you can see it written down, and so it makes it much easier. and then to answer your question specifically is we think about it as that we've done the work in the engineering for this that we're in the process of it for the net-zero 1. we could translate that directly into make it a similar sized plan. so, think of it as a copy of net-zero 1.
that's the comment paradigm. however, we've got people we're working with were challenging us to think much bigger. and so we're asking ourselves that question as to how to go about doing that. so, we're running -- it's a very simple path to just simply copy net-zero 1, right.
so, that's kind of the incumbent hypothesis and it makes sense because the demand is so much greater than the product supply. so, we're asking things like, well, why not a 100 million gallon plant. how can we go bigger? how can you achieve 500 million, 700 million gallons in five years? is that the kind of stuff we're trying to address. and of course, there's a whole bunch of chicken and eggs here because, all right, people who actually is going to buy this exactly and when and what are you going to do.
and yes, we can do it this technically possible. it's just a matter of capital. so, it's getting to be quite interesting for us. right now, there is definitely, definitely, definitely a shift that has occurred in the last several months.
sameer joshi -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
yeah. no, that was the reason for the call that instead of 46 million gallons, what if you would be able to do bigger if the industry demands it?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
yeah, we can. there's no limit. so, the reason -- what we're doing right now is we took what we had. we're trying to stay with it something we already had well defined, and we're trying to optimize the returns and capital.
so, i noted that in our models, they project that the ebitda has increased from about $100 million a year that you talked about. that's pretty good. that's like a 50% increase from optimizing. i think we should spend certain money on optimizing.
sameer joshi -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
it's exciting, certainly.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
i mean, that was a better result than i ever expected from our people, well done. there's still so many variables and stuff. everybody always ask me, well, what happens if corn stays high forever. and all this -- you know what, we've got enough economics to work with and we have additional things that we can do with the technology where we feel pretty comfortable that we're in a good spot in terms of what project and yes the details are going to move around a little bit in terms of specific irrs.
but overall, we feel pretty -- we got a handle on it, much incredible speed, i think. so--
sameer joshi -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
and just one more clarification on net-zero. the green hydrogen that is going to be produced is part of the $720 million to $980 million capex. but then for the excess that you are planning to or may produce, is there any additional capex incremental to this $980 million?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
so, on the $980 million, right now, we're at -- if you're going to far us to other projects, it'd be $720 million, it's a number to use to compare us to other people. once it's financed and installed and you do the prepaid accounts and all the other craft that goes with project financing that i really don't like, by the way. you add all that up, now you get to $980 million. so, in addition to the $720 million would it take additional capital if we want to make a whole lot more hydrogen interest, yes.
so, the game plan for us is to figure out who actually wants to buy hydrogen, where, what, does it make sense, and just do your -- do the calculation. and if it makes economic sense, you can get equivalent returns or better than -- so if it has attractive returns, 18%, 20% or better or something, then we'd say that may be a word to use of our capital. that's how we think about it. so--
sameer joshi -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
yeah. thanks for that clarification. moving to the rng, the 355,000 mmbtu plus capacity, is that all going to be taken by bp for the recent press release, just wanted to clarify that.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
it is. we're going to send it down the pipeline to california because that's how you maximize value. and that's attractive. and we could later on take gas up to the burn, which we do, we are running it again.
but we could take it up there as we expand liver and make it into a hydrocarbon plant or it's a net-zero 1. but right now, the way you make the most money is just send it to california is through bp.
sameer joshi -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
right. and this next question probably has been asked before, but just wanted to understand the preliminary stage project costs are being expensed as against capitalized. that is because they're not associated with a particular project, but it is just pre to the project. is that correct?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
i know that -- yeah, i was going to say, there's some that we capitalized to some that we don't, so but carolyn can explain.
carolyn romero -- chief accounting officer
right. so, the r&d-related costs are being capitalized effective with the second quarter. that's because we've got the financing and we're able to move forward with the project. the cost related to net-zero are being expensed until we get past all of the fel 3.
sameer joshi -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
ok. so, there could be something in the future.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
yeah, yeah, it will be. when we get to the near the closings and stuff is what she is talking about. well, short handling go for some of the focus to call it fel 3, but fel 3 is not well understood by a broad group. what it is, when we get down to that plus or minus -- when we get down to that plus or minus 10% level and say, we're going to do the financing now here it is.
that's the time when the stuff would be capitalized and will it be a look back as well because we are keeping track of our expenses and putting them into buckets in a very onerous process of tracking all of our time. carolyn makes us do it, lynn makes us to do it.
sameer joshi -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
no, that's great. ok, thanks. that's all i have right now. congratulations on the progress, and good luck.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from poe fratt with noble capital markets.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
good afternoon, pat. i was hoping to -- with the project costs moving around a little bit, i was hoping to get your current estimate of what you think the equity investment from gevo into the first spb would be?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
we're assuming 65% debt, so if it's $980 million, that's like $340 million or something like that line there. lynn are you there. i got that right. right, lynn?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
yes, $345 million, yup.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
that's up from $270 million is what we thought earlier. but it's good. it's all in the space of good and nice and doable. and you know what, getting those -- one of the questions that has come up over and over again, you've even asked me, how can you get more return sooner back? how more distributable cash sooner? well, here you go.
we deploy more capital sooner with a good return sooner.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
and then have you firmed up or is there any potential -- or could you give us maybe potential timing of net-zero 2? if you and then but take us -- and i know it's tough, pat, but can you take a stab at when we're going to see additional capacity at net-zero 2 sold down?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
we've already sold since earlier this year, we have announced like 10 million more gallons, so that i think we're up there's like 10 million more -- that's a lot -- 10 million more gallons, so to do another 35 million gallons. so, i think what's going to happen is we're going to be well over that. so, we're probably -- we're up in another 50 million or 60 million gallons immediately and there's discussions for several hundred million gallons, actual real stuffing negotiated that's way, way, way bigger, like order of magnitude bigger. but -- so we're sitting here trying to figure out how to do it.
so the opportunity is here in front of us. it's an outstanding problem to have, but how do we go bigger sooner, much bigger. and that is part of the question. yes, we can keep the point net-zero copies kind of like that because i can understand it is straightforward.
it's relatively bite size for this market space. but we want to be bigger. and we have one of the very few technologies that actually works. so, we've got to figure it out.
and that's one of the active things we're working on. so, as far back to your question, when can i announce the net-zero 2, i'd expect soon. i always say that, though, poe. and i expect these contracts to be done.
they're not gone. and i know why the -- it is this final negotiations. these are big contracts. remember, a 45 million gallon offtake that's worth about $1.5 billion across the life of it.
so, these aren't chunk change for people. they all play serious and doing it and they're inching along, inching along, getting done. and but then i think we'll see ones that are bigger or intent for ones that are bigger.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
understood. so, on the engineering work that you're doing, you've gotten the estimate down to plus or minus 30%. i think i heard you say that you need to get to plus or minus 10% to get the bond closed. when do you expect -- it sounded like you might expect that by the end of the year.
is that what i heard?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
i think that what we'll see is it mostly in that range by the end of the year. but what we're going to really need to get it closed is take those numbers and have the epc company. we will announce in the not too distant future. who they say, here's the wrap that goes with it.
that's actually what's needed to get to the bond financing. and so what will happen is we'll get those engineering numbers refined around the end of the year kind of a thing. and we'll continue to work on and keep refining. we'll never -- we won't stop the engineering.
we'll just keep plugging along. but we'll get to a point where now the epc company goes, here's the number that they're willing to guarantee.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
ok. and then do you have a working estimate for the wastewater and then the wind component of net-zero 1?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
lynn, what's the wastewater treatment plant is what, $100 million-ish.
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
it's less than that, but it's less -- it's a little less than $100 million. but these numbers are incorporated in our models as cost of service estimating the capital cost, return on capital to a build on operate, as well as their operating costs. that's the same thing we've been doing all along with the wind. we're doing the same thing now with water -- with wastewater and ad.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
so, what you should expect, i think, and what i expect is that we'll wind up being a co-investor with other people to get everybody see it, everybody feels more comfort when we do that, just like we did with our wind project done at luverne and then we go build it out. and we have a lots -- several parties who want to play with us here. so, that's good.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
yup. i just wanted to make -- clarify and make sure that the $720 million does not include the wastewater nor the wind at this point in time?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
you'll see that in our slide deck that we just put up when you get a chance to go through it. and we try to be -- for all of you listening who go look at her, we put out an enormous quantity of data into that slide deck that we just put up. it goes on and really tries to be crystal clear about the assumptions we're making and what we're thinking about things. we're trying to be really transparent.
but i need everyone to understand where we are. we're in the midst of sorting out making sausage, figuring things out. we're trying to manage it, and i even laid out principles of how we're thinking about things as we design, because it'd be easy to go super, super fast. and a lot of people go, tell me, pat go faster, how we can you those.
yes, i can go faster and i can waste like $100 million or $200 million, that's what i can do or we can do what we just did, optimize it, figure it out, incrementally increase capital and boost the ebitda and distributions. and so that's the work to be done here is to be smart about how we figure this out to make the most money at least risk.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
yup. yeah, i looked at slide 28 and so i was just trying to figure out what else -- what other capital costs might be associated with the entire project. let's--
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
poe, let me just go back. so, look, on slide 28, you'll see that table. and there's enough information there now. people can build a pretty darn good model and then do sensitivities around it with various assumptions and look at slide 29 as well.
and on slide 29, you'll see some more information. we decided to just put that out there. one of the things about people i was asking about is corn, what happens if corn stays at this high price? well, guess what, that has a relatively minor impact on the overall project. now, guess what, over 50% of the cost of corn is offset by the co-products, the nutritional products and corn oil value.
that's an internal hedge we have. that helps us. this is what helps make these projects attractive. it isn't quite as volatile as people would think just looking at simple commodities.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
yup. that slide -- those two slides are really helpful. if we could talk about the timing of capex now that the r&d bond financing proceeds are on your balance sheet or on your financial statements, can you talk about the timing of capex on the rng plant?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
lynn?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
yeah, we'll be complete. the project is on schedule and the anticipation is that we'll start up operations and begin producing very early next year. the way it works is we pay our contractors and then we submit to the trustee for reimbursements out of those bond proceeds. so, there's always a lag of a month or so from when we put the cash out till we get it back.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
and so that full, lynn, that full what $70 million will be laid out and reimbursed over -- laid out over the next three quarters, is that sort of how we should cash lock that down?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
no, i think it will -- we expect to be complete by year-end. so that we will have done all the work and paid all the bills, but it may drip into the first quarter on recovery of those last bill -- last contractor payments.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
ok, great. and then on net-zero 1, if you could just highlight what you are going to spend in the third and fourth quarter on that project?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
i will take that. the -- i think the largest uncertainty is around the long lead equipment deposits. we have budgeted $20 million for long lead deposits. the timing of that is uncertain, but we need to get that out before year-end to secure equipment to maintain schedule.
we probably -- i don't really have the numbers in front of me in terms of a cash burn for the other elements around engineering and site development, but it's going to be a fairly substantial number. i think we've always said that the total development cost, including engineering and long lead and financing up to close would be somewhere around $45 million. and then we recovered that at financial close as contributed equity.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
perfect. great. thanks for your time.
operator
that concludes today's question-and-answer session. i'd like to turn the call back to patrick gruber for closing remarks.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
well, thank you all for joining us. i encourage you to take a good look at that. our recent investor presentation, you will see that we did go into more detail about where we are on our net-zero project, how we're thinking about capital, the results are turning out, as i said, better than i expected. in fact, the ebitda has gone up and stuff.
yes, we still got a lot of work to do to sort it out. we're working it. this customer pipeline thing is a big deal and there's no one more in patients for getting contracts done than me. i can make my people crazy from bugging them, but we are moving it forward.
and the size of the discussions, these are like getting to be big. it's in the billions of dollars of capital, many, many billions of dollars of capital in the future. and people wanting to participate with us. and so all those things have to be sorted out.
net-zero 2, much more straightforward, that one is far along, and i can see that one being net-zero, a copy of the net-zero 1. but we got to grow bigger and faster. and that's where our attention is turning, how will we do that. so, there'll be more to come as this all unfolds, but it's an interesting time in place.
thanks for joining us.

welcome to gevo's second-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. my name is liz, and i will be your operator for today. [operator instructions] please note that this conference is being recorded. i will now turn the call over to geoffrey williams, gevo's vice president, general counsel, and secretary.
please go ahead, mr. williams.
geoffrey williams -- vice president, general counsel, and secretary
good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining gevo's second-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. i would like to start by introducing today's participants from the company. with us today is patrick gruber, gevo's chief executive officer; and carolyn romero, gevo's chief accounting officer. earlier today, we issued a press release that outlines the topics we plan to discuss.
a copy of this press release is available on our website at www.gevo.com. i would like to remind our listeners that this conference call is open to the media and that we are providing a simultaneous webcast of this call to the public. a replay of today's call will be available on gevo's website. on the call today and on this webcast, you will hear discussions of certain non-gaap financial measures.
non-gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for information presented in accordance with gaap. reconciliation of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures is contained in the press release distributed earlier today, which is posted on our website. we will also make certain forward-looking statements about events and circumstances that have not yet occurred, including, but not limited to, projections about gevo's net-zero 1 project and our operating activities for the remainder of 2021 and beyond. these forward-looking statements are based on management's current beliefs, expectations and assumptions and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those disclosed in gevo's form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020, that was filed with the u.s.
securities and exchange commission and in our subsequent reports and other filings made with the sec by gevo, including gevo's quarterly reports on form 10-q. investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. such forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date, and gevo disclaims any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. on today's call, pat will begin with a discussion of gevo's business developments, carolyn will then review gevo's financial results for the second quarter of 2021, and following the presentation, we'll open up the call for questions.
i'll now turn the call over to patrick gruber. pat? 
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
thanks, geoff. today, i'm pleased to be able to report an update on our engineering work and financial projections for net-zero 1. the results are good. we are on track to complete the next phase of engineering work, the next iteration, if you will, by the end of december this year.
this next iteration will tighten up the capital estimates further. of course, this is all in preparation for the debt deal getting done in the first half of 2022. now. hydrocarbon capacity is sold out.
in fact, it's oversubscribed based upon our take or pay contracts already in place. this is very, very good. we did decide to change the scope of net-zero 1 a little bit because we figured out how to potentially make more money sooner. we have added capacity for increased amounts of isobutanol, about 44 million pounds per year, which we plan on selling as a specialty chemical.
in addition, we are planning to increase our production of nutritional products like protein and animal feed by 40 million pounds. that brings us to a total of 340 million pounds of those products. and then we plan on making 46 million gallons per year of hydrocarbons rather than 45, and we still expect to produce about 30 million pounds of corn oil. now, as a result of that change scope and with updated pricing assumptions based upon the pricing in our existing contracts, the net-zero 1 project revenue is currently projected to be approximately $340 million to $350 million per year.
this includes the hydrocarbon products, the carbon values, nutritional product value, the corn oil value and the revenue from iva that we expect to produce in excess of what is needed for the feedstock for the hydrocarbon capacity. now, the really good part is that the current projected ebitda for the net-zero 1 project is approximately $150 million to $160 million per year. now, that's an increase of approximately $50 million to $60 million compared to what we had previously discussed or previously had told investors. that's really good news.
the current projected levered irr to gevo is approximately 18% to 20% and includes all the revenue streams and that's the distributable cash, the oem fees and all the rest. the distributed cash to gevo from the net-zero 1 project after debt service and major maintenance is currently projected to be approximately $80 million to $90 million once the plant is up at steady state, and that's based upon an assumed 65% debt load. the capital cost projection is currently expected to be approximately $720 million for equipment and build out. those are the installed hard costs.
now, on a fully financed, fully installed bases, fully deployed and paying for all the provisional interest during construction, debt reserves and all the rest, that brings it up to a total of $980 million. now, included in these costs or the increased capacity for the hydrocarbons and additional capital for more iva capacity to serve the specialty markets, infrastructure to facilitate an easier capacity expansion and then adoption of certain unit operations to facilitate greenhouse gas reduction, more efficiently, and then, of course, the increased cost of steel and equipment based on the latest data in the market. wastewater treatment and on-site biogas production are currently planned to be a separate project with separate funding and anticipated cost of capital commensurate with infrastructure returns using a third-party build own operate model. on-site biogas production is expected to meet the thermal demand for the plant.
it may be that we choose to finance the water treatment plant, that is a future decision. a separate but related wind power project is being developed to meet the majority of the net-zero 1 electricity demand. the wind project will be wired directly to net-zero 1. the wind project would be a separate project with separate funding, again, anticipated lower cost of capital using a build own operate model.
we also plan to making green hydrogen. current scope of capex includes the capacity of hydrogen wine for our products, we are still determining if and how much excess to make for the marketplace and the corresponding economic benefit to gevo. now, we know the world wants green hydrogen. since we are developing the capability to make it, we are working to figure out the best ways to make excess quantities and take it to market.
now, i'm extremely pleased with these results. we are continuing to optimize and try to figure out ways to bring more cash and profit back to gevo sooner, while reducing risk in our operations and business systems as we get net-zero 1 operational. now for more information, please see our updated investor presentation that is available on our website at www.gevo.com. we are also planning to do a fireside chat on wednesday, august 18 at 4:00 p.m.
eastern daylight time with chris ryan, our president and coo; and lynn smull, our cfo, who will together take questions and discuss the net-zero 1 project and give a little more detail as to what's going on there and how we're thinking about it. please join chris and lynn you can. we expect to be announcing the location of customers for our second net-zero project in the near future. our discussions with potential customers have shifted.
they are much, much much larger, and you'll see that in the updated deck and looking at it. the customer pipeline is now approaching about $20 billion of contracts in discussion. that's quite something. and we are working out then how to figure out, how to grow capacity much faster, so we can achieve many hundreds of millions of gallons of production and sales within five years.
there a lot of moving parts. the game has changed. bigger and faster, that's what we're driving for, that's what i'm driving my team for at gevo to achieve. switching gears to rng, i am pleased to report that rng project is on track in terms of construction.
we expect it to start up on time and begin producing gas early next year. i'm pleased to work with bp to sell the rng that will be produced. on monday of next week, we expect to publish our first esg report on our website. this esg report is, i say, well done.
in it, you will see our thinking. and if you invest in us, please read it. overall, we had an excellent quarter and we continue to make progress on our goals for this year. now, i will turn the call over to carolyn, who will take us through the financials.
carolyn?
carolyn romero -- chief accounting officer
thank you, pat. gevo reported revenue in the second quarter of 2021 of $0.4 million, as compared to $1 million in the same period in 2020. during the second quarter of 2021, hydrocarbon revenue was $0.3 million, compared with $0.9 million in the same period in 2020. hydrocarbon sales decreased because of lower production volumes at the south hampton resources facility in silsbee, texas.
during the second quarter of 2020, no revenue was derived at the luverne facility from ethanol sales and related products compared to $0.1 million during the same period in 2020. as a result of an unfavorable commodity market during the three months ended march 31, 2020, we terminated our production of ethanol and distillers grains, which resulted in no sales for the period. cost of goods sold was $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2021 versus $2.6 million in the same period in 2020. we increased maintenance and preparation for isobutanol production that began in july 2021.
cost of goods sold included approximately $1.6 million associated with the maintenance of the luverne facility and approximately $1.2 million in depreciation expense. gross loss was $2.4 million for the second quarter of 2021 versus $1.7 million for the second quarter of 2020. research and development expense increased by $0.7 million during the second quarter of 2021 compared with the same period in 2020 due primarily to an increase in personnel and consulting expenses as we work to improve our process for growing and fermenting yeast strains. selling, general and administrative expense increased by $2.1 million during the second quarter of 2021 compared with the same period in 2020, due primarily to increases in personnel, professional fees and insurance to support the growth in our operations and an increase in consulting related to creating our first environmental, social and governance report and documenting our compliance with section 404(b) of the sarbanes-oxley act.
preliminary stage project costs increased by $5.3 million during the three months ended june 30, 2021, compared with the same period in 2020, due primarily to an increase in consulting for preliminary engineering costs and personnel expenses to support the growth in business activity at our net-zero projects. as a result of the business activities noted above, during the second-quarter 2021, we reported a loss from operations of $19.0 million, compared to $5.3 million for the same period in 2020. in the second quarter of 2021, cash ebitda loss, a non-gaap measure that is calculated by adding back depreciation and non-cash stock-based compensation to gaap loss from operation, was $17.1 million, compared to $3.1 million in the same quarter of 2020. interest expense in the three months ended june 30, 2021, was $6,000, a decrease of $0.5 million as compared to the same period in 2020 due to the conversion of all of our 12% convertible senior secured notes due 2021 to common stock during 2020.
as a result of the business activities noted above, during the second-quarter 2021, we reported a net loss of $18.3 million or a loss of $0.09 per share based on a weighted average shares outstanding of 198,137,420. this compares to a loss of $6 million in the second-quarter 2020 or a loss of $0.40 per share based on weighted average shares outstanding of 15,071,105. in the second-quarter 2021, gevo recognized net non-cash gain totaling $43,000 due to the changes in fair value of certain of our financial instruments such as warrants and embedded derivatives. adding back these non-cash losses resulted in a non-gaap adjusted net loss of $18.3 million in the second quarter of 2020 or a non-gaap adjusted net loss per share of $0.09.
this compares to a non-gaap adjusted net loss of $5.8 million in the second quarter of 2020 or a non-gaap adjusted net loss per share of $0.39. now, i'll turn it back over to pat to wrap things up.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
thanks, carolyn. so, we're looking forward to this. we have a lot of exciting things coming and we are fired up. our engineering work is -- whenever you do these things, it's an enormous quantity of work that we're cramming into a small period of time given that we just got the money to do these things at the beginning of in 2021, and we're making great progress and the engineering results really are good.
i like having our ebitda go up, that's exciting, and i certainly like the way our pipeline is growing. and i know everybody wants us to get more contracts signed faster, but these are really big. that's what they look like. so we're excited looking forward to it.
with that, we'll take questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of sameer joshi with h.c. wainright.
sameer joshi -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
good afternoon pat, carolyn, thanks for taking my questions. so, with this increased scope to 46 million gallons per year, how does that impact or affect the subsequent net-zero projects that you would do? will those be of so larger size as well? and what is the plan going forward?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
well, so let me comment first to just say that one thing we just put up and published on our investor presentation on our website, all the stuff that i just set out loud, so you can see it written down, and so it makes it much easier. and then to answer your question specifically is we think about it as that we've done the work in the engineering for this that we're in the process of it for the net-zero 1. we could translate that directly into make it a similar sized plan. so, think of it as a copy of net-zero 1.
that's the comment paradigm. however, we've got people we're working with were challenging us to think much bigger. and so we're asking ourselves that question as to how to go about doing that. so, we're running -- it's a very simple path to just simply copy net-zero 1, right.
so, that's kind of the incumbent hypothesis and it makes sense because the demand is so much greater than the product supply. so, we're asking things like, well, why not a 100 million gallon plant. how can we go bigger? how can you achieve 500 million, 700 million gallons in five years? is that the kind of stuff we're trying to address. and of course, there's a whole bunch of chicken and eggs here because, all right, people who actually is going to buy this exactly and when and what are you going to do.
and yes, we can do it this technically possible. it's just a matter of capital. so, it's getting to be quite interesting for us. right now, there is definitely, definitely, definitely a shift that has occurred in the last several months.
sameer joshi -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
yeah. no, that was the reason for the call that instead of 46 million gallons, what if you would be able to do bigger if the industry demands it?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
yeah, we can. there's no limit. so, the reason -- what we're doing right now is we took what we had. we're trying to stay with it something we already had well defined, and we're trying to optimize the returns and capital.
so, i noted that in our models, they project that the ebitda has increased from about $100 million a year that you talked about. that's pretty good. that's like a 50% increase from optimizing. i think we should spend certain money on optimizing.
sameer joshi -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
it's exciting, certainly.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
i mean, that was a better result than i ever expected from our people, well done. there's still so many variables and stuff. everybody always ask me, well, what happens if corn stays high forever. and all this -- you know what, we've got enough economics to work with and we have additional things that we can do with the technology where we feel pretty comfortable that we're in a good spot in terms of what project and yes the details are going to move around a little bit in terms of specific irrs.
but overall, we feel pretty -- we got a handle on it, much incredible speed, i think. so--
sameer joshi -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
and just one more clarification on net-zero. the green hydrogen that is going to be produced is part of the $720 million to $980 million capex. but then for the excess that you are planning to or may produce, is there any additional capex incremental to this $980 million?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
so, on the $980 million, right now, we're at -- if you're going to far us to other projects, it'd be $720 million, it's a number to use to compare us to other people. once it's financed and installed and you do the prepaid accounts and all the other craft that goes with project financing that i really don't like, by the way. you add all that up, now you get to $980 million. so, in addition to the $720 million would it take additional capital if we want to make a whole lot more hydrogen interest, yes.
so, the game plan for us is to figure out who actually wants to buy hydrogen, where, what, does it make sense, and just do your -- do the calculation. and if it makes economic sense, you can get equivalent returns or better than -- so if it has attractive returns, 18%, 20% or better or something, then we'd say that may be a word to use of our capital. that's how we think about it. so--
sameer joshi -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
yeah. thanks for that clarification. moving to the rng, the 355,000 mmbtu plus capacity, is that all going to be taken by bp for the recent press release, just wanted to clarify that.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
it is. we're going to send it down the pipeline to california because that's how you maximize value. and that's attractive. and we could later on take gas up to the burn, which we do, we are running it again.
but we could take it up there as we expand liver and make it into a hydrocarbon plant or it's a net-zero 1. but right now, the way you make the most money is just send it to california is through bp.
sameer joshi -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
right. and this next question probably has been asked before, but just wanted to understand the preliminary stage project costs are being expensed as against capitalized. that is because they're not associated with a particular project, but it is just pre to the project. is that correct?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
i know that -- yeah, i was going to say, there's some that we capitalized to some that we don't, so but carolyn can explain.
carolyn romero -- chief accounting officer
right. so, the r&d-related costs are being capitalized effective with the second quarter. that's because we've got the financing and we're able to move forward with the project. the cost related to net-zero are being expensed until we get past all of the fel 3.
sameer joshi -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
ok. so, there could be something in the future.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
yeah, yeah, it will be. when we get to the near the closings and stuff is what she is talking about. well, short handling go for some of the focus to call it fel 3, but fel 3 is not well understood by a broad group. what it is, when we get down to that plus or minus -- when we get down to that plus or minus 10% level and say, we're going to do the financing now here it is.
that's the time when the stuff would be capitalized and will it be a look back as well because we are keeping track of our expenses and putting them into buckets in a very onerous process of tracking all of our time. carolyn makes us do it, lynn makes us to do it.
sameer joshi -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
no, that's great. ok, thanks. that's all i have right now. congratulations on the progress, and good luck.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from poe fratt with noble capital markets.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
good afternoon, pat. i was hoping to -- with the project costs moving around a little bit, i was hoping to get your current estimate of what you think the equity investment from gevo into the first spb would be?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
we're assuming 65% debt, so if it's $980 million, that's like $340 million or something like that line there. lynn are you there. i got that right. right, lynn?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
yes, $345 million, yup.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
that's up from $270 million is what we thought earlier. but it's good. it's all in the space of good and nice and doable. and you know what, getting those -- one of the questions that has come up over and over again, you've even asked me, how can you get more return sooner back? how more distributable cash sooner? well, here you go.
we deploy more capital sooner with a good return sooner.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
and then have you firmed up or is there any potential -- or could you give us maybe potential timing of net-zero 2? if you and then but take us -- and i know it's tough, pat, but can you take a stab at when we're going to see additional capacity at net-zero 2 sold down?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
we've already sold since earlier this year, we have announced like 10 million more gallons, so that i think we're up there's like 10 million more -- that's a lot -- 10 million more gallons, so to do another 35 million gallons. so, i think what's going to happen is we're going to be well over that. so, we're probably -- we're up in another 50 million or 60 million gallons immediately and there's discussions for several hundred million gallons, actual real stuffing negotiated that's way, way, way bigger, like order of magnitude bigger. but -- so we're sitting here trying to figure out how to do it.
so the opportunity is here in front of us. it's an outstanding problem to have, but how do we go bigger sooner, much bigger. and that is part of the question. yes, we can keep the point net-zero copies kind of like that because i can understand it is straightforward.
it's relatively bite size for this market space. but we want to be bigger. and we have one of the very few technologies that actually works. so, we've got to figure it out.
and that's one of the active things we're working on. so, as far back to your question, when can i announce the net-zero 2, i'd expect soon. i always say that, though, poe. and i expect these contracts to be done.
they're not gone. and i know why the -- it is this final negotiations. these are big contracts. remember, a 45 million gallon offtake that's worth about $1.5 billion across the life of it.
so, these aren't chunk change for people. they all play serious and doing it and they're inching along, inching along, getting done. and but then i think we'll see ones that are bigger or intent for ones that are bigger.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
understood. so, on the engineering work that you're doing, you've gotten the estimate down to plus or minus 30%. i think i heard you say that you need to get to plus or minus 10% to get the bond closed. when do you expect -- it sounded like you might expect that by the end of the year.
is that what i heard?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
i think that what we'll see is it mostly in that range by the end of the year. but what we're going to really need to get it closed is take those numbers and have the epc company. we will announce in the not too distant future. who they say, here's the wrap that goes with it.
that's actually what's needed to get to the bond financing. and so what will happen is we'll get those engineering numbers refined around the end of the year kind of a thing. and we'll continue to work on and keep refining. we'll never -- we won't stop the engineering.
we'll just keep plugging along. but we'll get to a point where now the epc company goes, here's the number that they're willing to guarantee.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
ok. and then do you have a working estimate for the wastewater and then the wind component of net-zero 1?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
lynn, what's the wastewater treatment plant is what, $100 million-ish.
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
it's less than that, but it's less -- it's a little less than $100 million. but these numbers are incorporated in our models as cost of service estimating the capital cost, return on capital to a build on operate, as well as their operating costs. that's the same thing we've been doing all along with the wind. we're doing the same thing now with water -- with wastewater and ad.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
so, what you should expect, i think, and what i expect is that we'll wind up being a co-investor with other people to get everybody see it, everybody feels more comfort when we do that, just like we did with our wind project done at luverne and then we go build it out. and we have a lots -- several parties who want to play with us here. so, that's good.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
yup. i just wanted to make -- clarify and make sure that the $720 million does not include the wastewater nor the wind at this point in time?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
you'll see that in our slide deck that we just put up when you get a chance to go through it. and we try to be -- for all of you listening who go look at her, we put out an enormous quantity of data into that slide deck that we just put up. it goes on and really tries to be crystal clear about the assumptions we're making and what we're thinking about things. we're trying to be really transparent.
but i need everyone to understand where we are. we're in the midst of sorting out making sausage, figuring things out. we're trying to manage it, and i even laid out principles of how we're thinking about things as we design, because it'd be easy to go super, super fast. and a lot of people go, tell me, pat go faster, how we can you those.
yes, i can go faster and i can waste like $100 million or $200 million, that's what i can do or we can do what we just did, optimize it, figure it out, incrementally increase capital and boost the ebitda and distributions. and so that's the work to be done here is to be smart about how we figure this out to make the most money at least risk.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
yup. yeah, i looked at slide 28 and so i was just trying to figure out what else -- what other capital costs might be associated with the entire project. let's--
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
poe, let me just go back. so, look, on slide 28, you'll see that table. and there's enough information there now. people can build a pretty darn good model and then do sensitivities around it with various assumptions and look at slide 29 as well.
and on slide 29, you'll see some more information. we decided to just put that out there. one of the things about people i was asking about is corn, what happens if corn stays at this high price? well, guess what, that has a relatively minor impact on the overall project. now, guess what, over 50% of the cost of corn is offset by the co-products, the nutritional products and corn oil value.
that's an internal hedge we have. that helps us. this is what helps make these projects attractive. it isn't quite as volatile as people would think just looking at simple commodities.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
yup. that slide -- those two slides are really helpful. if we could talk about the timing of capex now that the r&d bond financing proceeds are on your balance sheet or on your financial statements, can you talk about the timing of capex on the rng plant?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
lynn?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
yeah, we'll be complete. the project is on schedule and the anticipation is that we'll start up operations and begin producing very early next year. the way it works is we pay our contractors and then we submit to the trustee for reimbursements out of those bond proceeds. so, there's always a lag of a month or so from when we put the cash out till we get it back.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
and so that full, lynn, that full what $70 million will be laid out and reimbursed over -- laid out over the next three quarters, is that sort of how we should cash lock that down?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
no, i think it will -- we expect to be complete by year-end. so that we will have done all the work and paid all the bills, but it may drip into the first quarter on recovery of those last bill -- last contractor payments.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
ok, great. and then on net-zero 1, if you could just highlight what you are going to spend in the third and fourth quarter on that project?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
i will take that. the -- i think the largest uncertainty is around the long lead equipment deposits. we have budgeted $20 million for long lead deposits. the timing of that is uncertain, but we need to get that out before year-end to secure equipment to maintain schedule.
we probably -- i don't really have the numbers in front of me in terms of a cash burn for the other elements around engineering and site development, but it's going to be a fairly substantial number. i think we've always said that the total development cost, including engineering and long lead and financing up to close would be somewhere around $45 million. and then we recovered that at financial close as contributed equity.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
perfect. great. thanks for your time.
operator
that concludes today's question-and-answer session. i'd like to turn the call back to patrick gruber for closing remarks.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
well, thank you all for joining us. i encourage you to take a good look at that. our recent investor presentation, you will see that we did go into more detail about where we are on our net-zero project, how we're thinking about capital, the results are turning out, as i said, better than i expected. in fact, the ebitda has gone up and stuff.
yes, we still got a lot of work to do to sort it out. we're working it. this customer pipeline thing is a big deal and there's no one more in patients for getting contracts done than me. i can make my people crazy from bugging them, but we are moving it forward.
and the size of the discussions, these are like getting to be big. it's in the billions of dollars of capital, many, many billions of dollars of capital in the future. and people wanting to participate with us. and so all those things have to be sorted out.
net-zero 2, much more straightforward, that one is far along, and i can see that one being net-zero, a copy of the net-zero 1. but we got to grow bigger and faster. and that's where our attention is turning, how will we do that. so, there'll be more to come as this all unfolds, but it's an interesting time in place.
thanks for joining us.

welcome to gevo's second-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. my name is liz, and i will be your operator for today. [operator instructions] please note that this conference is being recorded. i will now turn the call over to geoffrey williams, gevo's vice president, general counsel, and secretary.
please go ahead, mr. williams.
geoffrey williams -- vice president, general counsel, and secretary
good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining gevo's second-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. i would like to start by introducing today's participants from the company. with us today is patrick gruber, gevo's chief executive officer; and carolyn romero, gevo's chief accounting officer. earlier today, we issued a press release that outlines the topics we plan to discuss.
a copy of this press release is available on our website at www.gevo.com. i would like to remind our listeners that this conference call is open to the media and that we are providing a simultaneous webcast of this call to the public. a replay of today's call will be available on gevo's website. on the call today and on this webcast, you will hear discussions of certain non-gaap financial measures.
non-gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for information presented in accordance with gaap. reconciliation of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures is contained in the press release distributed earlier today, which is posted on our website. we will also make certain forward-looking statements about events and circumstances that have not yet occurred, including, but not limited to, projections about gevo's net-zero 1 project and our operating activities for the remainder of 2021 and beyond. these forward-looking statements are based on management's current beliefs, expectations and assumptions and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those disclosed in gevo's form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020, that was filed with the u.s.
securities and exchange commission and in our subsequent reports and other filings made with the sec by gevo, including gevo's quarterly reports on form 10-q. investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. such forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date, and gevo disclaims any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. on today's call, pat will begin with a discussion of gevo's business developments, carolyn will then review gevo's financial results for the second quarter of 2021, and following the presentation, we'll open up the call for questions.
i'll now turn the call over to patrick gruber. pat? 
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
thanks, geoff. today, i'm pleased to be able to report an update on our engineering work and financial projections for net-zero 1. the results are good. we are on track to complete the next phase of engineering work, the next iteration, if you will, by the end of december this year.
this next iteration will tighten up the capital estimates further. of course, this is all in preparation for the debt deal getting done in the first half of 2022. now. hydrocarbon capacity is sold out.
in fact, it's oversubscribed based upon our take or pay contracts already in place. this is very, very good. we did decide to change the scope of net-zero 1 a little bit because we figured out how to potentially make more money sooner. we have added capacity for increased amounts of isobutanol, about 44 million pounds per year, which we plan on selling as a specialty chemical.
in addition, we are planning to increase our production of nutritional products like protein and animal feed by 40 million pounds. that brings us to a total of 340 million pounds of those products. and then we plan on making 46 million gallons per year of hydrocarbons rather than 45, and we still expect to produce about 30 million pounds of corn oil. now, as a result of that change scope and with updated pricing assumptions based upon the pricing in our existing contracts, the net-zero 1 project revenue is currently projected to be approximately $340 million to $350 million per year.
this includes the hydrocarbon products, the carbon values, nutritional product value, the corn oil value and the revenue from iva that we expect to produce in excess of what is needed for the feedstock for the hydrocarbon capacity. now, the really good part is that the current projected ebitda for the net-zero 1 project is approximately $150 million to $160 million per year. now, that's an increase of approximately $50 million to $60 million compared to what we had previously discussed or previously had told investors. that's really good news.
the current projected levered irr to gevo is approximately 18% to 20% and includes all the revenue streams and that's the distributable cash, the oem fees and all the rest. the distributed cash to gevo from the net-zero 1 project after debt service and major maintenance is currently projected to be approximately $80 million to $90 million once the plant is up at steady state, and that's based upon an assumed 65% debt load. the capital cost projection is currently expected to be approximately $720 million for equipment and build out. those are the installed hard costs.
now, on a fully financed, fully installed bases, fully deployed and paying for all the provisional interest during construction, debt reserves and all the rest, that brings it up to a total of $980 million. now, included in these costs or the increased capacity for the hydrocarbons and additional capital for more iva capacity to serve the specialty markets, infrastructure to facilitate an easier capacity expansion and then adoption of certain unit operations to facilitate greenhouse gas reduction, more efficiently, and then, of course, the increased cost of steel and equipment based on the latest data in the market. wastewater treatment and on-site biogas production are currently planned to be a separate project with separate funding and anticipated cost of capital commensurate with infrastructure returns using a third-party build own operate model. on-site biogas production is expected to meet the thermal demand for the plant.
it may be that we choose to finance the water treatment plant, that is a future decision. a separate but related wind power project is being developed to meet the majority of the net-zero 1 electricity demand. the wind project will be wired directly to net-zero 1. the wind project would be a separate project with separate funding, again, anticipated lower cost of capital using a build own operate model.
we also plan to making green hydrogen. current scope of capex includes the capacity of hydrogen wine for our products, we are still determining if and how much excess to make for the marketplace and the corresponding economic benefit to gevo. now, we know the world wants green hydrogen. since we are developing the capability to make it, we are working to figure out the best ways to make excess quantities and take it to market.
now, i'm extremely pleased with these results. we are continuing to optimize and try to figure out ways to bring more cash and profit back to gevo sooner, while reducing risk in our operations and business systems as we get net-zero 1 operational. now for more information, please see our updated investor presentation that is available on our website at www.gevo.com. we are also planning to do a fireside chat on wednesday, august 18 at 4:00 p.m.
eastern daylight time with chris ryan, our president and coo; and lynn smull, our cfo, who will together take questions and discuss the net-zero 1 project and give a little more detail as to what's going on there and how we're thinking about it. please join chris and lynn you can. we expect to be announcing the location of customers for our second net-zero project in the near future. our discussions with potential customers have shifted.
they are much, much much larger, and you'll see that in the updated deck and looking at it. the customer pipeline is now approaching about $20 billion of contracts in discussion. that's quite something. and we are working out then how to figure out, how to grow capacity much faster, so we can achieve many hundreds of millions of gallons of production and sales within five years.
there a lot of moving parts. the game has changed. bigger and faster, that's what we're driving for, that's what i'm driving my team for at gevo to achieve. switching gears to rng, i am pleased to report that rng project is on track in terms of construction.
we expect it to start up on time and begin producing gas early next year. i'm pleased to work with bp to sell the rng that will be produced. on monday of next week, we expect to publish our first esg report on our website. this esg report is, i say, well done.
in it, you will see our thinking. and if you invest in us, please read it. overall, we had an excellent quarter and we continue to make progress on our goals for this year. now, i will turn the call over to carolyn, who will take us through the financials.
carolyn?
carolyn romero -- chief accounting officer
thank you, pat. gevo reported revenue in the second quarter of 2021 of $0.4 million, as compared to $1 million in the same period in 2020. during the second quarter of 2021, hydrocarbon revenue was $0.3 million, compared with $0.9 million in the same period in 2020. hydrocarbon sales decreased because of lower production volumes at the south hampton resources facility in silsbee, texas.
during the second quarter of 2020, no revenue was derived at the luverne facility from ethanol sales and related products compared to $0.1 million during the same period in 2020. as a result of an unfavorable commodity market during the three months ended march 31, 2020, we terminated our production of ethanol and distillers grains, which resulted in no sales for the period. cost of goods sold was $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2021 versus $2.6 million in the same period in 2020. we increased maintenance and preparation for isobutanol production that began in july 2021.
cost of goods sold included approximately $1.6 million associated with the maintenance of the luverne facility and approximately $1.2 million in depreciation expense. gross loss was $2.4 million for the second quarter of 2021 versus $1.7 million for the second quarter of 2020. research and development expense increased by $0.7 million during the second quarter of 2021 compared with the same period in 2020 due primarily to an increase in personnel and consulting expenses as we work to improve our process for growing and fermenting yeast strains. selling, general and administrative expense increased by $2.1 million during the second quarter of 2021 compared with the same period in 2020, due primarily to increases in personnel, professional fees and insurance to support the growth in our operations and an increase in consulting related to creating our first environmental, social and governance report and documenting our compliance with section 404(b) of the sarbanes-oxley act.
preliminary stage project costs increased by $5.3 million during the three months ended june 30, 2021, compared with the same period in 2020, due primarily to an increase in consulting for preliminary engineering costs and personnel expenses to support the growth in business activity at our net-zero projects. as a result of the business activities noted above, during the second-quarter 2021, we reported a loss from operations of $19.0 million, compared to $5.3 million for the same period in 2020. in the second quarter of 2021, cash ebitda loss, a non-gaap measure that is calculated by adding back depreciation and non-cash stock-based compensation to gaap loss from operation, was $17.1 million, compared to $3.1 million in the same quarter of 2020. interest expense in the three months ended june 30, 2021, was $6,000, a decrease of $0.5 million as compared to the same period in 2020 due to the conversion of all of our 12% convertible senior secured notes due 2021 to common stock during 2020.
as a result of the business activities noted above, during the second-quarter 2021, we reported a net loss of $18.3 million or a loss of $0.09 per share based on a weighted average shares outstanding of 198,137,420. this compares to a loss of $6 million in the second-quarter 2020 or a loss of $0.40 per share based on weighted average shares outstanding of 15,071,105. in the second-quarter 2021, gevo recognized net non-cash gain totaling $43,000 due to the changes in fair value of certain of our financial instruments such as warrants and embedded derivatives. adding back these non-cash losses resulted in a non-gaap adjusted net loss of $18.3 million in the second quarter of 2020 or a non-gaap adjusted net loss per share of $0.09.
this compares to a non-gaap adjusted net loss of $5.8 million in the second quarter of 2020 or a non-gaap adjusted net loss per share of $0.39. now, i'll turn it back over to pat to wrap things up.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
thanks, carolyn. so, we're looking forward to this. we have a lot of exciting things coming and we are fired up. our engineering work is -- whenever you do these things, it's an enormous quantity of work that we're cramming into a small period of time given that we just got the money to do these things at the beginning of in 2021, and we're making great progress and the engineering results really are good.
i like having our ebitda go up, that's exciting, and i certainly like the way our pipeline is growing. and i know everybody wants us to get more contracts signed faster, but these are really big. that's what they look like. so we're excited looking forward to it.
with that, we'll take questions.
",2021-Q2,GEVO,0.9991,0.9907,
0.9952,,":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of nate pendleton from stifel. your line is now open.
nate pendleton
good afternoon. thanks for taking my question. the first question is, with the understanding that you and adm are only a couple of weeks removed from your ethanol to jet announcement, could you share comments on how your dialogue is progressing? and what's a reasonable time line for disclosure of commercialization plans to achieve first production in the 2025, 2026 time frame?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
well, the steps that have to happen are that we got to figure out the game plan of how we're going to fully decarbonize. and then we're doing some engineering work on the ethanol to jet stuff. once we have that pinned down, then we'll know what the time line should be. so we're a ways away from that yet.
it's not like it's in the month. and the -- as far as we go with adm, the idea -- and you heard that their ceo talked about it as well on the earnings call, is that using 900 million gallons of ethanol raw material is -- that's a good starting point to generate a heck of a lot of saf. we got a lot of work to do put in the game plan to do this. we've got to bring in other partners because it's a lot of work to decarbonize things.
and then we have to finance the whole thing. and there's a whole lot of interested parties about -- who are hanging around here, working on it with us. so it's one of the things you just have to stay tuned to.
nate pendleton
excellent. and then for a quick follow-up. regarding net-zero 1, i wanted to follow up on the ccs commentary that you gave. while not part of the initial net-zero 1, could you comment on the opportunity you have to integrate ccs and the price and ebitda uplift potential?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
well, i'll comment first. then, lynn, you can pick it up and talk about what it might mean economically or something, all right? so the answer is, yes, our plant at net-zero 1 is like any other plant. it's a fermentation plant that generates co2. that co2 is actually pretty valuable in that it could be captured and sequestered.
when you do that, that has an impact of about 35 ci points. so if we're starting at a minus five, it's another minus 35. even in california, where they just penalized corn, our minus 5 in california is a 40. and that's what our contracts are based upon.
then you would get presumably credit for carbon sequestration, so you'd get some improvement there. and if you got the full credit, you'd be down to a ci score of five in california. and lynn, do you have any comment on what you think that value might be the upside?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
it's 35 ci points. it's something like $0.02 at ci point per gallon. so it's substantial in terms of ebitda uplift. the cost associated with engaging a counterparty under ccs is not nearly as great as the benefits that we're seeing out of the ci reduction.
i would say, though, that for net-zero 1, we don't see carbon capture sequestration as being a key component of the debt financing but rather a potential equity upside investment in the -- or engagement and a contract in the future.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
and of course, that's because we think that will have to get financed before the ccs pipelines exist.
nate pendleton
great. thanks for taking my questions.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of shawn severson from wtr. your line is now open.
shawn severson -- water tower research -- analyst
great. thanks, and good evening. question on the mix of isooctane these days, renewable gasoline. obviously, a lot of talk about saf and certainly through the adm deal and stuff.
but what are you seeing these days when you look at the potential contracts, offtake agreements in isooctane versus saf?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
well, interestingly enough, it's still split, ballpark, 50-50, maybe 40% isooctane, 60% jet. but in recent -- since that white house meeting a couple of months ago, there definitely has been an uptick on people focused on saf. the airlines still have an issue in that they don't make a lot of money. they're low to project long-term purchasing and things like that.
and so i think it will be interesting to see who all steps into the fray as to -- and are the off-takers before the airlines. and so it's a bit changing. but with isooctane, isooctane is gasoline even after everyone decarbonizes things. and if you took the most optimistic view of evs and wildly successful evs, the gasoline pool is still the biggest marketplace.
and i think you'd be hard-pressed to find anybody who thinks it isn't that way. even the most optimistic scenario say that gasoline will be bigger than jet fuel or diesel fuel out -- at 2050. so we should decarbonize those two. california provides a pretty good model for it, though, in that they know how to count carbon there.
and they've done a good job and they have a good model that works. and our business group with partners calculate that we need something like 26 isooctane plants aimed at california just to meet their demand currently. so there's -- and that's because they import foreign isooctane or -- from other places. and of course, that's fossil-based.
so there's a good opportunity here, and it's going to be an important part of the mix. the other thing about isooctane that's interesting is that when all these guys are doing renewable diesel or if you're making some lower-value naphtha products, naphtha is something that can be burned in gasoline, you mix some other isooctane, you just get more gallons of gasoline then. and so -- because our octane is such a high-value product such -- because it's pure isooctane. so there's -- we have the opportunity to take in more gallons from other people and make a better blend and get paid for it.
shawn severson -- water tower research -- analyst
and just a follow-up question. can you -- what's the difference between verity tracking and the greet model? just compare and contrast. i mean i know they're both carbon counting, but could you highlight some of the differences for me, so i understand the two?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
sure. paul, do you want to take this question? just explain what greet is and then the business concept of verity?
paul bloom -- chief carbon officer and chief innovation officer
sure thing. thanks for the question. so when you think about greet, greet is a life cycle inventory program that argonne national lab runs. and basically, it can calculate the carbon intensity score of different products when you have the right inputs.
the difference here between verity tracking, verity tracking uses greet as part of our calculation system to make sure that we get the carbon intensity calculation right. but what verity tracking also does is then it tracks things from the sources. so think about what a farmer or a grower does, what then you do with that corn at the processor level, and then how the final product user implements or uses that product. so really, what verity tracking does is use greet but then use a blockchain or distributed ledger technology to connect all the dots through the value chain through the whole of the business process system to calculate the difference in the carbon intensity from the incumbent product that you're comparing it to.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
yes. so the thing is, shawn, is that think argonne greet is a scientific tool that measures stuff. verity tracking is actually going to have like field auditors. we have audit stuff in the field, measure stuff in the field, account for it, take pictures, whatever the heck it turns out to be.
and then it's accounting for exactly the energy packet that's used in the production, tracking it all the way back out to the marketplace. and so think of verity tracking as the sustainability certificate that comes with the product except it's going to be a separate business because it's going to need to be audited, right, and have third parties looking at it and saying, yes, that is in fact the case. and of course, it's not lost on any of us that verity tracking done right leads to tokenization of those attributes. and that's interesting as well because that could be another means of commercializing that value.
shawn severson -- water tower research -- analyst
right. and you mean that they trade in some capacity could be exchanged like rins are? is that -- what do you mean by that?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
well, you tokenize that -- everyone knows what a token is, right? everybody who does blockchain understands tokens. if you have a certifiable attribute that's immutable, can't be changed, documented and all the rest, you can tokenize it. we've already worked on the prototypes for that. and so you could do that.
and then they could be traded in some way except for what's going to be different about these, there to be some hocus pocus hand waving. it's going to have all the data attached to it. so you can say, here's exactly where it came from, how it came to be, the whole bit, like you would expect out of a blockchain system.
shawn severson -- water tower research -- analyst
thanks for the full explanation. thanks, pat.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of amit dayal from h.c. wainwright. your line is now open.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon, everyone. so, pat, what gets your partners and potential customers like chevron from mou to definitive agreements? is there some sort of a trigger or some catalyst that moves that needle for you guys?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
no. it's just plugging along. it's getting tim in the same room with people, me in the same room and working it all through and figuring it out. that's all.
so that's progressing. and it's the same thing in all of these deals. and then around the ethanol plants, this deal with adm is great. but we're going to -- we intend on working with more than just adm.
so it will be interesting to see who else comes into the mix because that's a very fast way of growing and it's complementary to our isobutanol. so it's interesting. and it will be starting to see how we changed. i'm serious about these 1 billion gallons per year of hydrocarbons by 2030.
and so that's our focus. and yes, the net-zero project and what it proves that can be done is eye opening for everybody because it shows how things can be decarbonized if you do the right mix of renewable energy, the electricity and the gas. it shows people how it can be done. it creates a road map for everybody else.
and so we're going to use that. and i'm glad that we're able to partner with axens. and i'm glad that we have pieces that are falling into place.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
understood. and congratulations on getting the butamax ip. i was wondering if you have any plans for that ip in the near term? or are you just going to maybe sit on it and see how things play out for you guys?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
well, i'll tell you how we're going to use it is that, that portfolio is really large. and so there's lots of active patents. and so we can extend those patents further, add to them, adjust them and extend the life of the patents. and there's also useful technologies that are incorporated there.
i'll tell you, what it does is we're going to be successful, i believe, in being a big large company with big revenues. and these patents have long lifetimes, 20 years. so it's really important to make sure that we aren't creating somebody who comes back -- something that -- i wanted to get them under -- in our tent because i can imagine 10 years from now, something goes wrong, someone else might acquire them and they might have some other hassles someday in the future when we're worth big bucks. and cleaning up is a good thing.
and it gives us more opportunities to create even more intellectual property.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
understood. and then with respect to sort of your plant build out, your equipment needs, et cetera, the current supply chain environment, and all of the backlog that these types of deployments are facing right now, are you already kind of dealing with those types of issues? or are they a little bit removed for you at this stage?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
there -- kiewit is superb at this. this is one of their strengths. and so they're already taking that into account. and so far, i don't anticipate any big issues.
whether our plant starts up midyear, third quarter, late in the third quarter or maybe it's even earlier, those are all things that will be determined on other project impacts and effects. but i don't expect it's equipment at this point. when i ask that same question to the -- all the engineers, they are like, we already have taken those kinds of things into account. ok.
we'll see. we'll see.
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
pat, i would add that for the nonrecourse debt purposes, we have to have dates certain with liquidated damages. so kiewit will take into account the procurement constraints in guaranteeing their schedule.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
and so they're going to want to be absolutely certain of that date before they promised to guarantee it with that price and damages.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
understood. understood that. just last one for me. with respect to this verity tracking effort, how much investment is going into this? like how big is the team, etc.? any color on that would be helpful.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
it's a relatively small investment. so it's one of these things where i wish we -- i wish i shouldn't say this even out loud, but i wish we would have thought this years ago and done it. we could have really cool super-duper, valuable -- we're going to have a set value business from it. but it's one of these things where it's a small investment, a lot of leverage.
it's a software-oriented thing. so it isn't like a heavy capital asset investment. so it's in the few millions of dollars kind of a thing as we develop this.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
ok. i mean, it looks like there are a lot of opportunities for you guys, even with the rng efforts. and one of the things you are sort of building for yourselves, these are potential services that you could provide other folks with as well. so i mean is that something -- is that how you are thinking of maybe leveraging all these efforts into additional revenue opportunities?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
it is. and you see it also in how we're putting together our partnerships like with juhl energy. they do a great job and they're hungry. they want to grow, and they're really good at working in the midwest.
and they're creative. they've got good financial partners. they get good technical partners, good technology partners. and same thing is true with our wastewater treatment.
the folks we work with there, they get this as to why this is important. this point i keep making about, if we want to decarbonize the world, focus on electricity. let's focus on getting rid of our 60%-plus of fossil-based electricity and turn it into renewable. and let's do something about the gas.
this latter one, the gas is the reason we're doing renewable natural gas. we originally started doing it because we're going to just supply it up to our luverne plant. but we can make more money -- california. so we're going to do that for a while.
but you know what, it's available to us to use it any time and it has a massively negative ci score. we think biogas is going to be incredibly important in the future because that is the only practical way to get rid of fossil-based methane. and so we think we're quite bullish on those opportunities. the way we think about it, though, is we can take that green value and transform it into liquids.
that's a different paradigm, and that's how we think about it. so whenever we're looking at a site, whether it's an ethanol plant site, acquiring an ethanol plant, working with an ethanol partner -- digestion is going to be part of it. it might not be manure digestion, but shoot, if we just took the residual carbohydrate waste and fermented those with an -- digestion, we get net-zero carbon footprint for the biogas that's produced. that's valuable.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
right. understood. that's our last one. thank you so much.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
you bet.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of poe fratt from noble capital. your line is now open.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
hey, pat. how are you?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
good.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
you've been a very busy man.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
i was -- you did a great job of laying out a lot of progress that you've made. i'd like to focus on lynn's comments just about being pre-revenue. you look at quarterly cash burn and maybe even on an annual basis. lynn, can you just highlight what will be present in the fourth quarter financials as far as capital? the butamax is not going to be there and then highlight the corporate burn rate too, if you wouldn't mind?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
yes. i think our corporate burn rate is around $6 million a quarter. so we're looking at $24 million for the corporate. that excludes the cost of goods sold at luverne.
in terms of capital investments in the next quarter, it will be similar. the larger investments associated with getting going with site mobilization, site acquisition, everything will be into 2022 for net-zero 1?
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
and would you be able to quantify that as far as what you might expect over the first half of '22, lynn?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
not at this point. i wouldn't want to throw those numbers around loosely.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
but they're going to be like long -- we talked in the past about long lead equipment items. and there will be some site work, stuff like that. but it's not the big drop of money. that's sometime later once we have date certain of delivery of the plant and the guarantees in place and the financing in place.
so that's -- we got to unfold that still, but it's looking good. and by the way, the reason that i had lynn make sure that he mentions we're a pre-revenue company is because i keep getting questions from investors where they go, well, you aren't making any -- you don't have any material revenues. well, no kidding. we keep telling people we shut down ethanol.
and so ethanol wasn't our main business. and we are about focusing our efforts on building out future capacity and technologies. so that's why.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
and then any change to the -- either capacity or cost for net-zero 1 at this point?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
not yet. and i keep asking that question too, poe, because i look at all the world with covid and supply chains and the same amit asked. and i got no data that says anything is different yet. and we keep making progress.
so this is a good thing. if there was something that was a disaster, i'd heard about it already. so --
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
yes. i was looking at it from the other side, pat, that you had introduced the concept that maybe 45 million to 50 million gallons per year might be a little too small for potentially gaining efficiencies. and i was just looking at whether you actually upsized the net-zero 1 yet or sort of where that stands?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
ok. let me comment on that. so what paul's referring to is that we've always been talking about net-zero 1 at 45 million gallons of hydrocarbon, 340 million pounds of high-protein animal feed products and 30 million pounds of oil. and that's good.
you know what? we could -- if that thing gets engineered, that site at net-zero could handle two of those plants. and the other sites that we're choosing all could handle two of those plants. and so you do a lot of -- there's the capital cost, yes. but when you're carbon copying, you save a heck of a lot of money.
and when you're building things on skids or building skid production facilities, which is possible to do, and you're sticking to kind of carbon copies, that can be very interesting. none of this is lost on us. and of course, when you maximize capacity at a site, you do spread out your fixed cost because it's still the same team who can run both that 90 million gallons versus 45 million. none of that is lost on us.
and then you start thinking, that's interesting. and what if we have an ethanol plant plus an isobutanol plant on site? and once you have dehydrated ethanol to ethylene and made butanes out of it, guess what? it's the same process to take a butane from isobutanol, butine mixture from ethylene. and so it too is the same plant. and so none of this is lost on us.
we just haven't gone into detail yet about how this will unfold. in the early days here, you're right, poe, that we got -- we sold out 54 million gallons under contract so far. we'll get much more sold out, i think, here shortly and be able to talk about it. you can see that the interest from chevron, there's a bunch of people who are interested.
the chunks and bites are getting bigger. and so because we're still requiring someone to backstop them on a financial basis, that makes it not for the faint of heart on the customer side. but it is interesting. and i think we are going to wind up bigger.
i just don't know when we're going to be able to pull that trigger. and we do need diversity of sight as well. so i just -- we just got to go through the work and figure out which choices make the most sense given the full set of circumstances of customers, partners, sites, economics, the whole bit.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
great. so, pat, if i heard it correctly, then you're still looking at the similar size, but maybe call it colocation so that you get some of the -- whether it's input synergies or the wind, the biogas and the wastewater, you're able to tap into sort of the -- if you will, the plumbing a little more efficiently so that reduces your incremental costs?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
i think that's a fair assumption. and the reason i say it that way is if i want to hold time lines and get big faster, then i should stick with the current size we've already spent a year engineering. if i change it, guess what happens? i got another long period of time to engineer stuff again. so the idea is do what you said is leverage it.
now we could also take the approach -- the hydrocarbon plants, mind you, are a little bit different. they're easier to scale because we have a bunch of work that's been done by axens already that we can leverage. and so that will be -- that's a little bit different. and of course, then ethanol comes into the mix.
and so when we look at ethanol, there's a lot of ethanol plants we want to -- that we can see make a lot of sense. we have -- our phone has been ringing. and we do expect to have additional partners, don't have a time line yet. the key is about decarbonization.
and so how can we leverage all these things and make them all work synergistically, get them deployed quickly? because i think there is a benefit in getting lots of decarbonized hydrocarbons out into the marketplace sooner rather than later. and that's the game afoot in what we're working on. lynn mentioned that we'll be putting out guidance eventually here. and i don't know when it is, but it's not very far away, meaning it's within -- i don't know.
i hate even to say relatively soon. we put out guidance for the 1 billion-gallon plan, who, what, where, how and all the rest.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
ok. great. and then just if i may, so you alluded to the fact that you -- the next slug of contracts could -- that would sell out net-zero 2 might be forthcoming. if that happens by the end of the year, pat, does that mean that you'll have net-zero 1 and 2 under construction at the same time and sort of very, very parallel tracks? or will they be sequenced a little bit?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
they're going to be sequenced just a bit because i think we've got sites. we already have done site development work and continue to develop even more sites. we like some of these places. and so that part is already ongoing.
the engineering work, of course, if we're doing a net-zero copy, it is literally taking that plant and dropping it down somewhere else. and so it can go pretty darn fast. i think that practical time line, and i'm -- lynn, we've been talking about what? seven months delay for net-zero 2 would be the earliest, something like that?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
yes. six months lag.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
six months delay. and just as a matter of we got -- get these permits in place, get the site work done, get all the little details done. and -- but yes, it would be something like that. remember, we sold out 54 million gallons.
and so if we get a big bite here, we're going to be well into net-zero 3 at that point. and then we might have even bigger bites. and if we have bigger bite, then let's call, we better hurry up and get on with these adm plants focused on decatur first.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
and then lynn talked about funding for the first time at the gevo, inc. level. you refreshed the atm when you made the chevron announcement. but you need shareholder approval to expand the share authorization.
can you give me an idea of when you expect to do the shareholder vote? and then two, the timing of potential funding actually raising additional money beyond what cash you have now?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
well, i think we -- we actually have -- when we're sitting here with $520 million of cash equivalent cash, cash equivalents, we're in pretty good shape. so it isn't like we have this burning, oh my god, i got to do something. so we don't -- in the situation. and we did refresh the atm because it was time to do it and it made sense to do it and all the rest.
and we haven't used it yet. so that's all sitting there. we have a lot of interest -- the world has changed for us. so it's hard for us to describe.
there's no way for me to explain it to everybody. it's not possible. but the world changed for us. and it's about who's going to play with us, how are we going to play, how are we going to grow.
and everyone wants to go big sooner. how are we going to put this together and make it happen? this is the question in front of us. i get that we could just go do our net-zero 1 plant, do another one, net-zero 2 and net-zero 3 and have a nice business. and it's been very profitable business.
i mean, shoot, these net-zero plants are looking at a cash flow streams of $150 million a year or something. so they're good projects. i want to grow faster. and i think now with this combination of isobutanol and ethanol to hydrocarbons technologies, the two of them together, we can grow a heck of a lot faster.
and that's what we should be focused on. and it makes it for a more efficient deployment of capital. so we expect to bring in other partners. we expect to bring in people investing at the project level.
that's what the chevron deal was about. it's -- we expect to see people interested at the gevo level. we expect that we will have to raise money in the future. but we'll see -- we're going to do it judiciously.
we've talked in the past about this. and it's like, i'm not really a big fan of doing dilutive fundraising. we don't -- we're beyond that stage, i think. so it's about accretive stuff.
it's about saying, here's these projects. we're going to go raise money. and here's the cash flow streams that are expected to resolve. it's that kind of a game that has to get played.
poe fratt -- noble capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you. well, thank you. very helpful.
operator
thank you. at this time, i'm showing no further questions. i would like to turn the call back over to pat gruber for closing remarks.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
well, thanks, everybody, for joining us. it's an exciting time for us. this billion-gallon plan is the right kind of idea. i bet we can -- i want to see us do even more than that.
the fact that we're able to work with axens, get that deal done with them, get the deal done, make progress in the net-zero concept, where we're decarbonizing the production systems and being able to prove it. that is all of it a big deal and it applies across the board. it's what is attracting people to us. and that, along with the way to count carbon and track corn and all the rest or any other feedstock with verity tracking.
so we're on a good track. i like where we are. we're making great progress. and thank you all for your support, and thanks for joining us today.

please go ahead, mr. williams.
geoffrey williams -- vice president, general counsel, and secretary
good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining gevo's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. i would like to start by introducing today's participants from the company. with us today is patrick gruber, gevo's chief executive officer; lynn small, gevo's chief financial officer; and paul bloom, gevo's chief carbon and innovation officer. earlier today, we issued a press release that outlines the topics we plan to discuss.
a copy of this press release is available on our website at www.gevo.com. i would like to remind our listeners that this conference call is open to the media and that we are providing a simultaneous webcast of this call to the public. a replay of today's call will be available on gevo's website. on the call today and on this webcast, you will hear discussions of certain non-gaap financial measures.
non-gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with gaap. reconciliation of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures is contained in the press release distributed today, which is posted on our website. we will also make certain forward-looking statements about events and circumstances that have not yet occurred, including, but not limited to, projections about gevo's net-zero 1 project and gevo's operating activities for the remainder of 2021 and beyond. these forward-looking statements are based on management's current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those disclosed in gevo's form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020, that was filed with the u.s.
securities and exchange commission, and in subsequent reports and other filings made with the sec by gevo, including gevo's quarterly reports on form 10-q. investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. such forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date, and gevo disclaims any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. on today's call, pat will begin with a discussion of gevo's business developments.
lynn will then review gevo's financial position. and paul will finish up with a discussion of verity tracking. following these prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions. i'll now turn the call over to pat. 
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
thanks, geoff. as everyone paying attention to us knows and see in our presentations or press releases of the videos, they know we're on a crusade in the pursuit of net-zero drop-in fuels. we have learned that we can convert renewable carbon into gasoline, jet fuel saf and diesel fuel as well as the building block chemicals to make most plastics and other larger volume chemicals. the technologies work.
the key to driving out the fossil footprint and all of these products is renewable electricity and alternatives to fossil-based natural gas. if we reduce and eliminate fossil energy from our production systems, we should be able to achieve net-zero fossil footprint of our products as measured across the whole of the business system. that means all the way from carbon capture to tailpipe or the exhaust of a jet engine. we are in the business of transforming renewable energy into energy-dense liquids like saf and motor fuels.
when we look at our business, we have some similar issues with that -- that are confronted by evs and hydrogen. that is, what's the source of electricity? is it fossil or not? what's the source of energy to produce hydrogen, fossil or not? it turns out, we're all aligned regarding infrastructure. if our business system has access to renewable energy, then it shouldn't surprise anybody that the fossil footprint can be reduced and potentially eliminated. so ev folks, the hydrogen folk, and companies like us all need improved access to renewable energy.
i'm glad to see the emphasis of this in public policy, particularly regarding infrastructure. i'm glad to see that bill got passed. because of the size of our renewable energy need and the ability to achieve economies of scale, we expect that our business system could further catalyze development of renewable energy. we are finding that there are many parties interested in building out renewable energy infrastructure.
they need a big customer, someone like us. i'm also glad that our products drop into existing pipelines and enhance existing markets. i'm glad our products are dropping at the consumer level. there is a benefit if no one needs to do airplanes, cars or trucks, to reduce or even eliminate the fossil fuel greenhouse gas emissions footprint from combustion agents.
i expect that we will have the opportunity to help the ev and hydrogen people, too, as we expect to generate excess energy, excess renewable energy, electricity and even hydrogen and supply to the marketplace, where they wouldn't otherwise have it or couldn't do it. our net-zero 1 plant design is unusual for the following reason. we are designing it with the carbon footprint in mind from the get-go. we are working with juhl energy on a wind farm that would be wired directly to the plant.
we are planning to install a wastewater treatment plant that has the ability to generate water for use in the production process short. but equally as important, it is expected to produce enough bio-based methane to run the plant. we also plan to install electrolysis units to produce green hydrogen from wind. so it's a different set of paradigms about how to install energy and manage it across the whole.
of course, we are -- we get excited that we can prove using the world-leading argonne national laboratories greet model, that by substituting the energy sources, getting it away from fossil-based sources and by using carbohydrates from sustainably grown corn that the system we are building should be able to achieve a net-zero fossil carbon footprint across the whole life cycle from carbon -- to tail pipe or exhaust of a jet engine. think about it for a second here. jet fuel has roughly a fossil footprint of about 90 using a carbon score index. that means 90 is a fossil-based score.
our saf when burned according to the argonne greet model is expected to be 0. that means that our saf sitting a tank or a railcar before it's been burned is at least a negative 90 ci score, negative 90. if we never burn it as a fuel, it would just be sequestered carbon in a tank. that's an interesting paradigm.
when the fuel such as saf is burned, it does release co2. so then the carbon score is back up from minus 90 to near zero. renewable energy in a tank with all the advantages that infrastructure provides to take it to market in all the vehicles, the planes, they all exist and used without change. that's pretty amazing.
it's really a new game to think about what can be done. so for a minute, suppose our building blocks produced net-zero plant were used to make plastics rather than making saf or motor fuels. these building blocks would result in the same plastics made from petroleum except that we have swapped out the fossil carbon for renewable carbon captured from the atmosphere. the technology works.
so imagine car bumpers with tires made from our stuff. it'd be sequestered carbon captured from the air, transformed into durable goods. the carbon score of that bumper or tires could be expected to be massively negative because we're not burning the products. they're being made into durable goods.
of course, it would depend upon the content of those plastics or rubber derived from our net-zero type of ingredients. looking forward and in the future, we expect to add geological sequestration to the decarbonization mix. of course, we can do that. others can, we can do it too.
that should make our footprint even more negative, more negative in a big way that according degree, we'd expect the possibility of a negative 30 to 40 ci score from where we are today. that's even after the fuel is burned. if we add some new techniques in agriculture, it can even be more negative across the whole of the life cycle. how could it be so negative? because our business system would be the cause of carbon sequestration, for instance, in the soil or in geological formations.
in addition, by using the latest processing techniques for corn, higher-value protein products and corn oil can be produced and sold into the food chain. this is really important. we believe that it's possible to use land to produce food and generate raw materials for energy simultaneously. and many improvements still can be made.
we're not done yet. of course, we can also use carbohydrate feedstocks to buy it from wood, biomass -- and other carbohydrate sources. any of these are fair game for us as we grow our business. the sustainability of each feedstock would need to be proven and it must be cost effective before we take it on.
now we've been making excellent progress on the business front. so first, chevron. the mou with them outlines the basic deal where they would take up to 150 million gallons of hydrocarbon fuels and correspondingly invest in the production assets to produce those fuels. good, that means that if we did six net-zero 1 style plants, each with a capacity of about 50 million gallons.
and if they took 50% of the capacity, then the mou contemplates them investing in the 50% of the capital in each of the plants. we still got to convert the mou to definitive agreements, and there could be some twists and turns along the way. but we like chevron's commitment and their energy that they bring to getting this done. ethanol to jet is a new thing for us.
we've been working on it quietly for years. and then we announced that we signed a deal with axens of north america. that gives gevo the exclusive license to develop ethanol to jet in north america. axens is the licensing arm of the french national research and engineering laboratory called ifp.
ifp focuses on applied research and engineering. they do a lot of work over the years, over the decades on refining technology, chemical plant technology and many, many other technologies. they're really well-known research and engineering outfit. their capabilities are truly immense.
we were just visiting there in the last month. they're quite impressive. we got to know them. we got to know axens because of our work on net-zero 1, we are co-engineering the process to convert isobutanol into jet fuel and renewable alkylate.
we get along really well with them. and as we got to know them, we learned that they have more than 60 patents and 25 plants commercially operating with a technology to convert ethylene into fuels and chemicals. now we know how to decarbonize the alcohols. and we know how to convert alcohols into olefins, ethylene as an olefin.
and so together, it occurred to us that, you know what, we've got a really clear path to take ethanol as a feedstock using commercially proven technology and convert ethanol to saf in proven processes. it's pretty impressive. they have done these technologies using petrochemical-based feedstocks. what's new here? bringing ethanol in, converting it to ethylene and taking the ethylene onward into the well-proven processes.
so we've struck up strategic alliance with them. and we believe that ethanol to jet is going to be important. and we see it as synergistic with the isobutanol to hydrocarbon routes. in fact, there's many opportunities to add value to each.
it should give us the opportunity to produce more products, a wider slate of products, as tim cesarek likes to say, we can do diesel fuel, jet fuel, gasoline products and many other building blocks to the chemical industry and ultimately achieve a higher renewable content in fuels. in other words, it makes it easier. we have more building blocks to work with, so we can make a more complete fuel over the long run. it's also worth noting that axens will provide process performance guarantees for the alcohol to saf and motor fuels technologies.
and of course, that's really useful in financing production facilities at the project level. we signed an mou with adm with the intent of converting 900 million gallons per year of ethanol into about 500 million gallons of saf and hydrocarbons and along with that, to build iba to hydrocarbons, particularly indicator. adm has some of the most economical ethanol plants on the planet. starting with low-cost ethanol is a really good idea when converting it into saf.
the work with adm is expected to result in a jv with them and other investors. adm indicator has been a pioneer in geological sequestration too. it's an exciting opportunity, and i expect that they will be a good partner. i know everybody is interested in the customer pipeline.
it's growing. we are still on the tack of obtaining financial offtake agreements. the pipeline of potential contracts is now well over 1 billion gallons per year. we are negotiating these contracts.
the interest in saf has definitely increased, especially since the white house meeting a couple of months ago. we expect to announce the next agreement that sells out net-zero 2 and beyond soon. we acquired the butamax patent portfolio. we now have about 600 or so patents covering the biotechnology, fermentation production processes, converting alcohols in hydrocarbons.
it has -- it adds value to have all these patents under one roof. i'm glad to have that cleaned up. our net-zero 1 project is on track. kiewit, one of the world's largest and most capable engineering and construction firms, is a great addition to our team.
kiewit has tremendous horsepower and the capability to build multiple plants at once. this ability is really important to us since that is the situation, i think, we're going to find ourselves in, that is needing to build more than one plant at once. they have a reputation of delivering on time and on budget. in addition, they're really good people.
we'll have the next round of engineering done around year end. then we'll be moving to a more detailed phase. we expect to have the epc wrap completed around the end of the first quarter, maybe early second quarter and then work to complete the project debt deal. if this timing all holds up, we expect to get the plant up and running in 2024.
our northwest iowa renewable natural gas project is on track. it's expected to start up in the first part of next year. it's gone very well so far. i like the experience we are getting because renewable methane, biogas, and rng are all going to be really important to us as we work to defossilize the hydrocarbon production systems like alcohol in alcohol hydrocarbons.
as i already mentioned, one of the big issues that creates the footprint from these plants is the fossil-based natural gas and fossil-based electricity. eliminating these things makes everything more green. as the last key point, we are changing our ambitions. we believe that it's possible to bring online a business that delivers and sells 1 billion gallons of capacity or more per year using the combination of iba and ethanol as feedstocks to hydrocarbons to serve saf and motor fuels markets by 2030.
we call this a billion gallon initiative, simple, 1 billion gallons or more by 2030. this is what we're working on, and i believe the pieces are falling into place. net-zero 1 is the first step, and we need to get it right. but we see that the potential is large, and we can achieve fast growth beyond net-zero 1.
we see that chevron, adm, axens and others all could be part of making this happen. now lynn small is here with me today. we decided to change the format and content of our earnings calls. rather than read the financial details that are already disclosed in our earnings press release and form 10-q, we figured it would be far more useful for lynn to just talk about gevo's financial position and what his thoughts are in larger and more general terms.
lynn?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
thank you, pat. gevo's primary execution focus is getting net-zero 1 built and operating. net-zero 1 design and engineering work is progressing well. and we're advancing the plant engineering, procurement, and construction contract with kiewit.
we feel very good about our partnership approach with kiewit and their strong expertise and capabilities as well as their abilities around delivering multiple plants simultaneously, as pat mentioned. we expect to start ordering long-lead equipment to engage in site mobilization and preparation work and to continue detailed engineering in the first half of 2022. this is key to enable us to hold our project time lines. the wind power and wastewater anaerobic digestion, design, build, own, operate, manage partnerships referred to as dboom partnerships are progressing well.
juhl energy, our wind dboom partner, is advancing net-zero 1 60-megawatt behind the meter wind project development and working with potential utility partners to ensure a structure that works for all participants. we are well into the -- and commercial processes with multiple wastewater anaerobic digestion dboom partners and expect to finalize those arrangements with a winning party early 2022. we've been very active with advanced work around the net-zero 1 nonrecourse debt financing. we have multiple tracks underway, including tax-exempt private activity bonds or pabs, a potential department of energy loan guarantee route, and some interest with long-term private placement debt providers.
we're pursuing multiple paths out of an abundance of caution and to see which will present the best debt structure and terms. the base case so far has been a pabs offering by a city group. the majority of our net-zero 1 project costs are eligible to be funded with pabs and those markets are very attractive for this type of credit. we expect to have the project finance elements in place in time for a mid-2022 debt offering regardless of the route taken.
the strength of net-zero 1 project participants from off-takers to kiewit to citigroup and a range of other important supporting elements will all play well as we head toward breaking ground and financing construction next year. we are also working to get follow-on net-zero 1 plant sold out with offtake agreements developed, financed, and built. to build out a fleet of plants, we'll be raising money at the project level as contemplated in the chevron mou and if the right circumstances arise at the gevo, inc. level.
for example, adding a strategic party or two in the mix is a possibility and would enhance our ability to execute on projects. in any case, we will eventually want to raise money at the gevo, inc. level so that we have capital to contribute as equity and can benefit from commensurate levels of project cash flows. our view on capital investments is that the opportunities are immense and that they should be accretive.
we are also interested in partnering with companies that own ethanol assets and in acquiring ethanol assets with the intent to decarbonize existing ethanol production to provide low-carbon feedstock to new staff production capacity with correspondingly low carbon index scores on the final product. we would welcome hearing from ethanol plant owners who may be interested in gevo's approach to that. we have identified and are pursuing several sites for follow-on greenfield net-zero 1 projects that are as attractive as net-zero 1 lake preston site. we will need these options on locations as we grow production capacity.
decarbonization of production is always a focus when looking at sites. for example, adm's decatur, illinois site presents a superb opportunity around that need due to its carbon sequestration capacity. we are also operating our luverne plant to make isobutanol and working on optimizations of systems and processes. these learnings should serve us well as we operate the net-zero 1 plants.
we're using the luverne isobutanol to make small quantities of hydrocarbons down at the silsbee, texas plant. and next year, we expect to use luverne isobutanol production as feedstock for a modular hydrocarbon plant that is currently being fabricated by praj and is scheduled to be installed at luverne in 2022. we are currently a pre-revenue company. recall that while we are producing isobutanol at luverne to accumulate feedstocks for hydrocarbon production, we suspended the plant's ethanol production in q1 2020 to focus on our net-zero program.
late next year, we would expect to see some revenues from our rng project and some revenues from sales of small quantities of hydrocarbon products. in late 2024, we expect to see substantial revenue upon net-zero 1 projected start-up. as our 1 billion gallon initiative begins to take shape, we would expect to put out some guidance, but that is premature today. given our pre-revenue status, the key third quarter financial metrics are as follows: end of q3 cash and cash equivalents was $522.4 million.
long-term debt outstanding was $66.8 million. corporate burn was $6.1 million. capital investments associated with net-zero 1 and other capital projects was $16.8 million. and we had other investing activity of $9 million associated with the butamax patent acquisition.
as geoff noted, full financials are available in our earnings release and our form 10-q available on our website. now i'll turn it over to paul bloom to talk about where we're at on the verity tracking. paul?
paul bloom -- chief carbon officer and chief innovation officer
thanks, lynn. first, i'd like to note that we have executed a joint venture agreement for verity tracking with blocksize capital. verity tracking is based upon distributed ledger technology, commonly called blockchain, and is focused on the tracking of sustainability attributes such as the greenhouse gas footprint across the whole of the supply chain, including carbon capture, feedstocks, sources of energy used in production, and other key inputs to determine the life cycle footprint of products like ours. we intend to provide verifiable and mutable sustainability data from the source of the raw material to the tailpipe and exhaust of jet engines.
i am the responsible executive at gevo for this joint venture. in the future, we intend on spinning verity tracking out of gevo. we still have some more work to do to get it organized such as putting the key leadership team in place. we envision that verity can be a benefit to any company that needs to prove their sustainability footprint.
when we started verity, we were focused on using it for gevo's sustainability systems and products. we quickly discovered that this technology and method of tracking sustainability improvements using a blockchain solution filled the gap for other industries as well. we intend to open verity up to work with any company that wants verifiable proof of their carbon intensity reduction and is willing to commit to transparency. as the anticipated demand grows for high-quality carbon offsets for compliance and voluntary markets, verity tracking is anticipated to provide the carbon accounting needed for both segments while avoiding double counting.
we also intend to simplify auditing while providing users with the best-in-class data security. we look forward to continuing to develop the joint venture with blocksize capital and developing solutions for other potential customers. thank you. now i will turn it back over to pat to wrap things up.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
all right. thanks, paul. thanks, lynn. and let us open up the call for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from shawn severson with water tower research.
shawn severson -- water town research -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon, everyone. hey, pat, could you maybe start with a 50,000-foot view picture here and what's going on with demand for saf and kind of an update on where the airlines are taking this? and any other industry items we can point to in terms of increasing demand there? hello?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
here we go. sorry. these -- what we're seeing is because of the government discussions about wanting to see saf, because of some of the policies that are being talked about put in place, because the airlines themselves are making pretty bold goals as to how much has to be replaced by 2030. we're seeing a definite uptick in saf and that we're seeing a shift -- definitely a shift.
before, when people pass, it's like, ""hey, it was hard to tell."" now, it's clear cut. it's a shift. all of our existing customers are on board with what we're doing. they get it and moving forward with us.
and it's pretty darn interesting to see. so, saf is the one thing everyone can agree upon, that no one's going to -- we got to have hydrocarbons to fly jets over long hauls, nobody disputes that one. and so, that makes it much, much easier, and now the momentum is definitely shifted that way. so, our goal is to make more of it, and do it faster and grow bigger.
hence, we like the idea a lot of being able to leverage existing assets.
shawn severson -- water town research -- analyst
and along those buy, how does that de-risk the business? and talking about in terms of epc guarantees, cost of capital, obviously a very matured, well-developed ethanol market. so, how is that going to affect the economics for you?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
well, using an ethanol route, obviously, there's no risk involved in the fermentation systems around that, unlike we're using isobutanol, we would be the guy -- we would be the people who have to guarantee it. and you look at that, and you look at how many gallons you get, how much profitability. the costs are similar using sb on the cost per gallon. and isobutanol isn't fully optimized.
ethanol, cash cost-wise, it's good enough to put out there. but gosh, you add it all up, and you get more gallons for the same kind of capital members. and you know that means you make more profit. and so, you look at all that, and it serves the market need, where the market is heading, and with our other customers that are coming down the pike that we can see.
and so then you look at and say, ""well, how fast can we grow?"" well, it turns out this net-zero concept that we've been working on pretty translates directly over into using ethanol. so, it's not a big deal from a technical standpoint to substitute. and the engineering overlaps hugely. and so, that makes it a lot easier to go about this.
and the thing is, we didn't  two-thirds working closely with actions. we didn't have all the mass and energy balances to be able to figure out what kind of ci scores we could get. and do they make sense and all that kind of stuff? because really, you have to integrate these things. well, we had already done that work on isobutanol.
and that's where x install we had done an xy team together with -- like, shoot, we could do this not just that a greenfield plan, but we could also do this at existing ethanol plants. and that means a faster path for growth given all the demand.
shawn severson -- water town research -- analyst
my last question is on process. really wasn't -- could you explain a little bit more about what was going on there? what was equipment transfer?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
yes. so, process practice building that plant for us. that's the -- that thing's in partial construction, and they'll deliver it later this year. it's a alcohols hydrocarbon plant.
and it'll be a relatively small one to 3,000 tonnes, and it's a plant. so, we can make a variety of products. we can make hydrocarbons, the gasoline products. we can make jet fuel products.
we can make diesel products. we can make olefins. we can make feedstocks for doing appalachian units. we can do a whole variety of things.
and so, we commissioned this last year. we suggest people heard us talk about this as the skin, ok, when you put it in an artist's rendition like this or an engineering rendition. it looks a little bit bigger than a skin. it will be several skins stacked on top of one another.
but that, in fact, has been under construction and we'll see it delivered to rubber.
shawn severson -- water town research -- analyst
thanks. bye. i'll take the rest of the questions offline.

our next question comes from derrick whitfield with stifel.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
hey, derrick.
derrick whitfield -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
good afternoon, all, and thanks for taking my questions. perhaps for pat or paul, you're referencing slide 8. you're indicating that you're still evaluating site selection for net-zero 1. as there are several greenfield sites that are at least as attractive as lake preston?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
yes.
derrick whitfield -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
can you perhaps elaborate on the degree of economic improvement that is possible at another location?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
well, there's a couple things that come into play, one, obviously, you have to have the land and it's got to be transportation, good corn price, raw materials. you got to have access to renewable energy, at least with wind or, and we also like the idea of access to sequestration. we think lake preston will have that, too. but we still have other sites.
if we're picking them carefully, it could definitely happen. and that will be interesting in the future and useful in the future. along with that, expand upon as we develop the sites, we have been developing sites for actually quite a long time. because you always have to have alternatives in case somebody gets accused.
and you try to go and deploy something like lake preston. you're always going to have alternatives. and so, we've been keeping that in mind the whole way, we still talk about it very much. so, we have a couple sites that are attractive and some -- and sometimes, they come with economic incentive.
and so, what we won't -- you won't see us do is trade off a new site if it impacts the timeframes to commercialize, we won't. unless the payments upfront are so great that we'd have to say yes, but i don't have one of those in hand yet. but those are the kinds of things that can come into play and how we would think about it. we know that we're going to need multiple sites available, decarbonizing a net-zero.
greenfield plant is we think probably easier than doing an existing ethanol plant. so, learning how to do that well, and translating it, it teaches us a how-to just deploy the stuff, cookie-cutter stuff, but it also gives us the insight as to tricks we can use with existing ethanol.
derrick whitfield -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. and perhaps for pat or lynn, i know you guys have been working hard on the enterprise financing plan, which you referenced in your prepared remarks to support the 1-million-gallon initiative. could you just speak to the progress on that, and then kind of your latest thoughts on that initiative?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
lynn, do you want to come in?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
sure, i'll jump in. that model is substantially complete and useful now. it's a very large model. and it incorporates a lot of flexibility to make different assumptions around growth in capital deployment, the pace, the cadence.
and, of course, all of the costs involved and assumptions around revenue streams. and it does it in a way that then rolls up into a traditional three-statement format. so, it's quite advanced. the underlying assumptions that have gone into it, i think, are pretty robust.
and everything that goes in terms of the project level assumptions, you know, is based on everything we're doing it at net-zero 1 and looking at other potential etj opportunities. and all of those returns are very attractive. so, when we roll-up and look at the impact on the stock price, it's pretty appealing. so, we'll be sharing some thoughts around that in the future.
derrick whitfield -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. let's --
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
sorry, what's fascinating about this is we get one of the things that's attractive about this is when we bring the decarburization people, everybody wants to deploy renewable electricity or gas or biogas or ingestion. they want to do the -- or sequestration or whatever. all those things are fair game, right? so, we have a bunch of partners who want to work with us to do that put up capital, that's great. love that.
and then we have working with on the etj side, with actions, and we are designing modules. so, that this is like literally it will be 100 million gallons of ethanol in to make the product hydrocarbons coming out. so, we're designing it so that it literally can go anywhere. and that's a pretty interesting model.
we think we can grow faster with that and that solves one of the problems and i got to say it does the risk the heck out of it. because otherwise, you're left going people does it all work together, well, i got news. there's no question ethanol could be made. there's no question that the ethanol into hydrocarbons work.
and so, that completely changes then how people view the risk associated with an appointment of this.
derrick whitfield -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great. and then really last for me. with the understanding that you don't have a formal announcement today on archer daniels, midland, or chevron. could you just share comments on how your dialogue with those companies are -- is progressing and a reasonable timeline for the disclosure of commercialization plans?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
the conversations are going well with both. and so, it's a matter of getting all the pieces together. obviously, what has to happen, if we're talking about decarburization of, you know, adm got 900 million gallons of ethanol. that takes a serious chunk of capital.
so, there's lots of discussions going on in the background. we got to put them all together. and we can't do it all at once, obviously. and so, that's why we comment that we stay focused on net-zero 1.
we're going to learn all those stuff. we have to have a concrete focus for that. but we know that everything we're learning applies to these other things. and so, we are working at all those pieces out and how to do it.
but obviously, it's way bigger than us -- by ourselves. so, you know, the chevron what they've been into the project level, we have other people interested in gevo corporate. we have, you know, the adm is they've been very cooperative in trying to sort this out in it because it is a change of look figuring out all the details of economics, mass, and energy balances and all that kind of stuff. and how does it all work and fit together? so, we're in the midst of all that.
and remember, we've only had access to the detail from we've only had access to the accent details, all in the last few months. as we sort of sorted it out. you know, so we're making pretty darn good progress. and i like where it's headed.
derrick whitfield -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
it's great. very helpful. thanks for your time, guys.
operator
next question comes from prashant rao with citi group.
prashant rao -- citi -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. thanks for taking the question. i wanted to start some of the rng side, when something you said about the inflection there and it'll become revenue.
the revenue -- going -- kind of honing in on that a little bit. the guidance that you gave the 16 million to 22 million of ebitda, could you help us walk through, put some color on those on that post-summit range, what sort of ci score you need to get or what sort of credit assumptions and then also a little bit on the offtake, i know, you are working with bp, so i just wanted to understand how that arrangement works, if there's any credit sharing in that 16 million to 22 million, just kind of help us walk through how we should be thinking about that, so we could put that in our models with certainty.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
yes, i believe the bp agreements posted on an 8-k, but just to summarize that it's a  there is a sharing arrangement, and bp places that gas directly into dispensaries in california through their distribution networks. we're ramping up now. as we commenced the physical production, we're ramping up the coordination on accumulating the right level of data for the applications with carb. so, that we can get that process rolling as quickly as possible and try to get their approvals for lcfs credits on the ci score as soon as we can.
we do have alternatives for the nearer term to use temporary pathways and to go ahead and bring revenues in sooner, but we want to assess, you know, the risk around doing that. and maybe for going higher, higher ci or i should say lower ci outcomes because that temporary is that seem to be a 150, a negative 150. so, we'll be producing steady-state about 355,000 mmbtu a year. and you can kind of do the math on the price of rng these days with lcfs and rins.
to get to a revenue number. our ebitda is at this point, we don't think about leverage, because we financed that project with an lc-backed, private activity bonds issuance. but we will refinance that, probably this year to go ahead and do it on a nonrecourse basis. so, that we can release that cash collateral back to gevo for our own use.
i'm not sure, prashant. anything else that i can help you with?
prashant rao -- citi -- analyst
no, i think perfect. that's good. appreciate that. my follow-up is sort of related to that.
pat, you talked about, the numbers of yields sort of being updated on that tier 1 to be more saas and you've got that $150 million to $200 million target there. just wondering, a lot of moving parts but what does or what does that not need from the credit markets for sale further incentives or other subsidies in order to achieve that $150 million to $200 million? what are you sort of risking there? we've had a lot of talk over the last few months, and there's a lot of positive momentum. but everything from upsizing the btc credit to looking at rins, multiples, things like that. can you just help us sort of think about what you think is sort of the odds on risk profile for that number on tier 1? that'd be helpful, at least on the revenue side.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
yeah, sure. so, i'll start, and lynn, you can pile on it. yeah, so we don't leave you with budget $1 a gallon btc because we think that that's appropriate number. it's good.
i would just like stability in it. and so, we can predict it over a longer period of time. it doesn't need to be more -- none of us needed to be more  it's nice if we could all make more money if it is, but it's not going to cause anyone to shift anything or do different behaviors or anything like that. so, that just says that stability is good.
on the rff side, you know, there's  this is the year where the epa gets to do its set process, so there'll be some finagling around how rfs works. and i think what we're going to wind up with something that's a lot like what we got, except for the power enhancements, that takes into account. steps for lower carbon scores and things like that. but it's going to be, i think, the same basic system.
so, that's kind of what we assume going forward with that we actually predict going forward the same sort of this today. and then, in lcfs, we just model out the long-term predicted carbon scores. we have consultants who advise us. we actually have a bunch of people who do this.
and advise us what that would look like. and then, we incorporate that into our model. but one thing i really like a lot about the way the system works is that we got three different bites and apples, and the chance of all three of them going down is pretty low. and so, you get, ok, so right now, lcfs in california is 150 bucks a tonnes carbon, ok, that's a fractional thing to us, because that's one part of the green, just one-third of the green value.
rfs and the blended tax credit make up the other two-thirds. so, i like that approach. we do see that the lcfs tight markets are going to increase we think because you got different states putting their policies in place. and also in canada, we have a lot of interest, because they haven't lcfs.
but oregon, washington are good, are going now. new york's in the rulemaking state, stage of their lcfs. and then you got the midwestern states are working at it, too. so, we'll see which one of those goes first.
so, all of that creates bigger markets, where there's extra profit? and of course, then there's still business we can do in europe. so, lynn, do you want to add anything here?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
yeah. i want to just note that these -- those numbers are based on long-run projections by independent experts under the debt case. so, we're not as focused on today's corn or today's carbon price or rins price. and some are higher than what we have, some are lower.
but over the long run, we feel like these numbers will be -- we feel that these numbers are definitely achievable from the $150 million to $200 million level, definitely.
prashant rao -- citi -- analyst
ok.
john richardson -- investor relations manager
so, the way to think of it, when he talks about that debt paid for, everyone else was listening. i know you get it, prashant. but the debt case is the cynical case. and when we're talking about what really happened, that's more of an equity case.
and it's the higher side. that's what we believe.
prashant rao -- citi -- analyst
yeah. gotcha. and just one last one if i could sneak it in. the preliminary results of the fda testing, i was just curious, there's a lot of steps here for those of who are sort of in front of the needle on going from there to what that means in terms of getting certified pathways or even provisional pathways, not just in california, but you mentioned, patrick, a bunch of the other jurisdictions that have their own lcfs flight programs ramping.
can you just give us a sense of what that gets you right now? having that preliminary analysis and this peer review process, does that move you materially closer? how does it really bring you materially closer to any of the jurisdictions you have, so thinking of as end markets? and i'll leave it there. thanks.
john richardson -- investor relations manager
yeah. so, what happens is that a lot of the people who are developing their lcfs type policies, they start with the argonne greet model, which is the gold standard of models, and then they start modifying it usually for political reasons or convenience. and california does take the greet model and they modify it a bit, need to say all corners the same and the discussion. and so, well, it's not all the same, it depends.
argonne greet model takes that into account. now, in our economics, we just model for the carbon scores that we get in california with whatever their assumptions are. and this is one of the complications of a business like ours is that every jurisdiction has some variants of the greet model that you got to take into account and plan into your economics. that's just the way it is.
we think that at the national level, we should have argonne greet model be the standard, because everyone takes it and uses it. and then they start tweaking it. but it is the one that is the science-based one. so, what you see us doing is try to educate people about what the facts actually are.
there's huge opportunity to capture soil, carbon, the actual co2 in terms of roof systems. whether you're doing local or not, they build up carbon each year. you know, what we'll do is we're going to measure field by field and prove it to people. and so, we know that the people who do lcfs, say, tell us that, hey, if you can prove it in your business system, we would consider that.
now, the other way to find out if that's true or not is to actually go do it. that's what we've worked on. that's part of what our verity tracking is all about. and then, of course, the carbon sequestration offers another opportunity.
that's like 30 to 35 ci points lower. and we're friends with the pipeline companies. and so, it's just a question of who we work with and when we announced that kind of things. so, those are all possibilities too.
so, it's a pretty interesting game and the argonne greet model is the one that everyone turns to for the fact-based, science-based systems.
derrick whitfield -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thank you very much. appreciate the time. i'll turn it over.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer

operator
the next question comes from amit dayal with h.c. wainwright.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
good afternoon, everyone. thank you for taking my questions. patrick, with respect to sort of the financing environment, given recent market developments, interest rate, discussions, etc., that are taking place, how has any of that changed for you? any color on that? and, again, you had highlighted mid-2022, as sort of the target days to complete the project financing side of the story. any update on those would be helpful.
thank you.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
sure. so, i'll come in first, and lynn, jump in. but i had lynn go out with citi and do the market testing to see who -- what kind of money is available and what kind of quantities and what kind of price, so we could make sure we update our numbers. but the world is a little weird right now.
and so, we went and did that. lynn came back with nice results. we like it. there's lots of money who are interested in investing in these projects, having a -- be able to say, no, look, everything exists is an advantage.
no, there is no newness here. it's about putting it together in a way that hasn't been done. but the actual -- there's not a risk around fermentation, on risk around the hydrocarbon technology. that's pretty cool.
so, i feel pretty good about that. we'll probably close. i'll let you comment on that, lynn. i'll let you comment on that and add any more color to this question.
go ahead.
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
sure. probably given the desire to maintain our schedule, and we'll be deploying capital this year more equity, but the debt closing will probably occur in q1 of next year. the debt format will -- because we have changed from the ethanol configuration -- sorry, the isobutanol configuration to ethanol. we are back at the table examining eligibility for private activity bonds.
but the work that we did in december with citi that pat mentioned was not private activity bonds. it was oriented toward long-term institutional debt under more of a mini-perm structure. and the terms were absolutely attractive. definitely, interest rates are sliding up a little bit, but nothing that would make a good debt financing not achievable.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
ok. so, none of this -- the shift out almost like two or three quarters does not impact the work you are doing to move everything forward. is that how we should read?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
no, that's what you should read. yes, what's driving us is everybody wants to see us, when are you going to commercialize? when is it going to be operating in 2025? can if we complete in late 2024? it's a tight timeline. so, in these projects, we always build slack anyway, read up some of our slack time. and i wish i had -- had that close relationship with axens sooner, we could have sorted this out sooner, but we didn't.
and we didn't have the emphasis on sap wasn't what it is -- a year ago, there wasn't -- it was interesting. it was nice and had potential, but it's not like it is now. the majority of the new demand we're seeing is shifting to sap. so, we're adjusting to it.
i like -- we see that it has tremendous, long-run potential. our folks are modifying the bug. and we'll be -- sort of drops into an ethanol plant, that'd be kind of cool. and -- but we have time to do that now because we have such a strong intellectual property position.
before, we were pushing it out into the marketplace, but we de-risked this now by doing the ethanol route and the jet route. and with the part that is hard for everyone to grasp, i think is because we're doing this net-zero concept where we're decarbonizing these plants, it's not easy to do, you have to know all the details -- and the engineering details. well, that's what we know. that's why we're able to do it, and how to incorporate renewable energy and with all the levers.
that's not -- you have to go fight for that and figure that out. and that's what we've done. and you know what, it works, and it applies to other plants.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
so, the front-end engineering design work that was being done in the last quarter, say, q4 2021. is that still applicable, or do you have to restart some of that work?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
most of it is applicable, like all the stuff around the grind and site work. tankage should be updated, but that's minor. the back end of -- the hydrocarbon process itself overlaps like 50% or more. was that -- probably, it's the same.
and so, that's what actually got us going in the conversation, because a couple of unit operations that have to be done, and then it is about the -- substituting out the isobutanol fermentation for an ethanol fermentation. that's the work being done right now. and of course, this time, we really are designing to make it module. that's the work being done right now.
and so, we have more work to figure that out. we want to see modular isis. i worry about supply chain stuff. and i worry -- the world is weird and so i think that we're better off manufacturing one of these in the works if we can do it.
and that's what we're working on with axens right now.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
ok. understood. and with respect to the equipment or the plants that -- is building for you guys, just a word, how should we think about revenues, etc., from that plant?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
i think -- i hate it when people think about taking -- it's really -- a really nice, small plant, and we're going to be doing it to develop new products. so, i hate it when people start talking revenue because then the expectations get blacked out because we'll run it as we want to run it or not. and depending on what we're trying to do, and what catalysts we're testing, or what unit operations and stuff like that. so, i hate to set any kind of an expectation of revenue around that because it's misleading, i think.
now, that could change. there's a bunch of specialty products that people want  want to us to make. and we'll see what's true and what isn't once they sign a contract. and if that's the case, then we would turn around and report it, like you're asking for, its revenue, and tell people what it is and what to expect.
but i hate doing it in advance of that. even though, i know what we sell the product that we make from it. i just hate to set an expectation around that.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
understood. how much  what's the sort of capex or the investment that is going into this raj-related plant?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
about 15 million or so.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
ok. understood.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
and we spent a lot. we spent -- it's been -- we started this project quite a while ago.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
ok. understood, understood. yes.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
so, it's already incorporated. it's already incorporated into our financials, that money has been spent on it. so, it's not like a new -- i don't remember what  what percent is already spent and committed, but it's well along.
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
yeah, very little, very little left to go. so, our cash balances won't be dragged by that to complete.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
ok. got it. and just one last one with the shift to -- you're going to ethanol versus isobutanol for the saf product. is this sort of permanent shift to ethanol? you know, let's say net-zero 2.
would you still consider isobutanol, or would you eventually stick to ethanol? as you get to the second, third, fourth plants?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
i think what we  my assumption right now is the first few plants are going to be ethanol oriented, because we can deploy them quicker. and we don't have to prove anything to anybody. it's clear. and i also think that, doing working with existing ethanol plants that's in the cards for us.
so, we got to go do that and strike those deals and get them done. that's part of  that's what we got to go do this year. that is one of the things we got to go do because that's part of the business model about how we can grow, right? taking ethanol down into where to get into saf through an existing plant, so you don't have to invest the capital in the fermentation side of things. i can tell you, though, that there are some very nice, greenfield sites where you know what we might want to build greenfield to build new fermentation, because, boy, they're really good sites.
and so, that's different. the way that we think about isobutanol is you could add it on, and side by side, we can do that any time. and right now, we just  we will see isobutanol, i believe it will be back. and we have the possibilities of building isobutanol plants too.
but i would rather this point that made earlier about we had technology on a cash cost basis that to perform and get us about the same kind of cash cost in ethanol budget. now ethanol is 100% optimized, it's done. the ethanol process is not fully optimized. there's lots of cost improvements that can be done.
and i'd rather go do those and design it, so it drops in easily to an existing ethanol plant, particularly one of my greenfield net-zero plants. and we could switch it because remember what i said about the hydrocarbon process, they're substantially the same from alcohol into a hydrocarbon, the product mix is different. the olefin mix is different. and so, when you're thinking about us, and we've talked about this in the past amit, you have to think about us as an olefin company, we're decarbonizing olefin most of the primary building blocks to make plastics, chemicals and all the rest.
and so, people want those things. well, that's in part what we're going to do with this price in laverne.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
i'll take my other questions offline. thank you so much.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
you bet.
operator
i'm not showing any further questions this time. i would like to turn the call back over to patrick gruber for closing remarks.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
well, it's been very exciting. i think this year can be quite a year as we just drive and are focused on getting this thing deployed, this sorting through the fermentation system, and how to make it more reliable in this light, in this uncertain world that we have. i'd like -- derisking is great. and i also like the ability that we have working with accidents where we get to use proven technologies that i wish i had known it sooner.
remember, we've been using -- we've been developing ethanol technology making hydrocarbons for the last decade at least, we call it eto and so there's lots of synergies here, as we start to combine things and think about what can be, in the meantime, we drive to net-zero 1. that's the focus, get that done, i want that capital equipment belong lead stuff, purchases here, i want to move some, get the ground prepared so that we can build an earnest in next year. and if we want to get that renewable natural gas project, i mean, it's astounding. this is fifth largest plant ever done in the states.
that's something and it looks like a great project. so, that'll be interesting, too. we got to get that thing operating and making money. so, we got lots to do this year, but it's primarily focused on, you know, it's going to be all about net-zero 1.
it's going to be about bringing on board into this business system, other ethanol plants to work with us, so we can grow faster and drive the rng, get it done. so, with that, i appreciate it. thanks for joining us. thanks for your interest and your support in gevo.

welcome to gevo's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. my name is kevin, and i'll be your operator for today's call. [operator instructions] later, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. please note that this conference is being recorded.
i'll now turn the call over to heather manuel, vice president of investor relations and communications. please go ahead, ms. manuel.
heather manuel -- vice president, investor relations and communications
good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining gevo's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. i would like to start by introducing today's participants from the company. with us today is patrick gruber, gevo's chief executive officer; lynn smull, gevo's chief financial officer; and paul john richardson, gevo's investor relations manager. earlier today, we issued a press release that outlines the topics we plan to discuss today.
a copy of this press release is available on our website at www.gevo.com. i would like to remind our listeners that this conference call is open to the media and that we are providing a simultaneous webcast of this call to the public. a replay of today's call will be available on gevo's website. on the call today and on this webcast, you will hear discussions of certain non-gaap financial measures.
non-gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with gaap. reconciliation of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures is contained in the press release distributed today, which is posted on our website. we're also making certain forward-looking statements about events and circumstances that have not yet occurred but not limited to projections about gevo's net-zero 1 project and our operating activities in 2022 and beyond. these forward-looking statements are based on management's current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those disclosed in gevo's form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2021.
that was filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission and in subsequent reports and other filings made with the sec by gevo, including gevo's quarterly reports on form 10-q. investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. such forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date, and gevo disclaims any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
on today's call, pat will begin with a discussion of gevo's business developments. lynn will then review gevo's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2021. following the presentation, we will open up the call for questions. i will now turn the call over to pat. 
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
thanks, heather, and thank you all for joining us. we have had a great and very busy quarter, what i like everything but our stock price. today, i'll be using a slide deck. please refer to it.
and i'll let you know when to turn the pages as i go through it. and we'll start on slide no. 3. recently, you've had some very important announcements today i'll be talking about how these announcements fit together toward our goal of properly producing 1 billion gallons of stable fuels by 2030.
a lot of what we will discuss today will focus on achieving that goal while de-risking the strategy as much as possible. the axens ethanol for sustainable aviation fuel technology for saf that alliance is all about axens exclusively licensing their ethanol the saf technology to gevo united states. the adm mou is about converting large-scale capacity for ethanol into saf. the colmar supply agreement is about firm demand for staff in other hydrocarbons.
gevo's rng project in northwest iowa is about execution of an energy transition project that is expected to bring in meaningful revenue starting later this year. now, before we get into the details of those announcements, i want to admit it the refresh everyone on gevo's overall business and how investors should view it. please turn to slide four. gevo is focused on properly converting renewable carbohydrates into saf and other renewable hydrocarbons.
gevo has been one of the leaders in these technologies over the years. in the u.s., it's a vertically integrated system that includes primary processing of corn, a fermentation to alcohol process, and a chemical process to make renewable hydrocarbons like saf. vertical integration should allow a net-zero plant to achieve a very low or even potentially negative carbon intensity or ci score for saf using the scientific argonne group model for measuring carbon emissions. being vertically integrated from primary processing of corn to fermentation to hydrocarbon production provides an advantage for driving carbon scores down due to integration of systems.
for example, integrating wastewater and generating biogas on site is expected to enable the displacement of fossil-based natural gas that we would use to power the facility. setting a plant, we're going to have to fossilize electricity is critical because of the large footprint that grid electricity would mean to ci score. by working with farmers, we believe we can enhance soil carbon capture, which should translate to improve ci scores. so, by reducing and eliminating fossil-based energy and gevo businesses, in particular, and by choosing feedstocks lively, gevo believes it can achieve net-zero saf, meaning net-zero for capturing co2 at the farm to the exhaust of a jet engine.
to provide the transportation industry with real decarbonizing options, it is critical that we offset the exhaust emissions fully with the carbon absorbed in the fuel production process. we have established and are developing a business called verity and tracking that uses blockchain technology to track carbon and other sustainability attributes for renewable carbon sources through the use. we expect that we will separate verity and tracking out as a stand-alone company at some point perhaps as early as 2022. we think that the way to deal with all controversy around sustainability is to just document facts, use science, and be transparent.
and that's what already tracking is all about. moving on how we're developing a proper business, remember that we had set a goal of a billion gallons of capacity and sales for gevo's business system by 2030. let's go to slide five. we struck what we believe a good financial offtake agreement with kolmar.
this agreement brings us to nearly 100 million gallons per year of offtake agreements. we expect to get more offtake contracts done relatively soon. our contract pipeline, where we are negotiating terms is greater than 1.5 billion gallons per year. as saf contract momentum picks up, we need more production capacity and likely sooner.
going to the airline industry, airlines themselves have made bold statements about eating saf and i believe them. the chart on the upper left shows that saf toward the california renewable diesel market by 2030 assuming a 10% saf blend level, the market would be roughly 13 billion gallons per year. we believe that the economics work for investment and the pricing people can offer works for customers. now, it's all about building out production capacity to scale, to match the offtake agreements we have in place and the offtake agreements that we expect to ink in the future.
please turn to slide 6. in the fourth quarter of last year, we did a deal with axens that grant gevo the exclusive license in the u.s. to develop and commercialize their technology to convert ethanol to sap and other hydrocarbons. now we had been working with accents on gevo's isobutanol hydrocarbon production process.
as we got to know each other, it became clear that there was a lot of synergy. we know how to decarbonize feedstocks and production plants and alcohols using our net-zero concepts and axens had proven technology to convert ethanol and other alcohols into hydrocarbons, including staff. axens is well known in the chemical and refining industries. is an outstanding technology and engineering company.
the hydrocarbon process technology to make jet fuels from olefin has been commercialized in the petrochemical industry many times. it's really a strategic relationship. we complement each other. in addition to greenfield plants we're developing, we see the opportunity to convert certain existing ethanol plants to net-zero staff.
we'll work together with axens to try to make that happen. we all want to grow and faster. we have made the decision to use ethanol as a building block for staff rather than iva at our net-zero 1 plan. we believe we can make more money, produce more staff, and have a complete engineering package that would work with existing ethanol plants.
currently, the capital cost for a net-zero plant is projected to be about $900 million, fully installed in a nonrecourse project financed, and that zero 1 project ebitda estimates are approximately $150 million to $200 million per year. based on the current assumptions of commodities and all the rest. ethanol plants are well known in terms of cost and operating reliability. on the hydrocarbon process.
axens is doing the engineering it will provide certain process guarantees for converting the ethanol into hydrocarbons. this is a derisk production system as much as we can make it and in the current more cautious environment for financing the right way to move forward. the engineering designs modules integrations are planned to be cookie-cutter for deployment at other sites and ethanol plants. a great deal of the engineering work and designs that we already have completed for nz-1 will be utilized for nz-1 using ethanol axens technology.
the fermentation section of the plant will be smaller, and we will have to add additional equipment as part of the chemical processes. we expect nz-1 to be mechanically complete in 2024 and operating in 2025. we expect to order long-lead equipment in 2022 and begin site preparation work later this year. please turn to slide 7.
many of you may recognize this chart. it's basically the same as before. although the amounts and product mix has changed there's more saf being produced. the total capital expenditure has remained about the same.
the irr is projected to be better using ethanol rather than isobutanol deploying renewable energy and infrastructure to drive down ci is still critical to success. please turn to slide 8. the axens relationship in our plants to grow help to put the adm mou announcement into perspective. adm has some of the biggest and most efficient ethanol plants in the world.
we think there's an opportunity to convert those plants into saf plants and other hydrocarbons. adm theater has one of the few operating co2 sequestration sites in the u.s. we're in the midst of figuring out the how-to with them. we expect that we will be able to leverage the engineering work we are doing with axens for nz-1 into any transaction that we would do with adm.
we are also exploring other opportunities with existing ethanol plants, and we are currently in discussions with several plant owners. the idea here is that we can bring our decarbonization partners, juhl energy, the saf, plant designs, and our offtake contracts to the table. the value proposition for the ethanol plant owner is simple they would make more money, more reliably by feeding ethanol to a saf plant. they also would need to be decarbonized along the lines of a net-zero plant.
we have a very open business model and look forward to working with many ethanol operations over time. but we stress that net-zero 1 is our priority. ultimately, to reach our 1-billion-gallon goal, we expect to build multiple greenfield sites. we have several sites in development already, they're at least as good if not better than the lake preston site.
the advantage of greenfield sites is that we can optimize the key parameters for long-run success. in addition to raw material costs, we also take into consideration access to the fossilized energy and potential for carbon capture sequestration. in a strategic sense, it is always good to have options. for example, the plant layout that we have developed from lake preston to be used at another piece of land of similar size.
we believe that the site we select would require minimal changes to the engineering work. please turn to slide 9. we announced that we have begun the start-up of gevo's rng project in northwest iowa. when our rng project comes fully in line is projected to be the fifth-largest dairy rng project ever done in the u.s.
this project has over 20,000 cows and is expected to produce 355,000 million btus annually or thereabouts. there are three dairies involved at this point. you can see the pictures of the digesters at each of the dairies. the upper right picture is the gas upgrading injection site.
the picture in the middle shows the relative locations of the digestion system that we built, and our gevo pipeline that connects them to the upgrading system. we expect that the rng project ebitda would be approximately $16 million to $20 million per year, across the year of 2023. i give a range because the rng project ebitda will depend upon a variety of assumptions including how carb scores, the ci for each of the dairies. now to get a ci score, we have to achieve a steady-state, sending an application, wait for the approval to get the full value from carbon california, we'd expect to get those scores in late 2022 or early 2023.
carb is backed up these days with lots of applications. rng provides an exciting opportunity for gevo, we see it as strategic for gevo because we have to decarbonize our saf plants, and we do like the idea of being able to take rng up to our net-zero 1 plant and drive our ci scores lower if we so choose. we like adding rng and biogas in our portfolio as an option. in the meantime, we can make good money, meeting demand in california for our partner, bp.
please turn to slide 10. this is a rendering -- an engineering rendering of our hydrocarbon plant currently built by praj in india. we expect that this plant will be delivered to our production facility in luverne, minnesota in the latter part of 2022. we are currently making execute in luverne this hydrocarbon plant could convert isobutanol into a variety of hydrocarbon products we also expected to be able to produce or to take ethanol and make various hydrocarbon products.
we expect to use luverne as a development site for new products and to improve and refine the iba production processes. we may deploy isobutanol in a side-by-side configuration in the future, for example, as an add-on to a net-zero plant. now, i'll turn it over to lynn.
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
thank you, pat. we finished 2021 with the strong cash and cash equivalent position of $40.8 million, as well as $95.2 million of short and long-term restricted cash. our highly liquid and readily convertible short and long-term marketable securities totaled $339.7 million and are available for capital and operational needs. our long-term debt outstanding related to northwest iowa rng was $67 million.
our corporate spent was approximately $18 million for 2021 net of noncash stock-based compensation. during 2021, we invested significant capital into our preliminary and advanced-stage projects, including approximately $23 million into our flagship net-zero 1 project, $52 million into northwest iowa rng, and other capital projects, as well as approximately $12 million into strategic patents and licenses. as heather noted, our full financial statements are available in our earnings release and our form 10-k both available on our website. i'd like to stress that we substantially advanced the company with our expenditures last year.
we have continued to staff experienced talent to bolster our corporate management platform and to prepare for successful execution across a range of critical functions including stronger design engineering capabilities, continued r&d around our technologies, deeper commercial contract solicitation, and execution capabilities. the development of verity and the gevo growers program substantially improved capabilities around investor relations, significant advancement in the integration of our erp system into current and future operations to enable intelligent automation and reliable internal and external reporting, successful implementation of sox 404(b) compliance requirements without any deficiencies, and improved financing and financial management capabilities. we strengthened our balance sheet to provide financial resources to support the development of our 1-billion-gallon initiative, the equity investment in net-zero 1, rng execution, and operational and r&d activities at laverne. we advanced the development engineering and expected nonrecourse debt terms and attainability for net-zero 1 and we substantially constructed the northwest iowa rng project.
as a result of this progress and our work with institutional investors, there was an impressive shift in gevo institutional stock ownership from 10% at the end of 2020 to 46% at the end of 2021. we may still be considered a pre-revenue company as our revenues have been intermittent, and mostly were related to testing and r&d activities. but that will begin to change in 2022 given that we have begun the northwest iowa rng project start-up, we expect to start generating revenue and cash flow later this year once the biogas production ramps up and stabilizes. initial revenue recognition and cash flow realization for any rng project in the marketplace lags actual rng production due to california carbon scores and epa rins certification processes.
but we will push hard to realize value in 2022. upon full rng operations and certifications, we would expect to see rng project ebitda flows in the range of $16 million to 22 million a year, depending on the project-certified carbon index outcome and market prices for commodities and environmental benefits. as we flesh out our 1-billion-gallon initiative, and how much staff we expect to produce and when, we expect to communicate these plans to our shareholders. everything we are planning to do is supported by a comprehensive financial enterprise model.
we are happy to be in the growth phase of our business and we are delighted that our capital deployment opportunities should result in excellent returns. we would expect any future capital reasons to support this growth to be accretive. now, i will turn this call back over to pat to wrap things up.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
excellent. let's open up the call for question. operator?
",2021-Q4,GEVO,0.98735,0.9987,
0.9998,,":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of derrick whitfield from stifel.
derrick whitfield -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
congrats on progressing your northwest iowa rng project on time and budget in light of the current environment. so perhaps for pat. i wanted to see if you could speak to the importance of the farmers edge mou and the value you expected to contribute to your net zero and verity tracking content?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
yes. so one of the great big issues that's in front of all these sustainable products, and not just ours, but everybody's is what's sustainable and what isn't. we have all kinds of people creating, talking about how they're green or they're doing these great green credits or whatever, but each deficit will provide those. we want to see things verified absolutely throughout the whole value chain, set these things are verified.
they're verified by third parties, mutable, can't be messed with, hence the blockchain approach. and farmers edge has 18 million acres of farming partners where they collect all the data that are -- that's used in agriculture and how those people plant their crops and all the rest. and that's a key input for figuring out the sustainability footprint. that's just one part of the puzzle.
there'll be more parts to this as you see -- as you all see it unfold. but the idea is to do absolutely verified, certified data from the field all the way through the energy of the production all the way straight through the whole supply chain out to the marketplace. we have a different point of view than almost every other company out in our space. we think it should be tracked that way.
that's how we can be sure of it and we could end the base, that we could do it with data.
derrick whitfield -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. and as my follow-up, i wanted to focus on the net-zero 1 inputs and outputs referenced on slide 8. directionally, both the inputs and outputs are higher than your q4 update. so just wanted see if you guys could perhaps update us some of the most notable process and/or design changes, which have led to the enhanced productivity.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
it's more of going through the details. chris, did you want to comment on this at a high level because you can't go into detail or details.
chris ryan -- chief operating officer
yes. i mean we're still making some improvements to the process to allow us to increase the amount of product we produce as well as reduce the inputs required. so yes, it's all headed in the right direction.
operator
our next question comes from the line of shawn severson from water tower research.
shawn severson -- water tower research -- analyst
i was wondering looking forward, when you're talking about ethanol plants and the right ones, what does the time frame look like for new nz development in a plant that's existing like that. that's termed as compressed time frame relative to what the first one has been obviously, but how long will that take if you have the right plant getting to production?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
well, we're trying to accelerate as much as possible. so the idea of the design of that net-zero 1 is to make it a modular type of a plant from the alcohol forward. there are some things that you still have to do around optimizing for energy around ethanol. but that part of converting ethanol into jet fuel.
that's the idea is to do a modular approach. and in which case, you could put these things anywhere very quick. however, you still got to work on the decarbonization, and that's when we're talking when we say the right ethanol plants. we've got to be able to decarbonize those ethanol plants in order to make them into the saf that the marketplace would want.
shawn severson -- water tower research -- analyst
ok. so not too different of the time frame from development. and obviously, nz1 time frame, additional plants, nz2, 3 using existing ethanol plants is going to be what the green shot. i'm just trying to understand how quickly they can be cookie-cuttered.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
so the design that we're doing for nz1 could be -- that's going to be a modular design that can be taken directly to any other plant directly. and then the time so could be very, very quick to the point, unusually quick. and we don't have risk the way normal processes have. so these processes from axens are well known, well studied.
we're doing the energy integrations. we're working with fluid quip on the ethanol stuff. so we have a pretty good -- we don't have risks like so many other process you do. you don't have it there.
so it's much, much better shape. and so i think we can deploy multiple lease at once is which i think you're asking me. the answer is yes, we can.
shawn severson -- water tower research -- analyst
yes, exactly. and the second question is regarding pipeline new business. obviously, the environment created a lot of opportunity for energy diversification, let's say, and looking for alternatives to oil. how has that changed or impact your pipeline given the events year to date?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
do you mean because of all the discussion in particular marketplace like saf? or is it a --
shawn severson -- water tower research -- analyst
no. no. no. i'm talking about just in oil and energy security diversification.
we have ukraine and russia, etc.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
gotcha. macro. yes. big time.
so what's happened is that people know we're going to need liquid fuels. everyone can see that. we're going to need liquid fuels. and it's a question of how to decarbonize them, and we have one of the very good routes of our technologies to make of course saf.
we can make diesel fuel, jet fuel as well. of course, there are any other -- any of the basic chemicals and materials, too. so the need is going to be here. it's strong.
the demand is growing and the interest across the whole front of everybody involved in the space has heightened because of all the pressure, the price of oil, the price is still the concerns about carbon. all of that stuff comes to bear. and there's going to be a need for the fuels fundamentally, a need for the fuels. and i think that will become more clear in the next month.
operator
our next question comes from the line of amit dayal from h.c. wainwright.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
pat, with respect to the rng revenues, how should we expect these to start showing up revenue? you just you still are like getting qualified on that front right now. but by fourth quarter, do you think we should be able to see some cash flows from that effort to come through?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
this is a question for lynn. i'll punt it to him. lynn?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
sure. yes. we're in start-up now. we expect to be in steady-state production by june.
we'll be selling commodity, but up to that under normal terms of trade. the revenue recognition around environmental benefits, i.e., rins will be slightly delayed a few months, and lcfs predicts are delayed under the carb process for pathway approvals by a few more months. so by the end of the year, we hope to see some revenue recognition off of the environmental benefits. and then 2023 should be steady state on a cycle of receipt of the receivables on that.
but we modeled in that as a working capital hit, the delayed receipt of revenues and -- on receipt of cash and revenue recognition. so we were fully anticipating that. that's just part of this business of generating environmental benefits. it's a particular cost to all projects.
and in fact, we learning firsthand by the administration of putting those benefits into the market and receiving the cash and the revenue recognition is a great learning exercise for us to get us ready for the bigger game around net zero.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
understood. that's helpful. and pat or maybe lynn, you highlighted you're going to be breaking ground and then ordering long lead time equipment in the next -- over the next few quarters. is that going to be funded through our balance sheet? and what kind of risk does it create potentially from a perspective of getting the project financing in place, etc.? any thoughts on this exact thing would be.
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
yes. we will be funding the development period expenditures off the balance sheet. then when we get to financial close, that will provide the full construction budget or financing both debt and equity to complete the project. it reduces the risk, though, because it locks in pricing.
we will have done enough engineering to know exactly which equipment we need, and chris can comment on this more specifically, but it actually will reduce the risk of getting the financial close and execution of the project overall because financiers love to see a sponsor going long, going at risk with a major capital project, and that's what we're doing.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
understood. any changes to that environment, lynn, in terms of how the market is behaving right now, interest rates, inflation, all these factors? has that changed anything from a financing perspective?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
no. not at all. we still have strong interest on the debt side. we feel confident that we'll be able to pull the debt in on the sort of projected levels.
interest rates are up, but the bigger component of the interest expense is going to be the spread and the actual underlying rates are not driving any material changes to the overall economics.
amit dayal -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
ok. understood. and you guys were also expecting to receive in process of receiving delivery from praj on some saf equipment, isobutylene conversion equipment. has that taken place? or is that also sort of the second half 2022 catalyst?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
that's the second half of the year kind of a thing, and we're working with them. and we have some more creative ideas on what to do with that equipment. and so once those are baked, then we'll tell everybody about it.
operator
our next question is a follow-up from the line of derrick whitfield from stifel.
derrick whitfield -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
as a follow-up for lynn. lynn, i know you spent a considerable amount of time in developing the enterprise financial or financing plan and that efforts likely generated several learnings in the process. could you speak to how you're generally thinking about the chevron and adm partnerships and any key learnings in the process today?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
well, the enterprise model is a 1 billion gallon initiative. so it's much broader than just adm and under that memorandum of understanding or the chevron mou. it's actually looking to control our own destiny with quite a lot of development of greenfield as well as other potential ethanol jvs or acquisitions that we talked about a little earlier. and the model itself is extensive.
it's a very comprehensive large model that's been scrubbed backwards and forwards, and it yields a very attractive sort of view on the future with respect to accretion and value creation. so i think it's been very useful to form the basis of discussions with financiers and it's well thought out. and we didn't have that three months or six months ago, and it's really been useful to have that plan in place.
derrick whitfield -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great. and just one last follow-up for pat. i wanted to touch on your decision to proceed with lake preston as a site for net-zero 1. as i recall from last quarter's call, you were still evaluating site location as there were several greenfield sites that were at least as attractive as lake preston.
could you perhaps elaborate on the developments that firmed up lake preston as the final site selection?
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
yes. it comes down to good -- we were lucky to have a good pool of sites. we had to take a last look. and lake preston is the one we felt we could develop the quickest.
and so quickest to market is what we want. and therefore, let's go.
operator
this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. i'd like to hand the program back to dr. gruber for any further remarks.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
thank you all very much for joining us. i appreciate your support. i appreciate the questions from the analysts, and it's a good experience. we're on to an exciting time here at gevo.
we are in a sweet spot. i don't like the overall markets, of course. but you know what, we got a good plan and are going to drive to get things deployed and get on with success. thanks.

thank you for standing by, and welcome to the gevo, inc. first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, today's program may be recorded. and now i'd like to introduce your host for today's program, mr.
john richardson, director of investor relations. please go ahead, sir.
john richardson -- director of investor relations
good afternoon, everyone. this is john richardson, gevo's director of investor relations. thanks for joining us to discuss gevo's first-quarter results for the period ended march 31, 2022. i'd like to start by introducing today's participants from the company.
with us today are dr. patrick gruber, gevo's chief executive officer; dr. chris ryan, gevo's chief operating officer; and lynn smull, gevo's chief financial officer. earlier today, we issued a press release that outlines the topics we plan to discuss.
a copy of this press release is available on our website at www.gevo.com. please be advised that our remarks today, including answers to your questions, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act. these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to be materially different from those currently anticipated. those statements include projections about gevo's sustainable aviation fuel projects, its renewable natural gas project and other operating activities described in our filings with the securities and exchange commission, which are incorporated by reference.
we disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. in addition, we may provide certain non-gaap financial information in this call. the relevant definitions and gaap reconciliations may be found in our earnings release and 10-q, which can be found on our website at www.gevo.com in the investor relations section. following the prepared remarks, time permitting, we'll open the call to your questions.
i would like to remind everyone that this conference call is open to the media, and we are providing a simultaneous webcast to the public. a replay will be available via the company's investor relations page at www.gevo.com. i would now like to turn the call over to the ceo of gevo, dr. patrick gruber.
pat? 
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
thanks, john. good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our call today. we filed our form 10-q earlier today. we ask that you refer to it for detailed information.
the first quarter was exciting on several fronts. we progressed further down the path toward gevo becoming one of the first commercial producers of verifiable net zero carbon aviation fuels, starting with residual carbohydrate as the raw material and toward our goal of producing 1 billion gallons of this valuable high-demand fuel by 2030. we are in a unique position with our vertically integrated plant design that we believe will make it possible for gevo to offer the transportation industry of fuel with a very low and potentially negative full life cycle ci score. this can only be achieved by managing the entire system from feedstock selection through product delivery, the optimization of farming practices and the elimination of fossil-based energy throughout the whole life cycle is key to achieving low ci scores.
low ci scores are critically important to the airlines as they have limited options to decarbonize their operations. as a reminder, a ci score of zero means that as much co2 is consumed in producing the fuel as is created when it's burned in an engine. now during the first quarter, we announced new supply agreements with delta and british airways for a combined total volume of 105 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel or saf. we now have contracts of more than 200 million gallons per year.
these agreements further validate the airline industry's commitment to low-carbon saf as the solution for their businesses to meet the environmental goals that they have identified and that their customers and investors demand. we also completed construction of our rng plant in northwest iowa on time and within budget. that plant is served by 3 dairies with 20,000 cows plus combined, and it is designed to produce 355,000 million btus of rng. the digesters are in the start-up phase and should be reaching steady-state production levels in a matter of weeks.
we are producing biogas and are starting up the equipment to process that gas into rng for the pipeline distribution system. as most of you know, this rng will be sold by bp into the california market where it'll be used for transportation fuels. once we've gone through the certification process of carb and the epa to understand the value of lcfs and rin credits, we can begin recognizing fully the revenue. we expect the project level ebitda to be in the range of $16 million to $22 million a year depending upon the value of those credits.
i'm really proud of how well the rng projects were executed by our team, and it was done completely in-house. gevo acted as the project manager, general contractor for this project. so i believe it clearly demonstrates gevo's ability to plan, design and execute a large-scale project, while delivering it on time and on budget. based on the interest that we've received from nearby farms, others are excited about this team's execution and rng plans as well.
last point on our rng project. getting it done within budget also means that we're able to plan correctly even in this inflationary environment that we have these days. the business model is very attractive and continues to develop. the recently signed mou with farmers edge is a big step forward, provides the proprietary data set that we can use with verity's blockchain technology.
farmers edge has reported that they had data on agriculture production of more than 18 million acres and it's growing. verity is developing the software and methods to attract carbon and other sustainable attributes from the farms to the jet exhaust. we expect verity's tracking to be able to be used for fuel products, food products and even industrial and oil products. it's a tool in a service that tracks data and converts it into rock solid information.
we plan to offer the product to others and develop the business. i think we have something quite valuable here. we also continue to work with adm and other ethanol producers. we are looking at several greenfield sites that are special in their economics and ability to drive the ci score down.
as we grow, i expect that we'll have a mix of both greenfield sites and existing ethanol plant sites, both ways can give good economics. there are a rising number of ethanol producers in the u.s. that are interested in providing feedstock for our saf process. the value proposition makes perfect sense to them, but not every ethanol plant makes sense for gevo given the need to decarbonize the process.
there will likely be other partnerships over time to finding the best ethanol plants in areas with favorable farming practices and readily deployed defossilized energy to eliminate fossil fuels takes work and effort. we are working with concepts that are new and our critical issues in choosing sites that is driving the ci score down defossilization of the energy sourcing, defossilized electricity and the heat. now i would like to turn the call over to dr. chris ryan, our chief operating officer.
chris has been with gevo for 13 years and has been a coo and president for 11 years. chris is one of the been there done it leaders we have on our team. he has a long track record of delivering commercial projects and technologies going back to natureworks to dla. chris is in charge of deployment of our net-zero 1 project and engineering for the plants.
as we are working through the engineering and cost for our nz1 project, chris and his team have done a good job putting down costs and supply chain issues so that nothing hinders our 2025 operational time frame. getting down information is a particular hassle in this inflationary and covid world. we had to double and triple check equipment costs and time lines. good news is we're on track for our 2025 start-up at nz1.
but we have eaten into some of our slack time on the project. slack time is excess time built into the project time line for unknowns. i think it would be helpful for chris to provide the status of our nz1 project. chris?
chris ryan -- chief operating officer
thanks, pat. net-zero 1 project is coming along really well. we're on track with site developments, engineering and all the commercial contracts for our lake preston site to be operational in 2025. we're excited to receive the additional use permits a few months ago for both the net-zero 1 plant as well as the wind turbines that will power the net-zero 1 plant.
those conditional use permits are a critical green light that we needed to move forward at the site. together with the land agreements that our wind partner has in place with the local landowners, the wind part of the project is moving toward the execution phase. at this site, we're on track to break ground this year. we have the land option agreement that we executed in 2020, and we expect to finalize the land purchase soon.
all the necessary permits are on track, and our engineering is finalizing site layout and foundation requirements needed to start moving dirt this year. speaking of engineering, i want to take a minute to highlight the very experienced and capable engineering team we have for our net zero projects. i can't think of a core group of more experienced engineers at designing, scaling up and commercially operating such a diverse set of bio-based processes. each of our leaders has 20 to 40 years' experience engineering and operating bio-based chemical and fuel processes that are running successfully today.
the team has a track record of commercially successful renewable resource-based processes. add to that, the experience of our development and engineering partners, most of whom we've not yet disclosed. this gives me comfort knowing that we have the capability of designing and building what we believe to be the most efficient, lowest carbon processes with low operating risk. all of that experience is being put to use in finding ways to minimize energy required to produce these zero carbon products using proven unit operations across the manufacturing chain.
i'd like to highlight a couple of our key partners who we're working with on the process engineering. in our production process, we have two basic steps. first, we make alcohols by fermentation, think of beer brewery. then we convert those alcohols into hydrocarbons, such as sustainable aviation fuel.
we have key engineering partners for each of those production steps. on the fermentation plant, the gevo engineering team is working with fluid quip technologies to design the most efficient and flexible, low-carbon process that we can. fluid quip has years of experience engineering ethanol plants in the u.s. and outside the u.s.
plus some of the key people at fluid quip have spent their careers on converting ag commodities to various products using a variety of processes. and that's great as we evaluate various options for how we should build our net zero plants. on the alcohol to hydrocarbon plant, we're working with axens who is bringing their commercially proven alcohol to hydrocarbon process. axens with its 2,500 employees has been licensing this sort of process for 25 years into the petrochemical and refining industries across more than 100 operations.
for the alcohol to hydrocarbon process, they're giving us an end-to-end process guarantee backed by service, support and constant remote monitoring. we've been working with axens now for nearly 18 months around engineering and catalyst selection. they're a very capable organization and their engineering deliverables are really well done, which makes for an easy handoff to an epc for execution. as we work with axens and our other partners to finalize the net zero design, we've accumulated a lot of know-how and intellectual property.
much of this is related to removing fossil energy from the manufacturing process by first, reducing energy requirements for the process; second, self-generating renewable energy at the site; and third, integrating everything to minimize the carbon footprint and achieve net zero. our intellectual property is around how all the pieces are integrated and how the system works in concert to produce products using a low amount of fossil energy. the novelty of the design goes beyond the core manufacturing process and includes designing the wind energy, the green hydrogen production and the wastewater treatment plant. for example, we're designing the green hydrogen process to work in concert with the wind turbines to utilize excess renewable electricity on high wind days.
also, the biogas we generate on site for the thermal energy will be able to be throttled with process energy needs. doing these things allows us to minimize fossil energy use and achieve a low-carbon footprint. and because we have a very experienced team between us and our partners, we know how to design these processes with minimal risk because we've experienced many different bio-based processes, and we have lived through things that run smoothly and those that don't. so we know how to design for low-risk operability.
we also know how to plan in an inflationary environment and have considered that in our plans. so we have engineering on track and expect to break ground at lake preston later this year. we'll also start purchasing long-lead equipment to maintain a schedule that has us beginning operations in 2025. we expect to execute commercial agreements for the wind energy, the green hydrogen production and the wastewater treatment this year with companies who are experts at those things, which allows us to leverage their teams.
we're also currently running the process to select the epc for the execution phase of this project. i've been talking about net-zero 1 and progress there, but it's important to keep in mind that we're not just designed for net-zero 1, but for future net zero plants. so we make this as much a cookie-cutter process as we can. that includes modularizing wherever it makes sense.
of course, we expect future net zero plants to be even bigger than that net-zero 1. so the process design has taken that into account as well. when it comes to the cost of the lake preston project, we expect the capital cost to be in line with what we projected last year, but we anticipate we'll be making much more product than we expected last year, about a third more due to improvements in our design over last year. now i'll turn the call over to lynn smull to review the financial results.
lynn?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
thanks, chris. we ended the first quarter of 2022 with a strong liquidity position of $413.4 million in cash, restricted cash and other liquid investments. our long-term debt outstanding is related to the northwest iowa rng project and was $67 million. our corporate spend, that is sg&a was approximately $8 million net of noncash stock-based compensation.
during the first quarter of 2022, we invested approximately $31.2 million, comprised of $9.6 million into our net-zero 1 project, $18.3 million into the northwest iowa rng project and approximately $3.2 million into other capital projects. i believe that the future looks bright for gevo. we're at the forefront of creating a new industry that blends substantial aspects of existing agriculture, energy, renewable energy, transportation and materials industries into the new carbon reduction industry. we sit at the nexus of all this and have a unique perspective on the horizon that customers, financiers, contractors and equipment suppliers recognize.
this perspective is holistic and drives a comprehensive approach to the business system development. essential to this is the vast undersupply in the market of renewable fuels and materials and most importantly, right now, sustainable aviation fuel. taking the pronouncements of major airlines like delta, we expect global demand for saf to be in the 13 billion gallon per year order of magnitude by 2030. our billion gallon initiative would obviously supply only a portion of this demand.
rapid capital deployment is key and limited by the ability to site, permit, engineer and construct production capacity. we are solving these issues and showing the solutions to major financiers who want to participate in the capital formation and industry creation. we believe our enterprise model is a realistic view on the billion gallon initiative. and based on what we feel are reasonable projections of future capex, revenues and opex, it indicates highly accretive value creation for the next several years.
we have discussed the model with financiers and early stage reactions are positive. given our strong value proposition, we do not expect the capital availability will be a constraint. our mission from a finance perspective is securing the capital for growth on terms that are both accretive to gevo's shareholders, and it also keep us in the driver's seat. we feel that remaining in control of our business plan execution is important given our unique perspectives on this newly emerging industry to take substantial time and energy to explain this to people, but we believe these efforts will yield the capital resources needed to execute on our plans.
capital will likely be supplied in various forms given the large numbers involved and the various levels at which different financiers may prefer to participate. for example, we expect financing will come in the form of nonrecourse debt at the project spe levels, third-party project-level equity, potentially the evolution of holdco level equity and aggregated portfolio debt and corporate level equity raises to downstream funds into the projects. now i'll turn the call back to pat.
pat gruber -- chief executive officer
thanks, lynn. and with that, i think we should open it up for questions.
",2022-Q1,GEVO,0.9998,1.0,
1.0,,":
operator
[operator instructions] we have a question from derrick whitfield with stifel. your line is open.
derrick whitfield -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thanks and good afternoon. for my first question, i wanted to ask if you could really share your thoughts on potential benefits from the pending ra legislation, really building on where you ended the conversation. obviously, the sap btc is a positive, but it seems like there's also a potential on the ccs and itc elements that could benefit your capital costs. any thoughts you guys could share about those benefits and the payment mechanism will be really appreciated.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
yes. so the way the ccs work for us is that there is one of the pipelines being built, not too far away from us. we'll probably look up to that. i would expect us to and then it will go on.
and the deal that we make with that would -- so everyone understands, we'll be capturing co2 that comes off from mutation source or renewable carbon, and going into the pipeline, and ultimately geologically sequestered. that improves our ci score along the way. and so, it helps to add to the margins of our product. and how much it adds is dependent upon california lcfs, how it will be treated under rfs and all the rest, plus then there's the blenders tax credit that we just talked about.
so those are things that will be unfolding. if you do argonne greet model, you'd wind up with carbon negative type ci scores, carbon-negative ci scores. there's nobody who's talking about fuel from carbon negative, but us. and that's because we start with a net zero plan, if you add ccs to it, then it goes negative.
that's a big deal. and that shows people what's possible here for the future. the other things that are interesting in that bill are, one of the doe programs, good. those are about energy transition.
they funded the usda smart climate stuff, that's awesome because this is about sustainable agriculture, bringing in to the overall picture. one of the great tools that this country has available to it is capturing carbon in the soil. it requires that modern -- people use modern farming techniques like low-till and no-till with precision agriculture, monitor what's growing, measure carbon and things like that. but those are the kind of programs that are put forth in that bill, and that's a big deal.
the other thing that we see is, going to be important is hydrogen stuff got funded, wind tax credits got funded, those benefit us because we'll be building hydrogen where, of course, we're working with juhl energy to build up the wind. the biogas, i think, there's some stuff in there for that, but i think it will be more important in the farm bill as that gets done because it's related more toward the manure and how to build things there. so overall, there's lots of really interesting stuff in here. it's a question of, is it going to get morphed up a little bit as it goes through the house, and then what is all -- what all the language behind it mean, all those things will be interesting to see.
but overall, it's like it's pretty encouraging, i'd say.
derrick whitfield -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
certainly. and maybe just tacking on to your response, while the plan for decarbonizing your energy sources for nz1 is likely locked, is there -- when you critically review that legislation to date, could that change your potential or preferred pathway for decarbonizing your production process?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
there's nothing in there that would change it like that. the fundamental issue for all production plants, this is all ethanol guys, anyone who makes, manufactures anything is, grid electricity is not green. that's just a simple fact of life. and so, people can talk about all the grid electricity and all the, hey, i got news.
if we want to use it, it creates the footprint for us. and you know what's worse, is fossil-based natural gas. that's where the issues lie for all of us who manufacture things. those have to be substituted out over time if we're going to be successful in reducing the greenhouse gases.
so what's interesting about this is, i think that people really are grasping this idea of energy transition that will happen over a period of time. it's going to require many different sources of renewable electricity -- of different routes to get there. same thing, hydrogen is useful. we can use capture excess electrons from wind, put into hydrogen, we can always get the energy back out of the hydrogen.
we'll be doing that up at our plant at, like preston. and then, i think there is a possibility to do techniques where sequestration comes into play, geological sequestration comes into play where you can do the burning of a natural gas, capture the co2 from it, sequester it. and so, i guess that's blue energy, and you'd wind up reducing the carbon footprint. so all those things are touched upon in this bill.
but make no mistake, all these things are awfully market-driven. so the government is nice, good, good for them, making progress, great. that will help things. we've got to clear up things.
we've got to clear up grid problems, all those kind of things. but you know what, it's all market-driven anyway. and so, this ain't going away ever on ci score. and that is a new competitive attribute of which we are 100% focused on.
derrick whitfield -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great. and if i could just ask one additional question. regarding to the chemical products you referred to in your prepared remarks, could you help frame or add some color around the market size and potential specializations for low-carbon chemical products?
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
yes. here's a really simple way to think of it is that our business is taking the renewable materials and converting them first in the building blocks. these building blocks are the primary petrochemical things that you get out of a cracker, the ethylene, propylene, and butines. if you know how to make those from renewables and to do them cost effectively, which we do, you can make literally everything that's in the petrochemical, all the big chemical products, you can make them.
the technologies are all already exist, and all in play already in the chemical industry. the thing that's going to be interesting about our material is that they're massively carbon negative. so think about that. if we take in our manufacturing sustainable aviation fuel, and then it goes to a jet plane and it burns and we're measuring co2 at the tail versus what the farmer took in a co2 on the front, and we get to net zero right? if it's sitting in -- that same fuel sitting in a tank would be about a minus 100 ci score, fully sequestered carbon sitting there in tank, likewise, with these chemical products.
so it'd be possible to take and make massively carbon-negative polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, any of those things. so think of all plastics, all large plastics, think of all those things, all of those are then enabled and it's not doing anything super special or fancy. it's just simply feeding them into the infrastructure of the chemical industry. that's all that has to happen.
you don't need new production to go downstream and do the chemical products, it already exists. you just got to substitute the raw material.
derrick whitfield -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great. thanks for your time and responses.
operator
at this time, this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would now turn the call back over to dr. gruber for his closing remarks.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
thank you all for joining us. it's an exciting time for us here at gevo. i'm pleased to be moving forward. lake preston feels really good, after all this time to get on with it.
i appreciate all of our partners who are working with us to do the defossilization, decarbonization. that's going to be a tremendously important thing as we go forth, and the solutions are going to be slightly different each location. and our customers have been great. they've been up learning about how to do sustainable agriculture, how to think about counting carbon, and learning to the ins and outs of this whole business because it is different.
we have to account for the whole supply chain. and we are out to drive ci score down. and we are trying to change the whole of the business system together. and so, it's a pretty interesting game to play.
i'm looking forward to it, and getting on with it, and i'm glad our teams are doing such a good job of getting things done. and thank you all for your support in gevo. with that, have a good afternoon.

john richardson -- director of investor relations
 good afternoon, everyone. this is john richardson, gevo's director of investor relations. thanks for joining us to discuss gevo's second quarter results for the period ended june 30, 2022. i'd like to start by introducing today's participants from the company.
with us today are dr. patrick gruber, gevo's chief executive officer, tim cesarek, gevo's chief commercial officer, and lynn smull, gevo's chief financial officer. earlier today, we issued a press release that outlines the topics we plan to discuss. a copy of the press release is available on our website at www.gevo.com.

patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
thanks, john. good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. we filed our form 10-q earlier today, and we ask that you refer to it for more detailed information. our team had fantastic momentum as we exited the first quarter of this year.
we announced two new saf supply agreements, one with delta, another with british airways in the first quarter for a combined 105 million gallons per year. we maintained that momentum through the second quarter and beyond. since the first quarter, gevo's business development team has done a great job to close five additional supply agreements with american airlines, alaska airlines, japan airlines, finnair, and aer lingus for a combined total volume of 155 million gallons per year of saf. collectively then, gevo now has over 350 million gallons per year of committed saf offtake that has an applied hydrocarbon revenue value estimated at over $2 billion per year, inclusive of the market -- inclusive of the value of the environmental benefits and based on current market projections and operating assumptions.
now, that brings us meaningfully closer to our production goal and sales goal of 1 billion gallons per year of 2030. it's tremendous progress. i'm proud of our team. and what's even better is, they're all -- they're take-or-pay agreements, and that helps us.
now, it's good momentum for saf and our systematic approach driving down carbon intensity, the customer base buys into what we're doing. it's inclusive of our whole supply chain from growing of raw materials to the burning of jet fuel. and we continue to believe that net zero carbon negative fuels can be produced profitably. that's what all the data keeps saying.
we haven't slowed down either. our team continues to discuss and negotiate agreements with other potential partners, including strategic partners. we are very pleased with our northwest iowa rng project, all three of our dairy partners and the digesters are now producing biogas, and that gas is being set to the upgrading unit and injected into the sales pipeline where the sales are managed by bp. over the next several months, gas quality production data will be gathered for gevo's application to carb so that we can apply for lcfs and maximize the value to gevo in those gas streams -- with those gas streams.
i look forward to being able to report meaningful revenue and the associated profit for that project in the near future. our team has done a great job work through start-up issues, everything is working. so it is very, very good. and the -- to remind people, this is a 355,000 million btu nameplate capacity.
this is the fifth largest dairy project ever constructed, and it is doing really well. our net-zero 1 project in lake preston, south dakota, which is being designed to produce 62 million gallons a year of low carbon fuels, 55 million gallons will be sustainable aviation fuel. that remains on schedule to deliver its first volumes in 2025. the fel-3 work is expected to be done around year-end, but we already have enough data to move forward on the build-out, and we expect to stay on schedule.
as we announced last month, gevo closed land purchase for approximately 245 acres in lake preston where the nz1 plant is going to be built, and we have planned a groundbreaking ceremony for next month to kick off the initial site work phase. we expect to be ordering long lead equipment in the fourth quarter of 2022, we are doing everything we can to stick to our schedule. we're monitoring the supply chain issues and attempting to mitigate any that we find as they arise. nz1 is happening.
i expect this nz1 plant to really quite something. it's going to show the world what's possible. it's going to show that sustainably produced raw materials can be converted into saf with energy-efficient production processes, we can displace the fossil-based energy that's the electricity and the heat sources, get rid of the methane from fossil base, and swap them out with renewable energy and make it all profitable to produce our jet fuel. we continue to evaluate additional plant locations as we map out the path forward beyond net-zero 1, kim has done such a good job selling stuff that we have so many gallons that we've got to really plan these out and get on with it.
remember, we have over 350 million gallons per year of saf to deliver beginning over the next few years and then multiple plants are going to be required to satisfy those contracts. we expect that the take-or-pay or otherwise financial agreements that we have, they will assist us in securing debt and equity for our projects. our team has done a great job, and our customers have done a great job cooperating with us to make sure that it all works. we've discussed previously for future production projects, both greenfield sites and existing ethanol plants, they'll both be likely in the mix for us as we go forward in our build-out strategy.
our focus continues to be on locations with stable, low-cost feedstocks that are ci score advantaged and a large part of the footprint from traditional production facilities comes from, where did you get that electricity, where did you get that gas. it's because you don't want the fossil stuff, you want something else. and so, a large part of our effort is around opportunities to de-fossilize energy sources to drive the production facilities, got to substitute electricity, got to do something about heat sources. and of course, you have to also choose states and local governments that are business-friendly and support the overall goals.
we have been achieving our net-zero 1 development milestones that we identified in our company update in june, and it's happening on our timeline that we had planned. we will begin ordering long lead equipment over the next few months, and we expect to close our dboom contracts for wind power, green hydrogen that we need for the energy sources up at our nz1 plan. in june, we issued shares of common stock in order to strengthen our balance sheet and advance what we believe will be a challenging financial markets over the next two years. now, we can move forward with our nz1 project and begin initial work on nz2, our next big plant without significant capital constraints.
we're already getting organized to put a nz2 plant in place, but i got to say, nothing is going to distract us from executing on nz1. nz1, fid and financial close on the debt component is expected to occur around mid-2023. we'll have already been spending and going to build that plant in advance of that. we expect to have 1 or more equity partners in the project at that time, which preserves gevo capital for the nz program development.
we expect that nz1 will be the cornerstone for our platform of nz projects with debt and equity partners. we met several investors, energy, and financial strategics who see what we're doing and have expressed the interest in investing in our projects. we do explore it and flesh it out still, the combination of our take-or-pay contracts and the proven production technology takes a lot of risk off the table and people are starting to notice. now, i'd like to turn the call over to tim cesarek, our chief commercial officer.
tim has over 30 years of business development and private equity experience with over 15 of those years in renewable fuels, chemicals and energy. tim has been with us at gevo since early 2019, and his team is responsible for building the relationships and growth opportunities that have led to over 350 million gallons per year of saf agreements. i think to get a few words from tim describing the current market environment would be helpful. tim?

thanks, pat. first of all, i'd like to thank all the airline and trading companies that have joined our crusade for their continued confidence in gevo's capability and vision. the importance of sustainable agriculture to the production of both nutrition and ultra-low carbon sustainable aviation fuel, and transportation fuels has been acknowledged by these companies through t`heir multiyear commitments to gevo. we continue to see demand for low-carbon saf exceeding supply for the next decade and beyond by as much as a factor of 12 times.
based on what we're seeing, we believe the saf market size is 10 billion to 30 billion gallons over the next two decades. on the supply side, currently announced saf projects total approximately 2.4 billion gallons globally. gevo's goal of 1 billion gallons of fuel production by 2030 should be easily absorbed by the level of demand that is expected. while not distracting from our ethanol to jet production build-out, it's important to note that we continue to consider ways to progress our isobutanol platform to supply low-carbon renewable gasoline blend stocks and saf.
additionally, both the ethanol to jet and isobutanol platforms can supply chemicals, which is an area of rising interest with our customers. our chemical products have the potential to be significantly carbon negative based on the greet model. the world hasn't seen a drop in products that can drive down ci score like this. it will be exciting to see how the market determines the value of these products.
it's important to note that the ethanol to jet and isobutanol platforms also have operational and product synergies and can optimize our cash cost and product position on the same platform over time. in short, they're complementary, and i anticipate you'll all see more on these efforts in the future. so based on our volume of executed take-or-pay contracts, we have proven the strong demand for saf exists. we continue to secure additional contracts and we'll supply the market for volume beyond 2027.
however, going forward, our team will focus attention on securing partners in the energy transition space, as well as traditional energy companies and strategic financial groups who can help us grow faster. further, we continue to screen and secure greenfield facility builds, and we will also look to partner with existing ethanol producers who are keen to decarbonize where it creates value and accelerates our time for production. finally, i expect our commercial efforts will build off our verity tracking platform, which as you know, is in development. this will help us secure customers, differentiate us and our users who believe in the vision of tracking and counting carbon across every link of the value chain.
now, i'll turn the call over to lynn to comment on the quarter's financial highlights. lynn?
lynn smull -- chief financial officer
thank you, tim. we ended the second quarter of 2022 with a strong liquidity position of $546.8 million in cash, restricted cash and other liquid investments. we realized $139 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and common stock warrants in the june 2022 offering. long-term debt outstanding of $67 million is related to the northwest iowa rng project.
our corporate spend that is sg&a was approximately $6 million for the quarter, net of noncash stock-based compensation. during the second quarter of 2022, we invested approximately $15 million in capital projects comprised of $6 million into our net-zero 1 project, $8 million into the northwest iowa rng project and approximately $1 million into other capital projects. construction on our northwest iowa project is complete and it is being placed into service in q3. depreciation will start flowing through the income statement at that point.
we continue the development and finance efforts around net-zero 1. there is substantial interest from lenders and net-zero 1 project financing. the actual debt structuring and financing efforts will ramp up later this year to drive toward a debt close in 2023 after the project delivery contracts and final costs have been locked in. we're also engaged in discussions around equity partners in net-zero 1 and our net zero program overall.
we'd welcome an equity partner or partners to preserve our development capital for subsequent plants while still giving gevo meaningful permanent project equity positions. and also note that the senate passed draft inflation reduction act of 2022 is a positive development for gevo given both the saf blenders tax credit and the clean fuel production credit for saf or cp -- sorry, cfpc were included for a total of five years. the cfpc would take effect for production in 2025. to qualify for this new tax credit, saf producers must produce fuel with at least a 50% reduction in life cycle greenhouse gas emissions when compared to petroleum jet fuel.
the saf credit has an upside of $1.75 per gallon if a net zero ci score is received. this is all very good for net-zero 1, as we expect our saf will qualify for the cfpc incentive, and we could qualify for as much as a cap to $1.75 a gallon if the epa uses the argon greet 3.0 model as its measurement tool since we plan to be net zero under that model. now, i'll turn the call back to pat. thank you.
patrick gruber -- chief executive officer
thanks, lynn. yes, there's other good things in that bill as well. there are things like the funding for overall greenhouse reduction programs to build out plants and capacity and things like that, plus they fund some of the doe programs and the usda smart agriculture, all those kind of things have potential to benefit us. that's pretty exciting.
thanks, lynn. and operator, now please open up the call for q&a.
