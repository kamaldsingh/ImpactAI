sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
thank you, lindsey. good afternoon, everyone. as we look back at 2020, i see it as a defining year for us. a year ago, we faced a very challenging business environment and global outlook.
despite this, we made important progress that allowed us to stabilize the company for 2021 and positioned us to advance our technology while pursuing strategic alternatives. i would like to start by thanking our employees for their dedication, creativity, innovation and execution. the potential value of this work is just starting to come into focus as the market segment in advanced driver safety and autonomous driving, sees established multinational technology companies, software companies focused on delivering mobility as a service and traditional automotive oems and tier one companies start to invest in and engage in preparation for this emerging market. i would also like to thank our shareholders for their support that allows us to focus on obtaining the right value while exploring strategic alternatives, including a possible sale of the company.
this support has enabled us to have a stronger balance sheet as we continue evaluating our options, while we work to complete our long-range lidar sample, which we expect to be best-in-class. i will expand on this a bit later in this call. stronger balance sheet allows us to add staff that we believe increases the value of our company for potential strategic partners, as well as reduces risk to our 2021 development goals. i expect us to continue adding key staff through 2021 to enhance our ability to demonstrate to the market and potential strategic partners to sustainable strategic advantages of our technology.
first, the ability to deliver a high-performance, long-range lidar sensor that is designed to meet or exceed current oem requirements. and second, scalability of our sensor to support future price targets. over the last 12 months, we also welcomed three new board members to our board of directors with considerable expertise in automotive and augmented reality market segments. i believe adding these new expertise and insight to our current board to augment existing expertise in business, including expertise in mergers and acquisitions, strengthens our ability to create value for our shareholders.
over the past few decades, we have leveraged our strengths to solve some of the toughest technical problems anticipated by multinational oems as they look to new market opportunities using laser beam scanning technology. in our augmented reality, interactive display and consumer data product verticals, we pioneered scalable solutions that we believe were far ahead of global competitors. the impact and value of what we achieved was hard to measure since there were no competitive solutions for these verticals. our automotive lidar product addresses an emerging market segment that has the potential to impact millions of lives in mobility and safety with potentially billions of dollars of sensor and vehicle sales for oems and multinational technology companies over coming decades.
i believe this market demand represents a great opportunity for microvision to showcase our competitive advantage of high-performance and scalability. we expect our long-range lidar sensor to demonstrate what we believe will be the high-performance required for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. this performance is calibrated to meet current oem requirements and would include range of up to 250 meters and beyond, a high-resolution point class with up to 10.8 million points per second from a single return, object velocity relative to ego vehicle from a time-of-flight lidar, low latency, intensity, inertial output and interference immunity from sunlight and other lidars. with such capabilities in our first potential product, we believe a future product could then include a lidar and a camera module combined in a single sensor.
we expect such a future product could reduce the number of sensors required for a vehicle to achieve features for advanced safety and autonomous driving. this improvement in cost per vehicle could support faster adoption. we believe our capability to demonstrate scale is important in this segment. we have successfully demonstrated our solid-state technology to achieve scale over more than a decade.
our custom mems and asics scale from 200-millimeter wafer technology, where we have successfully delivered products for oem programs. our lidar is based on 905-nanometer laser diode technology that is currently available and is the plan of record for anchor technology companies. additional innovations in injection molded freeform plastic optics and multi-axis active alignment automation, automated testing and closed-loop control algorithms, among others, have prepared us to show scalability from our pilot line. as i mentioned in our call last october, regarding our a-sample timing, we expect the hardware for demonstration, along with select benchmark data from our development platform will be available to interested parties in the april time frame, followed by continued benchmarking and testing.
i also expect that a version of our solid-state long-range lidar sensor could be available for sale in small quantities in q3 or q4 this year. our solid-state long-range lidar sensor could enable any interested party to perform testing with our sensor on their moving platforms such as cars and long-haul trucks. this is important because we believe scalability being a key strategic advantage of our technology needs to be demonstrated to help realize value for our shareholders. also, we expect to establish a pilot line with appropriate capacity to demonstrate scalability as we have done over the last decade for multinational technology partners.
let me be specific on this. our capabilities include delivering process maps, control plans, supply chain partnerships, automation and product integrity qualification for high-yield designs that can ramp. we have confidence in our ability to scale our sensor from our pilot line. in addition to our automotive lidar vertical, we believe we remain well positioned in augmented reality interactive display and consumer lidar product verticals for strategic alternatives.
the impact of the global pandemic on consumer devices in these segments is evolving as is clarity about opportunities from oems focused in these markets. in conclusion, we remain committed to exploring strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the company, in part or whole, to maximize value for our shareholders. i believe that our advanced technology and continued dedication of our employees, our vision on products and markets, and strength of our balance sheet, we can deliver a scalable, best-in-class long-range lidar sensor. i am profoundly optimistic about our path forward.
finally, today the company announced that david westgor will retire from my microvision. david has been a key contributor for over 15 years. he is stepping down from his current role but will be available to support the transition to a new general counsel. as he approaches his 68th birthday, he feels, it is time to look to his planned retirement, enjoy the time with family, with the company on a solid path forward.
on behalf of our employees and shareholders, i would like to thank david for his dedication and service to microvision. i will miss our time together and his counsel, and i wish him a wonderful retirement. now, let me turn over the call to steve to discuss the fourth quarter and full-year results. steve?
steve holt -- chief financial officer
thank you, sumit. good afternoon, everyone. before i move on with my prepared remarks, let me just echo sumit's sentiments about david's retirement. i too will miss the daily interaction and wish him the best in retirement.
for the fourth quarter, revenue was $395,000. all the fourth quarter's revenue was royalty revenue and was attributable to our april 2017 customer. in comparison, in the third quarter, we recognized 639,000, 539,000 in royalty revenue and about $100,000 in product revenue. revenue for the full year was 3.1 million, 1.7 million from royalty revenue and 1.3 million in product revenue.
the product revenue was mainly from shipments to our april 2017 customer in q1, before we moved to a royalty model starting on march 1, 2020. as a reminder, i want to point out that royalties that are due to microvision related to our april 2017 customer will be credited against the prepayment made by the customer in 2017. when the prepayment is exhausted, the customer will begin making cash payments for royalties due. at the end of q4, the balance of the prepayment stood at 7.8 million.
as i previously reported, the 7.8 million prepayment is not refundable to the customer, and the 7.8 million is on the balance sheet as a contract liability. during the year ended december 31, 2020, we applied a total of 2 million against the prepayment. royalties have no cost of revenue. so fourth-quarter cost of revenue was zero, resulting in a gross profit of 395,000.
in comparison, gross profit was 639,000 in the prior quarter. operating expenses were 4 million in the fourth quarter, up from 3.5 million in the prior quarter. the increase is due to additional expenses related to our development work on our first-generation lidar sensor and personnel additions we've made to our engineering staff. let me talk a minute for -- about headcount.
a year ago, in february 2020, we reduced our headcount approximately 60% because we were not sure what the future held. while lowering headcount was essential at that time, we've concluded that we need more people to advance our lidar product to a point where it would be easy or ready to scale. additionally, we believe having a more rounded out or complete team makes us more attractive to those who may consider strategic transactions. fortunately, we've been able to rehire some of the employees that we were forced to lay off in february 2020, and we've added some new personnel.
today, our headcount stands at 53. for the fourth quarter, our net loss was 3.6 million or $0.02 per share and this compares to a loss of 2.8 million or $0.02 per share in the prior quarter. in the fourth quarter, cash used in operations was 4.2 million, which compares to cash used in the prior quarter of 3.5 million. we expect that our cash used in operations for q1 2021 will be in the range of 5 to $5.5 million.
the expected increase will be due to continued spending on parts, tooling and contractors to develop the first-generation long-range lidar and the increase in headcount. i'm very pleased to announce that we ended the fourth quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $16.9 million, up from 5 million in the prior quarter. in addition to the 16.9 million cash balance, we raised net proceeds of 61.4 million from 2 atms we completed in january and february of 2021. this puts our balance sheet in the strongest position it has been in for many years.
and based on the december 31 cash balance and the 2021 proceeds from our atms, we anticipate the financial statements that we will be releasing shortly will no longer have a going concern opinion. we are very pleased where the company is today. we will now open the call for questions.

operator
[operator instructions] our first question will come from glenn mattson with ladenburg thalmann.
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
hi. yeah, thanks for taking the question. i have a few -- so just bear with me. so on the -- just quick on -- so on the interactive display, as we're trying to kind of think about what that could be worth as far as to a third-party or strategic buyer or something.
it was about a year ago, thinking back that this time that the large customer that you were potentially working with kind of stepped back from that project. so perhaps could you give us an update on like, has there been any further discussions on new products? has that customer come back? i mean there's a lot of applications where that could be useful, obviously. there's a lot of home speaker companies who would maybe be interested in differentiating themselves. and that product has been available now for a few years, more or less.
i know it's been improved over time, but maybe you can give us some color, sumit, on how much interest there is right now in that part of the business?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think, glenn, that's a good question. but as i mentioned in my remarks, the impacts of global pandemics and what's that done to consumer device demand, that gets stabilized. based on what oem outlook would be.
but at this point, we are well positioned in the three verticals i mentioned on the consumer side. and beyond that, we're not giving any more clarity. but you're right, there's -- as a consumer myself and yourself, we can recognize in our lives, especially in the last year, there's multiple opportunities to have a technology like that, especially when it's a class 1, and it could embed in a lot of different places for a lot of different applications.
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
the april 17 customer on the -- on that display piece, is there -- that's been out for a while now. so maybe can you talk about, are they seeing an uptake in usage or anything? there's a lot more ar/vr stuff going on these days. so can you just give us -- do you have any sense or are you completely separated now that you've -- more of your license partner rather than a solutions provider for them?
steve holt -- chief financial officer
yeah. on the april 2017 customer, we are expecting that royalties in 2021 will increase over 2020. and we're rooting for that product to do well and for it to really be successful. so we do think there will be some increase.
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
ok. and then, moving on to the lidar stuff. so congrats on the progress. nice to know.
i think you said the april time frame, which i assume being that you think you'll have product for shipment late in the back half is like just plus or minus a few weeks, i guess. so i guess, it's clearly -- it's a big market. and sumit, you talked a lot about all the ways that your product differentiates from the numerous other lidar makers out there. but the biggest one i think i heard about was kind of the ability to reduce the number of sensors on a vehicle.
so i'd just like some clarity on that, i think, because it is important, i think. and then, are you suggesting that there would not be a need for any redundancies or that instead of three or four sensors, you can get down to one or two or just -- sensor systems. so maybe you could just kind of clarify or maybe expand on that. i think that's an interesting point.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
that's a great question. it's one of my favorite topics, so i'll try to keep it concise instead of talking too much about it. so i think if you think about these sensors, a lot of them, redundancy is going to be dictated by regulation. a sensor's capability, what will happen over a long period of time with actual miles driven on enough cars for consumers or testing, regulatory bodies like nhtsa, euro ncap, they will decide what's required.
but as you can imagine, for every -- the big business is oem. obviously, a single oem, let's say, shipping 10-plus million vehicles compared to like some shipping only half a million. things are going to change, as we know, but they will decide, which is the most scalable product, long term, accommodate for the regulation requirements, but anybody would want a solution, regardless the regulation requirement, solution, that's the most concise, that gives us the best opportunity possible to ship a product at a competitive price. adoption prices increases, the lower the number of sensor counts.
so i think everybody knows this. if you're just watching the news, cars have radars and ultrasonics and lidars and multiple camera modules, but then there's another bigger proportion of it that is not talked about often, which is called ecu, where all of this is fused together, and that's where the decisions are made based on planning and maneuvering. so if you think about some of the choices we made, some of the hard problems that we chose to solve for multiple years before launching our product. obviously, range is important.
that's a basic. you have to have a bit of range, so we certainly have that. but this high-resolution where something at 250 meters as tall as me probably even shorter than me, significantly shorter than me, you could identify, that is a very compelling thing. so resolution is a very important one.
on top of that, cluster velocity, so you can predict how things are moving in relation to the car you're driving, the ego vehicle, that's very important, again, in the same sensor. this whole point of like 30 hertz are low latency. this is very important because cameras -- camera modules that are in the cars right now, they operate there. so sensor fusion becomes a lot simpler.
unlike if a sensor was at, let's say, five hertz, 10 hertz, 15 hertz, some people would say, oh, it's all the way to 120 hertz. well, we can be there as well. but what we do know is sensor fusion requires a very, very simple computing to merge, simple, relatively speaking, but then you can start seeing pieces come together that make the entire system, including the computing and the sensory required to deliver true l3, l4 features as regulations are written for them. so in general, having a sensor, a lidar with such high-resolution at the latency, which is about the same as a camera module and a computer system that can actually fuse the sensor and perform all the analysis on the fly, that's the path to a scalable product in general.
now, what else stays in there? what other features are there? it's regulation, of course, what oems want to offer, what their differentiation would be. so this is the data all the way back from my time at google and other places. this is the problem that everybody has been looking to solve, is how do you take the number of sensors required to achieve autonomous driving and advanced safety features? and this is the path. so again, this is what i believe is what we believe, and you can see in the market right now, you see different people feeling different, moving platform testing.
and we're excited about having this product available for them to put it on their moving platform and explore this.
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
great. that's great color. so just two questions kind of about the balance sheet. no.
1, i guess, now that you have this big pile of cash, which probably equates to somewhere to the tune of like three to four years at the current burn rate, assuming there are like no revenue coming in the door. is there some part of -- some element of the thought process to maybe go at it alone at this point? like there's less urgency necessarily to find a partner for sure. so just curious about if you're thinking about maintaining yourself as an independent entity with -- now that you have this cash?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
right. so i think consolidation is actually happening in the market, as you know, right? there's more than 100 lidar companies. so that's part of it. so we have to keep that in mind.
and consolidations are horizontal vertical, depending on -- the market by itself is settling. the best solution, the best scalable solution, was most likely going to win. so that's a premise -- we just have to sort of remember. so the concept of strategic alternatives is the most pragmatic way i can describe how one would have to approach this as we think about going forward.
so this concept of as a stand-alone company. i think, for us, we've mentioned on the call, we continued the advance development and expect to have the best-in-class lidar, as we said that. so that positions us for that one key part of the conversation about why this such a differentiated product is. the second piece is also extremely important, which is scalability.
so if you think about all the consolidation, it's going to whittle down to a small group of companies that have the most gravity around their solution. and it's not the one that's got the flash in the pan kind of like what conversation they can have. this has to be the protein and the fiber part of it, where you have actually thought about what problem you want to solve and you're way ahead of everybody. that's the conversation.
so that's how i look at it. so this question about stand-alone company, i think, is a good one. but i think the way to really think about it, consolidation is a point, that is happening. strategic alternatives are there.
we certainly have a pilot line that i think we can ramp to anything that is required on our a sample. b and c sample, i can give a little bit more color on that later, but those are done when they're specifically something an oem that they want to customize and that goes toward their product, so right now, that's not there. so the sustainable one company, i mean, of course, we can go there, but strategic alternatives is how you could think about it, because where the market is in the lidar space. how is anybody can justify all these valuations with the kind of revenue that would have to be a reasonable multiple to that in the future, right glenn?
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
yes. yes.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
so i'm saying that strategic alternatives is the right way to think about it. and we are a stand-alone company right now, while we're up for sale. so i think that's the best way i can answer it.
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
sure. so the last one for me, just the -- so for the third atm that you did, i've never seen one that was announced and then completed inside of like six days. so i understand the first two like we're done, they were a little longer than that, obviously, but they were had to be done, and it was kind of imperative that you got them done quickly to get enough balance sheet power to hold out long enough to do negotiations for sale and everything. but the third one, you weren't necessarily under extreme balance sheet pressure.
now the stock had run-up a lot. so i guess i'm just trying to think about how you feel -- in other words, if you thought the stock had a lot of room to run, you might have taken a longer time because you weren't on any time crunched balance sheet wise to get that done. so just kind of think about just -- if you can just discuss the thoughts about how you executed so quickly.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think the volumes, the time -- after that, were very high in the share trades. and so, we were able to really quite -- be quite patient it didn't take very long to sell-through those -- that amount of shares. but the price was high and the volume was quite high.
so we were able to just take advantage of that. i guess i'd also say that on some of the earlier atms, we were able to clear those in relatively short amount of time too, largely because the volume and the share trading was high and the prices were also good at those times as well, though not as high as on the third one.
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
all right. ok. thanks, steve.
operator
our next question comes from kevin dede with h.c. wainwright.
kevin dede -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
good afternoon gentlemen. thank you very much for hosting the call and taking my questions. i realize that there's a lot of background noise, so i apologize. i'm not sure if you can even hear me at this level.
so let me know that first before i continue.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
we can hear you, kevin.
kevin dede -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
oh, good. ok. so sumit, you mentioned the compatibility with cameras. so can you talk about that? and i mean, i get the whole 30 hertz thing, but i'm wondering how much further you're going to go? are you going to try to continue to work on your module and integrate it with a camera on your own? or do you think you're just going to be able to pass off the lidar technology separately and go with that?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
as if you review the comments i made today, we're focused on our lidar product, but it was trying to draw a future vision of part of the road map for anybody reasonable would be to accommodate that. and what is that benefit to that. so by making this lidar to the level we've done, what is the real benefit, right? that lidar by itself is extremely valuable, right? i mean, i'm always optimistic about the company. a year ago, where we were, people ask, what do you think microvision, where it is, i think that even back then, i said it's worth billions, right? took a year.
so that's what the market valuation is. so if you think about the value of the lidar is where i'm trying to say that what problem has it solved? like how is just lidar another widget that another company is -- another company has a widget, and how do you differentiate? so i'm trying to draw that bigger picture of how important it is to actually solve these problems in these segments? that's point no. 1. so that's how you think about it.
so we're not developing that product. is it part of the current plan? no, absolutely not. i'm just saying that that would be the next one. if a partner comes along and then they want to do something with that, right, that's perfectly fine.
but i wanted just to have -- provide the color so people understand, what's the benefit? when everybody hears about this company x makes half a million units and their ceo doesn't believe in lidar. so i get all sorts of questions all the time. so i've never really brought a point about that. but it's about that lidar will become an integrated item in l3 and l4 safety as you go forward.
but the ultimate solution is the number of sensors that are required to make a car to that level of safety, is too big. so therefore, adoption rates will be low. so therefore, over a longer period of time, if you want to go to higher volume in whatever time frame, i think there's other competitors that have financials out that project years into the future. that's the point i'm trying to bring out is, what solves that? a lidar by itself will not solve it.
it will completely go to the level that's required. it's a very important piece. but you still have a more expensive part, a holistic part of that entire system is also the computing. if you have a five or eight-kilowatt water-cooled computer in the trunk is the only way you can do this autonomous driving, that's not scalable.
people use their trunk for other things. so again, that's where it puts in context where that technology is. so i'm just saying it's a future road map that how to visualize why the problems you solved are extremely important.
kevin dede -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
yeah. no, understood. i think you did a great job making those points clear. sumit, i guess.
i was just sort of thinking of the next step in terms of convenience for your potential future partners or customers. and that's why i thought that -- yes.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yeah, right now, i mean, i just want to be very crisp about that, right? we're focused on our lidar, a-sample, it's exactly what i said. overall for our strategic alternatives, we know what we will have to do, but just because we know ultimate solutions years out because we had experiences, and we have -- fortunate to have some really great board members. that does not mean that we're embarking on that. i think being very crisp about what we're working on and our commitment to strategic alternatives because that just kind of makes sense where the game is right now.
kevin dede -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
fair enough. fair enough. i didn't -- i apologize if you thought i read too much into it. it just seemed like the logical next step.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
no, i apologize kevin, no that's -- my directness was not, i guess -- it's a great question. it's a valid question, right? it's just, i want to make sure that -- lots of people listen in to these calls, right? so it's kind of important that people have clarity of thought of exactly what we're working on, right? introduce that concept is to say, why we would be winning? so if you think about this consolidation happening in the market, if anything else, my comments says, why wouldn't we be one of the final companies? if you solve a key problem and you're extremely valuable, of course, i'm optimistic about this company. hugely optimistic what it could actually enable. so that's why i was just trying to be crisp, but i don't want my optimism to somehow mix in with what our plan.
our plan is exactly what i said. so that's why i wanted to be pretty crisp about that.
kevin dede -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
fair enough. i appreciate the candor. and -- ok. so i know, glenn got a couple of words in on cash burn, but i was on -- was hoping maybe steve could go back to that topic.
what's your expectations for headcount, steve? i think you mentioned 53 total now. where do you think that goes year-end? and how does that change your cash burn?
steve holt -- chief financial officer
well, we haven't given a forecast on where it's going to go. we see that we'll be adding some throughout the year. but just to sort of kind of book end it, i think, it'd be in the realm of 80-ish would be as high as i would think it would be potentially lower, but just it's not ramping tremendously. about a year ago, when we were in february of 2020, i think we were at like 78, 80 people around that time frame.
and you got to remember that cut we made in february was pretty deep. so as far as the cash burn, as far as i'm projecting out right now, or giving guidance on is this 5 million, 5.5 million next quarter. and as you can imagine, there's a fair amount of materials and stuff going into building this product. and then, those spend -- those expenses would come down and then -- so i don't have a long-term forecast, but it wouldn't -- it shouldn't go up too much more.
kevin dede -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
ok. last question for me. can -- i know sumit spent a lot of time on this, too, but can you just kind of go over exactly what will be tangible within the april time frame?
steve holt -- chief financial officer
so we are -- in the april time frame, we'll have the a-sample hardware that can be demonstrated and shown and also, we would have some benchmark data from the a-sample device, as well as from our development platforms that we can share that data as well. so the folks understand what the a-sample is, is capturing and seeing.
kevin dede -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
ok. and then, 3q, 4q --
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
and beyond that , kevin, we'll, of course, benchmarking, testing and further testing just continues, including any other requests that may come back for custom testing so that the work continues after that.
kevin dede -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
of course. of course. understood. and then, 3q, 4q, is that your b-sample?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
no. no. that's a-sample. that's where -- it's up for sale.
so as i said, potentially, if somebody wants to put a piece of hardware on a moving platform testing because obviously, we're not investing in moving platform testing on cars or long-haul trucking, whoever -- however that could be utilized, right? we would have the capability to build that. but it's a pilot line in the sense that it can be ramped. obviously, that's always been our wheelhouse. but we're just being reasonable about what the future would be.
and beyond that, i think we're not giving any more guidance.
kevin dede -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
yeah. yeah. fair enough. appreciate the time, gentlemen -- i'm sorry, steve, go ahead.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
yeah. let me make clear. the demonstration we're doing would be to potential customers or other interested parties. we -- it's not a public demonstration per se, but it's to folks that we're in conversation with.
kevin dede -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
understood. understood. very much appreciated. i think sumit, most everybody that's listening in feels the same way that you do, right? there's a lot of technology, and it has a lot of value.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yeah. yeah. i think this is like a fight for the feature. the last time i remember feeling this kind of excitement was what we call the internet age, right, in the late 90s or the mid-90s, you knew that there was a big revolution that would impact everybody's lives.
so i'm excited. all of us are. thanks, kevin.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
so we're going to go on to some of the questions. we received over 70 questions from investors. many of the questions are variations of the same topic. and most of the questions were addressed in our prepared remarks.
as we did last quarter, we tried to consolidate the questions on the same topic to address the basic issues. we won't be able to answer every question that was submitted, but we will go through several. and so the first question is, sumit, can you provide any more color about your automotive lidar a-sample, the outdoor testing and customer validation and also, will there be a b or c-sample?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
that's a good question. so as i mentioned, a-sample, i think it was back in october, also we gave color on this. a-sample is a specific thing that is a general part that everybody can utilize to evaluate the impact their technology will have on the path they have. so therefore, it's funded by microvision, obviously, and it enables us to address it to every potential interested party.
it's got advanced features in our sensor. they must go through appropriate verification, as you can imagine. so when you say 250 meters, all resolution, you have to demonstrate that. and of course, all the other custom requests that may or may not be there to evaluate for a specific part of it for somebody, confidentially, specifically for them.
so it's a great platform is how you think about it, a-sample. it allows us to -- that's why we say like we have the a-sample hardware, but we also have a development platform. so depending on what's happening, we address that. and that's why that data is, i think a lot of the retail investors ask for, is that data going to be made public? the answer is like, no, because there could be confidential stuff in there.
so no, this is benchmarking data that we provide to interested parties, ok? so outdoor testing is a very important one. obviously, one of the big features here is with our active scan locking that allows us to have a time-of-flight lidar in a 905-nanometer laser, which is pretty unbelievable, in outdoor testing, you have to verify these features. so that is something that is the most basic verification you have to do. today, it's a very beautiful day in seattle, redmond area.
it's bright up to like, what's called 70,000 lux. it's pretty bright day. some of the brightest days that are in all of u.s. is about 100,000 unless you're in death valley, it's about 127,000 lux.
so it's a very bright day. so you have to verify the performance over a wide range of conditions. that's very important. so you have to produce, as you can imagine, a broad body of data with all sorts of things.
all sorts of modifications that somebody may or may not ask for. that's one important thing to remember. so a-sample, again, like we said, there's a time line for the hardware, but then the work starts of getting all this data to get everybody's questions, answered any interested party. and we would probably most likely are going to get asked by interested parties further along to explore capabilities accustomed to them, so this is not something that all of the standard data sheets up.
this is specifically for something of interest to an interested party. that testing has to continue as well. so that's why the period just we embark on a big verification testing and everybody's thirst for data would be done, who's working with us under nda, right? this will be done on the a-sample in the development platform, i've said. so that's important to remember.
and our current focus is the development of a-sample. so there is no b or c sample. b and c sample, the best way to think about them, these are the -- like let's say you go through an rfq with an interested party, like an oem, then that enables somebody to customize their base solution for that interested party. and that customization designed, it could be a full redesign, a partial design, in most cases, a partial redesign and qualification to their standards, whatever they require for their customization.
and those are the b and c samples and then goes toward the oem launch cycle, and it's got its own cadence. so at this moment, i think i want to be pretty clear. our focus is a sample, but it is an actually pretty valuable because you have the precursor to every potential derivative of that that people could consider. so we have platforms which they can actually -- we will be more than happy to accommodate their requests for custom data, and they could -- without any investment or waiting, they could actually see how we would have aligned to their plan, or how we do align to their plan, right? so that's pretty important.
now, we expect this thing -- to launch this pilot line, and that's actually a pretty important step because regardless of what customization happens when a b-sample, the ingredients i mentioned, those are very important. if you can demonstrate them at a-sample, you're significantly more mature and your probability of success for b and c sample increase, of course. so again, this is something that we have to show, something that we to show benchmark data. we have to build confidence.
we have -- we're fortunate that we have a decade-long history doing that. and then, you would embark. so b and c sample, they're on the spectrum, but they are not part of our day-to-day planning right now.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
ok. second question is -- it's related to the $50 million atm that we did in february, what are you spending 50 million on? why do you need so much money? i'll take that question. we're trying to become an important player in the automotive lidar market. and in the automotive lidar market, the staying power of a business is important.
also, we need a balance sheet that gives confidence to others in our ability to execute our plans. we need to have -- be able to give confidence to customers, people perhaps in a strategic transaction, as well as to employees and future employees. and so, that's another reason to have a strong balance sheet to show that confidence. and then it just seemed out of sync to be a 2 to $3 billion market cap company, having such a low cash balance, particularly when you compared it to some of the other public lidar companies.
third question. why are you hiring employees if you're working on a strategic transaction? i'll take this one again. so first, let me just remind you of the significant reduction we had in 2020. that really brought us down to a very low level of staff.
and so, why we need some employee -- hire more employees? well, first, we're working on aggressive timelines to complete the development, improve scalability. and for that work, we need more people and some additional skill sets. second, we want to make sure that we have backups in critical skills and positions. we don't want to be in a place where one person, if they got ill, for example, that one person being out could seriously affect our ability to execute our plan.
and then, thirdly, we need to have an infrastructure in place to support the work that's going on. so we need it. we need people operations. and we need accounting and finance at the appropriate levels to support the business.
so those are all the reasons that we're bringing on some folks. number -- fourth question, was -- can you provide an update on the april 2017 customer? i think glenn asked that question as well. not much more to add in terms of what i mentioned as glenn asked the question, which the customer continues to ship product with our components. they continue to report their shipments and their quarterly royalties.
we expect 2021 royalties are going to increase over 2020. and we're just hopeful and wish that customer a lot of success building up the volumes and sales of their product. the fifth question, we talked about scalability today. why is being able to scale in your product so important? sumit, do you want to take that one?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yeah. so i think i mentioned this also in the q3 earnings call. scalability is important to demonstrate the gravity of business and the product that they have, they would have a future capability of generating revenue and profits. so i think it's important to think about now that for the first time in the 20-year history or even the 20-year history of this company, finally, we are in a market, in market segment where there's other public examples of stand-alone companies they can benchmark against.
there you can see, like you finally have a race where we're not the only ones -- there's no competition over there, ok? so keep that in mind. now, everybody will talk about scaling, but it is pretty clear. oems have a very specific idea of how the long-term market would be. if they cannot win for a sensor that can go multiple years of deployment, they're not going to redesign a sensor every year.
that's not what automotive is. it is slow and steady and reliable. so therefore, it is very important to understand the long-term commercialization and scaling of the choices that we make. so anybody can have the best possible sensor solution.
while i believe that solid-state mems scanning is powerful is because our scanner starts from a 200-millimeter wafer turning to module, controls, electronics, optics and it is able to do that wide scanning. now put that versus a mechanical scanner, you can't negotiate your way down when you have a lot more components and you have mechanical parts. so right off the bat. when you talk about scalability, it's not just the fact that you can go from a small volume and ramp up to a higher one.
that is very important. of course, that's one of the biggest things why you would leverage a mems-based scanner and a 905-nanometer laser system integrated together, with a lot of the features that we have. it's the fact that that is much more competitive. so regardless of where the entire conversation in the market with the folks that we're competing against, that's one of a very big conversation that kind of gets lost in model.
people are so focused on, do you have 251-meter single return, right? yeah. that's check, check, check. but the better question is, how are you going to win this if you know that the customer always looks at commercialization, even harder than consumer. repeat that.
whatever people have in understanding of the consumer market, automotive is significantly more conservative because they need to understand any sensor sales that they would make that oem would make in a car is supportive about 15 to 20 years behind. this premise -- this supports my premise, of course, the consolidation is something we have to keep in mind. it is the way -- the level of investment that's involved, it's probably the path forward for the company, obviously. but also, that scaling part of it, right, if it's demonstrated, you have a high probability of potentially being successful.
otherwise, you can build a story and sell a story, but it's -- for me, personally, it will not jive because if you can't really prove where the scalability is. so it's very important to think about scalability. and we just talked about, what is the asp? and what the margin would be? that's a good conversation. but the conversation for any interested party in the world goes beyond that because they had to understand multiple years.
we said, millions of lives and billions of dollars over decades, so you can understand. that's why scalability is very important, correct? so if you combine all that together, right, you have to really give long-term confidence to hit target price points and margins that they would experience, and that's important. that's the step. so actually, i think, steven and i had a great conversation about this.
steve, do you want to add a couple more things to this?
steve holt -- chief financial officer
yeah. well, i think one of the things, when it's on scalability, we are putting together a pilot line, but just want you to be aware that we're not going to hog wild with some big factory. we're building a pilot line to prove our capabilities and the fact that this product does -- can be made to scale and can go. and the line could ramp up if it was needed, but that's the secondary.
right now, we're focused on the appropriate level to be able to prove and show scalability in the product. ok. i think this is -- the last question we have is -- this question is regarding where we are in the process of seeking strategic alternatives. anything you want to add on that, sumit, in addition to the comments we've already made?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think the point i would start with is just i want people to understand is, it's not a philosophical one, right? it's just common sense, and so you have to be pragmatic about it. with so many companies vying for the rollout volumes that are going to be there in oem, and they're still the biggest game in town, consolidation is going to be part of the conversation always. and then, any reasonable businessperson would say, that has to be on the table at all times.
so that's why we stay committed to it. so there's no ambiguity or reading between the lines, there's nothing to read between the lines. this is as straight as i can say. so i think it is actually forward for strategic alternatives, seeking that, right? that's no.
1. i think to realize the right value for the company, advancing our hardware demonstrating scalability. again, i've hit on that quite a few minutes here, is key given the current competitive landscape. so as you get more people in there, the conversations going in different places, but i tend to want to just stay down like this is -- it is one thing that everybody can tell the story of their company, their products saying you know what, hey, i'm going to win.
we're going to win. we're going to win. but there's another thing that you can see a company and seeing a group of people and seeing a product when you can see the move yourself from the outside investor and say, i think they're going to win because this is how it would piece all together. anybody -- any reasonable person would see.
this is how it would be. there's nothing exotic about it. and that's very important. so i think i can just come out and be pragmatic about it, which is this is where we are and all the variations of the chess game, yes, it's reasonable.
so therefore, strategic alternatives still stay in the forefront of our thinking, right? so it's very important. and again, the current key landscape associated with the market capitalization for potential parties, you can see where everything is very important to focus on the right thing. we continue to advance development of our automotive lidar. and again, as you noticed, is to a-sample, again, be pragmatic about how -- what do you have to enable so you can think through -- you're not promising the moon and under-delivering.
just be reasonable about where everything is headed and spend accordingly. i mean, that's pretty good. and for me, personally, like the process continues, the process is always continuing, but we will not be commenting more on it. i think the question that steve has created here is like a soft reversion of some of the questions, and i appreciate everybody's enthusiasm for the company and trying to understand.
but as we've said before, i assure you, the process continues, but we will not be commenting on any specifics.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
ok. with that that's the last question. sumit, do you want to make any final comments?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yeah. yeah. in closing, i want to once again thank our employees, business partners and our shareholders for their continued support. i look forward to reporting on our progress in the future.
thank you.

thank you, lindsey. good afternoon, everyone. the last 14 months have been incredibly busy and productive at microvision. today, i will cover some of the important achievements from our automotive lidar product development and their potential impacts, our target areas of execution going forward that we believe will increase shareholder value and provide a business update.
first, i want to thank our employees for their continued dedication and execution. multiple times in our company's history, our team has performed exceptionally, and delivered products based on our technology that we believe were far ahead of global competitors. our employees are incredibly smart and talented, and i am continuously humbled by their dedication to make microvision a success. let me start us today by updating you on our first-generation long-range lidar a-sample and the potential impact it could have.
i believe this sensor could offer a much higher level of performance, compared to any lidar currently available or announced in the market. our team successfully completed our a-sample hardware and development platform on schedule. our a-sample hardware, as seen in the pictures shared in the press release earlier this week, is targeted for potential customers, partners, and parties interested in a strategic transaction and can bemounted on top or behind the windshield inside a test vehicle. we designed this hardware to support automotive level moving platform testing from the ground up.
our robust design also allows us to target this hardware for initial sales in the second half of 2021 following completion of internal and external testing. i will elaborate on this a bit later on this call. we expect our sensor to meet or exceed current target oem specifications. microvision's lidar sensor is expected to perform to 250 meters of range.
it is also expected to have an output resolution of 10.8 million points per second from a single return at 30 hertz. lidar companies communicate product resolution in different ways as you may know. i think looking at points per second is the most relevant metric to compare resolution performance of competing lidar sensors. we believe our sensor will have the highest point cloud density for a single-channel sensor on the market.
our sensor has also been designed for immunity to interference from sunlight and other lidar sensors using our proprietary scan locking intellectual property. our sensor will also output axial, lateral, and vertical components of velocity of moving objects in the field of view at 30 hertz. i believe this is a groundbreaking feature that no other lidar technology on the market, ranging from time-of-flight or frequency-modulated-continuous-wave sensors, are currently expected to meet. let me elaborate a bit more about the potential importance of this feature.
the capability of future active safety and autonomous driving solutions to predict the path of all moving objects relative to the ego vehicle at 30 hertz is one of the most important lidar features. this is significant since these active safety systems are tasked with determining and planning for the optimum path for safety. providing a low latency, high-resolution point-cloud at range is an important first step. however, having a detailed understanding of the velocity of moving objects in real-time enables fast and accurate path planning and maneuvering of the vehicle.
sensors from our competitors using, either mechanical or mems-based beam steering time-of-flight technology currently do not provide resolution or velocity approaching the level of our first-generation sensor. additionally, flash-based time-of-flight technology has not demonstratedimmunity to interference from other lidar which is big issue. this potentially limits the effectiveness of these sensors to be considered as candidates for the optimal lidar sensor or as the primary sensor to be considered for active safety and autonomous driving solutions required for 2024-25 oem targets. lidar sensors based on frequency-modulated-continuous-wave technology only provide the axial component of velocity by using doppler effect and have lower resolution due to the length of the period the laser must remain active while scanning.
with the lateral and vertical components of velocity missing, lower accuracy of the velocity data would make predicting the future position of moving objects difficult and create a high level of uncertainty. the core function of active safety hardware and software is to accurately predict what will happen and adjust in advance of a dangerous event. these missing velocity components could potentially mean a larger error in the estimated velocity compared to the actual velocity of objects and predict incorrect positioning. let me share an example.
an ego vehicle moving at 60 miles per hour and a target vehicle moving at 25 miles per hour relative to the ego vehicle, covers approximately 11 meters in a single second. our sensor updates position and velocity 30 times per second, which would enable better predictions at a higher statistical confidence, compared toother sensor technologies. if the target vehicle suddenly starts changing its position relative to the ego vehicle, an active safety system would do a much better job if it had more precise position and velocity data of the target vehicle. this could mean the difference between active emergency braking stopping short of an accident versus a potential collision.
a sensor that can provide an accurate and detailed picture of position, resolution, and velocity ofall objects relative to the ego vehicle at a faster frame rate would enable better active safety systems. delivering safe mobility at the speed of life requires a sensor that is fast in data output, has high resolution so it can classify objects, has appropriate cost for large volume scaling, and provides precise velocity and range of objects to predict what will happen in driving conditionsall of us experience day to day. when evaluating lidar specifications from various sources, it is important to consider the context of actual risks in the driving experience all of us have. i would also like to provide a fuller picture on what our product roadmap could look like and why this is important for our value.
we expect microvision's long-range lidar sensor will have two versions in the future. our first-generation sensor is the first product in this roadmap. a future generation sensor would be a more advanced version and could have the same hardware layout as our first-generation sensor. a future sensor could also include our proprietary software that would provide features needed for a stand-alone sensor used for active safety applications.
i want to expand a bit on the importance of this future product and the value this could represent to our shareholders. having what i believe to be the best-in-class first generation sensor gives us a huge step up against competition. it also provides our very capable team with a hardware platform to further increase value for potential partners and our shareholders. in the short-term, i expect our team to continue focusing on internal and external validation of our first-generation lidar sensor and any potential confidential evaluation from customers or partners.
in the long-term, i believe a future sensor could provide features like active emergency braking, active emergency steering, pedestrian active emergency braking, and active lane keep, among a longer list of higher level adas features with microvision software running on our edge computing. i believe a lidar sensor with embedded software that does not require massive amount of external computing will ultimately reduce cost of systems for oems, thus potentially accelerating adoption of vehicles with autonomous driving and active safety systems. i expect that key features in our firstgeneration sensor like highest resolution, full velocity components, immunity to sunlight and other lidar could allow an incredible opportunity for us to add significant value with our software for a greater sustainable strategic advantage. i believe future products built with our software, sensor performance, edge computing, and scalability, would be valuable to oems, tier 1 automotive suppliers, companies that are focused on mobility as a service, and therefore, of value to our shareholders.
as we remain focused on exploring all potential opportunities to increase value of our company,a portion of our team will continue building toward this roadmap. i look forward to reporting on our progress. another major advantage of our technology is its capability to demonstrate scalability. to demonstrate this, we successfully developed and installed our long-range lidar sensor pilot line in redmond.
this pilot line is sophisticated. it includes six custom active alignment stations that our team developed working with our automation partners to enable scalability and performance. our team has launched multiple pilot lines in the past for ourdisplay, augmented reality, and interactive display products. i am very proud of our team's ability to apply their expertise and complete this pilot line on time given the challenges with a pandemic.
this pilot line will allow us to validate designs and manufacturing processes in house in faster cycles. we expect limited quantities produced from this line will support exploring potential partnerships. this pilot line will also enable us to take our designs, process maps and control plans, and launch a new highly automated production line to support expected initial sales inventory in the second half of 2021 through a contract manufacturer. this future production line in asia will eventually have the capacity to produce between 12,000 to 15,000 sensors per year starting sometime in 2022.
the purpose of this second line is to show the next level of scaling. the ultimate capacity of this production line can be adjusted to meet volumes as required prior to mass production in the 2024 to 2025 timeframe. we continue to work to mitigate risks to our plan due to covid and other supply limitations. a key element to show scalability of our technology comes from being able to scale our highly reliable and cost-effective solid-state beam steering system for automotive use.
this month, we launched our fifth-generation mems to a 200-millimeter wafer size with our mems fab partner. this is of course not a new effort for us. we have launched our mems to scale in the past with our third-generation that were used in a sony product and our fourth-generation mems that was part of our april 2017 contract and are currently in production. advancing our fifth-generation mems to the fab is a big step for this program that will allow us to demonstrate to potential partners our capability to meet future price targets.
i am extremely proud of our team to have achieved this key objective with all the challenges faced through 2020. i would be remiss if i did not mention that our long-range lidar sensor is and developed internally from our proprietary mems based laser beam scanning technology. this intellectual property has been developed and proven in various programs for more than two decades. our differentiated sensor is built on a large body of intellectual property, including more than 400 patents. i believe this provides us with a competitive moat in hardware and software for years to come and a very important sustainable strategic advantage.
i would now like to briefly update you on our exploration of strategic alternatives. i believe, our technology and products are at inflection point in multiple verticals. i want to emphasize that the company remains committed to exploring all strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. in october 2020, we set the objective to complete our lidar product and said having hardware that can be productized would be an important step for evaluation by potential interested parties.
we completed that objective in april as planned and are prepared to support any potential evaluation of our technology and capability to scale. as i shared earlier today, i believe our sensor technology is differentiated by features that will potentially be recognized as disruptive in the market. i have shared with you that i believe consolidation in this space will continue and signs of this are starting to become public. i believe microvision needs to continuously build value with our products, roadmaps, and partnerships, while also exploring strategic alternatives.
given the continued consolidation in the market, i believe this is a pragmatic approach as we seek to maximize shareholder value. i want to emphasize our primary focus will remain continued validation of our first generation lidar sensor and support any customized evaluation data from potential partners. finally, we ended the first quarter with $75.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. as steve will share, our cash requirement and plan for growth are under control providing a sustainable runway.
this allows us to explore all our options from a much stronger position to maximize shareholder value. i sincerely believe our company now is in one of the strongest positions in our history to be successful. we are in a solid financial position and potentially have a disruptive new product in a market segment expected to have global impacts. the work required on the road ahead is hard.
i am truly energized everyday as i think about our future and remain profoundly optimistic in our path. now let me turn the call over to steve to discuss the first-quarter's results. steve?
steve holt -- chief financial officer
thank you, sumit. good afternoon, everyone. for the first quarter, revenue was $479,000, a 21% increase over last quarter's revenue of $395,000. all of the first quarter's revenue was royalty revenue and attributable to our april 2017 customer.
we're pleased to see an increase in royalties over the fourth quarter and look forward to our customer's continued success with sales of their product. as i have pointed out before, royalties related to our april 2017 customer will be credited against the non-refundable prepayment the customer made in 2017. once the prepayment is exhausted, the customer will begin making cash payments for royalties due. at the end of q1, the balance of the prepayment stood at $7.3 million dollars.
the $7.3 million is on the balance sheet as a contract liability. our first-quarter cost of revenue included a $5,000 credit related to the reversal of a warranty accrual. the result is a first-quarter gross profit of $484,000. in comparison, gross profit was $395,000 in the prior quarter. operating expenses were $6.7 million in the first quarter, up from $4 million in the prior quarter.
in the first quarter, we put in place an employee incentive plan to retain and motivate our team. the expense recognition for this incentive plan increased our operating expenses by approximately $1.2 million in the first quarter. total non-cash compensation for the quarter was $1.6 million. this expense was a non-cash item.
other causes for the increase were the company's portion of payroll taxes on employee stock option exercises and vesting rsu awards. there was also increased spending on labor and benefits due to an increase in headcount, and an increase in materials and subcontractors for the development of our first-generation lidar sensor. our headcount at the end of march was 57, up from 47 at the end of december. for the first quarter, our net loss was $6.2 million or $0.04 cents per share. this compares to a loss of $3.6 million or $0.02 cents per share in the prior quarter.
for the first quarter, cash used in operations was $4.5 million, which compares to cash used in the prior quarter of $4.2 million. again, the non-cash compensation i referenced a minute ago was the primary factor causing the cash usage to be so much lower than operating expenses. cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter was $75.3 million, up from $16.9 million at the end of the prior quarter. the increase was the result the proceeds we raised from two atms which we discussed on our last earnings call and that were completed in the first quarter.
i'd like to now turn to the second quarter and give some thoughts on our spending and cash usage as we move forward through this year. i expect an increase in operating expenses in the second quarter. as i mentioned earlier, we initiated an incentive program that uses equity to retain and motivate team members. those programs will continue through this year, and the expense recognized in q2 will be similar to the $1.2 million recognized in q1.
i then expect the expense related to that program to decrease to about $1 million in q3 and $800,000 in q4. additionally, in april the company signed a three-year employment contract with sumit as ceo. the agreement eliminates any cash bonuses and instead primarily uses equity for ceo compensation.the agreement was designed to align ceo compensation with long-term shareholder interests. the agreement grants sumit 1.2 million shares over three years and will likely generate non-cash compensation expense of approximately $7.5 million this year.
about $5.3 million will be recognized in q2, and then about $1.1 million in q3 and $1.1 million in q4. again, this expense is a non-cash item. as for cash expenses, we expect we will continue to add headcount at the pace of around 10 to 12 people per quarter for the remainder of the year, primarily in our engineering organization as we further advance our first-generation long-range lidar sensor and prepare to start production. additionally, we expect to backfill some of the support positions that were eliminated in our february 2020 headcount reduction. taking those items in to consideration, along with other spending, we see q2 operating expense in the $13 million to $14 million range.
given that much of the increase is in non-cash compensation, we expect cash used in operations to be in the $5 million to $5.5 million range, up $500,000 to $1 million from the $4.5million used in q1. additionally, you may have heard about tightness in the supply of silicon chips. to mitigate risk of supply shortages, we have ordered inventory for some long lead-time components that are expected to arrive in q3, but if they should arrive before the end of q2, we could see another $1 to $2 million of cash used in operations in q2. as sumit said earlier, development is progressing well and to ensure the supply of components needed to meet our plans, we concluded it was prudent to place orders for those long-lead time components.
before we open the call up to questions, let me add my appreciation for our engineering and g&a teams. the engineering team, just days ago, completed the a-sample hardware and development platform on schedule. this feat was something that some said they couldn't do, much less do on schedule. they were supported by a top-notch team in our g&a areas that were able to support the engineering effort and also maintain the public company compliance and controls that are so necessary to our success.
we are very fortunate to have some many outstanding people working at microvision. with that, we will now open the call for the questions.

[operator instructions] our first question today will come from glenn mattson with ladenburg thalmann. please go ahead.
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking the questions. congratulations on getting the a-sample out for the lidar product. so you know, you set a milestone and you hit it and that was a terrific work. i guess then people start thinking about what the next milestone is and you've kind of hinted multiple times that there'll be product available for shipment in 3q or 4q.
so you know, i guess, is your expectation that you would have multiple shipments by then? if so, when would the timing be? like, would you be able to announce them? maybe not announce to the customers, but that you know, similar to the april 17th contract that you got a customer or two or three and oem that's sampling the equipment. any thoughts on the kind of roadmap for the news flow over the rest of the year on that -- on that front?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
that's a good question, glenn. so i think the way i think about it is, i think steve and i have both mentioned that these are initial quantities. so we're looking at a couple of hundred and think about them in terms of more like direct sales, if somebody wants to buy and do moving platform testing and they need sensors for their fleet or whatever, a range of options that come through us, right, and there's lots of companies out there. i'm not only available publicly because at that point, it's been validated by us and external parties, and it would be something we would offer to buy.
but i think sending out its initial quantity part is an important point to remember.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
i think what we said was we're working to get the production line up in q3, q4 timeframe. we'll be doing our internal and external verification reliability testing, compliance testing, and be -- and then plan to sell those initial quantities in the later part of the year. so that's that's sort of what our thinking is for this year in terms of getting the product out there and for sale.
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
ok.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
if you think about our april 2017 customer, right? we -- that contract's going into production. therefore, we always have the very proof concept that we are in that space and we are driving past the automotive parts. in the automotive lidar, creating reputation for a long time is important. so therefore, this line objective shows scalability is very important actually.
and i think i mentioned this last call as well that it's equally as important technology and we are actually in very good position for that.
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
right. in the past, you've said that getting the product completed would kind of derisk the story potentially for potential acquirers and you kind of talked about that a little bit in your prepared remarks. but i wonder was there kind of a lull in negotiations while people waited for you to finish this and we expect now that it would pick back up? or just any color or their clarity on that would be great.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think we are clear that having the ability to prove what we were trying to -- what we were saying we could do was critical in progressing things along. and so you know, i totally can't comment on the process further than that.
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
ok. thanks. and the april 17th customer, there was a large technology company that won and is a very large dod contract in the last six weeks or so. you know, i guess can you, whether or not you can comment on anything about that, or how it would affect you if it's related? i imagine you can't comment, but i thought i'd ask.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yeah, yeah, we can't -- we can't comment on that glenn, sorry.
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
ok. sure. and so -- and just, steve, on that expenses for the components that note because that's the only kind of cash the major part -- most of this is non-cash related to the stock comp stuff, but the $1 million to $2 million you said it could come in q2. but if it comes in a little early, thte $1 million to $2 million and otherwise, i guess, that would come in q3 until make --
steve holt -- chief financial officer
yeah. the target -- i guess, i'm trying to say, we're thinking the q2 cash used in operations would be in that $5 million, $5.5 million range. but i want to say there could be $1 million to $2 million of inventory, should it arrive early that would be a good thing i guess. but you know, inventory purchases go to cash used in operations and so i just want to put that out there as a caution that if it arrives on the certain quarter, one day versus the next, it could be $1 million to $2 million, depending on how many units arrive.
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
sure. ok. great. that's it for me.
thanks and congrats again.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
thanks, mike.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
our next question will come from kevin dede with h.c. wainwright. please go ahead.
kevin dede -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
good afternoon, gentlemen. thanks so much for taking my questions. steve, you mentioned headcount going from 47 to 57 the end of the quarter and summit you mentioned, i guess, development -- software development for generation, the second generation. i'm kind of wondering how you're teeing up headcount to address the challenges you might find in that -- with that initiative.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
i think that's in the numbers that steve gave last time how you'd end up the year. i think, we work very closely that's accounted for. so there's no changes in what -- i gave a little more detail today of what's value, right, how you think about step by step. but i think, we've -- everything we've said is, it's already accounted for in there.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
yeah. i said today, kevin, we're looking at 10 to 12 people a core. this is probably the pace we would see this year.
kevin dede -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
ok. yeah. you spoke -- though you addressed support staff and i guess, i was just wondering what you were going to have to do on the software development side.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yeah. we'll be having people in the engineering team, in production areas, and support staff, and that's all of those areas in that 10 to 12 people per core.
kevin dede -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
yeah. got it. got it. thanks.
ok. thanks. can you help me sort of put valuation in perspective, gentlemen? at what -- almost $2.9 billion market cap and maybe a 20% premium. i'm wondering how you think that might size up against alternatives.
i know you spoke to some -- that you spoke to frequency modulation and i'm just wondering how you guys look at that.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yeah. i'm not going to comment on valuation obviously, but i mean, just think about it. i think that we said -- we talked about a lot of detail in the call today specifically. you have a disruptive product that's able to do something that the final application needs and there is a spectrum of technology and companies out there.
their solution is to [inaudible] regardless of what the comparative valuation is, i'll let the market decide that. our job is only control. we take our technology and make sure people understand the value of it, as deep as they want to go, as broad as they want to go and impact it's going to have. numbers like you're saying, right, i think it's all relative.
and then of course, i'm very optimistic about the company. i think there is room to grow, i always do. but you know, it's something that it's important for everybody to get to see, why it took so much time to talk about the innovation, why it's so valuable. you haven't just offered product in a hot market, excuse me, that's hard to pin down, right?
kevin dede -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
yeah. absolutely, that's why i asked for your view. thank you for taking that --
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
no, no, you know i mean --
kevin dede -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
sumit --
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
it'll go up and down and our moods are based on what happens. it's really knowing like what we have is disruptive and that's the point we have to make. that's it.
kevin dede -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
ok. fair enough. thank you. could you help me understand the oem, the auto oem's qualification cycle and maybe the time involved? just so i might be able to compare that against your, i guess, time to development.
your -- because you suggested, i guess, full manufacturing in the '24 or '25 timeframe at volume.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
what i said was our production --
kevin dede -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
i understand how long it takes them to yeah --
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
so our production lines that can make a-sample which is a first step, except this a-sample design will go through reliability and other things and it could be available for direct sales or anybody obviously. beyond that, the real answer to your question is, that if let's say an oem was interested in something, you have stages, a-sample, b-sample and so on, which is their development cycle. so whenever i make sourcing decision i take that step by step. there are always in the market standard features that everybody is aware of and it's standards qualification of what [inaudible] wants and what [inaudible] those are standards.
but then, oems, each oems because they're competing in the same market each other, they have their own confidential things behind that. so you just -- it's a hard question to answer, but the point is, those phases is what they take out. they look at the maturity the technology, they look at the maturity of the company, they look at the maturity of the supply chain. it's a safety-critical device that's going to have a 15-year tail.
they want to make sure they can support it for that long, so those are all the things that goes into it. so as far as the qualification, once they have a target in '24 or '25 model years, let's backtrack and it's pretty well known what the decision will be and how you would go and how they're being valued. so the production line, the way to think about it is, it's a demonstration obviously. there's nobody in the world that can actually demonstrate that level of scalability.
you know the whole concept of, excuse me, the perfect lidar, i'm using bunny ears on the phone here. the perfect lidar is not just about the features. it's also about scalability, long-term cost, reliability, proving all of those things and this production line will just let us allow it to show off what we've done all the time. you know, i wanted to emphasize over 20 years.
it's not the first time we've done this, we've done this multiple times successfully. so i think we're in a good position to demonstrate that, but really, that schedule is controlled by the individual oems. there's no general steps, except what's generally known that there's after a bcm so on sample to mass production or certain production.
kevin dede -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
ok. well, i speak for myself and i'm sure glenn follows into this as well. you know, we've been around through a bunch of those cycles, sumit. so we understand it.
i guess, it was just on the production side, right? it's just kind of hard to fit where you are and how that folds into what actually goes into a finished, complete vehicle. because i mean, as i understand it, there's a -- there's certainly the oem qualification and there's the intermediary and i was just trying to make sure that i had a rough idea of how to think about it.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
all right. so the thing is, to think about a-sample product, obviously, it's not an fpga, right. to make an [inaudible] that the timelines are known, so those are all compounded in. and obviously, for us from a timeline standpoint, those milestones are probably more important because that's the biggest cost reduction right there, is a [inaudible].
so some of the features that may be in a application processor like velocity for our first-generation product and are putting in our associate reducing cost, we have a lot more flexibility for that. so as far as you're thinking about, like you know, timelines for that, the first thing is, the tier 1, as any company, i'm not going to use microvision as an example, any company and that's really going to be providing. are they going to be a tier 2 supplier or licensing to somebody else? those are things that have to be figured out with the oem. so the question is hard to answer because of that, but scaling of our technology, the timeline, and whoever does it have to do it or somebody else has to do it.
those are the ones that have to be checked out first and then a decision on how to commercially do it, right. so there are two separate things, but the milestones are kind of set. any design that would have an fpga needs analog and there's soc in our case. what level of application software is in there.
we do something very unique or we are endeavoring to put it all in soc and not have to require a huge amount of computing. that's actually very important and we have a line of sight to that. so just demonstrating that as the steps ahead or even if it will be required for something like that.
kevin dede -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
thank you so much for the -- ok. yeah. well, thanks. thank you very much for the color.
in the -- in an ultimate on the road test platform, how many sensors the microvision type would you suspect any one vehicle would need?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
so let's talk about it in general. so you see a lot of numbers in tam, the softwares, there are a lot of things mixed in, but if any of us are going to have these cars, it has to be affordable. you can't have them [inaudible] in the sensors, but you definitely want to have more than one, right. because it's up to five sensors, one can imagine, but there are a combination of heavy pilot versus traffic jam pilot versus parking, depending on the feature.
recently, i read that gm said that it had 30 models targeted for ed and four or five year timeframe for example. how many of them are going to have these features? those are things are going to become clear as any company moves to this, but there's just a handful of sensors required to get to those higher level of sensors. now if a car needs forward collision warning and active lane keep for example, our lidar sensor, obviously, has higher level required, but have the added benefit off to other fields of view. so it gets resolution at range, it's very unique in that sense.
but if a rear warning is required and there will be another one, so it really depends upon the kind of features that they're offering in those vehicles, on those targeted vehicles. so a general answer is, a long-range lidar which is the fourth one, which is going to be the real active safety that's required and then there's other potentially flash bays or some other kind of lighter or sensors required for lower-speed maneuvering that work in concert or that work individually. but certainly, can be more than one, let's be honest because getting as much awareness as possible of your surroundings in these vehicles, would be very important for the first-generation product. so it's unclear at this point that all of us have the same marking data that's available and that's wide ranges of numbers in there and they all account for different numbers of sensors required.
yeah, but in general, right, definitely more than one.
kevin dede -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
ok. thank you, sumit. thank you very much. thanks for taking my questions.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
thanks, kevin.
operator
our next question will come from tay bordner, who is a private investor. please go head.
unknown speaker -- private investor
yeah. hi, can you guys hear me?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yeah.
unknown speaker -- private investor
ok. hey, congratulations on -- to you and the whole team on all the progress made over the last 14 months. i got a quick question for steve and then i've got another question. steve, last year you guys had to declare publicly in one of your sec documents, an estimate for the 2017 royalty customer.
do you have to do that again this year?
steve holt -- chief financial officer
yeah. yeah. you're talking about under afc66, the revenue guidance.
unknown speaker -- private investor
yeah.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
you project out what your deferred revenue and contract liability recognition is going to be for the current year and that's in our 10-k that we filed back in march, $3.2 million and it'll be in the q when we file that.
unknown speaker -- private investor
ok. great. i must have missed that. sorry aout that.
ok, thanks. right. right, kind of reading the footnotes. i got a question on the software.
actually, i've maybe two questions on the software. i mean, sumit, you've spoke about the development platform which i assume is a software platform. is that -- is that a platform that is going to -- is used to collect, analyze, slice and dice the data that's received from hardware? or is it a software platform that actually allows the hardware to be configured based on maybe different types of fov or resolution type stuff like that or is it both?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
both, it's a developer platform because the sample, anything you want to put on there, you want to have someplace that you can test it out, put it on. and of course, our a-sample that's on path, potentially if anybody wants to do something unique that they know -- they want to test for themselves. we would not upset our path of our a-sample because there's a group of people that potentially might be wanting to look at that. so our hardware platform that i'm talking about, software hardware platform is -- we would do that.
so it could be -- it depends, you know, i mean it's flexibility. that gives us the flexibility of what is the right place to provide what's needed, right. if anybody ask any potential person interested in options and unique, that flexibility would be there.
unknown speaker -- private investor
ok.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
we certainly don't want to take like somebody who's obsessed with the entire thing. you know there was more than one people, right, so it gives our team more flexibility.
unknown speaker -- private investor
right, it makes total sense. makes total sense, right. lets you be a little bit nimble. and then regarding the software comments you made today for the potential next generation, future generation.
i mean i guess, i heard that the -- i view that more as embedded software. that's sort of just completely integrated with the hardware and the software to do a bunch of work that would have to be done outside, meaning higher latency probably and maybe not as efficient. is that what you're referring to there when you talk about that kind of software and the potential future version?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
that is correct. so we've always focused ourselves on -- first of all, we don't do anything [inaudible] products. so i think most of the investors when they listen to other competing companies, everybody talks about quote unquote software. so we're very specific and consistent in what we've always said.
we make a hardware, our hardware and anything would be at the edge computing level alone. so there's companies out there, that of course, there are mobility companies out there that have significant software suites. they're doing another level of automation, much higher, level five, high level, level four, let's say. that's a different market.
the big market and tam is a level three, that's where most of the cars are going to be. having something that a better software that works easy, without requiring massive computing like five or eight-kilowatt waterproof computer, that's not reasonable. those are ok for development cars, moving platform for development cars, but computers are like very expensive. you cannot imagine a real car ever having them.
so if a lidar sensor have high enough resolution, fast enough frame rate, and can process lots of data which our sensor can, our sensor has somewhere between 1.5 to 2 gigabits per second, it's a massive pipeline of data. it processes that at edge that allows you to somehow show the feature validation independently, then you can actually be considered potentially for a primary sensor. right now, nobody can save any sense of refinery or not. so that software that i described today, it is actually a big important part of the story.
now, we have our first generation, i want to be clear, we call it the first generation that it is a product, a piece of hardware and i call it a future generation without getting a number because it's on the roadmap. it's showing what the value is and every one of these things don't have to be turned over. if you want to really know what the value of it is, what they impact is, what disruption you've actually caused, you have to turn over and you have to show people what's possible with technology and leverage and what it does. now, if somebody had a path of that future costs of that full sensor, suite, or that system could be reduced, i mean, one could project that potentially adoption to these because you have more affordable solutions.
unkonwn speaker -- private investor
so, ultimately --
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
actually be part of that conversation and let them know what we have actually can do.
unknown speaker -- private investor
sure. so ultimately, that -- you know, your painting a picture and telling a story about how microvision could provide that software. and ultimately, that is just really to reduce the cost of the overall system solution, it sounds like to me, and more efficient as well.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
well, again, let me just go a little bit higher for us, right. there's lots of lidar companies out there, and i think on the last call i talked about consolidation is common sense and you're not going to have massive -- two hands of lidar companies, automotive, they will condense down and everybody wants to know who's going to be at the final table. is is going to be specs, is it going to be scalability, right. you can imagine that all the valuations saying, whoever is going to win is going to win big.
these revenues are multiple years out, why do valuations valid? because people are making the bet, maybe they're making the bet potentially, who's going to be at the final table, who's going to win, right? so you want a sell component of why you have something that projected out that far has a very serious chance of being a contender. and so david and steve today and we're just going back and talk about airbags. i think when airbags came out in the early days, same exact thing. but when they became regulation, there's only a handful of companies that were there in the world that were supplying all the airbags.
so, yes, you want to show that it is much more high tech compared to airbags as far as what this will be required to do. so it's in our best interest to make sure that people understand, not just the high resolution and you know those specs, it's beyond that because that data stream, but what do you do with it? you put in the software and you work something that you can actually do something actionable. and you know, there's lots of little testing and of videos on youtube i'll let you guys find that out. just go take a look at it right and they show you actual accident situations, how fast they happen.
just imagine a computer has to do it faster than the human that was driving that. interesting videos and i love watching it because it kind of blows your mind. it kind of puts in perspective for me. why it's important, why like all the things that our team is driving for, i mean some of the best people light our work, in microvision now.
there's been some real good work. so that's the -- that's the top down answer i can give you is, it's really about the consolidation, how we converge and you can think about our software is a meaningful part because ultimately, that overall system have these.
unknown speaker -- private investor
ok. great. thanks. final question, can you tell us how many entities have requested the a-samples? is that a fair question?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
we're not going to comment on that.
unknown speaker -- private investor
all right. thank you very much.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
our next question will come from jim cronica, who is a private investor. please go ahead.
unknown speaker -- private investor
thank you for taking the question. my question is, how if the -- a buyer or a partner has an automotive company, as one of its members of its group, and you want to work with them and then the second group comes in -- i'm thinking of like microsoft have decided they want to go in the lidar business and they're going to work with gm. the second group could be google and interest from ford because they had somebody on the board that used to work there. is your lidar going to be constricted because of that slightly premium relationship with the one partner.
is it going to be a slick restricted to a single automotive manufacturer? or will you still be able to do business with many more auto manufacturers?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
let's let's take that question generic, right. because i think it's a very speculative and lot of things you're asking about. let's make it generic and i'd like to borrow your name.
unknown speaker -- private investor
fine.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
i think, let's say there is, oem 1, oem 2, right, i think as i say general some pockets of people that may be interested or they want to evaluate it. the benefit we have is, everything we have is homegrown, proprietary to us. we've grown this all from ourselves. we own it all.
so it it gets acquired, the company will own it. and then it's of course, you need to [inaudible] that person, right, and our job is you've got to imagine what it is right now. but in the case that if somebody or multiple people want a partner, there's no restriction. it's all on -- it's what value will be.
there's no restriction to one person, either because when takata sell the airbag or maybe it's not a good example because the takata is no longer around, but even a company sells an airbag to oem a and then, not to put it aside to oem b, it's not commercialization they want to scale globally. so i think that's -- that's specific case, think about it and we never talk about oems general specifications of any of the product vertical, nobody talks about that. in automotive, some generic ones they made public. so, yeah, we can comment on that, but they keep some secret, right.
so this is a unique industry. so i think, think about it. you are a company, you have to roll it out, and it depends on what the commercial options available there, but there's no restriction to us. we own everything.
unknown speaker -- private investor
but you could be making a restriction in who you ultimately decide to partner with if they -- if they are the best buyer.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
it's really hard to speculate on because i mean to comment on because it would be speculative as what anything would be, who knows. but i mean, the fact is, it's all ours and you have to give them a compelling reason why this is going to be a paradigm shift for them. that's about all we can probably say. so i think, like, you know, you're trying to draw conclusions.
i'm just saying, it's impossible to even get to that point because there's various scenarios. clearly, everybody wants the best economy of scale obviously, right. and ultimately, what combination that may be or may not be, it's impossible to comment on. i think i'm going to give a very honest answer actually.
it's because i don't know. i don't have a crystal ball to say what people think. but if there is like, there's two companies, if it's our product, we can trade with anybody, of course. if we don't like it then -- we own it all, right.
we choose who we work with, right. we will sell to any oem that or any consumer or any pocket of customers that feels confident that this is what they want. absolutely.
unknown speaker -- private investor
ok. great. terrific job by the way for all -- for all of you. i appreciate it.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question will come from adam jones who is a private investor. please go ahead.
unknown speaker -- private investor
hey, sumit, it looks like you're moving from successful development to marketing now, sales and marketing. and a lot of that was laid out in a recent job post for a brand marketing manager. i'm wondering about a couple of points in that. maybe you can illuminate one of those points was about bringing the brand and product story to life for customers, investors, employees.
i'm wondering how you see that story, how you see it unfolding, and what kind of roi you expect it to generate.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
i think i'm going to step back and put it into perspective. we've received a fair amount of questions about this. if you think about it, we have -- we have lots communication to be done with a new product, new market. it would behoove us to know that the value to the shareholders, obviously, because you want to make sure that everybody has a fair understanding of the impact that we have created here.
so i think like one provision there. i don't think it's that big of a deal because it helps us make sure that people know the right story. you know, it's not kind of organically grow into it. so it's kind important that that's done.
you know, communicating with investors and investors have something, right. i mean, you know, we have a small team here. we can't ever -- we can't have, i think, sort of you said like maybe you want more and understand more about the technology side of things, right. and it's not marketing in general, if you think about it, i think one thing you said that's what i am saying we're here to.
we're not getting into marketing, it's just part of a normal company building value. if you got something valuable, if you don't get the message out, how do you know that you have enough value on the table and i don't know any other way, right. people need to understand what this is and i can describe you my enthusiasm, right. but it takes more than that to tell the real stories, step by step to understand how to solve it.
so i can talk about the concepts and what the business impact is, but it takes a lot more than that. and i think to be fair, we've gotten many questions from our retail investor base, wide range of them, and said yeah, that would be nice to to do it, except we can't have that with the resources we had so far. so i think that's a -- i think that's just part of the value that you have to create when you have something valuable. and you know, i think a role of that person to help you tell the story, i think it's beneficial for the company, right.
unknown speaker -- private investor
that's really my only question.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
go ahead, steve, sorry.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
yeah. that role do corporate communications, company presentations, website or things like that. so those are all that role is going to do.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
and as a [inaudible] of this company, where your website's updating takes too long, right? so, we're a tech company, right, and we have to act like a tech company. so we're just aligning to what is expected.
unknown speaker -- private investor
so -- but in terms of marketing or working with potential customers that i believe it was in the 10-k you mentioned that that's the executive management team. is that still the case? are you guys making those inroads directly?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yes. well, this is where, if there is expos what we go through. there's a bunch of what we've done to have a floor show. steve and i can't do that.
i mean, i just mean --
unknown speaker -- private investor
yeah. i know that.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
but you have to get there. you have to have get your sensor out there. if you end going to see us. you know, any expos that you go to, just imagine.
there's a bunch of work to be done and presented to the market. so we always are excited to come visit us and we always welcome you so long as yoiu have a good experience because this is something new.
unknown speaker -- private investor
i guess so, maybe i was just getting hung up a little bit on the semantics with them. that you have it, where it talks about customers or senior stakeholders, and maybe some other differentiations you make in terms of who does what within the realm of the business.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yeah, maybe so, maybe so.
unknown speaker -- private investor
ok. congrats on reaching a successful milestone this april.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
thank you.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
thank you.
unknown speaker -- private investor
you're welcome.
operator
our next question will come from gio [inaudible] who is a private investor. please go ahead. gio, your line maybe muted.
unknown speaker -- private investor
sorry about that. yeah, i was muted there. good afternoon, gentlemen. sumit, i was looking at the pictures that the the lidar unit yesterday and the one with the cover of -- there was a lot of talk sort of among various shareholders that that's a very asic and we're wondering if, is that something that was a proprietary design of microvision? or did you go to someone else and use their part or partner with someone else in designing that? could you give us a little bit of color about the internals of that thing?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yeah. so it's got the analog and analog side, obviously, that drive all the analog side of it. the mems and the asic and then there is our fpga-based, you know, where our magic sauce is. of course, all our own family jewels in the digital which we're trying to do asic in the future, but it is an fpga level.
and there is a -- there's a third board on top which houses a processor or an external processor for the platform, right. you want to have everything there if you are required to create something you're not scrambling so it's part of it. is it getting use or not use, that's you know -- we're not going to comment on that because it's unclear what long-term. as i said, our first-generation product, our intention would be to not have that significant cost or have any kind of application processor with gpu and big cpu on there.
our bread and butter is you know, we are very good at actually putting into our slc that goes up to the dsp level, right. and that's -- that's why products that we make are great features and yet they have no competitive price points that we can do. so think about that a-sample, it's serving a purpose it's supposed to be, which is a development platform. so we have multiple, just preparing for anything may or may not come.
you have everything there, so you can respond quickly, and you don't have to keep developing new hardware. that's the best that i think about that.
unknown speaker -- private investor
ok. that makes sense to me. thank you.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
i just want to add a little note, right. i mean, probably one of the reasons why i wanted to put that picture out there and i think i kind of got a little annoyed. i'm not -- i shouldn't get annoyed so easily that people are saying that microvision they don't know what they're doing in hardware. they've never done hardware.
what business they have and that kind of just rub me the wrong way and i'm pretty sure of a lot of people that work here is rub the wrong way. so it's kind of important to show you guys. obvioiusly, you don't want to talk about what's inside, i mean lot of things were left covered, but to show like you know there's real hardware just like the housing top and bottom that -- anybody can do that. there's actual stuff in there, right.
so i hope you know, i mean this is a brief look into it, right. but i think it's quite a lot in there.
unknown speaker -- private investor
you know me, i'm always up for talking about the tech.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
sure.
unknown speaker -- private investor
thanks.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question will come from jeff porter who is a private investor. please go ahead.
unknown speaker -- private investor
gentlemen, good afternoon. congratulations.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
thanks, jeff. thank you.
unknown speaker -- private investor
following up on gio's question, there appears to be an -- i don't know if you can comment on it or not, but there appears to be a nvidia jetson xavier nx component. can you comment on, whether that is -- that's what it enables?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
i can't comment on what it enables. i think you can see logos and stuff like that. just think about that incidental choice. we could have another song there if we want to, right.
we've just picked one that makes sense. what we're doing, but it's -- there's nothing more to really comment on that. so i think the point about the first generation, i really want to take that -- jeff, the take away is, it's our intention. think about it, there's let's say there were two products, one is going to be your first generation which is going to have a very specific price target.
the other one's got software, probably got more to it, more innovation, there was going to have a different price points. so these things are like future things. what our current hardware has to start thinking through, what the different options would be for that and to demonstrate that, when we talk about scalability, absolutely, when you do things at the factory, but also designs are scalable. that when somebody looks at it, it's not another 10-year invention.
all the key ingredients of what's -- all are very good actually, just trust me on that. they think through multiple steps ahead of how they would want to scale. that's what's impressive about them. so think about that as an incidental choice right now, we can show what do we want.
but if our business benefit is to put it our [inaudible] of course we're going to do that. we could provide a feature at the lowest cost. so i want to be clear. it's incidental.
that's how you think about it because it has to go to an advantage. if everybody's got the same chip you know, of course, that's going to limit some things, but there's some features that people want put in that are not required, right, and this is public data. so if somebody could do active for example, that's a pretty big important feature. it takes priority over anything else for multiples.
it's public accounts that people made. so again, think about that chip as a, as an incidental choice that we made and we would somebody else's ship, if they liked. it's agnostic to it is what i want to say.
unknown speaker -- private investor
ok. ok. one additional question and this relates more to display. can you talk about the current state of direct green laser diodes as opposed to, say 10, 20 years ago when a company was founded.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
i think green lasers you know are fortunately, there's more than one partner in the world that has been lasers now. so i think they're not supply limited. you know there's no -- they all have their own ip. they're mature processes.
i think it's more demand limited. so i think as the market starts opening up, laser is not going to stop and you got to roll out of any kind of factor display or any product that we have or that display only ar. i think the green laser diodes are much more common now. not common, there's only a handful going oem, but they're not art anymore.
unknown speaker -- private investor
so they're more prevalent now than they were 10, 20 years ago.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
oh, yeah, absolutely. yeah. i mean if you think about our attractive display, i think we -- we've worked on that for a long time. obviously, that's part of the supply chain.
things that we had to open up and we had to work on that and we're pretty confident that that would not have had any impact.
unknown speaker -- private investor
ok. all right. that's all i have gentlemen. congratulations again.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
thanks so much.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
thank you. in addition to some of the questions today, we also received quite a few questions were submitted. we've run over on time. i've just gone through the list of them and i think we hit most of this stuff that was covered in the questions that were asked today.
so i think in the interest of time and not being redundant, the questions we've already answered and we just go to your closing comment.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
so, thank, everybody for joining. i think it is a good time. i think we really have to think about built -- continue to build value while i'm exploring, if you can do those two things simultaneously. and i definitely want to emphasize that, as you go through alternatives, this is something we focus on very seriously.
but we also look at every opportunity to increase shareholder value and we will continue to be prudent as we see and describe how we move forward and focus on the areas that make us the value the most. so thanks for joining and we really appreciate all the effort, all the energy and emotion everybody was putting in. thank you for that.

and now i'd like to turn the call over to sumit sharma. sumit? 
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
thank you, lindsay. good afternoon, everyone. it's great to have the chance to update you on our progress. later in the call, i will also update you on our strategy for initial direct sales of lidar sensors, while we work on developing opportunities for sales to oems and tier-one partners.
we refer to these sales opportunities to oems and tier-one partners as strategic sales. we remain profoundly confident in our ability to successfully execute this strategy that i believe will drive long-term value creation for our shareholders. let me start off by thanking our shareholders for their enormous support and confidence in the company. the continued support of our shareholders has allowed the company to fund development and maintain all ownership of rights to our technology.
we are purposefully driving toward a future inflection point, where i believe our cash flow from these investments will lead to significant greater value creation. i will also provide some additional perspective on how we plan to position our technology and products toward the expected automotive lidar market. i believe we should give you greater insight into our bullish view of the future. i would like to sincerely thank our employees for their continued hard work and dedication.
we began transitioning back to the office in july and it is great to see some normalcy return. i would also like to warmly welcome potential business partners to this call who are starting to join and follow our public updates. i'm happy to report that we have made great progress since our last call, building on our work from the past year. since last year, we have been submitting responses to rfis or request for information initiated by oem, tier one, and mobility-as-a-service companies.
with the completion of our a-sample, we were able to share our data from outdoor testing with oem and tier-one companies that demonstrated our sensor operating at ranges greater than 200 meters, high-resolution, and velocity output, among other features. our team has been actively concocting outdoor testing on various development platforms since december 2020. this has allowed us to share performance data and support various deep dives into our technology to highlight advantages of our hardware and software as part of these rfis. we have been building bridges to these potential partners throughout our development.
with covid-related international travel restrictions and constraints placed by companies in europe and north america, limiting onsite visits, we were required to share tremendous amounts of data for rfi inquiries. with travel restrictions listing, we are now beginning to plan in-person trips and public demonstration of our lidar technology, starting with iaa mobility show in munich in september. the feedback we have received from potential customers so far has been very positive. with our proprietary active scan locking architecture, which is based on proven technologies, we believe our lidar meets or exceeds their product, expectations and will be the most cost-effective lidar product on the market.
our features and costs are two key sustainable strategic advantages of our technology that we expect to maintain well into the future. while we still have work ahead of us in completing partnerships, we believe our technology can clearly meet our customers' short and long-term needs. we often get questions from our investors about publishing a comparison of our specification versus our competitors. on our last call, i went into detail of our specifications and advantages of our technology and road map.
unfortunately, such clarity on relevant specifications is not available from our competitors. since providing incomplete comparison charts would not be constructive and could be misleading, we will instead periodically release updates from our track testing program and other validation efforts. we remain confident that our lidar sensor is best in class. i am pleased to report that this month, we will start conducting moving platform testing at a third-party track.
we will test our lidar with a test vehicle at speeds typical for highway driving. the track will have various test protocols set up, which are specified by national highway traffic safety administration or nhtsa and euro ncap to achieve adas safety ratings for oem vehicles. with the interest we have received so far, we expect to continue expanding our funnel for target partnerships with the addition of a business development team in germany. we also expect to add business development teams to address north america and asia pacific markets at some time in the future.
automotive lidar represents the biggest opportunity in the history of our company. to successfully engage potential partners, it is important for our customers to understand our commitment and our pedigree. to appreciate the important reason why we received such interest from oem and tier ones, we need to look back at where we have been and what we have accomplished over our company's long history. early applications of our technology included heads-up displays for u.s.
military and automotive systems. in the market today, our technology can be found in microsoft's hololens 2 product. in the past, we have worked with other global brands to incorporate our core technology into their consumer products as well. our hardware and software teams know what it takes to develop technology that meets or exceeds extremely high expectations.
our core technology has proven its ability to successfully perform and scale to mission-critical standards. our team is very experienced and has a pedigree of delivering products that have the potential to open large markets with a laser beam scanning technology. with our strong history of reliability, predictability, and precision, we feel confident that our automotive lidar sensor will perform to the standards expected by the industry. i'm honored to say with confidence to our potential customers that we are well established, well funded, and committed to deliver.
we see great long-term value in our lidar strategy to address the immediate market with direct sales and in parallel, engaging oems and tier ones for potential long-term partnerships for our hardware, custom asics and proprietary software as part of strategic sales. let me first elaborate on the importance of our direct sales strategy. we expect to introduce our lidar family of products, which will include four new product models. this will include our premium product with dynamic field of view with near, mid, and far field of view in a single product.
we believe this product could someday be considered a standard for adas safety. we will also introduce three additional models with fixed fields of view in near, mid, or far fields. all four models will be built on our current hardware with their appropriate software. because all four products will be built on the same hardware, it will limit our inventory exposure, while allowing our business development team to have flexibility in converting our sales funnel.
we believe our product with dynamic field of view will ultimately be our flagship product. by supporting our customers with six focus sensors and plugging gaps that may exist in their current sensor suite, we expect the opportunity of providing them a softer transition to our hardware platform. we are looking at every opportunity to accelerate sales and adoption of our hardware, while targeting a blended margin in the range of 50% for direct sales opportunities. our capability to potentially enable adas safety features directly from our sensor will allow us to demonstrate to oems and tier ones of adas features currently in the market can be improved.
current adas systems utilize low-cost camera module technologies that are limited to daytime use. with our track testing program, we expect to show potential partners the capability of our lidar to perform day or night and still be cost competitive. we are excited at this prospect. i would now like to discuss strategic sales.
our strategic sales will focus on the biggest volume opportunity in the lidar market we see coming from automotive oems and tier-one partnerships. about 24 million passenger vehicles are projected in 2024 to have advanced safety features, ranging from level two and higher, with an expected increase to about 37 million vehicles by 2030. the current industry leader selling level two camera module-based system, safety systems, has publicly announced its push into lidar. we believe we are ahead of this and other companies with our current sensor specifications, long-term competitive cost and proven maturity of our technology.
with a large market and significant growth ahead of us, we see great opportunity for further value creation with our focus on strategic sales. i'm excited about our dual-path strategy to drive revenue and profitability. now, let me turn the call over to steve to discuss the second-quarter results and then i'll be back to provide some additional perspective. steve?
steve holt -- chief financial officer
thank you, sumit. good afternoon, everyone. for the second quarter, revenue was $746,000, a 56% increase over last quarter's revenue of $479,000. all the second quarter's revenue was royalty revenue and attributable to microsoft corporation, who we've previously referred to as our april 2017 customer.
as i pointed out before, royalties related to this customer will be credited against the nonrefundable prepayment the customer made in 2017. once the prepayment is exhausted, the customer will begin making cash payments for royalties due. at the end of q2, the balance of the prepayment stood at $6.5 million. the $6.5 million is on the balance sheet as a contract liability.
our second quarter cost of revenue included a $31,000 credit related to the reversal of a warranty accrual. the result is a second-quarter gross profit of $777,000. in comparison, gross profit was $484,000 in the prior quarter. operating expenses were $15.7 million in the second quarter, which is higher than our guidance of $13 million to $14 million we discussed on april 29 and up from $6.7 million in the prior quarter.
the increase in opex was primarily due to non-cash compensation of $7.9 million. recruiting and payroll expenses associated with an increase in headcount came to about $800,000, and there was a write-off for unused production equipment related to our interactive display -- the interactive display product of around 660,000. our headcount at the end of june was 74, up from 57 at the end of march. and we are really very pleased that we were able to attract 17 new employees in the quarter given the tight labor market.
and we remain in a hiring mode and plan to hire more people, primarily in engineering, but we will also expect to fill positions in sales and other administrative functions. we expect that by the end of the year we could be up to 110 to 125 people. now much of the increase in the projected headcount is for our software and hardware teams. as sumit mentioned, we plan to add features and reduce costs to enable strategic sales in the level two and higher categories.
and these people will be needed to make that happen. given the higher operating expenses in the second quarter, our net loss was $15 million or $0.09 a share. in second quarter, cash used in operations was $6.7 million. first-quarter loss was $6.2 million or $0.04 per share and first-quarter cash used in operations was $4.5 million.
the increase in cash used in operations during the second quarter was primarily attributable to salaries and recruiting expenses in connection with the increased headcount, development materials, and suppliers as we continue development on our long-range lidar and prepayments to vendors for materials and software tools and inventory that we expect will be used to build product in the fourth quarter. cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter was $135.3 million, up from $75.3 million at the end of the prior quarter. the increase was a result of the company raising funds on the $140 million atm we put in place in june. in the second quarter, we issued 4 million shares and raised $67.8 million in net proceeds.
we've not raised any additional funds on the atm thus far in the third quarter. we were pleased to put the atm in place and raise the cash we did as it gives confidence to prospective customers and partners as well as employees and prospective employees that microvision will be a strong long-term partner in the automotive lidar market. now, i'd like to turn to the third quarter, give some thoughts on our spending and cash usage as we move forward through this year. so q3 will also have a significant amount of non-cash compensation.
additionally, we continue to hire and get ready for production and begin promoting our lidar sensor, the direct sales and i expect to see our q3 operating expenses in the range of $14 million to $16 million. as for cash used in operations, in addition to the increased expenses i mentioned, we will begin adding inventory in advance of starting production in q4. so i expect to see cash used in operations in the $9 million to $11 million range in the third quarter, not q4, but that's q3 -- in q3, $9 million to 11 million. finally, let me echo sumit's excitement about our competitive position and the progress we've made so far in 2021.
we are focused on the successful start of direct sales of our lidar sensor and we're also focused on building a company that can succeed with the long-term strategic sales that sumit discussed earlier. i'll now turn the call back over to sumit for some comments before we open up the call to questions.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
before we open the call up for questions, let me revisit a couple of important themes from this call. today, our focus remains on establishing ourselves as a trusted partner for automotive oems, tier ones, and mobility-as-a-mervice companies. we expect our closely integrated hardware and software to enable the adas safety market while also supporting potential partners in the autonomous driving market. we expect to start validating our adas safety capabilities to our track testing program by second-quarter 2022.
nothing is more important to us than getting this right with our products and partnerships. our technology and company have already demonstrated our pedigree and enabled large global brands. i expect us to establish ourselves and lead the adas and autonomous driving space with a hardware and software into the future. we remain confident in our ability to successfully execute on our strategy.
i am clearly bullish on our future. let's open the call up for questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from glenn mattson from ladenburg thalmann and co. please go ahead.
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the questions. sumit, first of all, interesting that you're able to name microsoft finally as the customer, the april 17 customer. i know that's been pretty well-known for a very long time now, but it's -- just curious as to why you're able to actually talk about it publicly now.
and now that we're talking about it publicly, maybe can you give us a more clear sense -- updates on just kind of like the road map that they're on, what kind of growth do you expect from them over, say, the next 18 months with regards to that project any color there. thanks.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
yes, glenn. this is steve. so we evaluated our legal obligations and the information that was in the market and disclosed the information today. as far as any discussion of road map or anything like that, we have no comment on that.
i will note, if you're just looking for what does revenue look like this year on the royalties, as you're well aware, we disclose our estimate for that in the revenue footnote in the sec filings. so that will be in the queue that we have. i think it's going to show about $2.3 million is what's expected for the -- for 2021. but of course, that's subject to change as we get more information.
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
so as more of the production a possibility for early test sample product sales in q4, is there any sense of what kind of volume you would expect? i think you kind of talked about production and shipments in q4 for the lidar. so can you just give us any sense for what kind of -- i know, obviously, it's very early, but just kind of what kind of level we should expect?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
i think as we said, right, we just call it initial sales are expected to be small. i think there's no more update to that beyond that. as you can imagine, creating a product getting going, it's early times. so i think we'll still call it just initial sales by q4.
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
and how many of the additional personnel would you -- it sounds like you're building up a bit of a sales force to support the product, so can you get a sense of how big that sales force would be and how difficult is it to find people in this specialized niche and just color there too.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
i can't really share, like specific it right, but as steve mentioned, right, we expect to be somewhere between 110 to 125 people, and there's a mix of that. but it all depends on the needs that we see ahead. certainly, a lot of that is investing in the engineering because we really still have to think about the bigger markets and think about the cost reductions and the improvements in the features that we would like to get done. and i think as far as the sales team is concerned we will be appropriately sized from a strategic sales standpoint and a direct sales standpoint.
so we're so -- we have some thoughts here, but we're going to -- as we roll out we'll understand more of size appropriately.
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
and on the atm, can you give us a sense on what level of cash you feel is necessary to support the business? its cash obviously balances gone up tremendously over the last year or so. so where should investors think that you think you need to be in terms of the cash on the balance sheet?
steve holt -- chief financial officer
we'd like to raise the remaining roughly $70 million is on the atm. we would like to, but we don't have any specific plans to do that at this time. part of the reason -- well, a lot of the reason for the atm is the confidence it's giving to customers and suppliers and employees and prospective employees. so it's been very helpful.
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
ok. did you see what stock comp would be in q3? i might have missed that, steve.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
i didn't give a projection on that. i expect it to be less than what it was in q2. the volatility of the stock makes it difficult to be predictive. i'm kind of thinking $6 million plus or minus is in that ballpark, but it is -- it really matters on what the stock price is on the day of a specific brand and with our volatility.
that's tough to predict.
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
ok. all right. that's it for me. thanks, guys.
operator
your next question comes from richard shannon from craig-hallum capital group. please go ahead.
richard shannon -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
well, hi, guys. thanks for taking my questions. just one or two on lidar here. i guess, sumit, the first one is you talked about a family of four products your premium one and then three others that have single range specs here.
maybe you can help us understand the driving force behind the split of specifications. any way you can discuss what those specs are relative or quantitative and then the use cases you expect for each of them that would be great to hear.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
and it's a great question. so as you can imagine, richard, in all the different partners that may be testing a system, perhaps they have a flash-based, short-range lidar, and they're lacking the capability for long-range only, but they don't want to completely change over yet, because they've developed a bunch of software on it. so having four different products in the family does not foresee one solution, which may be the ultimate solution, right, right off the bat. so to accelerate sales, you want to accommodate that their specific need, maybe, for example, mid-range only needed added on because they're not going high with speeds or somebody wants to go even longer-range and a short-range only.
so it allows them to mix and match for their specific needs. so it allows us also the flexibility of connecting with them and offering them the benefits of our hardware platform. i still believe having a single lidar with all three fields of view, those kind of ranges, allows you the flexibility of low speeds, all the way to highway speeds, i think i've spoken about this before, and getting the resolution and the velocity, all of those at the single lidar level as a feature. but i think any kind of new technology being introduced, you allows -- like a more softer introduction to it with the hardware.
the benefit, of course, is it's all on the same piece of hardware that we have right now that we made. that would be one single-family product. and of course, the software and other things would be slightly different in there. but that allows us to maintain our inventory levels at a very low level.
there's no risk on that one and we can provide the features, specific features that our potential customers may need. to some extent, people have different needs. they may have low resolution at a certain range, and they just need something to plug that in, and then they start seeing the other benefits of it, and that allows them to come back onto our ecosystem.
richard shannon -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
maybe just to restate what i think i've heard here, sumit. so the -- is the three products with singular range is supported there. those are expected to be plugged into platforms where they have a whole and lidar needs there, whereas your premium one is expected to be the one around which the platform is designed. is that a fair way to think about it?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
that's fair to say. direct sales will use the 3 that are fixed, most likely. i mean, we will sell the dynamic field of view version as well. but yes, for strategic sales, think about the dynamic field of view as a premier product.
richard shannon -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
my other question here, i may have missed the terminology you assume it, so please correct me on this one, but i think you said you're expecting to start a validation by second quarter of '22. is that with this current a-sample as you describe it or is there going to be a forthcoming version that you might label as a b or c sample here? just help us understand that. and is the ones that you're validating starting in q2, is that the one you expect to be ramping to reduction in '24, '25?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
the sample that we have right on, the hardware sample, is the sample that we're going to be testing part of this program in q2 2022. let me be sort of a little bit more clear on what that is about. so as i mentioned in the earlier part of the call that we're starting our track testing program. so obviously, it's going to be over a long period of time.
and starts with ground proof testing and other scenarios, safety scenarios that oems always have to design sensor suites for. the q2 2022 mentioned that i had, that's the first opportunity we want to show that we can be -- from -- right from our lidar, that we are able to actually address some of these safety protocols, test protocols that are defined by nhtsa and euro ncap. performance ride from the lidar by itself. so it's a different kind of products.
if you think about level two and level two plus, plus and some of the features that are in level three, i think there's always a new level that's always created, richard. those can be addressed what we believe from a lidar alone. for example, a, b, front collision warning, there's a whole lot of features that can be addressed. and the bigger market, of course, still remains at the level two, level two plus plus, as you know.
and we want to be able to demonstrate that through track testing, someplace where nhtsa and euro ncap testing is done.
richard shannon -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
your answer here actually brings up another quick caution for me, which is on the topic of safety. wonder if you could talk about the importance -- relative importance to safety over the last six months here, both from an oems perspective, but also -- and i think you referred to it here briefly is regulatory bodies in the various jurisdictions worldwide. what are they seeing here? what are they expecting to do or are you expecting them to do? we're going to see something more standardized here that will ultimately drive more lighter penetration in faster.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
i think the -- this is a really good question, because if you think about adas safety, it is really determined by these governing bodies, these regulations that test protocols you have to pass to be able to get your product qualified, and this is at the oem level. so us being able to demonstrate that removes barriers of adoption, the things that are hardware that can actually solve the problem early on. as far as, i think you may have read, i think recently, in europe, i think germany, a level four system, some controlled test will be allowed. but it all -- at the end of the day, every one of these things, before it gets into a car, it has to go through qualification that these regulatory bodies will define and test protocols that every oem, tier-one lidar company would have to meet.
so, therefore, that's the path effectively. and so far, level two and level two plus, plus, those have test protocols available. level three, still not dominantly available right now. and level four is just starting to become there.
but no legislation that i've read so far has been clearly defined of a time line for level four technology to be out on the -- available to the public effectively, maybe in some control cases, but not really openly available yet. so the main volume still remains in level two and level two plus plus and other features or other sub-levels that can be created to replace the level three. and that's why the number i gave, 24 million approximately, a bulk of that is including those levels as well, level two, level two plus plus and others that may arrive.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
we'll now respond to some of the over 150 questions we received from investors via email. many of the questions are variations on the same topic and many of the questions were addressed in our prepared remarks. we tried to consolidate the questions on the same topics, but try to address the basic issue. we won't be able to answer every question submitted, but we will go through some of them here.
then we will open up the call to investors like we did on the last call. so the first question is, can you provide an update as to the progress on your internal testing and external validation of the sensor and supporting partner and customer confidential evaluations.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
as i mentioned earlier, we've been conducting indoor testing on various development hardware since december 2020. our engineering team is focused on exercising the hardware and developing features toward our objectives for initial sales. we share data from our development progress, features, and progress of indoor and outdoor validation test with interested parties, potentially interested parties. the commonly expected understanding is that a laser product that has not been ce marked in the eu or has been -- or has a product report submitted to the cdrh in the u.s.
may be operated by anyone else other than the manufacturer in certain cases and approved and qualified manufacturer representative. once the product is ready for initial sales, we will, of course, have class one laser qualification complete and then any potential customer can purchase. till that time, we need to be present to demonstrate the device. this is understood by folks we speak with.
folks with -- also folks internationally that we speak with right they understand this as well. it is prudent that in a private event or setting, the valuation sample that is not being ce mark is always maintained under the physical control of manufacturers, personnel and not left with the customer. so because of this restriction, right, i think we've done the best we can. they share as much, as i said, tremendous amount of data that we've shared with them with covid restrictions still in place internationally, and of course, locally, some restrictions off non-employees being on site.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
the next question relates to opening the german office. can you shed more light on the reason for that office. and did the regulatory environment have anything to do with it?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
european oems and tier one in germany have been the most active in adas space, mostly because of regulation on adas l2 safety and beyond. as we have mentioned before, we have been active -- actively promoting our technology in germany since 2019. it just made sense to have an office there that can be responsive to those companies in the same time zone and same language.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
we received a number of questions about the upcoming trade show in germany. what can we expect to be showing at this event?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
we're very excited about the trade show and can show our sensor publicly and be able to highlight the advantages of our technology, i've mentioned in previous calls. we will have several displays and live them out there that i would not want to steal thunder from. but we, of course, will share videos from the show. we make them public during the show and after the show.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
the next question that we had was questions around the atm. i think i answered address those when glenn asked his questions about it. again, i think the point to make here is that the atm and the cash that we have with a strong balance sheet has been advantageous when dealing with customers, suppliers, and employees. so that is a big reason for the atm.
next question was also about the april 2017 customer and which we disclosed as microsoft. and again, we answered those questions with -- when glenn asked his question. the next one is -- question is often asked about our plans for production, specifically, can you provide progress -- a progress report on the long-term -- on the long-range lidar sensor, pilot line in redmond or your planned asian production line.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
our original plan was to develop our pilot line in redmond during covid restrictions and transfer tooling, automation, and our process to asia. one of the partners is -- in this plan is in japan. unfortunately, japanese covid travel restrictions are still in place. our team needs to travel to the partner for a successful transition.
once we became aware of this in second quarter, we adapted our plan. all the automation is being delivered in to our redmond headquarters. we tend to qualify the line and produce our initial quantities for q4 sales in redmond. as before, we expect to transition to a partner for scaling from there, and we are evaluating all our options.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
next question relates to other verticals. what is the status of these verticals and are you actively pursuing or investing in them now?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
as i shared in previous calls, all our effort is on automotive lidar. we believe there is value in other verticals and we stand ready to support a potential customer as needed. but that is not our focus now.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
next question is about strategic alternatives. what can you share about strategic alternatives? as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, for the past year, we've been responding to rfis, sharing data, and sharing test data and we will continue this work. but as we have previously disclosed in sec filings, we currently have no agreements or commitments to engage in any specific strategic transaction. and the last question before we take more live questions relates to the mems production.
what can you report about your fifth-generation mems and your mems fab partner?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
i'm happy to report that we have received our first wafers from our mems fab partner. in fact, they are in the devices we are building now. i expect our q4 initial sales units will use dyes produced from our mems fab partner. beyond that, i think there's -- we're not commenting any more than that.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
ok. we will now take some live questions from investors. operator, we're ready for the first question.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from tye bordner. please go ahead.
unknown speaker -- unknown speaker
yes. hi. can you guys hear me?
steve holt -- chief financial officer
yes.
unknown speaker -- unknown speaker
congratulations on -- you guys and the entire company to the progress you made in q2. so congrats on that. steve, i think in the last call, you mentioned that you were projecting around 80 headcount by the end of the year, and obviously, now that's changed. i think current projection is 110 to 125.
so can you comment on why that significant increase?
steve holt -- chief financial officer
i tried to hit that in my prepared remarks. it's -- there's an opportunity to get our sensor into the adas level two, two plus, and higher. and to do that, we need some software, some hardware teams to build some features and get the cost down. and so that's really the focus.
we think there's an opportunity there, but we'll need some people to do that.
unknown speaker -- unknown speaker
ok. so i guess that wasn't necessarily well-known back in q1.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
i think in q1, we talked about a future product road map. but as we've been able to do work and dig into what the opportunity is and the time frame of what we think we could do it in, what it would take for resources that was all happening in q1 and q2, we've kind of developed a plan, and we think it makes sense to go forward with.
unknown speaker -- unknown speaker
ok. got it. also, in -- back in the q1 filing, you mentioned extending the contract with sharp for an additional year. any -- can you provide any status on that? have you had any communication with them at all?
steve holt -- chief financial officer
i mean, the reason we extended that contract was just to give them time because covid was a difficult period for people to get out and make new product decisions. so we thought it was made sense to extend that. they've been a good partner and we want them to succeed. so that's really the reason for the extension.
do we communicate with them? yes. today, as a matter of fact, but i don't have anything i could tell you about, specifically about that. i believe they're still working to find customers.
unknown speaker -- unknown speaker
ok. and last question, this is for sumit. sumit, you've used a lot's changed over the last 17 months, 12 months. so microvision is clearly in a different position than you were then.
and you used an analogy back then, specifically, i think in regards to negotiating with the large companies and you used a reference -- a wrestling analogy of being on the mat. and i guess my question to you is now, do you feel like you are up off the mat now?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
the best way i can say it, the way i think about it, philosophically, if you're not a trillion-dollar company, you're always on the mat. all right. so you got to go, build value, launch expenses and just keep government. right? that's got the best answer i gave, the best answer i can give you.
unknown speaker -- unknown speaker
ok. thanks. that's all i got.
operator
your final question comes from mike wolken. please go ahead.
unknown speaker -- unknown speaker
hey, guys. great progress in q2, and congratulations. i'm excited as well as an investor. i wanted to talk a little bit about -- you mentioned that you would be able to manufacture and sell small quantities of the automotive lidar sensor in q4.
are these sensors being manufactured and sold to automotive oems for their own internal advanced road testing or exactly how are they -- in other words, it's a small number. we don't know what that number is. what are they going to use those for? we've given them data on our own internal testing and we'll continue to. but what are these sensors for?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
i think, mike, think about these. these are, as we said, initial sales, small quantities, therefore, our direct sales. so there's going to be a cohort of potential customers that we will be addressing these. and they will all have different needs.
there could be all different segments. it's not specifically one segment we're saying. there could be robotics, there could be this. it could be people that autonomous driving software development.
it could also be tier one, tier two, it could be a whole group of people. so, therefore, the sensor by itself, right, people are going to use for different things. so think about the market is many, many different segments. and if you think about some of our competitors when they talk about their public sales that are significant amount over the years, it's that kind of strategic sales, where different people use for different things.
so it would be hard to say like what specific thing use for now. your question about test data, test data is important because you have to validate what you are believing that you can do, how you can actually solve a big problem. and when you think about an automotive oem or tier one, they're going to make a product that they were going to support for 15 years after they make the purchase. so they look for something different.
right? so before you can enter that phase of making that product forever, you have to actually do some initial work. and it could be a wide range of things that could be used for. so it would be very hard to say specifically. but the most basic thing is, if you say it does something, they have to go validate that and they may have some special requirements themselves that is not common to anybody else, right, that we would work with them and support them.
so it's a varying -- a variety of things that could be done. but yes they're going to definitely test it, stationary, moving, calibrating to other things that have already done. right? so it would be pretty hard to comment on what they will use it for. we really have to comment publicly what they're going to use.
we certainly will know what they're using it for, but publicly, of course, we're not going to comment, mike.
unknown speaker -- unknown speaker
and one other question about the business development office in germany. dr. luce, who is going to be head of business development there was -- has previously been for seven years ceo of a company called optoflux in germany. and of course, he's going to go to work for the company, which is great based on his credentials.
going to their website because optoflux is an interesting company and i could see the possible connection between our two companies. going to their website, he still is going to represent optoflux as a managing director, even though he's taking the job of head of business development in germany for microvision. is there an engineering partnership or any connection between the two companies that you can share with us?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
so thomas luce joined microvision in september. so till then, he is still ceo and managing director there. so once he joined microvision, he's going to be with microvision.
unknown speaker -- unknown speaker
any connection between the two companies with respect to engineering or lrl going forward in terms of product design.
as steve mentioned, right, our hardware and software, our teams are going to be here based in redmond, washington, and that's where we're doing the scale-up.
ok. thanks for answering my questions.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
our pleasure.

sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
thank you, lindsey. good afternoon, everyone. i would like to start off by walking you through our progress in the last quarter, including our product introduction at the iaa munich mobility show and our priorities to frame the year ahead of us. we have made progress since our last call.
in september, we introduced our lidar sensor at the munich mobility show. it was a great opportunity to showcase our technology alongside our competitors. ada safety and the need for lidar as a central sensor was part of the story for every oem and tier 1 that exhibited at the show. the largest volume opportunity and recurring revenue resides in oem programs for automotive lidar sensors, which have been our focus for the last several years.
i can say with confidence that the race to secure in oem program for level 2+ and level 3 ada systems with lidar as the central censor is still wide open. no lidar company has yet secured an oem deal that was recorded on its financial statements as meaningful backlog. i believe microvision is ahead of all of our competitors in several key areas. based on our work with a leading global consulting firm, we expect oem to make partnership decisions after careful and thorough evaluation in the next 16 months for launch of new ev models with more advanced adas features, which will start to ship in 2025 with a larger global rollout of a battery-operated electric vehicle is expected in 2026.
this could represent lidar unit volumes in the millions in the future. i am excited to report that we have received very positive feedback from our recent oem and tier 1 meetings. oems tell us that our sensor is of interest because it demonstrates best-in-class cost advantages, size, key features, and demonstrable scalability for production and quality requirements. we believe our hardware and software solution excel in each of these categories and we have received acknowledgment of this in our meetings with oems and tier 1 companies.
potential customers and partners have consistently been impressed by the complex size of our sensor and the number of features packed inside. our capability to provide highest resolution at range with dynamic field of view and velocity field, while running at 30 hertz is a major accomplishment of which we are very proud of. the 30 hertz could enable higher-speed operation of automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, and automatic emergency steering. it has features that are expected to be the centerpiece features for future vehicles.
our technology would also provide larger system cost savings than competitive solutions, an important factor in oems' final decision process. and ada solution integrated with our lidar would require a lower number of sensors to meet ada safety requirements and result in a lower overall system costs compared with a sensor stack utilizing lower resolution and lower frame rate lidar solutions. working with a leading global management consulting company have allowed us to confirm this, enable us to more widely start introducing our product to oems. as previously stated, we expect to demonstrate our integrated software and hardware ada solution by june 2022 that will demonstrate higher levels of ada safety, features that oem desire.
as i recently discussed, our technology is built on well-known technologies for lasers, photodetectors, lens, and custom silicone components. there are no exotic materials in our sensor so we can quite easily show our cost scalability to oems. the microvision know-how is combining these standard materials with our algorithms, software, and custom silicon in what creates incredible value through our intellectual property. additionally, with our history of delivering products for world-class customers like microsoft for challenging applications, demonstrates the pedigree of the company and provides potential customers the confidence in our ability to meet and exceed their expectations.
as i frame our priorities for the next year, working to achieve an oem or tier 1 partnership remains our focus. our team is working around the clock in polishing our sample for oem evaluations that are expected to continue well into 2022. the oems require a more specialized product for automotive adas and a product for the general market. because of the large and valuable oem opportunity ahead of us, we have decided to focus our attention on the oem business what we call strategic sales.
we will continue to prepare our product for direct sales but at a slower pace. we expect it will be available in the middle of 2022. i believe we need to maintain our focus on strategic sales, given the timeframe for oem decisions and the value this strategy could represent to our investors. one of the questions i often get from investors is, ""is microvision plan to go it alone?"" let me clarify my thoughts on this.
the opportunity for an oem program is tremendous and represents significant value for our shareholders, but no company can go it alone in this space for such a safety-critical system. partnerships will be required with oems and tier 1s and others in their stack to be able to deliver a solution. in the near term, industry experts expect a huge amount of consolidation in the adas space but recurring significant revenue is not expected until 2025 and beyond. microvision is in a strong position with our hardware and software built on decades of relevant development and solid intellectual property rights.
before i turn the call over to steve to discuss future results, let me comment on the cfo announcement we made last week. i would like to start off by thanking steve for his eight and a half years of dedication to microvision and helping the company navigate through challenging times to the most financially secure level it has been in its history. steve and i have worked closely to my time at the company and i will miss his focus and friendship. we also announced anubhav verma will be joining us on november 15th as our new cfo.
i'm excited that he brings with him great energy and solid experience from years executing in capital markets and investment banking transactions. i'm looking forward to working with him and the expertise he will bring to our management team. in other news of interest to our shareholders, dave allen, microvision's longtime ir consultant is retiring at the end of november. i am very appreciative of dave's work over the years supporting the company's communication with shareholders.
he will be missed. i would like to end this update by thanking our shareholders for their enormous support and confidence in the company. i would also like to sincerely thank our employees for their continued hard work and dedication in getting us here and remaining focused on the important work ahead. now, let me turn the call over to steve to discuss the third quarter results, and then i'll be back to provide some additional perspective.
steve?
steve holt -- chief financial officer
thank you, sumit. good afternoon, everyone. for the third quarter, revenue was $718,000, down slightly compared to last quarter's revenue of $746,000. all of the second quarter's revenue -- third quarter's revenue was royalty revenue and attributable to our augmented reality customer.
as i've pointed out before, royalties related to this customer will be credited against the nonrefundable prepayment the customer made in 2017. once the prepayment is exhausted, the customer will again making -- begin making cash payments for royalties due. at the end of q3, the balance of the prepayment stood at $5.8 million. the $5.8 million is on the balance sheet as a contract liability.
i'd also like to point out that there is no time limit within which the prepayment must be used. as long as the components we developed for the customer are in production, royalty revenue will continue to be generated. third quarter cost of revenue included a $10,000 credit related to the reversal of a warranty accrual. the result is a third quarter gross profit of $728,000.
in comparison, gross profit was $777,000 in the prior quarter. operating expenses were $10.8 million in the third quarter, which was considerably lower than our guidance of $14 million to $16 million discussed on august 4 and lower than the $15.7 million in the prior quarter. the decrease in operating expenses from q2 was primarily due to a decrease in share-based compensation. share-based compensation was lower in q3 because q2 had a one-time expense of $4.2 million and some employee awards earned in q2 were not repeated in q3.
if we subtract share-based compensation expense from operating expenses from both q3 and q2, operating expenses would be $8 million in q3 and $7.8 million in q2. our headcount at the end of september was 83, up from 74 at the end of june. we are a little behind in our hiring plans due to the very tight labor market, but we are pleased that we were able to attract nine new employees in the quarter. we remain in a hiring mode and plan to hire more people, primarily in engineering, but we also expect to fill positions in sales and other administrative functions.
expect by the end of the year, we will have 100 to 110 people, a little lower than our prior guidance of 110 to 125. our net loss in the third quarter was $9.4 million or $0.06 per share. in comparison, the second quarter net loss was $15 million or $0.09 per share. because of the large swings in share-based compensation, we think it would be useful in making comparisons if we provide an adjusted ebitda number.
adjusted ebitda is earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation expense. for the third quarter, adjusted ebitda was negative $6.2 million and for the second quarter, it was negative $6.7 million. third quarter cash used in operations was $10 million. in comparison, cash used in operations in the second quarter was $6.7 million.
the increase is due to adding $1 million in component inventory for our long-range lidar. also in the quarter, we paid security deposits in prepaid rent for new lidar testing and office space. those deposits and rent came to about $1 million. and additionally, in july, we renewed our d and o insurance.
our insurance premium increased substantially due to our increased market cap and general conditions in the d and o market and that accounted for about $900,000 in increased cash usage. cash and equivalents at the end of the third quarter was $125 million, down from $135.3 million at the end of the prior quarter. we did not raise any funds on the atm in the third quarter or thus far in the fourth quarter. while we have not opted to utilize the atm since the second quarter, having a strong balance sheet and the ability to raise additional funds has given confidence to prospective customers and partners that we can be a long-term player in the automotive market.
strong balance sheet also helps in retaining and attracting employees. i'd like to return to the topic of real estate leases. in september, we signed a lease for about 17,000 square feet of space that will be used for both lidar testing and office space to start paying rent on this space in november. additionally, we have placed a deposit for a lease on a building next door to the testing facility.
if we are unable to complete a negotiated exit from our current lease, the deposit will be returned. if we can negotiate that exit, we will likely move our main office to the new facility in late summer or fall of 2022. the new facility is around 36,000 square feet and the facility we would be leaving is around 31,000 square feet. now, i'd like to give some thoughts on our expectations for the fourth quarter.
first, let's cover revenue. as sumit mentioned, we're focusing on the automotive oem business because of the opportunity for high levels of recurring revenue. in the short term, this effort will consume a lot of engineering resources. as a result of this focus and the timelines that come with it, we have pushed back the start of production of lidar units for direct sales from q4 of this year to the middle of next year.
so, expect q4 revenue this year will continue to be royalty revenue in the range of $500,000 to $600,000. now, for operating expenses. q4, again, will have a significant amount of share-based compensation in the range of $3 million to $3.5 million. additionally, as we continue to hire and continue spending on materials and services, i expect to see q4 operating expenses in the range of $11.5 million to $13 million, including the share-based compensation.
finally, cash and -- used in operations, in addition to the increased expenses i've mentioned will continue adding inventory of long lead time components for our long-range lidar. so, i expect to see cash used in operations in the $10 million to $11.5 million range. finally, let me echo sumit's excitement about our competitive position and the reception we received at the iaa mobility trade show last month. you know, that show was really the first chance we had to show our hardware, and the response we received was every bit of what we hoped it would be.
i'll now turn the call over to sumit for some comments before we open the call to questions.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
thank you, steve. before we open the call for questions, let me revisit a couple of important themes from this call. the strategy that i described today, though ambitious, is built on microvision's well-established technological depth and maturity, including our proprietary asic, our cost-effective components, and our demonstrated ability to prioritize at scale. we expect that our engagement with oems will continue as we support the valuations of our sensor in q2 2022 and of our software features in q3 2022.
we believe that microvision will be well-positioned to support oems as they roll out new vehicle programs built on next-generation technologies. we remain confident in our ability to successfully execute on our strategy and i'm bullish on our future. let's open the call for questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] the first question comes from glenn mattson with ladenburg thalmann. please go ahead.
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
yeah. hi, thanks for taking the questions. just first, let me most importantly start off with just congratulating steve on his, i guess, his retirement, right? and just say what a pleasure it's been, you know, working with you all these years. so, that out of the way, sumit, first, just -- i know it's off-topic a little bit but questions about, you know, your thoughts on facebook's kind of big thing today talking about changes into meta and the big move in the metaverse and just, you know, whether or not you think that kind of spurs investment by some of the other competitors there in terms of just kind of the ar world.
i know that a lot of the ar and vr stocks got a boost today as a result of that news. so, just, you know, just opinions on whether or not that spurs further investment from your one big customer or from other interests from other parties in the ar space.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
good question. so, of course, i've just recently read about it so i have not really processed it all. but, you know, glenn, if you think about it, the bigger picture that you've talk about here is if they're going out there announcing all the things they audaciously, aspirationally want to build out is going to take significant amount of investment. that includes hardware, software, platforms.
so, i think what's exciting about that news when i read it was that, you know, a big company with, you know, hundreds of billion dollars of market cap is willing to say and, you know, they're generating cash that they want to actually invest in there. so, again, these kinds of platforms, these kinds of spaces, when one big party makes investments, others do as well. so, i'm excited for the space. i've always been excited for the space.
i've always said that it's going to be something big but at the right time. and it's good to see that a big, big, big company like meta, the new move coming like meta is going to be making investments and strides into that space.
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
great. yeah, thanks. and then on the [audio gap] update focused more on oem versus, you know, direct sales of sensors on that front. just, you know, a little bit more on the color.
i mean, i guess, obviously, longer term, the oem is the bigger opportunity. you know, i guess the thought would be seeing some progress on -- seeing some sales in the short term would be like more of a signaling device for investors and people like that to kind of just get a sense of the acceptance of the products in the marketplace or [audio gap] would kind of be helpful in some sense. but, you know, ancillary to the big mission, which is to get, you know, into large design wins and things like that. so, you know, just a little bit more on the give and take on your thought process there.
and then, you know, thinking about the fact that there's, you know, you talked about having product available kind of middle of next year now. is that -- so, shall we start to model in kind of thinking about not seeing any product revenue until that point in time? or should there be some sample revenue for some of these oem opportunities that are out there?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think that's a good way to think about it. and i think, you know, the sample revenues is like incidental. you know, think about what i just talked about that there's, you know, we're working with a global management consulting firm, making sure that all the data the market has that we're up to speed on that one to make sure that we -- we're aligned that, you know, try to minimize, reduce, not being surprised that they come in these kind of endeavors.
so, 16 months ahead of us is where some of these key decisions are getting made. and it is important for us to focus on that and not let that opportunity pass us by. now, the strategic sales represent the biggest revenue -- recurring revenue for any company in this space. all companies are hyperfocused on that.
so, it's not just microvision. all companies are hyperfocused on that because it is the biggest price. now, when you think about direct sales or i think a common term that people are coalescing around is spot sales. those are incidental, right? they go up and down and they have market acceptance.
we're going through that as well. but to start something like that, you have to focus the team on addressing that for the market. it is not just something you, you know, software that you're selling. you're selling hardware and software and partnerships.
so, it would take quite a lot of effort. and i wanted to make sure that the company focused on the strategic side of it because we do have a significant advantage. and i'm just more enthusiastic about it after munich than ever. i mean, clearly, from a hardware standpoint, we're heads and shoulders above in size and performance than anybody else, and cost advantages, and the key features.
so, we really have all the things that everybody was looking for. and anybody that read anything about it or visited the munich show, again, can probably like, you know, attest today is where, you know, our competitors are showing things that are the size of like a vhs, you know, recorder. and here we are, a vhs cassette. you know, so, the sensor size, the cost, the technology.
we actually are ahead than our competitors. and it's obvious to the market right now. so, therefore, for us to focus on the biggest opportunity in the world right now in this space, i think, is the most prudent thing that we're doing. as far as the sales, yeah, those are things that, you know, are there but we want to focus the team on the big thing, given the fact that next 16 months are going to be very, very active.
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
great. thanks. and last question for me. so, you talked about burning $10 million to $11.5 million next quarter.
i imagine that's going to [audio gap] quarter as the hiring picks up pace and the investment in this sales and in engineering and everything else. so, you know, talk -- that, you know, equates to somewhere to the tune of, you know, 50-ish million between now and the end of next year in kind of cash burn so, you know, last quarter, you talked about having exhausted half the current atm, you know, and that you thought that it was important to have a lot of cash on the balance sheet [audio gap] serious and in here for the long term or whatever. so, what level of cash is necessary? and just maybe some of the thought process on why you didn't tap the atm in the current quarter. thanks.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think with the -- just to say on this, we would like to use the balance of it but we just don't have any definitive plans. and as -- in the quarter, we just didn't have, you know, open windows for us that we thought were -- made sense at the time.
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
thanks. and is there a level of cash that you feel like you wouldn't want to go below or anything like that? or is that, you know, so far below what you currently have --
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yeah. i don't have a specific number in mind. but i think, you know, what will we see is a change in the conversation, you know? when some of these conversations were happening before this atm and the raise that we did in q2, the going nature of the company, and our longevity was an issue and that seems to have become now a -- not an issue. and so, we just want to be mindful of making sure that that's the way the company appears and the company stays that way.
to state the obvious, people want to do business with people that are going to be around for years. right, glenn?
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
mmm hmm. great. that's it for me. thanks, guys.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
ok. thanks, glenn.
operator
the next question comes from sam peterman with craig-hallum capital group. please go ahead.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for taking my question. i just thought i'd ask one or two on lidar to start here. you guys probably saw the gm had an investor day the other week and they talked a lot about their new ultra cruise product, which i believe is going to standardize lidar at least into certain models that are featuring ultra cruise.
so, just curious that you just talk about, you know, any more -- or i guess, just in the industry broadly. are you seeing more oems wanting to adopt lidar? can you talk about kind of how the trend is changing there over the last few months, especially that gm announcement the other week? thanks.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yeah. that's a good question. i think the eye-opening part is actually public. so, if, you know, munich was one of the first auto shows since covid, so let's not forget that.
you know, every oem, every tier 1, if you visit them, every model they were showing, they would show where a lidar would be placed inside the car. and in most cases, some of the lidar they were showing were not even in operation. they were just showing like a mockup. but it clearly showed that every part they're talking about that would have these higher-level adas safety features, there's a lidar as a central features part of that.
and now, you're talking about oems that ship in the tens of millions of units per year. so, you know, their strategy is pretty well-known in oems that support them. every one of those oems, that the top tier 1 oems and the mid-tier 1 oems, they all had a lidar as part of their product offering. so, it's everywhere, you know? i think, you know, adas safety is coming as more battery-operated electric vehicles become commonplace.
higher levels of safety is a central feature. that is the real value proposition for them and lidar would be required for them. so, i think like the ultra cruise is an interesting product. you say it's standard but yet it's selected lidar.
but if you look at the features of standard cruise -- the ultra cruise, i mean, the ultra cruise is needing the lidar actually. so again, it's starting to happen in the premium models. but over the period of the next several years, we'll start seeing it across the board on different programs.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. that's great. and then just talk about the munich show. i mean, when oems are showing, you where -- the lidar was going.
obviously, there's a lot of spots that different oems seem to be looking at, whether that's windshield or roof or in the headlamps or, you know, on the corners. is there any particular place that, you know, microvision's lidar couldn't go? are there particular places that you think you integrate well into? any color on that?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
well, with the smaller size that we have, we can be in a lot of different places. so, that's one of the nicer options for the design teams. let's not forget cars are -- beautiful cars have to have a certain shape and line to them. so, the design teams are very particular about what they want to incorporate.
and having a lidar that can fit into the headlamp, behind the windshield, within any part of the body gives a lot of flexibility. and that's actually important -- a huge, important -- a huge benefit to our technology that nobody else can demonstrate working today. and they are years away from that -- from anybody's speculation.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. thanks for that perspective. and i think last one for me. there's been, you know, continued activity in the industry with, you know, new lidar companies coming public and acquisitions being made and, you know, quantities trying to go public with the optical phased-array technology and, you know, ouster just bought sense, which is making flash lidar.
i guess my question is do you guys see a trend toward kind of next-gen technologies taking hold at all? or do you think the, you know, the mems approach that you're going with is still more than sufficient and it's going to beat those technologies?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
i mean, not because that i get the option to lead a mems-based company. but honestly, i can say that mems technology will see a lot of traction because it's the most obvious thing that can scale, has to be cost-effective, and something that will show the reliability for, you know, 15-plus years' worth of life, which is what's required for safety. so, we think about all kind of different steering systems, optical phase array, flash-based, all of them have benefits but all of them have detriments. you really have to do a cost analysis and a risk analysis of what will happen.
you know, a question that came up recently and i think i want to add that here is like, you know, somebody asked me what about the flash-based technology, right? isn't that better? you know, it have a global shutter and some rolling shutter. well, most of things in your life are rolling shutter, by the way. but put that aside. imagine two vehicles and they're flashing at each other.
dropping one single frame, dropping several frames, that actually causes a problem with the software, right? so, you need significant more software to be able to fill in the gaps. and again, now you're leaving the realm of actual data versus something that's oppressing. how do you believe it? you would need redundancy, you need more software. effectively, the system cost goes up.
and those flash-based systems are running at 24 hertz. and that's considered, you know, cutting edge. but everybody wants 30 hertz. thirty hertz is at the latency where the automotive system is more effective than a human.
so, when you think about 10-hertz system, 15-hertz system, the question all with this is like well, aren't they all the same? the answer is like, no. this is all about latency. how much better is the system is responding at speed to a human. and if the other latter systems at lower frame rates are not able to actually show that working, that's a big advantage we'll have.
so, i think consolidation, that will continue happen. i think if, you know, somebody is making a bad and it's spad array and wants to spend hundreds of millions dollars' worth of investment to make custom pixels, custom spads, and investors want to support it, more power to them, right? our story is much simpler. you know, the stuff sells itself. you know, i'm not even a good sales guy, i would say.
i open up the thing and i show them inside and remind them everything in here is things you know. there's plastic, there's metal, there's known silicon technology that's at 200-millimeter wafer, sensor technology at 300-millimeter wafer, lasers that you can buy. it's all the stuff that you know. it's stuff that they have in their vehicles now.
what's magical about it is, you know, how microvision uses our ip to develop a product. therefore, the cost-effective nature of it and the scalability is there. it makes it much more palatable to them that, you know, these are things that they understand and know. think about in new technology.
you know, phase array, you know, metamaterials. i mean, goes on and on. the path for those things is going to be harder because they're more novel. the path for microvision is going to be less because it's proven technology.
so, i believe strongly that the path that we have chosen is going to bear fruit.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. thanks for the perspective. that's all for me.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] i'll now turn the call back to steve holt to begin answering submitted questions through the webcast.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
ok. we're going to respond to some of the 150-plus questions we've also received via email. many of the questions are variations on the same topic and maybe the questions were addressed in our prepared remarks. we tried to consolidate these questions down on the same topic to address the basic issue.
we won't be able to answer every question submitted but we will go through some of them here and then we'll open up the call to investors. so, first question is, ""sumit, can you give some detail on why you think microvision lidar sensor is best-in-class?""
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
so, i think i covered this in the call today and the last question of sam. but let me iterate that. so, let's think about like four categories in which, you know, you want to sort all the sensor companies and figure out like what's best about them. believe it or not, for oems, the no.
1 is actually cost. every conversation starts with understanding scalability of the technology and what will be the cost for the sensor, but really the cost of the delivered system that will deliver the adas to them. so, there's things, from a cost standpoint as i just said, right, things inside that are predictable. so, when we actually talk about some cost numbers, projecting the future level of economy at scale, it's much more believable.
there's no fantasy, there's no -- these are things that we verify because there's fabs out there, you know, these things are pretty easily reconciled. but the cost of a system is the interesting part. so, think about when you have a vehicle like this. you have a lidar, you'll have, you know, some, you know, lower quantities of other sensor stacks, including radar and camera modules and the etu.
ultimately, our lidar with a high resolution, some of the features, key features that we've developed allows the system cost that they are forecasting today to be reduced. and through our partnership with our global consulting management companies, what we found is that our system put inside a level 2+, level 3 would be actually competitive to today's prices offered by camera module-based systems. so, think about the cost competitiveness. you know, we have advanced technology that is competitive today, which is also the bigger market.
that means that the market that microvision's technology could address is significantly wider than just what's in the future for level 3 or level 2+. so, cost is a big one. so, i would say clearly like, you know, very, very confidently i can say this in a checklist that very, confidently that when it comes to cost, best-in-class. hands down.
next one is size, right? so, as i said, you know, people still want to buy vehicles. and if they buy a vehicle, the design of the car is actually important, right? the beauty of it is still in the lines of the vehicle. so, having a sensor that meets the cost requirements and fits inside the body of the car in all different places based on what the oem need for flexibility, that's important. and this was apparent when we were at the show that, you know, everybody, all our competitors showing up hardware publicly.
the no.1 thing when any oem or tier 1 visited us that if one of the first response to them was like, ""wow. it really is very nice and small and tiny."" and we went through and talked about it and they were very impressed. you know, seeing the live demo, seeing some of the other road testing data that we demonstrated and the hardware there, you know, i think -- so, clearly, like the size of it actually makes a big difference and it's a big advantage for us. anybody that's been in hardware industry will tell you that if you're showing a hardware and like our competitors' words that are significantly larger, these -- that take several years and significant amount investment.
but for us, we're already there. so, that's another big advantage that we have. so again, i would consider it best-in-class because of that and that's was demonstrated publicly as well. the third one of course, you know, it does matter what the features are, it does matter the range and the points of density, and the frame rate, and things like that in the field of view.
you know, we have labored -- our team has labored on defining these features and executing on them. and i can honestly tell you, years ago, you know, 2019, when i actually went on the road and actually shared these features we intended to create with these oems. first of all, they were surprised that we actually had such a deep understanding of what was required. but after that, they were actually really impressed that anybody could even take on audacious goal to produce something like this.
so, we did it. we demonstrated it. and i think the impression is now that having these features inside, it is reasonable for them to actually say that other sensors as part of the stack could be removed, therefore reducing the overall system cost. so, if you have a lidar that allows to reduce not just the future cost of our lidar but also their system, that's what basis economy of scale, that's what they will have more models that they can actually put this on to.
so, that's an exciting thing. so, this is how we think about features, right? it's not about, you know, this feature versus x feature. you know, one oem may value range more, the other one values resolution more, the third one may value some combination, right? we can support all of that from the same hardware. that's a very, very big thing.
we're not tied down. so, as we mentioned, right? our team works very hard to polish the features and make sure that the oems stay, they get to see what's important to them. and from the same hardware, you know, we're able to do that. so, that's actually a -- that's a pretty big win for us.
so, again, best-in-class. we don't have to develop a new product to satisfy their needs of understanding what's possible. the last one i would say, maturity technology. so, as i said, things that i'm talking about, things that this company has had have a long history.
we have history with, you know, big companies like microsoft and sony and others that we have demonstrated at scale. so, really, regardless of, you know, how much revenues companies generated in its history, the core technology maturity has been demonstrated. and that's actually a big part because that makes it believable. that makes something -- that's a partnership that people would want.
so again, i believe very strongly that, you know, our maturity technology is significantly higher for a silicon-based system. you know, people can have galvos and other kinds of beam-sharing technologies, but none of those are as mature as it's cost-effective. so, if you take all of these four legs of the table, you need all four to have a very, very secure product and, you know, to make the claim you're best-in-class. and i'm very confident that i can say that, you know, we are best-in-class compared to any lidar company out there at the moment.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
second question is -- on a previous call, we've talked about our ability to output axial, lateral, and vertical velocity of moving objects. and other lidar companies seem to be making similar claims about those abilities. so, what can you tell us about microvisions capabilities and the capabilities of others in this space?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
it's a good question actually. so, the no.1 thing to think about is the latency we talked about. the low-latency systems. so, the 30-hertz number is very important.
for safety, you're going to have to do -- make decisions faster than the human would and you need a system that's operating at around 30 hertz, where -- that's about what, 33, 34, maybe 35 milliseconds. and the refresh rate is so fast, it's important to see everything in the field of view and to be able to predict what would happen in the next 30 milliseconds. giving that information to the central computer allows them to predict what to do with the maneuvering that they're about to start. how much to steer? which way to go? slow down, speed up.
these decisions have to happen at a very, very fast pace. so, velocity is actually a very big component of it. so, in a lidar, just knowing exactly where the point cloud is is very important. but additionally, and probably more important is exactly where the velocity of that cluster of point cloud is going.
you may not know if it's a motorcycle or a mini cooper or a escalade. it does not matter. it matters that those cluster point clouds do predict where they will be in the next 30 milliseconds, 60, 90, and so on. so, as you're maneuvering, you can predict where you will end up and is there any way you can avoid them.
so, if you think about these prediction things -- velocity is a big part of it. the way we do velocity, of course, is we have high frame rate. we, you know, we have our software that's going to be, you know, of course, they can dance down into our asic eventually. velicity output is happening continuously.
cluster velocity output is going to happen continuously. and we're also going to be able to give lateral and axial, meaning in the direction of the motion of your vehicle and 90 degrees to it. you need both of these components. the third one, vertical is a little -- because, you know, cars don't bounce up and down too much but, you know, it'll be there but it will be kind of noisy.
if you only have one of those, your prediction is always going to be off, so you need more sensors. so, your sensor stack cost goes up. but from a single sensor, we're able to do both axial and lateral, and that is a first. and so far, we have not seen anybody talk about it at 30 hertz to be able to do that.
so, i'm not really sure if i've actually seen any lidar company claim that at 30 hertz, they can do both, which is what the oems have required.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
all right. next question is about just asking generally about employee morale at microvision. so, you know, first, we have a really great team in microvision. you know, sumit and i are always amazed at the capabilities and the creativity and the dedication of the people here.
we think morale is good and we're really thankful that, you know, turnover has not been a big issue for us. and so, we think morale is good. the next question is on the atm. just lots of different questions about the atm.
as i said in my prepared remarks, the atm gives potential customers and suppliers, employees, and prospective employees confidence in our ability to be a long-term partner in the automotive lidar space and that is important and -- when we're talking about the businesses we're talking to. and then also, the atm with craig-hallum was not used in the third quarter and $70 million remains available on it. as i said, last quarter, we'd like to complete the raise on that atm. we don't have any definite plans as to when we would do that.
i'll also point out that under the atm agreement with craig-hallum, craig-hallum is not allowed to short microvision's stock. ok. there's some general questions about the iaa auto show in munich. you know, any additional color you can provide about it and the response we received? i know we've talked about this a fair amount.
i don't know if there's anything else you have to add.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
no, i think steve in his remarks, he put it the best that the reaction that we had hoped, that we expected to get, we received it across the board. very welcoming to show it publicly and, you know, get a lot of praise from, you know, oem and tier 1. so, it was a great experience.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
next question relates to other verticals. and people who talk about other verticals with us are typically talking about augmented reality or interactive display products. and what's the status of these verticals? are you actively pursuing or investing in them now?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
now, as we've shared in the previous calls, you know, our focus and effort has remained on the automotive. since i've taken over, i think i've been pretty clear about it for the last 18 months. but i've also said that, you know, we are -- i believe that we are so far ahead in those verticals to anything that the market is offering and we stand ready to work with any partner as they come along. you know, we are -- we put together our bd team.
as you know, we've just hired our first vp of bd in -- under my tenure in germany. and, of course, we're also looking to, you know, expand that in the us. so, i think as these markets are developing, you know, we stand ready. we know all the players, they know us.
but right now, our focus remains solely on the automotive lidar, given the fact the opportunity is so big and it is right in front of us.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
it was a good segue. the next question was about the business development staffing and, you know, first, is as sumit said, thomas luce coming on board has been a big -- he's making a big impact already and we're just really excited that he's with the company. and he's working on adding to the european team and sumit said we're continuing to look for folks to expand the north american team in the near future. and then what can you tell us about how lidar operates in inclement weather?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
it's a good question. so, just let me get some context. so, if you think about systems that are shipping right now-- --  they are -- there are some level of sensor fusion. what i can tell you depending on the oems vehicle that you have, they all have some restrictions.
based on a weather condition, you can't use the feature. so, because the regulations right there, some limitations of what features, you know, what -- within what ways they can be operated. so, those are part of today's reality. as you can imagine, that's, you know, that's not going to go, right? effectively, if you're going to have a adas safety feature, it has to work always.
if airbags work all the time, your abs brakes work all the time, so therefore, a adas feature has to work all the time. when you think about a lidar -- so, this question i got quite often also at -- in munich. these are 95-nanometer laser, what happens in the rain? i think i've answered this before. the density of point cloud is so high that if, let's say, there was a raindrop that hits one of our pulses and that one is gone, there's still significant amount of other pulses that, you know, you can drive and you will still get, you know, very high-quality data.
unless you were driving in like a sheet of water like a waterfall, right? that's not realistic, let's be honest. so, lidars by themselves are going to be able to operate that. there is no magic saying that 95 will not be there. what i can tell you is the most investment and the most interest people get is when i say the word that we have 95-nanometer lasers.
so, oems that have looked at this problem are not shying away from that because they do understand that this is a sensor fusion problem. that, you know, once we have our software integrating radar and, you know, and them integrating other parts of it goes to products by themselves, they can be significantly more valuable because they will solve the problem redundancy and you will still have the sensor that's able to provide it. so, when you think about radars and resolution, those are actually big things. so, when you have a company that says, well a million points per second is good enough.
you know, we're looking good here. that's not true actually because that's not what oem wants. and consistently, i can tell you we all just get, you know, these rfis and i recently saw one where they wanted even a high resolution, they to explore it. and of course, you know, we want to support that and our system can do that when we, you know, we respond to those.
and it's amazing to me that, you know, weather, you know, it's an issue now. would a regulatory body ever let this system be operational in whiteout snow conditions? i can't answer that. that's really for the regulate -- regulatory bodies, right? but you can imagine that over a period of time, these sensor suites are going to be -- asked to be more and more sophisticated. but as we sit today, there is no impediment for us to see a path to adoption.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
ok. and the last question we have before we take some more live questions related to lidar software and -- what can --  you know, we've -- you've talked about the lidar -- the software component of our product. you know, what can you tell us about our lidar software?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
so, our lidar software. this is the key, you know, this is a very bright jewel in the crown for microvision. this is something that all of us should care a great deal about and i'm very, very excited about this. we're working on something that would allow oems to start evaluating a system where more of the load from their computing can be shifted into our asic, to our algorithms that we've already developed., that we are going to develop and we're going to actually demonstrate.
and this is what the exciting news about the june 2022 timeline that i talked about previously and also touched upon today is that actually is a very, very big deal for us in the future. and having a big software component besides our hardware component makes the company a lot more valuable. so, having our custom asic and software story getting solidified, that's important to all of us. so, what's in those features? i think it's more -- we're going to demonstrate it.
i think, you know, we don't want our competition to listen to our earnings call and understand what features are coming in the future. but i can clearly say that i think i hope i've demonstrated over the last 18 months that i have a good insight into what's happening to this  industry and i can say with confidence that we are on a very good path and our global management consulting partner also has vetted this out with us, of course, but also with oems. and they strongly, you know, agree with me that this is something that is going to be pretty impressive.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
right. thanks. ok. let's now take some live questions from investors.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] the first question comes from tai bordner with -- he's a private investor. please go ahead.
unknown speaker
ok. thanks. hey, first of all, congratulations to steve and also david allen for your impending retirement. so, thanks for everything you guys have done over the years.
appreciate that. sumit, you've -- in your prepared remarks, you referenced a focus, which i think is on oems. you know, i would say versus tier 1s or even mobility as a service companies. maybe you can help add some color to that.
and also, i think you have labeled it, just in terms of the labeling, strategic versus direct. maybe you can also, you know, label from -- or put some color into that -- those words as well.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
ok. so, when you think about the oem, of course, you know, those are the cars that people buy. tier 1 oem are connected. no company is going to be able to ship their product directly to the oem.
they're going to have to work with a approved tier 1 to supply, because the tier 1 is the one that actually does the manufacturing of most of the modules for the oem. so, our go-to-market strategy is pretty straightforward and similar to lots of other people. we focus our energies and our efforts and our attention toward oem to make sure they understand the gravity of the problems that we've already solved for them. and we also work with tier 1 because we know at some point we're going to have to have a tier 1 partnership that we expect to be favorable to microvision after all the innovations that we've done that allows us to ship that product for oem programs.
we are not endeavoring to become a tier 1. that's just not -- that's not who we are and that's what anyone should be thinking about. that's -- no, people can think what they want. but that's not what we're going to think about.
but whenever you talk with oems, they always want to know, you know, your structure and how you'd want to work with tier 1 in that case and we're well-aligned with their expectations. so, think about oem and tier 1 together.
unknown speaker
ok. i'll --
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
they are focused on adas. i'm sorry. go ahead, tai.
unknown speaker
no, no. right. right. right.
adas. adas, right. but it's a little confusing. so, ultimately, i guess it sounds like you pitch to the oems but then almost you -- they direct you to the tier 1s for, you know, i don't know, manufacturing production.
is that right? or, you know, how should we think about that?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yeah. i'm not to comment on that because, you know, every tier 1, you know, think about this. there's a certain amount of margin they're going to pay. you think -- i think we've done some great work here.
our goal is to be part of that and make sure that the margin stacks in our favor, right, tai? so, you know, that's where -- what you want to do is if you want to get -- you get adopted, if, you know, if the oem believes that you have the right solution for what they need and they want to work with you and your technology, there's a thing called directed buy. you know, a tier 1 will have to work with you and strike a deal that makes sense, right? and, you know, none of these deals that anybody would do or we would do in the future would be exclusive on one tier 1. so, we would find the most favorable deal for our investors, and oems know this as well. but the important thing is they don't adopt because just of one factor, right? and a tier 1, they themselves don't know which one to pick.
they want the oem to make the choice and they want to go work out a deal. so, as i said, you're part of a group, you're going to be in the stack and get to work with them and there'll be other partnerships you have to prepare for.
unknown speaker
ok. all right. it sounds like you got to convince the oem --
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
no. before we go on, i want to add one more thing. so, your first question was what about mobility as a service. so, this oem-tier 1 is adas.
mobility as a service company are primarily focused on autonomous driving. level 5. and they're much more aspirational as in like that could be 10 or 20 years before real products will be fielded out there or six years in trucking or three years, you know, whatever number some of these companies are saying, ok?
unknown speaker
ok.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
they're too different. but the biggest prize, known biggest prize that get confirmed by multiple people globally is the oems. nine million to 100 million cars --
unknown speaker
ok. is that --
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
expanding in the next five years.
unknown speaker
yeah. it sounds like you got to convince the oem or oems that, you know, you're the right product and then they sort of direct the tier 1s to go and make it all happen. is that kind of right?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
that's correct. yes.
unknown speaker
yeah. ok.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yep.
unknown speaker
second question i have is you used the term partnerships. you said partnerships will be -- looking at your prepared remarks, partnerships will be required with oems and tier 1s and others in their stack to be able to deliver a solution. and then you also, in the very next sentence, talked about a huge amount of consolidation. so, maybe you can comment on what do you mean by partnership exactly.
and then you referred to consolidation again. so, maybe talk about both of those.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
if you think about partnerships, i think, you know, how will people trade and partner with each other. you know, clearly, you know, we develop the hard drive, invest a lot of money in it, we develop software, invest a lot of money. silicon, lots of this is in our ip. and all companies are looking for recurring revenue that support, you know, significant multiples to their market cap, right? obvious thing i'm say here, we are a high-growth company so it's kind of important for us to strike a business, set a business deal that allows us to actually stand up for that.
so, when i think about partnerships, it's about how do you partner with each other. if we are the ones that are developing the technology and we're the experts at it, right, how will we participate of how that thing gets manufactured. how does revenue gets, you know, split. you know how does the margin get spread, right? but we want to be in controlling.
i believe by us owning all our ip, we are in a controlling position and we have to just, you know, demonstrate to the oem how we can, you know, partner with them and solve their problems for them or already have solved their problems for them.
unknown speaker
all right. yeah, go ahead.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
so, on the second part of your question actually, i just recalled there's another part of the question i did not answer yet. but --
unknown speaker
well, on the very next sentence in your prepared remarks, the very next sentence --
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
consolidation.
unknown speaker
on consolidation. yeah, right.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
all right. microvision is a public company. so, at any given time, if somebody feels that, you know, like somebody is looking for a lidar company, a big company with lots of money, i think we're available. and if the gravity of the problem you saw determines what the future growth of the company would have been, i know, i mean, think about thermal value to be established right now but the market is just so big.
so, for us to work feverishly hard and why focus all our attention to the oem. to get that recognition is more valuable to our shareholders than any kind of spot sales or direct sales like i talked about. so, why focus the company on that? because establishing that, you know, by doing that, our products, our technologies would have a 10-year or multiple years' worth of -- decade's worth of future. that has more value to the shareholders.
direct sales, yeah. we're going to direct sales, right? but those are spot sales, you know, those are periodic and nonrecurring.
unknown speaker
ok. ok. last question. so, in your investor place interview the other day, you said we -- investors need to remain patient, which, you know, as a long-term investor, that makes sense.
but, of course, we're all looking for, you know, a deal, right? without respect, though, to a deal, what, you know, what are some milestones or events that we can, as an investor -- investors, we can use to track progress over the next near to mid term?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
i think we're just going to focus on the oem business. and as things materialize, tai, we're going to talk about it publicly. but if there was, honestly, if there's anything that i wanted the shareholders to track that would be valuable, i would have put it in the call today.
unknown speaker
ok. all right. thank you. appreciate it.
steve holt -- chief financial officer
the next question comes from james groninger with -- who is a private investor.
unknown speaker
my question concerns any developments that you may have made to date on nonrecurring engineering. does that look like an area you can use to focus on the oems? and as, you know, working on several nonrecurring engineering programs may be a way for you to develop some simpatico or some credibility as those move forward. or you have kind -- have you kind of dropped that strategy?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
no. i said the go-to-market strategy is that we're going to face them, we're going to work with them and show them the solution. i expect there may be some -- may -- maybe some nonrecurring engineering programs that may come along. so, i don't think that we have put it aside.
i think we are actively pursuing any kind of engagement with oems.
unknown speaker
ok. thank you.

now, i would like to turn the call over to sumit sharma. 
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
thank you, drew, and welcome, everyone, to this review of our 2021 fourth quarter and full year results. 2021 was an incredible year in microvision's history. our team completed our best-in-class a sample, which is the foundation of our four products we announced in september in munich. with that announcement, we solidified our oem and tier one engagements and started aligning to their program timelines for 2025 and beyond.  we enjoy a continued validation of our core technology and revenue with a major oem as we disclosed last august, focused on ar market for commercial and military applications.
microvision has real-world evidence that showcases our significant advancements over the competition, while being cost competitive at the same time, truly a win-win for the industry. we also ended the year with the strongest balance sheet in our company's history. i expect 2022 to be another incredible year in our journey and i would like to update you on three topics. first, our technology platform.
second, our go-to-market momentum; and third, our competitive outlook. we continue advancing our technology platform with the introduction of our edge perception software on a dynamic new lidar product. this is a very important extension of our intellectual property that we believe will give our adas solution an advantage over every other solution. by creating algorithms that would output obstacle versus free space clusters with associated velocities, we expect our solution to enable oems to significantly simplify their overall system architecture and reduce costs.
this year, in q2, we expect to deploy lidar test vehicles in u.s. and germany for track testing, high-speed highway pilot test scenarios. in q3, we expect to complete class one certification with external test facilities of our dynamic new lidar. in q4, we expect to start strategic sample sales of this integrated hardware and software product to oem and tier one partners.
demonstrating a solution for a true highway pilot system at a competitive cost will clearly differentiate us from all other lidar companies and prove why we believe we will be delivering a best-in-class adas solution to the market. to put it simply, between q2 and q4, the performance and capabilities of our adas solution will come into focus and be ready for oem adoption. now, i would like to provide an update on our go-to-market momentum. we remain focused on promoting our solution directly to oems.
the market has heard a lot of things about so-called partnerships between oems and other lidar companies. as we understand, these partnerships do not represent any purchase commitments for production in 2025 and beyond. we believe being an incumbent in the lidar sensor market does not offer an advantage if the solution that is proposed would have a vehicle's resembling taxis with big notches in body styling or odd-looking cutout in the front grill design. the location in the grill reduces advantages of a lidar sensor.
oems and tier ones continue to seek solutions that will solve lp problems at an acceptable cost. cars have always been about style, beauty and technology. our low-profile sensor with its capability to enable highway pilot is setting a high bar for our competitors. we are focusing on developing our solution for oems needed rather than hype.
our company is the only one that has delivered to a global oem a key product with actual experience scaling for cost and reliability. so far, oems and tier ones have provided positive feedback on our architecture and path. oems are very engaged in the adas market. they articulated to us the monumental shift in mobility that they are focusing on, what technology they need and how the path to success is still wide open.
the recent multibillion-dollar transaction in the market for an adas company is indicative of the once-in-a-generation opportunity this represents for oems and microvision. i am confident that our go-to-market strategy remains sound and that we are positioned to capitalize on the growth in demand for adas solutions from oems. finally, i would like to update you on our competitive outlook. we've had the opportunity to present our technology to oems and tier ones and talk about our sustainable strategic advantages.
we have learned through these conversations that the most important thing to every oem is the ability to deliver a high-cost competitive solution for l3 and l2+ with the most advanced features for ensuring safety. i can say with confidence that for every oem meeting we have attended; the specifications of our sensor exceeded their requirements and the specifications offered by any other lidar company. with our technology, oems do not need to choose between high resolution at long range or high resolution in near field. this is unique to our technology.
our dynamic view lidar gives the highest resolution at range and the near field simultaneously. our technology has additional advantages like low latency output with lateral and axial velocities all within a single system. no other lidar company can provide all the specification in a single sensor. therefore, we feel confident that none of the partnerships for other lidar companies are set in stone.
additionally, oems will also get our edge process point cloud, which is segmented for obstacle versus free space clusters. our hardware is also built with standard components that are scaled and are not exotic. this is a charm of our technology and ip. we utilize automotive qualified cost-competitive components.
with the addition of our mems modules, digital analog asic and software, can deliver the highest performance at the most cost competitive levels. so far, our competition does not meet the cost, size or performance needed to achieve high speed highway pilot features that oems are focused on. we continue to maintain a strong competitive edge. i want to conclude my portion of the remarks by reiterating a few key points.
one, 2021 was a very important and successful year for microvision in the delivery of our innovation, with oem and tier one engagements, real-world validation of our lidar and our very strong balance sheet. two, we are gearing up for an important highway safety test track work in second quarter of this year that will showcase exactly what our technology is capable of doing. we look forward to sharing this with you in the future. three, we are very focused on our go-to-market strategy, making the necessary investment in talent, sales and marketing to showcase the technology to oems and spotlight just how significant our competitive differentiators are in the market.
i want to conclude today by saying how proud i am of our team for delivering throughout 2021 and allowing us to position well for the incredible 2022 and beyond. i would like to now turn the call over to anubhav to talk about our financials.
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
thanks, sumit. based on the continued interest from the oems, it is clear that the automotive lidar market is a very attractive space. we're confident that microvision will play a critical role with oems, and that we have a sound business model. today, i'm going to be spending time focusing on two key topics.
topic no. 1, our business model and the resulting financial profile. topic no. 2, our 2021 financial results and 2022 outlook.
let's start with topic no. 1, our business model and the resulting financial profile. my goal here is to help our investors model microvision and build the framework of our financial profile once the company signs up a few agreements. let's start with slide five.
the chart on slide five represents the number of projected cars to be manufactured between now and 2030 that will include l2+ and l3 capabilities. if we assume that l2+ vehicles will require at least one lidar sensor and l3 vehicles to have at least two, using this assumption and an average asp or average selling price of $800, which was the median of asp estimates obtained after polling several industry experts, we estimate that the cumulative revenue opportunity for lidar sensors through 2030 is $80 billion. let's turn to slide six. this slide summarizes our cumulative revenue could be between $2 billion to $4 billion through 2030, with a corresponding cumulative ebitda profile of $1 billion to $2 billion once we're able to secure the partnership with the oems for our sensor units, to be included in their fleets.
both these numbers are potentially conservative and arrived at by assuming the asp to be 500 instead of 800 for every lidar sensor unit for these estimates. we estimate that the market share of microvision can start from 15% and gradually rise to 40% depending on the adoption by the number of oems. as i mentioned earlier, the end customers for microvision will be tier ones, which, in turn, will be supplying these sensor units to the oems. the revenue from tier one attributable to microvision will primarily come from two revenue streams.
no. 1, hardware. no. 2, software.
now, let's discuss the stream no. 1 hardware revenue. the hardware revenue stream starts once the directed by agreement has been secured with an oem and a manufacturing partnership has been established between the oem and tier one. this revenue stream can be modeled as a gross profit-sharing arrangement with the tier ones and microvision.
on an asp of $500, we believe that the gross profits will be in the 10% to 15% range for tier ones, gradually tapering off to 2030 as the hardware becomes more and more commercialized after mass production. we believe that microvision could be expected to share 50% of these gross profits with the tier one as revenue. this revenue stream is expected to grow with the number of lidar units being produced and delivered by the tier ones to the oems. the tapering of gross profit is very typical to any hardware product in its life cycle.
based on these parameters, we believe that the hardware revenue stream can be estimated to contribute approximately a quarter of the total consolidated cumulative revenue of $2 billion to $4 billion through 2030. let's talk about stream no. 2, the software revenue. the revenue model for this stream can be expected to be a fixed fee for every lidar unit delivered by the tier one to the oems for the proprietary software on microvision's custom asic.
we expect to be able to command 15% to 25% of the asp, 500 as this example, as this is the software engine that controls the hardware and associated sensor fusion with radar to build the world model for the oem. the software revenue stream will be expected to contribute the remaining three-fourths of the total revenue. unlike the hardware stream where gross profit would be expected to taper off with the increased adoption of lidar technology, software revenue per unit typically tends to remain consistent over time. to summarize, using these parameters, we estimate that the cumulative revenue could be potentially between $2 billion to $4 billion.
we believe that these estimates have two big potential upsides. no. 1, the average asp can be potentially higher than 500. and no.
2, if we add to this sam, the lidar sensors that is just needed for l2 vehicles on top of the l2+ and l3 vehicles, the market size increases considerably over $80 billion. let's talk about cost now. we believe that the largest cost for microvision to deliver the revenue is expected to be headcount as the business is expected to scale driven by the number of oem partnerships as no associated production costs and related risks are expected to be assumed by microvision. the number of partnerships with oems is expected to be the most important driver in scaling of the engineering resources.
in addition, there may be some increases required in sales and marketing efforts as the company scales this business. as a result of this, the ebitda profile of the company is expected to quite resemble that of a typical software company. with these general guidelines and assumptions, we estimated the corresponding ebitda to be $1 billion to $2 billion. these are illustrative figures should help you to quantify what success may look like for microvision through 2030.
please note that while these are not forecasts, i hope these assumptions help you understand why we are really excited about the future. we are truly transforming microvision's core technology to make the most prolific and advanced lidar solution out there in the market. now, let's move on to slide seven and eight and recap the following three very significant ways that we believe our lidar sensor hardware and perception software outperforms the competition. no.
1, the build in cost advantages. no. 2, the highway pilot capabilities with dynamic view lidar product at low latency and high resolution at range. and lastly, the proprietary software on custom asic powered by edge computing that provides free space clusters versus obstacles.
moving on to slides nine and 10 that just gave you a peek into how we're investing in the growth of our company and positioning the business as we scale the efforts with oems and tier ones. slide nine shows the lidar test vehicle, which will be fitted with our lidar technology. our team working to complete the track testing in q2 2022 in both the u.s. and germany.
slide 10 shows our investment in top-of-the-line r&d infrastructure and labs with the latest automation and reliability testing capabilities. now, let's discuss the second topic i mentioned earlier that i wanted to cover: 2021 financial highlights and 2022 outlook. let's walk through slide 12. we finished the year with $2.5 million of royalty revenue from microsoft.
as a reminder, this revenue is attributable to the contract executed in april 2017 with microsoft for using our technology in their ar display product. no cash was received for this revenue in 2021 as we received an upfront payment of $10 million at the contract signing. as of december 31, 2021, we had applied $4.7 million against the contract liability. during the year ended december 31, 2021, we applied $2.5 million against the contract liability with this customer.
for the revenue outlook for 2020, we anticipate that there will be another $2.5 million revenue to be recognized this year as the remaining microsoft contract liability winds down. in addition, we also plan to sell some lidar sensor units for strategic sales to oems and tier ones during the second half of this year. at the moment, we do not expect significant revenue from the direct sale of these lidar sensors. r&d expenses totaled $24.1 million compared to $9.8 million last year.
the increase was primarily driven by the higher noncash stock-based compensation. there was $6.1 million in 2021 compared to $0.7 million in 2020. backing out the stock-based compensation, the r&d expense on a cash basis was $18 million in 2021. this cash r&d spend was primarily due to our investment in adding more engineering resources to ramp up our effort with the oems and tier ones and the cost of direct materials to support the development of our products.
for the 2022 outlook on the r&d expense, we expect r&d on a cash basis to be slightly higher than $18 million in 2021. an increase in cash r&d this year will be driven by already implemented inflation-based increases to the payroll of our nonexecutive employees across the board in the u.s. to compete with the local labor markets. additionally, we also plan to add engineering resources as necessary to ramp up our efforts with oems.
we expect that there may be new stock-based awards to incentivize employees following the company's policies. an important component as we invest in our talent pipeline and motivate our employees to share the upside in the growth of the company. sg&a expense totaled $22.3 million for 2021 as compared to $5.9 million last year. the increase was primarily due to higher noncash stock-based compensation expense.
it was $9.2 million as compared to $0.6 million in 2020. another reason for higher sg&a was increased investment in professional and consulting firms to accelerate our business development efforts and higher business insurance costs. for the fourth quarter of 2021, sg&a expense was $6.5 million. during this quarter, we also invested over $2.5 million in engaging professional firms, consulting firms and other executive activities to ramp up efforts to promote and expand our business development and marketing efforts.
additionally, after backing out the stock-based compensation of $1.6 million from the q4 sg&a, cash sg&a for the quarter was $2.5 million, that translates into $10 million to $11 million for full year 2022. in addition to the above for sg&a, we will be investing our cash in several growth initiatives as discussed, including investments in business development in both the u.s. and germany. cash used in operating activities for the year 2021 was $29.4 million and cash used for additions to pp&e, i.e., capex was $2.5 million.
higher capex in 2021 was mainly driven by the increased r&d activities for the lidar product development and investments to upgrade our it and r&d infrastructure as the headcount almost doubled in h2 2021. we expect capex requirements to be lower in 2022 as compared to 2021. as a company, we have always sought to be very disciplined about using our cash to execute our strategic objectives. based on the 2022 outlook that i just described for cash burn and our current liquidity, i feel this positions us well compared to our peers whose burn rate is three to four times than ours.
now, let me give you an update on our atm facility. the company remains very strategic and focused on the shareholder value creation. in 2021, the atm program was mainly used in the first half of 2021 when the company raised $68 million of net proceeds issuing 4 million shares, taking advantage of the strong equity markets back then and strengthening the balance sheet. during the second half of 2021, there were no sales of shares that were executed under the atm program as the broader lidar equity markets, including most of our peers experienced overall weakness in the stock prices.
we finished the year with cash and cash equivalents of $115 million, including investment securities that gives us a strong liquidity position. given our current liquidity levels, we believe that we are well positioned to invest in some of the growth initiatives that sumit and i have talked about. let me summarize the themes from this update call for all our investors in three key points. no.
1, we're confident in our technology and looking forward to seeing it in the highway test track settings targeted in the next quarter. no. 2, we're excited about the business model that we're working toward, the strategic partnerships that we are looking to execute that could help us build a $1 billion to $2 billion cumulative ebitda business through 2030 in the future with a high growth profile. and lastly, no.
3, our current liquidity position and 2022 cash burn outlook positions us well with respect to our peers. with this, i would like to open the line for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question is from andres sheppard from cantor fitzgerald. please proceed with your question.
andres sheppard -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
hi. good afternoon and congrats on the quarter. my question is, i'm wondering, can you give us a little more color on highway pilot feature track testing and the class one certification. what are some things that we can look for that will be meaningful and to determine whether it's going well or it's not going well?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
i think i'll start with the second part first. i think class one is something that's part of our core technology. we've been at this for more than 20 years. as we develop our systems, class one is one of the foundational pieces our team works on.
to enable that in the automotive space using a 905-nanometer laser, we actually happen to have some very significant ip and patents filed for it. what we're expecting to do is to execute that in the product in the dynamic view lidar and actually go to an external party, not just a self-certification process, but go to an external third-party test site, get the full product qualification done in preparation for strategic sales -- to support strategic sales to oems and tier ones, as anubhav and i have mentioned. so class one is just an episodic thing where we're going to go through the process, the self-certification happens. and of course, as we go outside to a third-party lab, we're going to keep everybody in the market updated through q3 when the certification is complete.
the first part of your question, i think about the track testing. so track testing is -- there is no finish to wait. there's a long period of time that you have to keep testing to whatever the oems and tier ones most critical scenarios are. we've done a lot of work to gather data from them and our team is focused on a set of scenarios that are incredibly challenging to be solved at 130 kilometers per hour to make a level three system.
for a truly highway pilot, high-speed highway pilot system. so they have that focus, and we continue to plan for starting that testing. and by june, a tranche of work is going to be done that they are expecting. but what i actually expect is beyond that, as a matter of fact, 5 am.
this morning, that the work will be ongoing because there's interesting things that they always want to know. but we have a foundation of work that they feel is the most important to really differentiate our solution, lidar software hardware -- software solution from what they're seeing for highway pilot. so i hope that answers your question.
andres sheppard -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
yes, it does. that's very helpful. maybe one quick follow-up, if i may. regarding your go-to-market strategy.
in the past, you've alluded to the three pillars. and today, you've kind of explained a little bit more about maybe the main one, which is the direct relationships with the oems. but i'm wondering, can you maybe expand and give us a little more color on the other two, the tier one partnerships and the silicon partnerships? what are -- specifically, what are some things that you're going to be doing to pursue those partnerships? and what do you ultimately think will lead you to securing a lot of those partnerships?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
ok. so again, i'll answer the second part first. ultimately, the tier ones is who we're going to partner with. they are the ones that are going to  kepp the product and provide it directly to the oems, integrated in whatever form that's needed.
the silicon partnerships are important because that enables us, whatever domain controller and oem picks that a tier one is implementing, our sensor would have to plug in and effectively play with it. all the software stacks would have to be figured out and where you -- how your software goes to the stack would have to be established. so silicon partnerships are important, absolutely important that anybody that's making a level three domain controller, that your system plays nice with it and it's all implemented and it's a fluid system. partnering and promoting directly to the oem is actually very important.
and i can personally tell you that it's a step that they want to see. the tier ones necessarily do not have the technology because they do not have internal r&d to go bring the best solutions to the oem. so therefore, oems want to see the best solutions out there to enable their technology path. so the direct -- the go-to-market strategy we're doing directly marketing to the oems bears fruit when they actually start seeing what is it -- what's the best technology and how they could actually benefit from that and create a differentiated product for themselves compared to everybody else.
but ultimately, as we've always said, they will essentially -- there will be a directed buy agreement or some sort of way to go toward where we are going to partner with the tier one with the solution we're providing that the oem wants. and the silicon domain partnerships, of course, oems and tier ones identify that as a parallel path for themselves for domain controller, but we want to secure to make sure when that decision happens in parallel, our solution will play nice with it.
andres sheppard -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
got it. that's very helpful. thanks so much and congrats again on the quarter.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. and ladies and gentlemen, i'll now turn the call back over to anubhav verma to read questions submitted through the webcast.
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
thank you, jamie. so we've got a list of questions. so let me just run through them. the first question is, can you give us a sense as to what level of cash you feel is necessary to support the business? and why continue to keep the atm open? so let me answer that question.
as i described in my remarks earlier, our cash spent in operating activities was $29.4 million and capex $2.5 million in 2021. for 2022, we expect this cash basis -- r&d cash basis to be higher than $18 million for 2022. and for 2020, the sg&a expense to be $12 million plus some additional investment to pursue business development and marketing efforts. now, with a cash balance of $115 million, we have always sought to be very disciplined than our competitors.
we view the atm program is very strategic and focused on creating shareholder value. we raised atm in first half of 2021 when the stock prices were high for the broader lidar market. we have not used the program since then. however, the availability of atm gives us the required flexibility when we see active and interesting growth opportunities come our way.
the next question is, do you have sort of a target revenue level in mind? or when you expect to reach maybe breakeven on the operating income line or ebitda level? and is there a target revenue threshold that you're expecting or a time frame you're expecting to reach breakeven? i'll take this question as well. as i walked through earlier in my remarks, how to build a framework for the revenue of $2 billion to $4 billion and the $1 billion to $2 billion ebitda cumulatively through 2030, once the production commences, our business model will then resemble a software company, and hence as soon as production commences, revenue will quickly translate into ebitda for microvision. in the meanwhile, we expect to pursue single and doubles through strategic sales of sensor samples to oems and pursuing core development deals. what can we expect from the company's track testing by june 2022? sumit, would you like to take that?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
i think as i just previously mentioned, i think what to expect in the track testing is we have some test scenarios that the team is going to -- is working on, actually validating on a test track. additional testing as that comes along from oems and other parties, we will do that in germany and in the u.s. so we can create a body of work, so they can have some ground proof testing data, front track testing, and then, of course, follow that up with additional testing at their preferred test tracks. but it's really targeted -- it's not open ended, but it's targeted toward specific test scenarios that will demonstrate why we are able to achieve level three, or we can support potentially level three highway pilot features from our hardware directly.
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
sumit, next question is for you as well. how are oems thinking about the adas market?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
so i was actually pretty fortunate to be actually present in a lot of the oem meetings with our business development team. i mean, clearly said they're very engaged. their teams are very active. all the teams are very responsive and engaged with us in the broader market as well, i'm pretty sure.
but i think the best way to describe it is they see this as a very monumental, once-in-a-generation kind of opportunity to redefine mobility. and they recognize that as we start looking toward more ev vehicles coming out, the value proposition for them is shifting. and therefore, adas safety is going to be a big selling point in the future for vehicles. . if all the vehicles have the same level of performance, than the powertrain is not that important.
a company that has diesel or any kind of internal combustion engine technology, as you can see publicly is being stated that they are going down, right? they're seeing the sunset timeline for their technologies and battery vehicles are coming up. adas starts becoming a sort of a main tent pole that they have to rally around. and it is clear, just sitting there and talking and looking at the activity and looking at the interest that they are very, very active and they're very focused on understanding what's the best way to bring an adas solution to the vehicle. that's why the terms like cost competitive are actually ahead of your technology because the seriousness of it is not that prototype vehicle that's going to be done from marketing.
this is production vehicle they're looking for in the next wave. so the current wave is just more trying out and understanding the market, but the next wave of decisions, i believe, are focused on true production vehicles on multiple product lines.
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
the next question is also for you. please share where are you in recent discussions with oems and tier ones? and do you have any rfis, rfqs? can you quantify in terms of top 10 oems and tier ones that you're having conversations? and where those are in terms of stage of advancement?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
ok. so specifically, i don't think i'm going to name a name, but i think like as we've said, our focus is in germany and in u.s. right now. the top oems in the european union, germany specifically and the u.s.
that's a pretty big, pretty strong universe, a company that you're focused on, that we're focused on. as far as where we are, i think what i mentioned in our previous call was if you can look at it that the actual decision in rfqs and the hardcore work starts in early 2023, q1, i suppose, i think i said that. and in the meantime, what we're doing right now in 2022 is they're evaluating solutions. so track testing data, what we can do for a product, what's uniqueness about it, are we going to be cost competitive, what the strategy is going to be from manufacturing, who's our silicon partner, all those kind of evaluations sort of like the homework before you actually start going toward the decision is what we are in the middle of.
and so, i'm just going to say that in general, but i think as far things are concerned, i think we rather not mention names at this call, but you can imagine our expansion plans in germany to be closer to the oems that are there. and of course, in the u.s., we've said that publicly. so that's the universe.
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
thank you. the next question is also for you. my sense in the industry right now is that oems will soon be making decisions on lidar for production for the years 2024 or 2025. is that your understanding as well?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yes. so i think the data that we have so far, i think the next wave of production-ready vehicles that are like high volume compared to like the numbers that we have in our corporate deck to support that is 2025 and beyond. as you know, anubhav mentioned, right, we're modeling it out to 2030. but for model years out there is what the decision timelines are right now.
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
i'll take the next question. this is, will microvision final sale be to tier ones? so as we discussed during our go-to-market strategy discussions, this is an important piece of our business model. we're directly marketing our solution to oems to secure a directed buy agreement. once that's secured, our lidar solution becomes a part of the broader adas solution that the tier one is supplying to the oems.
we're not going to assume production risks and costs as tier one has already commercialized the broader adas solution, where our lidar product will become a part of it. this is why one of the competitive advantage of our product because our product will fit in within the requirement of what the oem is looking to do to build a world model. we're not seeking to displace the tier one or the oem's desire to control the camera module and other non-lidar sensor perceptions. sumit, next question is for you.
will your software run on chip platforms like qualcomm and nvidia? or is there another appropriate architecture?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
i think that's also in the corporate deck we put out. and let me be more clear about that one slide that's there. our software will actually run on our custom silicon digital soc within our system. and that will take the streaming point cloud and effectively do the obstacle versus free space clustering, velocities and other features, but it will be within our software stack.
and of course, the domain controller will have the world model generation, planning and maneuvering, which the oems and potentially tier ones will own. the domain controller, of course, is the big silicon companies like nvidia, qualcomm, nxp, ti, you can name it, there's infineon, right? those are intel, of course. they're going to focus on that. but our software will run on our soc, within our system, within our lidar.
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
thank you. i'll take the next question. is microvision actively pursuing or investing in non-lidar technology? this is a good one. we're actively pursuing and investing in the automotive lidar at this time, and we feel very confident about our strategy.
we believe the $80 billion revenue opportunity potential in the lidar space continues to be the most attractive space that will be monetizable. however, we believe there is significant value in our ar vertical as well. while ar remains to be an attractive market, at the moment, there is more focus on software than hardware. if there is an opportunity to tap into the ar market, we have products ready to go on that side and stand ready to support potential customers as and when needed.
i'll take the next question as well. what can you share about your process to identify potential strategic alternatives? so being a public company with a $115 million cash balance as of 12/31 and high average daily trading volumes, we're always focused on maximizing shareholder value. we work closely with our board to address potential transactions at appropriate valuations. global players and oems are aware of our capabilities and products in other verticals, and we stand ready to support their growth opportunities as and when they come along.
but as we have previously disclosed, we currently have no agreements or commitments to engage in any specific strategic transaction. i'll take the next question as well. where is the focus of your spend? and does it unlock extra capabilities? so as i discussed and highlighted in my remarks earlier as well, cash is being spent on growth. we increased our headcount to 97 people as of february 2022.
this is almost double of what -- where we were in march 2021 last year. we're expanding our engineering, business development and marketing teams in germany and u.s. to support potential customers to take us through the next phase of our growth as a company. so that's why i feel very excited about the future of microvision.
i think it looks like we're almost out of time. so these are all the questions we could get from online and from all the investor audiences. thank you for your time, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next quarterly update call.

sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
thank you, drew, and good afternoon, everyone. i'm excited to provide you with an update on our recent quarter, along with a look ahead to the back half of 2022. i'm thrilled to talk about our performance from the last quarter on our execution, momentum, and leadership role in solutions for highway pilot systems. the progress we have made over the past three months has made important foundations, which set us up for continued progress toward our 2022 goals and beyond.
first, we are executing on the go-to-market strategy outlined in january and remain on track. we remain committed to partnering with oems and securing directed by agreements with their tier 1s to provide the technology that will enable their adas systems, which unlock new highway safety features. we understand that oems are under pressure to deliver new-generation safety and driving experiences that will help them differentiate their products in the market that's being disrupted by consumer expectations for safety and autopilot features. our integrated hardware and software solution will allow them to deliver advanced highway pilot safety features.
microvision would retain the lidar hardware and edge perception software ownership while allowing them to retain control over the driving experience to differentiate their brand. we are getting aligned with their valuation schedules. our lidar sensor hardware is built entirely on technology and materials that oems and tier 1 suppliers already know, understand, and trust, making it easy to incorporate into their supply chain and with predictable cost to start serious production with auto grade quality of our optoelectronic products. our business model is built on partnering with oems and supporting them as lidar-based adas solutions are deployed across their fleets.
with our demo vehicles in us and germany ready by end of june, we expect to start strategic sales in the back half of the year. second, we're building momentum. the last few months have included some important milestones in our go-to-market plan. we completed as planned, an important round of track testing in march in detroit, michigan.
over the course of several days, we simulated several real-life driving scenarios at highway speeds. this is an important step toward commercializing our solution as it starts to demonstrate to oems the superior capabilities and benefits of the microvision hardware and software. through these tests, our engineering team was able to gather important ground truth data that will help us refine our software solution for their respective oem audiences. in the future, we expect to demonstrate our demo vehicles operating in full drive by wire mode and to autonomously maneuver such high-speed driving scenarios.
this is a big milestone for our team, and i'm very proud of their achievements. during this phase of testing, we continue to develop new software features that showcase our product to be at the next level beyond our competition. with our solution, we can detect wet growth surfaces that could lead to hydroplaning conditions at full frame rate. developing new features like this that enable detection of changing road conditions at high speeds, will help develop better and safer adas systems.
this is well beyond slower sensor fusion classification software our competitors are talking about. this is next-level feature set that none of our competitors have shown. the important thing to take away from this track testing as that delivering lidar data suited to high-speed highway driving scenarios is fundamentally different than city driving conditions. we understand better than most that success at hybrid scenarios means seeing further ahead at high resolution, painting a clear picture of what is and isn't drivable and enabling faster reaction times.
through this testing, we are demonstrating to oems that our solution is best suited to their needs that have we surpassed their already high standards, and we are in a class of our own compared to our competitors. with this momentum, we expect sample sales to start in the second half of this year, and our path to oem acceptance remains on track. last, we are positioned to take a leadership role in this space. over the last three months, we have been investing time and energy into how we communicated our value to oems.
we have been confident for a long time that we have the right combination of hardware, software, and business model that will enable automakers to develop next-generation adas features. microvision will remain committed to enabling oem success and paving the way for new high-speed highway adas experiences. that is our focus. looking ahead at the balance of 2022, i couldn't be more thrilled.
the recent track testing of our solution is just one in a series of important milestones that will bring us closer to securing oem partnerships. we will be completing additional testing in june time frame that puts our solution to additional highway speed, highway driving scenarios. we have existing plans for our product and form factors that will allow us to deliver on oem needs for flexibility. we will continue to work toward guiding and shaping new standards for what lidar-based adas solutions will need to deliver to enable the next wave of highway safety experiences.
before i hand the call over to anubhav, to go over the results and projections in more detail, i want to close by reiterating that microvision is continuing to innovate every day. we're executing on our go-to-market strategy. we're building momentum on securing oem partnerships, learning and evolving the way we communicate our differentiated value to oems and other stakeholders that are committed to improving highway driving safety just as we are. thank you.
now over to anubhav.
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
thanks, sumit. as sumit discussed earlier, we're really excited about the ongoing track testing of our integrated lidar solution with perception software. our goal was to demonstrate the density and low latency of our ultra-high resolution point cloud by simulating scenarios that drivers based on highways every day. we retrofitted a new 2022 jeep cherokee with our latest microvision lidar system, including our dynamic lidar sensor and a short to medium range center.
the lidar data captured from these sensors was fused with additional data captured from radar sensors mounted on the front bumper of the test vehicle. for the purpose of these tests, the lidar point cloud showing what parts of the road are drivable and nondrivable appear on a laptop in the backseat of the test vehicle. but ultimately, it's this ultra-high resolution point cloud data along with the rallidar and radar data feeds that would be fused together in our custom asic and passed along to the adas, allowing oems to create faster and more accurate safety features, along with their unique driving experience. now in this financial performance discussion, i would like to discuss two things.
topic number one, let me recap what we believe the key attributes of the business model can be once the medium and longer-term series production down targets with the oems are achieved. topic number two, the q1 2022 financial results and progress against the milestones. let's recap topic number one, key attributes of the business. the chart on slide 5 represents the number of projected cars to be manufactured between now and 2030 that will include the l2+ and l3 capabilities.
assuming l2+ vehicles will require at least one integrated lidar with perception software and l3 vehicles to have two of those. we estimate that the cumulative revenue opportunity for lidar sensors is $80 billion through 2030 using this assumption and an average selling price of $800. to estimate the cumulative revenue profile for microvision through 2030, we used an estimate of $500 as the asp. using this number and the number of cars to be produced through 2030, we believe the revenue opportunity for microvision could be cumulatively between $2 billion to $4 billion with a corresponding ebitda profile of $1 billion to $2 billion once we're able to secure the series production partnerships with the tier 1 and oem for our sensor units to be included in their fleets.
we estimate that the market share of microvision can start from 15% and a gradual rise to 40% depending on the adoption by the number of oems. our go-to-market strategy is to pursue oems and then strike series production partnerships with the existing tier 1s as only they have the experience to supply auto grade quality optoelectronic devices to oems. the revenue from tier 1s attributable to microvision will primarily come from two revenue streams, with the hardware contributing 25% of the total revenue and the remaining 75% of the revenue to be coming from the software. we do believe that these cumulative revenue and ebitda estimates have two big potential upsides.
number one, the average asp can potentially be higher than 500, especially in the initial years. second, if we add to this, the lidar sensors just needed for l2 vehicles on top of l2+ and l3 the market size increases considerably. please note that while these are not forecasts, i hope these assumptions help you understand why we are really excited about the future. we're working to transform microvision's core technology to make it the most prolific and advanced lidar solution out there in the market and believe that our lidar sensor protection hardware and software outperforms the competition on the following three parameters.
number one, build in cost advantages; number two, highway pilot capabilities with dynamic view lidar product at low latency and high resolution at range, and number three, proprietary software on custom asic powered by edge computing to provide free space clusters versus obstacles. now moving on to topic number two. let's discuss the current quarterly performance update and update on the milestones. we recognized $350,000 in royalty revenue from microsoft in the first quarter of 2022.
as a reminder, this revenue is attributable to the contract executed in april 2017 with microsoft are using our technology in their ar display product. please note that no cash we received for this revenue in 2022 as we received an upfront payment of $10 million at the contract signing in 2017. as of march 31, 2022, we have an unapplied $4.915 million left on the contract liability. as previously stated in our year-end results, we expect to recognize $2.5 million revenue for the entire year 2022 against this contract liability with microsoft.
we expect the revenue to be higher in the remainder of this year. in addition, we also plan to sell some lidar sensors for strategic sales to oems and tier 1s during the second half of this year. at the moment, we do not expect significant revenue from the direct sale of these lidar sensors. in terms of expenses, r&d expenses totaled $7.6 million compared to $4.5 million last year.
the increase was primarily driven by higher salary and benefits due to increased headcount, inflation-based salary adjustments for non-executive employees in the us, non-cash stock-based composition and higher non-direct labor-based expenses. sg&a expenses totaled $5.9 million in the first quarter this year as compared to $2.2 million last year. the increase was primarily due to higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense, higher professional services and consulting costs and increased headcount and payroll expenses. we continue to invest to accelerate our business development efforts and marketing efforts.
as we march toward achieving the milestones we laid out for 2022, we expect there may be new stock-based performance awards to incentivize our employees, an important component as we invest in our talent pipeline and motivate our employees to share the upside and the growth of the company. cash used in operating activities for the first quarter in 2022 was $10.9 million. this cash burn includes approximately $1.5 million of one-time non-recurring payments that impacted working capital. capex in this quarter was $0.9 million, which was primarily driven by one-time investments required in retrofitting of the cars with our integrated lidar for track testing.
we finished the quarter with a liquidity of $103 million, including investment securities. as interest rates have ticked up in the year-to-date period, we have added short-dated one-year treasury bills to capture some earphone market, and hence, our investment securities have gone up from $33 million at the end of december to $47.6 million at the end of march. from an outlook perspective, we expect 2022 cash burn to be moderately higher than 2021, as we scale the business and invest in the growth of the company. as a company, we have always sought to be very disciplined about using cash to execute our strategic objectives.
based on the current 2022 outlook and our current liquidity, we're well-positioned as compared to our peers whose burn rate ranges three to five times our cash burn. now let me give you an update on our atm facility. the company remains very strategic and focused on shareholder value creation. in 2021, the atm program was mainly used in the first half when the company raised $68 million of net proceeds issuing 4 million shares, taking advantage of the strong equity markets back 10 and strengthening the balance sheet.
during the second half of 2021, as well as the first quarter of 2022, there were no sales of shares executed under the atm program as the broader lidar equity markets, including most of our peers experienced overall weakness in stock prices. we expect to use this atm facility as a flexible tool to fund our growth plans as and when needed. now as we conclude our prepared remarks, let me summarize the themes from this business update call for all our investors. number one, we're confident in our technology and looking forward to complete additional testing in highway test track settings that are happening this quarter.
second, we're excited about the business model that we're working toward. the strategic partnership that we are looking to execute could help us build a $1 billion to $2 billion cumulative ebitda business through 2030 in the future with a high growth profile. and number three, our current liquidity position and 2022 cash burn outlook positions us well with regard to our peers. with this, i would like to open the line for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question is from andres sheppard of cantor fitzgerald. you may now go ahead.
andres sheppard -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
hey, guys. good afternoon, and congrats on the quarter. can you hear me ok?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yes, andres. thank you.
andres sheppard -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
wonderful. thank you. a few questions from my end. i wanted to go back to the feedback that you've provided in the past from your meetings with oems in germany.
and particularly, i was hoping if you can maybe give us some clarity on what were the one or two biggest selling points that resonated most with them? was it microvision's long history and experience with lidar? is it the predictable cost structure? is it the proprietary software on the custom asic. i'm just wondering what stood out to them the most in your opinion.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
i'll give you my impression, because i was present for most of those meetings. i think if you take a step back, what they specifically, was exciting is a piece of technology that has pedigree. there's a history to it. it's been deployed in other fields.
and there is history on reliability, history on successful partnerships. the overall size of the technology and what the cost structures may look like, right? that's very compelling. and then if you think about it also delivers all the main feature set that they need, like range, resolution at range, velocity and of course, the perception software they're looking for implemented in asic. so all those things combined, there's a very compelling case.
the pedigree being a foundational one, a technology that's not fly by the pants, a company that did not exist a couple of years ago. we have 20 years of history. we have history working with sophisticated oems globally and delivering product and having delivered products that went into production. so that was always gets a lot of compliments and a lot of respect.
andres sheppard -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
got it. no. that's very helpful. and maybe to expand a little bit about the atm program, right? so you mentioned you have $140 million currently available.
and this kind of gives you -- and you talked about this little flexibility, and is a differentiator to your peers in the same industry. can you give us a sense -- it hasn't been used since june of last year. can you give us any sense on kind of how you expect to use it going forward, either this year or next year?
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
yes. so thank you, andres. so yes, the $140 million facility, we used about $68 million of it last year, so about half of it is remaining. and we kind of see this facility as a flexible tool, which obviously gives us the firepower to access if and when needed, which positions us well with respect to some of our competition, which went through spac.
so the way we expect to use this facility is as when needed, because right now, i think our cash balance and liquidity levels are well -- are very sufficient to handle all our investment requirements, and we will only plan to use this facility as and when needed permitted by the market. so -- and that's the reason why we didn't use this facility in the second half of last year and even this quarter, because we saw weakness in the overall equity markets, because i think our goal is to make sure we drive shareholder value and use this facility very judiciously to fund our growth plans.
andres sheppard -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
thanks, anubhav. that's super helpful as well. maybe one on strategy. so obviously, the tam, the total addressable market for the automobile industry is quite massive, particularly as the adoption of electric vehicles continue and particularly as we move up in the levels of autonomy.
but i'm wondering, is there any consideration into also potentially targeting other non-automobile verticals. this is something that some of your peers have alluded to. and again, i understand that the automobile is the primary market. but i'm just wondering any thoughts about maybe expanding into some of these other verticals.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
i think what we have said in the past and it's still consistent. we have our strategic sales that we're focused on as a go-to-market strategy. direct sales, which is what you're talking about more general seeding the market with our sensors for different applications, from drones to deliveries to smart cities. i think certainly, once our hardware is available, that's going to be made available out there.
but if you take a look at like other people that are actually doing those kind of sales right now, they're already getting a lot of pressure from cheaper, no cost from the chinese market and the margins are not that lucrative, right? so it's the kind of -- like the first thing to focus on as a company right now with all our resources, all the expansions we're talking about, is to make sure we secure the first footstep in adas, establish ourselves and establish our product line. but once the hardware is available, of course, we intend to make those samples available, to explore different market segments. i have looked at this pretty deeply, by the way. so i can tell you like those other segments are not as big as anywhere near as big as what this market segment is.
they're dominated by a handful of company. some of them are in germany. they have been dominating them for more than a decade, as you know. and they're low quality compared to what we're providing, right? so we're providing specs that are orders of magnitude more than what the next competitor is providing in that space with simpler applications.
but certainly, at some point, we are a lidar company with perception software. if there's opportunities for us to expand into different segments, and there's a compelling reason to create value for that for our shareholders. of course, we're going to do that.
andres sheppard -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
thanks. that's very thorough. i appreciate it. maybe one last one for me is, can you give us a little bit of visibility into supply chain? obviously, with everything going on, most companies, right, this isn't -- this specific to microvision, but there has been supply disruptions as a result of the pandemic.
and so i'm just wondering, any visibility that you can give us into that? is that something that you expect to persist? is that something that you see improving? and kind of what are some of the things that you're doing to hopefully try to mitigate some of those disruptions?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
i think our supply chain team, our operations team did a really good job, well ahead of our -- with all the supply problems that were coming up, we have secured the materials that we need to meet the objectives that i have discussed for 2022 and 2023. but as far as the detailed question that i think you may be asking, our wafer for the mems, we've already tooled those up. the rest, as far as components are like fpgas and mcus and other components, we secured adequate supply of the risk material profile. we've done everything possible to secure our path forward.
of course, the big thing that we're going to focus on shortly in the second half and moving forward beyond that is our custom asic. so as we go further and further along in our maturity in this product and engagement with our customers, the supply chain issues that you're talking about, right, they start relieving because right now, we have strategic sales with a handful of units for the end of the year. and beyond that, also, we expect to expand that next year, but we have been very careful to secure the risk items because we're too small, right? so we are too small of a volume to get lost in the middle of any kind of supply squeeze that may be happening out there.
andres sheppard -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
wonderful. thank you so much, sumit and anubhav for answering all my questions. and congrats again on the quarter. i'll pass it on.
thank you.

i will now turn this call back over to anubhav verma to read questions submitted through the webcast. thank you.
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
thanks, emily. the first question we're getting is, could you provide more color on the roof assembly of the test vehicle in the recently released test track video via are there two lidar units, it appears they're mounted on heat things. can you provide more color on that? also, do these current units represent the final size of the unit, or do you expect them to shrink down further?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
so that's a good question. i think let's go back to the first part of the question, right, why are there two units mount around there. think about this demo vehicle as a test platform. our engineers can put multiple lidars.
they can check for interference. they can have a dynamic lidar or what anubhav described in the specific video. they could have a midrange and a short range. so you're doing lots of ground to testing on different versions of the product.
you're creating all the data that you need to create. if you recall, in september last year in the munich show, we announced four products, three of them were static view lidars and one was a dynamic view. and the team is working toward just characterizing everything they can to make sure that the things that we say to our customers, what is on the data sheet is what we deliver, that we characterize those things adequately and we understand the cpk and we understand the variances, we demonstrate to them the majority of our company with our data set. so i think, think about it in that terms.
as far as the question about the heating, i think i was a little described by that. i think we've talked about this before. our current product is fpga-based, which is significantly higher power. and when you're moving at high velocities, it may not be that important to cool it, but the structure that's been created there, we want this demo car to go into hot weather in the summertime, drive at different speed.
so it's just creating a platform that allows us to do variable testing and not have to worry about the effects of thermal that may come across it. now, of course, this fpga goes away, once we transition to our digital asic over the next couple of years. but this is just -- what you see there is just a setup for our current hardware, which is fpga. and i think the final question you have is like the size of it.
i think when you go to the asic the size of the device will get significantly smaller. but we also expect, as we engage with more oems, they will have some mounting some little customized way to mount the device for their testing. so we expect that the housing top and bottom to change to comment for their needs. and 98%, 99% of everything inside is exactly the same is just whatever they need to accommodate their needs for testing.
so what you see there right now significantly lower than the future, once we go to nasa.
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
thank you, sumit. and i think i'd just like to add, i think also the reason for two lidar units is also to connect the ground tooth data for which our software team is using to further refine and make the algorithm more powerful as well. so that's another reason why we are using twp lidar units there. all right.
second question is, can you clarify what the human driving and controlling the car in the test track footage or was it being driven by the software.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
ok.
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
can you please provide comments on the quality of the images on the laptop in the sneak peek as many investors observed and that it appears of a lesser quality than prior images at ces and the website?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
this is a good question. so this is where like the rubber hits the road now, so this is actually good. so if you've heard about it, we've been focused on adas. adas for level 3 and lower, the driver is always in control.
so the domain controller and the safety system only intervene when there is something catastrophic about to happen, all right? so what you're seeing there right now is, of course, within ground proof data, and we're showing how with our sensor with the fusion that we're doing, response tends to be reduced. so you could have a driver that is safe, but you can make even that driver safer. so think about the testing that you're seeing, its adas focused. in the call today, i also mentioned that in the future, we expect to demonstrate a drive-by wire solution, which effectively talks about when eventually companies are starting to look for level 4, they want to make sure your solution, satisfies their need for current adas level 3, level 2+ and so on, but also that, that same hardware eventually can go to level 4.
we're definitely going to demonstrate a drive-by-wire solution as well at the appropriate time. but i think it's all good news because it kind of demonstrates that we are still focused on the big market which is adas, level 3 and level 2+ and level 2. and the future market that comes beyond that the same hardware can also support. this is actually very positive for us and of course, also our investors and our customers.
the other question that -- i think there's like too many parts to this question. if i forget one, don't remind me again. but the question is, well, what's the quality of the point cloud from watching the video doesn't look the same, all right? so think about -- i think this is an anomaly of when people are seeing pictures and other things from other lidar companies, those are actually in a visualization tool has been like there is multiple points that are left in there beyond what they're saying is that even possible, which is called like super resolution. what we're showing there is like live 30 frames per second.
so the kind of resolution you're seeing on a vehicle, for example, is pretty impressive. it's extremely impressive and anybody that is in this space will say that's unbelievable amount of resolution we're getting at ranges of like 100-plus meters, going around curves. the other thing is, when you go to a test track like this, there's no buildings on the side, there's no trees on the side. you have a highway, you have guardrails and most of the time, the lidar is being fired off into open space and things are really, really far away.
so anything that is within the range, shows up and i think the piece of it that you're talking about is kind of an open highway where there was emerging theme happening. it just so happened in that scene, there was nothing around their except of vehicles. so i think the number of points we're talking about, the high resolution, resolution range is our key thesis for the product. we've worked extremely hard.
the team has worked extremely hard to make sure that we have range and high resolution at range. so i don't think i have any doubt that the things that we have talked about from a feature set, they're going to be met. did i miss anything anubhav? i think i got it all, no?
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
no. i think you got it all. right? the next question is, what are the main challenges, if any, of putting the lidar behind the windshield, will special windshield materials be required for that?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yes. this is an important one. and i talked to thomas about this also quite a lot. so this is really being determined by the oem and tier 1, they will decide if they want it in a headlamp, they want it in a grill or they want it behind the windshield.
we still believe, and we have a strong reason to believe that, that behind the windshield is where most likely it's going to end up because it's an ideal place for the right sensor with the right resolution to be there. now once that happens, the windshield is going to need to be accommodated. lidar, laser light can go through glass, of course. but most windshields are two pieces of the glass.
and of course, as people know, they have a polymer film in the middle and that's blocking. so of course, a special windshield has to be created with its notch cut out. this is not new to us, existing cars that are available, they have a variant of this. so at the right time, i think oem will decide where the right location is, but we're agnostic with that.
we can go in any location. our size is small, the power is low. everything is rated for high temperature. so we can accommodate in all different places.
but the benefit with our technology, of course, is being mems-based that it's very quiet, right? there's no winding of motors and bearing surfaces like some of the other galvo-based systems that are out there. therefore, we feel confident that we will be inside the cabin, and we would need all the audible noise requirements within the cabin, which is a pretty big thing. so the windshield problem, really you have to work with the oems, show them data, show them the benefit of it. and from there, they will decide what makes the most sense for their fleet.
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
thanks, sumit. the next question is some of the other lidar competitors have marketed their solution as 4d, where instant velocity is the fourth dimension. can you comment on how microvision's lidar solution compares to this?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yes. i think branding aside, what's very important is you need range, high resolution and you do need velocity, all right? you need all three of them, not just one. so when people have this thing they call instantaneous velocity, it is fmcw-based sensors. they're using doppler effect, but the resolution does not meet the requirements that oems have already set forth.
so it's not good enough to have one out of the three or two out of three. you have to have all three of those to be a valuable sensor. so the benefit that we have is, we do instantaneous velocity. we look at different frames and once something has been identified, that velocity is being tracked and it is instantaneous.
so when things come very quickly into the frame, maybe it takes like several frames to really pinpoint their velocity, right? but after that, we're tracking their velocity consistently, instantaneous also. so our sensor does outflow velocity. that's actually a big benefit. the other benefit we have that people forget is we do axial and radial velocity, tangential both whereas sensors that have doppler effect only, they can only do axial velocity and they can miss a whole component of velocity.
so it's not as useful. it is more useful to know two of those big components. i'm knowing if somebody is going sideways, like cutting you off, you need to know that vector and to know the vector, you have to know both the components of the vector. so the way we're doing velocity, i'm very confident.
it is the better way. and every time i've presented it every time, our bd team has presented it, right, you just get like this role of eye of satisfaction that somebody that understand how velocity has to be done. so i strongly believe we're on the right path. could we do a better job of marketing, but 4d is just the made-up thing, right? i think for oems, it's a spec that they have, and they have been defining it.
so we focus our messaging directly to them.
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
perfect. thank you, sumit. the next question is some of the other lidar competitors are now saying that the sweet spot price point for lidar for mass adoption is in the $200 to $300 range. what are your thoughts about that? let me take that question, actually, sumit.
so the way we think about this is the asp is going to be determined by economies of scale. so obviously, it's going to depend upon how many units are going to be needed by the oem, which ultimately be driven by how much discounts can we get in by the tier 1, which will be manufacturing it in terms of the wafers, in terms of the components that would be needed to manufacture or put this unit together. so at this point, the number obviously remains to be unpredictable at this point. but we believe, based on several executives and several conversations that the number would be higher in the beginning.
but as the adoption ticks up and as the products become commoditized, this number will come down. but at this point, we believe that our estimates are based on, obviously, a $500 per unit range. and at this point, we -- in fact, we believe that there's going to be a potential upside because we believe that number can be slightly higher than this in the beginning. and then ultimately, it will taper off as the volume picks up and as there are economies of scale to manufacture those units in large numbers.
the next question is one of the major competitors recently stated that they are the only lidar hardware provider certified on the nvidia hyperion platform. they also portrayed that there would be the sole and only lidar hardware provider certified on this platform and part of the reference design. is it your understanding of how nvidia is approaching the market, that is to only have a single lidar hardware provider as part of their hyperion platform?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yeah. i can answer. that was -- all the confidence in the world that is not true. i think beyond that, i'm not really sure how to answer this, because i don't think that's -- i think at the moment, they may have said that, that press release may have happened, they may have improved, but that is not going to be the case in the future.
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
ok. i think the next question that we're getting is microvision has a low cash burned relative to others in the sector. can you describe a bit about why that is the case? let me take that question. go ahead, sumit.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
no. please go ahead. please go ahead.
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
i was going to say, yes. look, i think the way we are focused on solving this problem is we're focused on the l2+ and l3 business at this point. look, i think we all know there is going to be autonomous driving at some point, but that is several years out at this point in time. so any investment that's needed for l4 and l5 will have to -- in our strategy, we'll have to come after we capture the immediately monetizable revenue opportunity that exists for l2+ and l3.
and i think that's one of the reasons why our cash burn is actually much lower than some of the other peers as well. and obviously, i think it's the quality of the engineers and the ability, the -- i think sumit mentioned about this is the pedigree, right? we have two decades of experience and over 430 patents in this field. so obviously, we do not need to even acquire hardware companies only as some of the other peers have been doing to even have that capability. so i think that sort of goes on to prove that we already have the team, we already have the resources and the know-how to not only make this product best in the market and also refine the specific features in the software, which makes the solution, the hardware even more powerful and more valuable to the oems.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yes. i think i'd like to add a couple of more comments to it, right? i think at base level, microvision is a company, it's got a long history. and it had some linear and two years ago, it was pretty tough. so i think like we just have a very good culture about spending money on things that are going to yield return.
we are funded by a public market by investors. so we have respect for the money. and we do not shy away from growth and innovation. like i mentioned, we continue to find new software features.
we add them. if any of our engineers come up with an idea that is going to yield us an advantage, we fund it. so we fund things. we're not on the acute side of it.
but having a $150 million opex, cash burn, these are astronomical numbers for companies that only have less than three years or four years to five years of history. we have two decades we're building on. so that's one of the biggest benefits we're always going to have.

sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
thank you, drew. good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our update on progress made during q2 and into july. i would like to cover this in three areas. first, i will discuss all that we accomplished through the second quarter and into july.
second, an update on how our progress is being received by oems and tier 1s. and finally, i will talk about what our 2023 may look like. let's dive right in. this quarter was one of the most eventful in our company's history.
our team completed our mavin dynamic range lidar product, delivered automated line, pilot line that would support serial production in the future and supported oem engagements. in our design, not only were we able to successfully include all of our target features, but we were also able to incorporate additional enhanced features tailored to the particular needs of oem. this last point is an important one, as it allows oems to tailor our base product for their specific use case. furthermore, this level of flexibility was previously viewed by oems as unachievable based on the limitations of competitor solutions.
this is a big win for microvision. the hard work of our team has put the company in a great place, as our potential customer engagements start heating up. our dynamic range lidar, mavin dr, is a game changer. it allows high resolution at all ranges and delivers this at low latency.
prospective customers have given us feedback that this represents significantly higher performance than the current lidar solutions, oems have been working with. i will elaborate a bit more about this later in my remarks. our team also achieved success in completing automation for our pilot production line. this paves the way for supporting serial production in the future.
this is an important achievement. while some agreements for lidar hardware have been announced by other manufacturers over the past three to four years, they are still not arrived in the market. this is because oems are being forced to choose between low-quality products that can be produced at scale production zero production or adequate quantity but in low volumes. with our automation and pilot line being set up for 2023, oems are providing very positive feedback on our strategy to position microvision as a leader, not only on design, but also our capability to deliver zero production orders in the future.
with these important points in place, our team remains on track to meet our second half objective of achieving class 1 certification and starting sample sales by q4. this, again, puts us in line with oem expectations on timing. we have a product that exceeds oem expectations, combined with the best company pedigree to complete individual oem customizations and a solid history of demonstrated reliability. we remain on track to complete our fifth-generation asics and have automation that will go from pilot line to serve production.
the second area i would like to provide an update on is the feedback we're receiving from oems. throughout the last quarter, we have continued to invest time and resources in helping oems understand the strength of our technology and how it can be customized to meet their individual program needs. these oems have indicated they are pleased with the maturity and capability of our solution. we have received positive feedback, including a comment that mavin is and i quote, ""the best lidar product they have seen to date."" as anticipated, oems are responding to the quality of the point cloud data that we provide and they witnessed during live demos.
basic opportunity it provides to build new high-speed safety features on their domain controllers. they are also very interested in our future software solution that could seamlessly enable their l3 features. oems are also complementing the low-profile design that enables more flexible deployment options, such as behind the windshield, behind the grail, or beyond. this speaks to our business model and strategy of partnering with oems, not just selling to them.
looking ahead to the back half of 2022, we are on track to achieve class 1 certification. given our 20-plus years of expertise developing products centered on laser beam scanning technology, the class 1 certification process is not new to microvision team. we have navigated this process before. we developed our lidar sensor with safety in mind, incorporating our proprietary technologies like virtual protective housing that ensure safe operation to class 1 standards.
for the third quarter, we are focused on meeting the requirements of oems and tier 1s to support sample sales. we believe this objective is well in hand. we've also started sample sales in q3 to oems and tier 1s for q4 deliveries. our engineering pilot line in redmond will support sales to oems and tier 1s.
i am excited about what mavin dr means for our future. once implemented in serial production with a strong intellectual property supporting it, i expect this product could be the centerpiece of adas l3 and l2 solutions for more than a decade. i am very excited about where we are and how we're positioned for the future. as we move into 2023, we will continue to invest in product execution and innovation.
we intend to demonstrate a drive-by-wire demo system based on our lidar hardware and our high-speed highway pilot adas software. we expect this will fully integrate up to two microvision lidar sensors, radar, camera, and ultrasonics on the microvision edge computing platform, together with our proprietary software running on our demo car. finally, i would like to summarize how we are positioning microvision as a high-tech, high-growth company. lidar technology will be the therapy sensor required to enable adas safety and autonomous driving for decades to come.
the limitations of camera module and radar technology is apparent in current products, and a mass adoption of lidar is expected. with my meetings with oems, i feel confident in this future. we are far ahead of the competition with our lidar hardware asking in the videos we're publishing. with the help of our advanced lidar technology, we expect to expand our software offerings to enable adas safety and autonomous driving.
our 2023 demonstrations will expand our company to a full software and hardware solutions company. before i invite anubhav to review the second quarter results and projections, i want to acknowledge and thank the microvision team for their hard work. we continue to set and achieve aggressive objectives on the path toward oem partnerships. i'm proud of the progress we continue to make, and i'm excited about what is next in 2022 and 2023.
thank you. over to you anubhav.
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
thanks, sumit. as sumit discussed earlier, we are really pleased with what we accomplished in the second quarter of 2022. the launch of mavin brings together our product that have short, medium, and long-range sensors, all combined into one to provide a dynamic view of the road ahead. the 905-nanometer lidar optimizes power output while ensuring safety at all times.
the low latency point cloud 30 hertz enables the oem adas systems to make split-second decisions and take actions at high speeds. we believe that this product offers oems, the following two key advantages; number one, with the improved sound profile, microvision lidar enables flexible deployment options for oems to place it inside the cabin behind the windshield. second, built with materials known to oem supply chains, microvision hardware is scalable, sourceable, and inevitably had a lower cost structure. we are very excited about the meetings and the positive feedback received for the demo cars fitted with our product.
additionally, we completed testing for some more complicated highway driving scenarios as well. we remain on track to achieve class 1 certification and also expanded our r&d and production infrastructure as we ramp up our pilot production lines to start some sample sales in the second half of this year, as we outlined. now, before i jump into the next section to discuss the financial performance of the company, i would like to recap that our go-to-market strategy remains the same. we continue to market our product, primarily to the oems to suit their needs and price points and work with them.
using the estimated number of cars to be produced through 2030, we believe the revenue opportunity for microvision could still be between $2 billion to $4 billion with a corresponding cumulative ebitda profile of $1 billion to $2 billion once we're able to secure the series production partnerships with the tier 1s and oems for our sensor units to be included in their fleets. now, let's discuss the current quarterly performance update. we recognized $314,000 in royalty revenue from microsoft in the second quarter of 2022. as a reminder, this revenue is attributable to the contract executed in april 2017, with microsoft for using our technology in their ar display product.
this recognition of revenue is directly tied to the number of units produced by microsoft. please note that no cash was received for this revenue in 2022 and as we received an upfront payment of $10 million at the contract signing in 2017. as of june 30, 2022, we have an unapplied $4.6 million left on the contract liability. based on q2 shipments provided by microsoft, we have reduced our expectations for the remainder of the year.
as a result, we now expect to recognize approximately $1.5 million in revenue for the year 2022 and against this contract liability with microsoft. to reiterate, please note that the lower revenue recognized from microsoft in second quarter has no impact on our cash position or operations as all of the cash related to the revenue payment was received upfront in 2017. now coming back to automotive lidar revenue as we discussed, we plan to sell a limited number of lidar sensors for strategic sales to oems and tier 1s during the second half of this year. at the moment, we do not expect significant revenue from the sale of these lidar sensors.
in terms of expenses, r&d expenses totaled $7.7 million in the second quarter, compared to $7.4 million in the same period last year. backing out the noncash stock-based compensation expense of $2.02 million and $2.2 million respectively, cash r&d expense were $5.7 million in the second quarter. compared to $5.2 million in the second quarter of last year. 2022 r&d expenses included lower stock-based compensation as compared to last year due to higher stock prices last year.
the higher cash r&d expense is driven by higher salary and benefits due to increased headcount, inflation-based salary adjustments for all non-executive employees in the u.s. and higher nondirect labor expenses. sg&a expense totaled $6.3 million in the second quarter this year as compared to $8.4 million in the same period last year. backing out the noncash stock-based compensation expense of $2.1 million and $5.7 million, respectively, cash sg&a expense was $4.2 million in this quarter, compared to $2.7 million last year.
the increase was primarily due to higher headcount and higher business insurance costs due to increased market cap as compared to last year. we continue to invest and accelerate our business development and marketing efforts. as we march toward achieving the objectives we laid out for 2022, we continue to use stock-based performance awards to incentivize our employees, an important component as we invest in our talent pipeline and motivate our employees to share the upside in the growth of the company. cash used in operating activities for the second quarter of 2022 was $9.7 million.
we are very pleased with this number, as it came right along our expectations, as i outlined last quarter. sequentially, our cash burn was reduced by 11% backed by strong financial discipline. our med volatile global macroeconomic conditions, we believe our cash burn remains one of the lowest in the industry, as we steadily build the business. capex in the second quarter of 2022 was $0.2 million, which is sequentially 72% down.
q1 was higher, and it was primarily driven by one-time investments required in retrofitting our test cars to support, track testing of our lidar sensor, and development of the pilot production line. we expect cash used in operating activities for the second half of 2022 to be approximately between $18 million and $20 million as we continue to exercise the discipline of prudent investing and using noncash stock-based compensation to incentivize employees. we do not expect any significant capex in second half of 2022. we expect that tenant improvements for our new locations in redmond will primarily be financed by incentives to leave our existing premises.
while there may be some timing differences between the amount spent and cash received, we do not expect this to be a significant cash burden of the company. we finished the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $93 million, including investment securities, which gives us a sufficient liquidity position at the end of the quarter. as interest rates have ticked up in the year-to-date period, we have shifted our liquidity position to be in the form of one-year treasury bills to capture some yield from the market. hence, the investment securities with maturities within 12 months have gone from $33 million at the end of december 2021 to $56 million at the end of june 2022.
as a company, we have always sought to be very disciplined about using cash to execute our strategic objectives. based on the current 2022 outlook, our current cash burn rate, and our current liquidity, i feel we are very well positioned compared to our peers whose burn rate ranges three times to five times our cash burn, especially given the macroeconomic environments. now, let me give you an update on our atm facility. the company remains very strategic and focused on shareholder value creation.
in 2021, the atm program was mainly used in the first half of the year when the company raised $68 million of net proceeds issuing 4 million shares, taking advantage of the strong equity markets back in and strengthening the balance sheet. during second half of 2021, as well as the first half of 2022, there were no sales under the atm program as the broader lidar markets, including most of our peers experienced weakness in stock prices. we expect to use this atm facility as a flexible tool to fund our growth plans, especially a drive by wire that we are planning in 2023. given our current liquidity levels, we believe that we are well positioned to invest in the growth initiatives that sumit and i have talked about.
let me summarize the themes from this business call for our investors. number one, we're confident in our technology and look forward to further testing to help us work toward commercialization of our solution and continued demonstration to oems and tier 1s, so that they may see the superior capabilities and benefits of the microvision hardware and software. secondly, we're very excited about the business model that we are working toward. the strategic partnerships that we're looking to execute could help us build a $1 billion to $2 billion cumulative ebitda business through 2030 with a high growth profile.
and lastly, our current liquidity position and 2022 cash burn outlook positions us well when compared to our peers. with this, i would like to open the line for questions.

operator
thank you, anubhav. at this time, we are conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question will come from andres sheppard with cantor fitzgerald. please go ahead.
andres sheppard -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. can you hear me ok?
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
yes, we can.
andres sheppard -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
wonderful. thank you. good afternoon and congratulations on all of the accomplishments this past quarter. i'd like to maybe start with a couple of macro questions.
given the rising interest rate environment, what impact, if any, do you anticipate that to have on the business?
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
so let me take this question, andres. so obviously, at this time, if only anything, it gives us an extra yield on some of the investment securities that we have shifted our liquidity position to. so, we are fairly confident based on our cash burn rates and our balance sheet strength, we are very well positioned to navigate the next four to six quarters.
andres sheppard -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
got it. ok. that's very helpful. and maybe following up with the continued supply shortages in bottlenecks, do you anticipate that to have any sort of impact?
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
not right now because, obviously, we do not have any direct impact from some of these supply chain shortages because obviously, we feel confident of where we are with our engagement with the oems. and hence, that's why we do not expect any effects from these supply chains.
andres sheppard -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
got it. that's great to hear. and maybe in regards to the atm program, would you be able to give us any kind of sense on timing or how do you anticipate to use it? as you know, the market to raise capital right now is not the best. and so, i'm just wondering any thoughts around that anything that you could share?
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, like i said, i think atm programs just offer us flexibility, given where we are. and maybe i can just tie it up with some of the numbers here, right? so approximately second quarter was$9.7 million used in cash and operating activities. and given we have $93 million.
so obviously, this gives us a very comfortable position. we use atm programs as more of a tool or a flexibility, which offers -- which is offered to us compared to some of the peers, who raised obviously significant amounts of capital during their ipos. so, we believe this tool to be -- only be used strategically as and when the market offers opportunity. and i think that's sort of what is illustrated in the last 12 months, we didn't use this atm facility because obviously, we didn't have the strategic need to do this.
so hopefully, that sort of gives you a perspective of how we view the atm program and where the balance sheet strength stands today for the company.
andres sheppard -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ye. no, absolutely. that's very insightful. thank you.
and maybe one last question for me is, i think it's great you're starting to sell the strategic examples this year. is the expectation for revenues still begin ramping up in 2024 or is there may be an opportunity to ramp those up a little bit soon or maybe in 2023, maybe even pursuing some nonautomotive verticals? thank you.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
yeah, yeah. let me answer this one. so i think --
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
go ahead.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
so, andres, i think we talked about this before. i think we purchased this pilot line, and that's going to turn to a steel production line. our intention of course, is once we have these sample sales this year, starting next year, of course, we're going to fulfill the needs for any potential oem or tier 1 development requirements. but also, since we're going to have extra capacity on the line, we are looking at different options to sell devices in other industrial and other markets, and we are developing that -- those channels and pipelines now as we speak.
andres sheppard -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
got it. thank you very much. that's all i have. congrats again on the quarter, i'll pass it on.
thank you.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
i will now turn the call back to anubhav verma to read questions submitted through the webcast. thank you.
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
thanks, matt. so, i guess, we have another question about, ""what are the normal levels of cash you feel are necessary to support the business and plans for the atm?"" so probably i'm just going to reiterate some of the points. we used $9.7 million in cash from operating activities, which was a sequential 11% decline from q1, again, driven by continued financial discipline. with around $93 million of cash and cash equivalents, we feel comfortable given our burn rate is one of the lowest in the industry with our competitors having three times to five times our annual burn rate.
we pride ourselves in being a traditional public company with over two decades of operating in conservative public markets that has successfully navigated quite a few economic cycles unlike our peers. and addressing the second part of the question about the atm, our spac peers raised significant amounts of capital at their respective ipos. and our remaining $70 million atm program gives us ample flexibility to raise capital as and when needed in response to all our publicly listed peers. the company has not executed in the past one year as broader weakness in the lidar sectors as all other spac companies in the lidar sector have come down significantly in their market valuation for their all-time ipo highs.
the next question is, ""how do you think microsoft microvision is going to be impacted by chips bill?"" microvision works on a fabless model. hence, we're not directly affected by the chips bill as the chips bill is fundamentally focused toward fabs and other chip providers. however, if chips bill does get passed in the house and signed into a law, it will certainly boost the semiconductor chip production and reduce the stress in the supply chain. i think this should bode well for all the players in the automotive ecosystem, including oems, tier 1s and us.
sumit, this one's for you. ""you said that you're on track to achieve class 1 certification in the third quarter. is class 1 certification needed to use lidar in public or with potential customers?""
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
this is a good question. so let me just go back to my prepared remarks comments and just elaborate a little bit from there. we have a 20-plus-year history in our technology. our team builds last on safety into every product from the ground up.
so that's actually a very, very important part of it. and i'm actually very proud of our culture on making sure from the ground of things are built right. we've been doing demos for customers and all the units we demonstrate are class 1 safe, meaning that the features are implemented. since we're in a demo phase, a microvision representative, our vp of bd or myself are always present there, in most cases, both of us are there.
i can say with confidence that our team has done a great job of implementing our virtual protective housing for class 1. the safety -- the demos are going like going incredibly well actually, and oems require that the demo unit is fully conformed into class 1 standards and the company representatives are present when we go to these demos. so that's part of a foundational piece you have to build out. and i think the question is, was the class 1 certification in q3? is class 1 certification needed to use a lidar in public, right? so, as i just explained, for demo, that's the gap that they've created, right, or essentially, that's what the regulation allows.
when you think about full certification, as move to sales, that's when you have to actually get the full certification done. fda approval, go outside third-party, whatever other testing you have to do. but for that to happen, you have to have all your features locked in, everything is into the rtl, everything is locked out, and then you submit the final sample that comes to customers will buy. once we start selling it, it has to have full conformance whereas oems and tier 1s are very, very comfortable taking those samples, they needed to be class 1 certified because at that point, there's no company representative, and they will do their other confidential testing that they will not discuss as a course.
so, i think like to sell a product, we certainly have to have full certification. but to demo the product, you have to have the full feature implemented operating in full safe mode with the company representative available. and this is not just new to us, every company has done any kind of deal in lidar or anything with a 95-nanometer laser or any kind of laser in the history of time, has to go through the same process. so, we're very comfortable with this process and i think we have this objective well in hand.
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
thanks, sumit. now, the next few questions, i think, are all about point cloud, so i'm going to summarize them. so, let's see, i think, is the point cloud quality posted most recently on the website coming straight from the lidar, or is it simulated?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
this is a good question. the point cloud that we just released recently, which was about the nuremberg drive, is directly from the lidar. it is streaming. there is no post-processing to make it more beautiful.
there is no stimulated data overlay. it is just an exact drive if you think about if a customer is sitting and witnessing that, that's what they saw. so, this is exactly what our point cloud does, and that's why i wanted to actually post that. there's some little bugs here and there that our team is still fixing, but i still wanted them to just post exactly what's coming out because it is very, very impressive, and it kind of proof is in the pudding.
it's easier to see even for people with no background in dsp or high-end mathematics to really see and you can start understanding how much more advanced we are than anybody else. i think for like an example that i was just talking about recently with somebody, if you think about detection of cycles, this comes up quite often in pedestrian safety. i think in the video, it just so happened that there were some cyclists on the road in front of us. and you could clearly see, you can see them heavily.
you can see all the details. you can imagine how easy it becomes to segment that, cluster that and actually identify things and tag them drive -- not drivable. so, it's actually a very, very important to see how well it runs. and this is not even the best it will be.
our team is, of course, continuing to find bugs and fixing it. and a lot of the bugs are based on environmental conditions, based on the device, they learn, at the test more, they learn more and they keep perfecting it to the point that it's pretty darn good. i think the comment, i think, what this is also talking about is like if i can talk about versus others. so, the reason i'm proud of this is because this is raw.
i mean there's nothing -- no post-processing we're doing. what i've seen so far from other folks, of course, is what we believe, and it's pretty clear by just looking at the point clouds, that its heavily post-processed. so, they look beautiful, but the fact that there's no noise and the fact that they are -- there are certain characteristics that you can look at these data streams, you can tell that it's coming from a simulated point cloud. and i will let you guys go figure out from everybody's website who's posting what, but when you see our point cloud, that's what a real point cloud of a high density, high resolution, low latency would look like.
and that's at the resolution that our customers are going to see and that's the latency. and we are doing that. there's no playing games with different configurations. ours is pure.
that's the best way i can describe it.
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
thanks, sumit. so, i think the next few questions, again, let me summarize it. i think broadly, how is mavin different from the prior product? and is there going to be a new data sheet with new spacs?
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
absolutely. actually, if you go back to september 2021, when we were in the munich iaa show, i think we announced four products. there were three products that were the static lidar, and of course, the which called the mavin now, which is dynamically back then is had much higher specifications. and we talked about, it gave us the flexibility to address different customer needs.
but we always believe that mavin is going to take a lot more attention from everybody. and that's exactly what's happened. so, in case that there is a customer that wants just a static lidar, we provide that. in those specific cases, we differentiate the product, the resolution is listed in the data sheet, as you know are the summarized data sheet that we have there.
the performance in a single field of view is ok, but all three of them are not included. and it's a significant difference as far as the value one versus the other. if somebody wants just a long-range lidar, it is, let's call it, our a1 sample, which is what we talked about last year, which is the black body. and the new product, which is the mavin product, is the white cover as you see.
and that has the resolution that we were announced last year. so, these are two separate bodies of -- all the components, almost all the components are exactly the same. but as you can imagine, the housing and some other features inside are slightly different that allows us to give the higher resolution in all three fields of view in a single product with velocity, whereas, a simplified product if somebody wants, we can make the a1 staple for them as well, and they could experiment with that. so, this gives us all the flexibility to address all the needs that we're hearing.
and, of course, we have a flexible platform. so, if a customer wants to take any one of these products and wants to see some slight deviation in a common development phase, which specify what a common development is, it's the same hardware, but instead of, for example, if they wanted to see low resolution on the corners of the field, but much higher in the middle. they wanted some sort of asymmetry in our smart pulsing, in some cases, they want lower power in one region, higher in the other. whatever they want, we can do that in firmware rather than having to redesign entire product.
and this, of course, is exciting for them where they don't have to wait years for a sample and live with the risk that comes with it, again, in a common development environment, experiment with the product with us, working with us directly and then make their decision. so, we are -- we just got to be very, very, very flexible for the customer, put their needs first and we're listening to what they want. and i'm pretty happy to say we're in a really good place. so, i think that's the key differences, and all four of them give us the same flexibility of working with anybody in the environment they want.
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
thank you, sumit. the next question is about silicon. ""how does microvision view chip platforms like qualcomm and nvidia for its design and current architecture?""
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
ok. so, our current design, think about the lidar, the -- our asic are inside our lidar. the asic has to be co-located within the hardware because we have some very tight analog signals going back and forth, high speed, high density. so, it's very important for our team to control that.
so those asic cannot be put far away into the other box. our digital asic, which of course, is the family jewels, again, has to be co-located because everything inside the device that are interiors designed for so many years, they have to have a very tight control of it. and the foundational piece of all of this is class 1 laser safety that cannot be moved away into software. so we do this in real-time logic, put into an fpga, lock it in and we can go to an asic.
some other competitors, they don't have real-time logic. they do it in an nvidia platform or qualcomm, and they have all sorts of other software running that are extremely high power. so when we go to the asic with our features running fully pipeline, we have the shot of being the lowest power device. and that's -- we've discussed this in different -- several meetings that i've been in, and they totally acknowledge immediately that yeah, absolutely the path you're taking.
it is going to be the lowest power. and they're actually pretty amazed that all these features are running so well at such high speeds and that we actually have a history of making these asics, as we have fifth generation asic, as you can imagine. so, i think if you think about qualcomm and nvidia, those are application processors. meaning that that could be in a second box, which is a domain controller, where a customer could be taking a lidar data and running their software.
but inside our design and the final design that the lidar product will be, when it goes to serial production in the future, that product by itself will only require the asic to run, and it could output the point cloud. the header file will have all the objects identified and are now drivable. and it comes to the customer if they want to stream the entire point cloud or just the header file or whatever version of it, but we will not require an application processor inside. and this gives us a big cost advantage because those processes are not cheap.
so effectively, when we give a target of pricing, and margins in the model that otherwise was built out, we've sort of baked that in, and we're very confident where we are right now.
anubhav verma -- chief financial officer
thanks, sumit. the next question is, ""will microvision's end customers be tier 1s?"" let me take this one. i think our go-to-market strategy remains solid, and there has been no changes to it. while we're focused on both oems and tier 1s, we are demonstrating our products and capabilities directly to oems.
like, i've always maintained, for the series productions, oems need automotive-grade optoelectronic devices that will have to be supplied by tier 1s. the next question is, i think, again, a form of question that andres referred to. so let me reframe the question."" is microvision still focused on automotive lidar only, will ar/vr market or other lidar applications be considered for expansion?"" as we stated before, we truly believe we have an industry-leading lidar sensor for the automotive lidar applications. hence, we continue to focus our efforts only on automotive lidar, given our current cash burn and balance sheet strength.
we believe that automotive lidar still provides for the largest total addressable market for lidar applications and have the appropriate size for us, as a company, to become a multibillion-dollar business once the series production starts. now regarding ar and vr applications. microvision's technology that were used in microsoft hololens already demonstrates that we are far ahead in the ar/vr space from a technology standpoint. we stand ready to help our customers, if they were to approach us for this technology.
additionally, we also believe industrial lidar applications will probably be another very attractive market opportunity to go after additional revenue and accelerate growth on top of the automotive lidar applications. next question is, i guess, again, on cash burn. ""which areas does microvision intend to spend their cash on and what are the extra capabilities that the company is looking to gain?"" i'll take this one as well, sumit. we continue to expand our engineering team as we work with all automotive oems to demonstrate our breadth and depth of our technology.
we recently expanded r&d and production infrastructure, with the delivery of our automated pilot line and continued construction of our new testing and lab facilities. we intend to expand our team to demonstrate our software capabilities that will enable our drive by wire with our lidar solutions in 2023. these are primarily the three areas where we would be spending our cash on in the next few quarters to come.
sumit sharma -- chief executive officer
i guess we're out of time. we appreciate your participation in our second quarter earnings call and your continued support of microvision. thank you.
