good morning, and welcome to sundial growers fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 financial results conference call. [operator instructions] the conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] yesterday afternoon, sundial issued a press release announcing their financial results for the year-end and fourth quarter ended december 31st, 2020. this press release is available on the company's website at sndlgroup.com and filed with edgar and sedar as well.
presenting on this morning's call, we have zach george, chief executive officer; jim keough, chief financial officer; and andrew stordeur, president and chief operating officer. before we start, i would like to remind investors that certain matters discussed in today's conference call or answers that may be given to questions could constitute forward-looking statements. actual results could differ materially from those anticipated. risk factors that could affect results are detailed in the company's financial reports and other public filings that are made available on sedar and edgar.
additionally, all financial figures mentioned are in canadian dollars, unless otherwise indicated. i'd also like to note that we are conducting the call today from our respective remote locations. as such, there may be brief delays, crosstalk, or minor technical issues during this call. we thank you in advance for your patience and understanding.
we will now make prepared remarks, and then we'll move to a question-and-answer session. i would now like to turn the call over to zach george. please go ahead.
zach george -- chief executive officer
thank you, everyone, for joining us on our full-year and fourth-quarter 2020 earnings call. as the covid-19 pandemic continues to affect global markets and people around the world, we hope that everyone is staying safe during this unprecedented time. our top priority remains the health and safety of our employees. we remain committed to stringent procedures to ensure the protection of our employees and consumers while minimizing disruption to our operations.
to date, sundial has not experienced any material disruption in operations related to covid-19. sundial recently completed its first two years of commercial operations, and i celebrated my first year as ceo in february. as i joined the sundial team in early 2020, we faced a number of internal and external challenges, including operational difficulties, excess leverage, inadequate cost control, a lack of focus on our core value proposition, and rapidly evolving industry conditions. during 2020, the canadian market experienced rapid change.
consumers chased thc potency levels as a quality threshold, which resulted in an acceleration in price discounts, along with an oversaturation of low-quality supply in the market. this dynamic has forced canadian-licensed producers, including sundial, to pivot to meet evolving consumer demands. the focus on value and a race to the bottom on pricing in several segments has impacted the path to profitability across the industry, and sundial has not been immune to this dynamic. as a result, we defined our strategy and made material changes to position sundial for improved performance.
we successfully restructured the entire organization by repaying all outstanding debt, improving our operating practices, and targeting a sustainable cost structure with a simplified and focused business model. the modular nature of our facility allows us to quickly readjust and deploy our capacity as market conditions dictate. while our financial strength has improved materially, we still have significant work to do in our core operations to achieve the goals that we have established for sundial and our shareholders. sundial's last two quarters have been negatively impacted by the complete repositioning of our cultivation practices as we focused on data-driven best practices to drive quality and potency results that meet evolving consumer preferences.
while we are currently seeing many of our canadian peers move away from cultivation, partially or entirely, due to their inability to deliver consistent cultivation outcomes, sundial has renewed its commitment to cultivation in our modular indoor facility. we view this core competency as an opportunity for differentiation going forward. we are excited to see progress, and these changes have accelerated improvements in quality, potency, yield, and cost. during q4, we saw the highest average potency in terpene profiles at harvest in sundial's inception.
we also just pulled our highest ever-potency harvest last month. in short, we believe that the dramatic changes that we've made to our cultivation practices are starting to show concrete results and we are determined to continue to improve to meet consumer demands with manufacturing-like consistency. we will continue to create strategic partnerships with retailers and increased points of distribution in key markets, including ontario, british columbia, and alberta. andrew will provide more details on this progress in these areas momentarily.
as a result of a number of recent capital-focused initiatives, sundial is currently debt-free and has an unrestricted cash balance north of 700 million. we continue to explore strategic opportunities to deploy our capital with a focus on maximizing shareholder value. a lot of you are wondering how we will use that capital. we have identified and executed on a number of investments and continue to evaluate a robust pipeline of opportunities.
maximizing returns on deployed capital and corporate stewardship are key priorities for our board and management team. our investment program has yielded positive early results. to date, sundial invested 58.9 million late in the fourth quarter and a further 31.5 million subsequent to the end of 2020 in strategic cannabis-related portfolio investments. we've already generated tax-efficient realized investment income and fees subsequent to year-end of more than $9 million.
sundial's high-quality cultivation processing and processing facility, combined with our team's broad consumer packaged goods experience and strong financial position, reinforce management's confidence in our path to sustainable profitability. thank you all. i will now pass the call to jim for commentary on our financial results. 
jim keough -- chief financial officer
thank you, zach, and good morning to all who are listening in. i'd like to remind everyone that all amounts that i mentioned this morning are denominated in canadian dollars unless otherwise stated. let's start with a review of the improvements that we've achieved in our liquidity and capital structure. in early 2020, we started the process of a complete financial restructuring, which was initially delayed by the impact of covid.
in the second half of the year, through a combination of a number of cash repayments, asset dispositions, equity and equity-linked issuances, and debt for equity conversions, sundial eliminated aggregate debt principal of $227 million and exited the year completely debt-free. at december 31st, 2020, sundial had $60.4 million of unrestricted cash on hand. and at march 15th, 2021, we had approximately $719 million of unrestricted cash on hand. to summarize our capital transactions, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we issued 712 million common shares for gross proceeds of $161 million under at-the-market equity programs and warrant exercises.
we also closed strategic cannabis-related portfolio investments of $59 million. and then subsequent to year-end 2020, we've achieved the following: we issued an additional 741 million common shares for gross proceeds of $695 million under at-the-market equity programs, registered direct offerings, and warrant exercises. we entered into additional strategic cannabis-related portfolio investments of $31.5 million. the portfolio investments generated approximately $9.3 million in realized gains, interest income, and fees in the first quarter of 2021 to date.
we regained compliance with the nasdaq minimum bid requirement based on closing bid prices for our shares. and this week, we entered into an exciting strategic capital partnership with the saf group, focused on cannabis-related opportunities and investments in canada and internationally. the first mandate of the joint venture is a special opportunity fund with commitments from third-party limited partners and with an initial commitment of $100 million by sundial. while the share issuances and conversions of debt into equity have resulted in dilution, with $1.6 billion currently issued in outstanding common shares, it has seen the company transform from a precarious financial position to a position of financial stability and strength, including the ability to evaluate and execute on a robust pipeline of strategic opportunities through deployment of our meaningful cash reserves.
now let's turn our focus to operating results, starting with revenue. for full-year 2020, our gross revenue increased by 10% when compared to 2019 to $73.3 million. in q4 2020, net revenue for the three months ended december 31st increased to $13.9 million, an 8% increase over the third quarter of 2020 net revenue of $12.9 million. branded net revenue increased by 15% from q3 to q4 to a total of $11.4 million.
the corresponding shift from unbranded sales resulted in lower wholesale net revenues, which were down 18% to $2.4 million in q4 2020. branded net revenue represented 86% of total net revenue for the quarter. our inhalable products continue to be well received by the recreational cannabis consumer. our dried flower and pre-roll, which comprise the majority of our recreational sales, grew to $12 million for the quarter.
gross revenue from vape cartridge sales was $4.3 million, representing a 19% increase over the previous quarter. average gross selling price per gram equivalent of branded products, net of provisions, was $4.14 per gram in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $5.53 per gram in the prior quarter. this is reflective of price compression across the industry in response to supply conditions and consumer shifts to value segments. cost control has been an important focus for sundial in 2020, and we've realized meaningful cost savings due to realignment and rightsizing of our operating model, which is delivering substantial sustainable cost savings.
in the fourth quarter, cash used from operations decreased by 63% to $12.2 million when compared to the previous quarter. general and administrative expenses were $6.5 million, 9% lower in the fourth quarter than the previous quarter. for the full-year 2020, we reduced our g&a expenses by 18% to $32 million compared to $38.9 million for the previous year. the decrease of $6.9 million was mainly due to reductions in salaries, wages, and consulting fees from workforce optimizations.
while we continue to focus on cost discipline throughout the year, we did ramp up investment in our brands. sales and marketing expenses for q4 were $2.3 million compared to $1.1 million in the previous quarter as we invested in our brand portfolio to meet consumer preferences. sales and marketing expenses for 2020 were $5.7 million for the year compared to $8.1 million for the previous year. the decrease of $2.4 million was largely due to a pause in certain marketing initiatives during constrained cash circumstances early in the year.
in q4 2020, cash cultivation cost per gram sold was reduced to $1.11, a decrease of 6% over the previous quarter, reflecting continuing cost reductions and efficiency improvements. we recorded an adjusted ebitda loss of $5.6 million for the three months ended december 31, 2020, compared to a loss of $4.4 million for the three months ended september 30, 2020, due primarily to investment in sales and marketing expenses and foreign exchange changes, offset by higher net revenue. adjusted ebitda from cannabis operations was a loss of $26.1 million for full-year 2020 compared to a loss of $30.1 million for the previous year. the decreased loss reflects reduced g&a expenses related to cost reduction initiatives during the year, partially offset by lower net revenue and the impact of the production of higher-cost product categories.
adjusted gross margin before inventory impairment and fair value adjustments for the three months ended december 31st, 2020, was $3.2 million compared to $2.6 million for the previous quarter as a result of higher revenue and improved margin mix. adjusted gross margin for the year ended december 31st, 2020, was $9.2 million compared to $16.8 million for 2019. this decrease in gross margin was mainly due to reduced pricing and a higher-cost product mix. sundial continues to analyze and adjust its operations to optimize margins.
we fully completed construction of our cultivation facilities in olds in early 2020 and our processing facilities in the latter half of the year, and have been limiting capital expenditures to essential expenditures and maintenance capital. total capital expenditures in 2020 were $3 million. we have budgeted $5.7 million in capital expenditures for 2021 related to processing automation, minor facility improvements, and maintenance. now i would like to invite andrew stordeur, president and coo of sundial, to provide some further remarks related to operations.
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, jim. while the industry will continue to see volatility, we remain committed to cultivation excellence of sundial's core competency. our continued focus on inhalable products provides the best opportunity for long-term sustainable growth. let me update you on some of the progress sundial made in 2020 and the fourth quarter.
at the beginning of the year, we announced that we would change our sales mix strategy and focus on driving better market penetration with our branded product offering, relative to the wholesale channel. we made good progress in this area and increased our branded net cannabis sales to 75% of total cannabis sales in 2020 from only 20% in the previous year. a crucial change made in 2020 included the restructuring of our cultivation processes. to deliver on our small batch at scale promise, we need to continue to develop capability and competency in cultivation.
several of our competitors have recently divested from cultivation because it's challenging to do it consistently, and at the same time, continue to evolve product offerings that the consumer wants. while we have made significant progress improvements in cultivation over the past 12 months, we still have work to do. i am proud of our team's accelerated improvements in quality, potency, yield, and cost throughout 2020. since our cultivation restructuring efforts started, quality metrics have consistently improved.
in the first half of 2020, our average weighted potency was in the mid-to-upper teens. as we adapted to consumer preferences, in the last three months of the year, we achieved the company's highest weighted average potency in its history, above 20% thc, and we still continue to see increased results. in order to consistently deliver on our top leaf brand promise, we made the decision to improve key quality processes, including hand-dried, hand-manicured, and only hand-bottling our flower offerings. we've also recently completed r&d on several new cultivars that we are excited to bring to the market in the second half of 2021.
to ensure we continue to provide the highest quality products, our quality assurance team has recently begun performing potency testing on our cannabis plants during their growing cycle. we anticipate this will help identify the sweet spot for harvest, ensuring consumers get the freshest and highest-quality products available. we have also simplified our supply chain and rationalized our skus across all brands and formats. given the current market dynamics, we took a proactive approach with customers to limit sku proliferation and maximize shelf space and rate of sale with an optimized portfolio approach.
we went from more than 100 skus at the beginning of 2020 to less than 40 skus at the beginning of this year. the company continues to develop a robust innovation pipeline. we continue to diversify our product mix and ramped up our pre-roll formats or we increase production by over 200% in the fourth quarter and into 2021 to meet consumer demand. we also added solventless extracts in the fourth-quarter 2020 with the launch of our top leaf bubble hash.
we entered into a license agreement with simply solventless concentrates for the processing and manufacturing of a suite of solventless cannabis concentrates. finally, we added edibles to our portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2020 through a sales and distribution agreement with choklat, an alberta-based chocolatier. industrywide price compression remained a challenge, headwind for our business in 2020. we took the decision to monetize a portion of our inventory at lower prices in order to rightsize the composition and mix of our portfolio of products.
we continue to focus on competing in the premium segment and generate greater margins. to maximize our product mix and deliver better value to the consumer, we are going to be purposeful on how we engage in the rampant price compression that continues to challenge profitability in the industry. this may lead to lower top-line growth in 2021, but a stronger product mix supporting our beliefs that higher-quality products that deliver against our brand promise will be preferred by consumers and customers in the long term. now in the first quarter of 2021, we are seeing a softening industry in key provinces.
this can be attributed to both retail sales and provincial board's managing inventory and sku rationalization efforts. we do anticipate this dynamic to impact most of the canadian industry license holders. in the first half of 2020, we had to curtail our cultivation and harvesting activities to match market demand. while this decision certainly impacted our business results, we were able to increase our throughput while also reducing our costs.
we increased the number of cases delivered on a monthly basis from 12,853 cases in january to 24,847 cases in december of 2020. cultivation and production costs were reduced by 75% from $22.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 to $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to a 48% reduction in grams harvested in the comparative quarters. we continue to increase our investment in our portfolio brands through targeted sales and marketing initiatives. as a key priority for us includes increasing points of distribution to facilitate consumers' access to sundial products, we are currently in the process of scaling our own internal sales force for the majority of the provinces while we run a broker model in quã©bec.
given our management team's expertise in developing route-to-market capability, we are bending on our ability to drive sustainable roi through breadth and depth of coverage through our in-house sales expertise. we are already seeing progress in this investment as we drive distribution, along with price and promotion learnings with key customers across the country. we certainly had a transformative 2020 on foundational areas of our operation. these changes and improvements take time, and we are far from done on several fronts.
challenging the expected and learning from doing supports a culture of continuous improvement at sundial. while we understand we still have work to do on driving a sustainably profitable business, we remain encouraged in the progress made this past year. with that, i'd like to turn the call back to zach for closing remarks.
zach george -- chief executive officer
thanks, andrew. this past year was a remarkably difficult year, and not just because of the pandemic. sundial had to make many difficult decisions under new management in 2020 to ensure survival and greater stability. we are now able to lift our heads up and think longer term and strategically versus last year when we were largely forced to play defense.
it's been a privilege to work alongside the sundial employees, whose dedication and commitment has never wavered. together, we have made tremendous progress. i thank our team for their efforts, i thank our customers for their trust, and i thank our shareholders for their continued support. i believe that sundial is better positioned for success today than at any time since inception.
thank you for joining us today, and please stay safe. i will now turn it back over to the operator for the question period.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from tamy chen of bmo capital markets. please go ahead.
tamy chen -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great thanks for the question. zach, i was wondering if you could elaborate a bit more on this robust pipeline that you referenced when it comes to additional strategic investments, whether it's types of businesses or structures of the agreements or geographies and markets that you have in this pipeline. and then broadly speaking, just wondering why sundial has kind of taken this bit of additional strategy to kind of embark on these additional investments. i mean what is kind of the end game we're thinking on the strategy?
zach george -- chief executive officer
sure. thanks, tamy. thanks for the question, and good morning. so we're not going to give a lot of in-depth commentary on the specific transactions that we're working on today.
but what i can tell you is that generally speaking, the pipeline that we're looking at falls into two main categories. one would be more vanilla m&a, and the second would be direct or structured investments. and in terms of your question as to why we're deploying capital in this manner, we view the cannabis sector, not just in canada but internationally as well, as a sector where capital is, in certain cases, being significantly mispriced. and so any sector where you have the banking community, either on the sidelines or not participating and inefficiencies within the credit markets, you tend to see very interesting and attractive risk-adjusted return opportunities.
and we have -- we are very attractive to those opportunities and start to execute in capital deployment in that direction.
tamy chen -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
understood. ok. and my second question is just noticing this quarter also has some inventory writedowns, and that's been occurring through the past year. so i'm just wondering why the ongoing writedowns, what are they a result of? is it just ongoing market pricing changes and resulting in you taking continued writedowns?
zach george -- chief executive officer
yes. so first of all, let me just say that our team is working aggressively to bring greater efficiency to our cultivation processes and outcomes. and so, no.1, we see this historic performance as unacceptable. but we have been operating against the backdrop where, for example, if you look -- if you rewind to the beginning of 2020, flower with potency in the mid-teens would move in the marketplace and was quite liquid.
and with the change in consumer preferences and this potency-chasing behavior that we've witnessed, by the end of the year, a product that even at 20% potency would be less liquid and be very difficult to move through retail. so we've been making aggressive changes to improve outcomes and ensure that we're delivering and delighting consumers. and that has led to us having certain product that needed to be impaired from an accounting perspective to the extent that our terpene profiles and potency on-average harvest increase as they have, those writedowns should diminish substantially. and it's a key focus for the team going forward.
you also have pricing impacting that dynamic as a lever. and as you well know, the value segment is really on its way to effectively sort of blocking out the sun in the space, north of 50% of the industry in canada is in the buy segment. and we continue on a weekly basis to see prices dropping. and so, for example, we saw prices over the last year for 28-gram value packs, for example, in certain instances, drop by 50% over the course of 12 months.
so that's been a dynamic that's also forced us to take another look at our inventory valuations.
tamy chen -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from vivien azer of cowen. please go ahead.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you. good morning. i wanted to follow-up first on the pricing question, please. so clearly, price deflation in value sounds like there's even price softening at a 20% thc potency level.
so is there any potency level where pricing is holding up?
zach george -- chief executive officer
andrew, do you want to take that?
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
good morning, vivien. thanks for the question. yes, look, i think, it's moved very quickly. so as zach mentioned, mid-teens at the start of the year.
i think you're seeing 20% midway through last year. and then as you get into the back half of 2020, 23, 24%, to play in that premium segment, is really where the market is going. so i think the question that we're trying to answer right now, too, is what is the unconstrained demand when you think about potency and you think about the premium segment. value has moved so quickly.
it's such a large part of the mix right now by retailers and by boards. it's hard to get a grasp on looking at that premium segment on a pro forma basis. but we do look at other industries, or other more established markets in the u.s. and we're seeing that potency will obviously start to level off at some level, and we will see premiums start to play its role, and we forecast it to be 30 to 35% of the industry segment over time, certainly in the areas we play in on inhalables.
but potency is moving fast, anything 23, 24% right now and above is doing very, very well. and i don't see that stopping any time soon.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. understood. and given the restructuring, which is obviously very appropriate to your cultivation practices, do you have a sense for when we might see a revenue base that looks a little bit more like you were doing, call it, 2q of '20, obviously, the mix being very different. how much longer do you need to continue to kind of -- that your cultivation practices dial in that data-driven approach to actually really scale your revenues?
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
yes. look, i'll take that. i think you said a key point there, right, i think on mix. and i think we've been pretty consistent on that.
our focus in 2020 was to make that transition to branded sales versus wholesale. and we did this. we -- 75% of our total revenue mix was in branded versus just 20% in 2019. so when you're looking at year-over-year comparisons, not all revenue is created equally.
and i think that the key one, vivien, if i was to kind of point you in a direction around how we're thinking about it, is our branded product sales grew exponentially, actually by 410% when you think about 2019 versus 2020. that's solid. and we're seeing the benefits of that from penetrating the market. and we're also mindful of the fact that, as i stated, not all revenue is created equally.
so we've got to be really mindful of not getting into that rat race when it comes to price compression and contributing to the consistent price deflation that we're seeing. so we're going to continue to stay focused on the premium segment, the core segment. we see value in that over time. certainly, cultivation and potency is going to help drive that.
we've also significantly invested in our in-house sales breadth of coverage, which i mentioned in my opening remarks, so we're putting the elements in place. foundational to that is cultivation excellence, and we feel pretty confident about that. but i just -- i think that mix piece that you mentioned is supercritical to understand the transformation we've made from '19 to '20, and we're going to continue to do that.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. and i'll try to squeeze in one more because you mentioned the sales force. so appreciate your confidence in management competencies around being able to run an internal sales function. we've seen some of your competitors actually move in the opposite direction.
is there -- are there kpis that you're monitoring? i'm sure there are that would perhaps inform a move away from that because it tends to be certainly more sg&a-intensive to run your own sales operation.
zach george -- chief executive officer
yes. great question. look, we pretty much went through 2020 with a fairly light retail approach across the country. we are running a hybrid model.
so we do run a broker model in the province of quã©bec. we feel that's appropriate. and we've seen good progress in that region. and then we decided for balance of canada english candidate to run our in-house.
and look, by far, the no.1 metric we're looking at is distribution. we're looking at how do we cover the retail expansion happening in key markets like ontario. so we've got tremendous experience in-house on ability to drive world-class field sales management, and we have every intention to doing that. and we view it as an investment, not cost, and that investment needs to payout.
but put in perspective, over the last probably four weeks here, we've increased our breadth of coverage across the country and our in-house sales force by close to 50%. so we're anticipating we're going to be able to add value to retailers overtime here that we just have not had a chance to get to back last year. so we're excited about that. we're optimistic.
and we are seeing some very good initiatives with regards to distribution in the early part of 2021 here.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
understood. thank you very much.
zach george -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from david kideckel of atb capital markets. please go ahead.
david kideckel -- atb capital market -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter. i want to go back to the strategy here. considering sundial is a licensed producer and also seeing some of the pretty impressive deals you're striking right now, we're considering this as also an investment vehicle, which is arguably a big part of the reason with the disconnect between valuation and stock price.
so i'm wondering, zach and team, if you can maybe just -- what's stopping short of giving guidance? can you give some goalposts to us for how do we look at this? because, in our opinion, the street is just not taking your investment vehicle side of the business into account to attribute value. so if you have any color you can give, i think, could help us how we understand, how you're moving forward with that strategy.
zach george -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, david. look, we'll do our best to answer the question. i would just say that as you're well aware, there's no shortage of bold claims and promotional statements that have been made in this industry historically.
and we're working really hard to quickly get to profitability and let the results and fundamentals speak for themselves. i can tell you that we expect to be able to update you and the rest of the market on some of our initiatives in the coming months, even within the next 30 to 60 days. so we have quite a bit going on at sundial. when you point to valuation, i would just make two simple points.
clearly, there is a lot of interest in the growth of the sector in canada and beyond. so that's certainly impacting equity valuations across the board, not just for sundial. and then additionally, when you think about our capital resources and cash balances, i would make the statement that if you look across the space, and you look at where financings, both debt and equity are being struck today. you can quickly reach the conclusion that $1 of cash in this industry is actually worth more than $1 of cash.
so i think those two factors in some combination are impacting the broader market and investors' views of sundial, but don't want to comment beyond that.
david kideckel -- atb capital market -- analyst
understood. and then maybe i can just ask a question as well about one of the prs you made this week with the jv and with the saf group as well. but specifically on the spac strategy here, given that some of the capital in the press release indicated that some of it will go toward the stack, i'm wondering which sector or subsector, say, within cannabis, are you looking at. is this relevant for a specific geography? and is this just one of many kind of your stack strategies that we can expect?
zach george -- chief executive officer
sure, david. so just to clarify, working in reverse order. so we're not going to comment on the spac until we have appropriate filings made. so we've referenced it as a potential opportunity, and we're very clear about that in our public statements.
and you should think about that as very separate and distinct as an opportunity from the opportunity fund, which we are launching currently. so what you have is a joint venture where the operating experience of sundial and its principles have partnered with very deep and seasoned private equity experience at the saf group to tackle a number of initiatives in the space. and we look forward to updating you on those initiatives with much greater detail going forward. but in terms of this opportunity fund, we will be a lead investor.
we will help manage the general partnership and we expect to see fee-paying third-party capital and limited partner forum join us in that fund for those initiatives.
david kideckel -- atb capital market -- analyst
understood. ok. and if i can just squeeze one more quick one in here. just back to your revenue mix for the quarter, looking at the numbers here, about 25% of overall revenue was from vapes, obviously, higher margin than dried flower, which was at about 70% product mix.
just wondering, do you expect for the next quarter, is this a similar revenue mix here. or do you expect, for example, vapes to increase share or decrease for that matter?
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
thanks, david. good question. it's andrew here. i'll just address the big question.
look, inhalables, obviously is a key part of the strategy. we've been pretty clear on that. we were early to the game late in 2019 when kind of phase 2 came out. and we came out with a really great offering on vape under our top leaf and sundial brands.
so we're really happy with the first part of that launch, and we saw good traction in the mix there. and you're right to say, from a mix standpoint, it is accretive for us. that said, there's been a tremendous amount of competition coming into the space. again, vape is like any other segments we're in.
it's facing a lot of new industry players and they're differentiating by price. and i think that's going to create a bit of a headwind for us in regards to how we continue to compete at the prices and the value equation for the consumer that we're looking to obtain. and i don't see that stopping because we're seeing, again, more entrants come into that space. but here's a point i would make as we think about the next evolution of vape.
we do have some very exciting innovation that we're looking to launch in 2021 in the vape segments. and we've done what we need to do with regards to competing in value with one gram vape, but it's certainly not a key focus. that will be line primarily with top leaf and sundial, and we're currently in two formats of extraction on that vape, which is ethanol and co2. and as you know, there's certainly more opportunities there, certainly on the hydrocarbon side to provide further differentiation, and we intend to do that, which should drive better value for consumers and obviously be accretive to our margin mix.
so we're excited about that offering but certainly competitive. early part of 2021, we're seeing that in the numbers.
david kideckel -- atb capital market -- analyst
ok. thanks for taking my questions and again congrats on the quarter.
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
thank you.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from doug miehm of rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
doug miehm -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks. a couple of questions. when you think about the invested capital between the two areas, let's say, between m&a to build the business, and then, i guess, what you call your investment side of the business. what do you expect the mix to be there?
zach george -- chief executive officer
yes, doug, that's a great question. we're working actually on a number of live m&a files. there are elements of timing and a lack of certainty on execution, which could cause a swing in that answer by hundreds of millions of dollars. so this is not something that we have set in stone or budgeted out.
we are underwriting and chasing opportunities that we think are highly strategic for sundial. and the timing and quantum ultimately is something that we're not going to give guidance for today.
doug miehm -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. when you think about what you're growing today and your ability to get to that 23% to maybe 25% potency, can you tell me what percent of the crop that you're growing is getting to those levels? because one of the things that, i think, we should all be concerned about is, are we going to see regular write-offs that actually should be included in your cost of goods, if you can't meet the 22 or 23%?
zach george -- chief executive officer
yes. i'll take that. so you're right. you're right, doug.
it's something that is a key focus for us with our core operations. and as we've said, we've made tremendous progress in terms of our -- the potency of our average harvest, particularly starting in the fourth quarter. we've also brought in some new genetics that were -- that are showing very, very promising results. but we are working to avoid some of the poor cultivation outcomes that plagued the company earlier on.
and it's absolutely essential to getting our costs down and ensuring that we are not wasting capital when it comes to our cultivation activities. so it is a key focus, and it's a great question.
doug miehm -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yes. but can you give an idea like is half of your growth not meeting the sort of hurdle? or is it a lot lower than that?
zach george -- chief executive officer
yes. i would say in rough magnitude at our worst in early 2020, and you can see this through the impairment analysis, is that, yes, roughly half at our worst was not suitable, not meeting the objectives that our consumers have in terms of product and potency. but that number has been reduced and continues to be reduced quite materially. and we're going to be able to talk more about that in the coming quarters.
but given the fact that we just revamped all of our cultivation practices in the back half of 2020, that number is still improving and is not static.
doug miehm -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok, excellent. that's it for me. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from shaan mir of canaccord genuity. please go ahead.
shaan mir -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
hi there and thanks for taking my questions. the first one i got here is just on the market share. so it's declining again for a second straight quarter to 2.7% in the quarter, and that's down from above 5% two quarters ago. so you're showing strong sales momentum on the vape side.
and from prior commentary, it's pretty obvious that the market shift and value is the key driver here. and so keeping in mind, andrew's commentary that focus will be on the premium segment going forward. i was wondering if you could provide any commentary on how you see that market share shaping up in the short term over 2021. and when internally do you expect it to start ramping back?
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
shaan, thanks for the question. it's andrew here. i'll take that. so maybe i'll start with a bit of the industry kind of view here, and then i'll kind of filter it down into how we're looking at that for market share for sundial-branded products.
so look, i think when you look at the industry, when you look at an annual compound growth, it continues to move in the right direction in this country, and that's good. but it's like any other cpg business, there is seasonality and there's other headwinds and tailwinds that are going to impact the industry. and rightly so, impact the ability for some producers to penetrate the market. so when i look at q1, it's soft across most provinces.
ontario -- i was just on the phone this week with the ontario leadership team, and their performance is minus 17% on industry versus december. and february and march are showing slight growth rolling 90%, but coming off a very small base. and they've been obviously having stores closed since november of last year. bc showing preliminary industry numbers at about minus 7% decline in february and march -- or sorry, january and february in alberta is double-digit decline on the industry.
and i tell you that because i think it's important to understand that you can still grow market share in a declining industry. and in some of the markets, we're playing in certain; some of the key markets, we want to win in. we're seeing some prelim results that would tell us we're moving in the right direction there. but i think it's going to continue to be very, very competitive.
i think we're at a point in the industry right now where you're having seven to nine new license holders being issued by health canada a week. you've got 100 lps sitting in the province of ontario. you've got a number of 200 coming in this year at some point that they're stating. so it's going to continue to be a big challenge to grow market share, but i'm really confident in our ability to -- now that we're investing in our sales and marketing, we are focused on a commitment to cultivation.
we have some great brands. we have some great relationships with retailers. and i'd also be mindful of when we're looking at these data sets, whether they're headset or whether there are some proprietary retail platform that a retailer is putting out there that you guys are looking at, there's other factors that are impacting what lps are doing well in those retailers. so from a holistic side, we're confident that we can grow market share.
we're seeing good signs of that. there's certainly going to be high levels of competition. but it's a focus for the group, and we're making the right investments into how we want to do that. and we'll see that momentum continue in 2020.
shaan mir -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
and then the second one was just on a brief update on what's happening with the choklat arrangement. so do you have any products at the market there? and if there's any commentary on how they've been received? and also, just considering all the moving parts that are in the story now, can you speak to any pipeline or desire for adding on any other contract manufacturing partners?
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
yes, shaan, it's andrew. i'll take that again. so yes, with last year, we ended up signing two contract manufacturing partnerships. one, as you mentioned with choklat, whose local alberta chocolatier makes phenomenal products.
and we've seen consumer uptake on that in the province alberta do really well. we launched that late last year by the aglc and we're getting ready to put that into other markets this year, and we're excited about that. so we'll continue to see good products being released under that partnership. there's some very cool innovation coming along those lines as well that choklat is working on.
and we're excited to be working with them to bring those to canadian consumers across the country. we also signed a licensing arrangement with a company called simply solventless out of our rocky view facility, and that's very much focused on concentrates. they're specialized in that. and we're going to look at the playing field.
obviously, the indiva investments that we made as well in early part of this year. and so we're going to continue to kind of look at the country around opportunities. but i would mention our core competency will still remain largely in that inhalables focus. and we're very dedicated to cultivation being the foundational piece of that.
and we'll look at those opportunities that come up, and they're certainly going to be more moving forward.
shaan mir -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
thanks for that. that's all my question.

this concludes the question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to zach george for any closing remarks.

2021-Q1,SNDL,2021-05-12 10:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good morning, and welcome to sundial growers' first-quarter 2021 financial results conference call. [operator instructions] and the conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] yesterday afternoon, sundial issued a press release announcing their financial results for the first quarter ended march 31, 2021. this press release is available on the company's website at sndlgroup.com and filed on edgar and sedar as well.
presenting on this morning's call, we have zach george, chief executive officer; jim keough, chief financial officer; and andrew stordeur, president and chief operating officer. before we start, i would like to remind investors that certain matters discussed in today's conference call or answers that may be given to questions could constitute forward-looking statements. actual results could differ materially from those anticipated. risk factors that could affect results are detailed in the company's financial reports and other public filings that are made available on sedar and edgar.
additionally, all financial figures mentioned are in canadian dollars, unless otherwise indicated. i'd also like to note that we are conducting the call today from our respective remote locations. as such, there may be brief delays, crosstalk, or minor technical issues during this call. we thank you in advance for your patience and understanding.
we will now make prepared remarks, and then we'll move on to the question-and-answer session. i would now like to turn the call over to zach george.
zach george -- chief executive officer
good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first-quarter 2021 earnings call. we are now more than a year into this global pandemic. unfortunately, covid-19 continues to significantly affect canadians as the third wave is in full force. that said, we believe that there's light at the end of the tunnel as vaccines are currently proliferating across the country and the world.
our top priority remains the health and safety of our employees. we remain committed to stringent procedures to ensure the protection of our employees and consumers while minimizing disruption to our operations. despite the negative impact the store closures and orders to stay at home have had on retail sales, we are grateful to be designated as an essential service provider, which has enabled us to continue to operate and serve customers and consumers while so many small and medium-sized businesses have not had the same opportunity. we are pleased to announce sundial's first-ever quarter with positive results from adjusted ebitda.
this result reflects the continued efforts from our teams across the organization to build a platform targeting attractive capital deployment opportunities while we focus on the continued improvement of our cultivation practices in an immature and rapidly changing industry. sundial continues to focus on operational improvements and capital deployment opportunities, both of which will enable sundial to become a stronger and more diverse cannabis company. since december, we have made a number of investments across the capital structure of public cannabis companies. and last week, we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of inner spirit holdings and the spiritleaf retail cannabis network.
we are pleased with our investment track record, which started with our internal program and has evolved to include a partnership with third-party capital. while we have made several significant strategic investments this past quarter, we continue to see a robust pipeline of additional investment and m&a opportunities. sundial remains debt-free and has a total capital base, including liquid securities, loan assets, and an unrestricted cash balance of more than $1 billion. today, approximately 70% of this balance sits in unrestricted cash.
maximizing our returns on deployed capital and corporate stewardship are key priorities for our board and management team. at the end of the first quarter of 2021, the company had deployed approximately $96 million into several cannabis-related investments. these investments generated $15.7 million in interest income and fees, including 12.9 million of realized and unrealized gains on marketable securities. as of today's call, we see absolute realized and unrealized gains in q2 that are greater than that of q1.
however, much of this exposure is subject to market risk and may change prior to the end of the second quarter. in terms of our cannabis operations, sundial remains focused and committed to its cultivation and processing activities and the improvement of its cultivation outcomes. revenue declines in the first quarter were the results of the continued growth of the discount segment, inventory monetization across sundial's grassland brand, and slower industry sales driven by seasonality and covid-19 restrictions across canada. our negative gross margin in q1 was largely attributable to aggressive price reductions on our grasslands products undertaken to optimize inventory levels to align with demand, in addition to maintenance capital items and an unanticipated spike in utility pricing in february.
moving forward, we will be limiting the offering of discount products in markets where we view the economics as neither attractive nor sustainable. sundial has no interest in pursuing unprofitable revenue growth, and we are unwilling to seek the maintenance of market share at all costs. we believe that the combination of continued oversupply, a lack of differentiation in the majority of branded product, in addition to regulatory and operating dysfunction at many levels will create a reckoning for the industry during 2021. we welcome this reckoning as the rationalization and regulatory evolution moves the canadian recreational industry toward greater health over the next several years.
we have made progress with our cultivation results, and andrew will provide more details, but we still have work to do in our core operations to achieve the goals that we have established for sundial and our shareholders. we continue to see some of our canadian peers move away from cultivation partially or entirely due to the inability to deliver consistent cultivation outcomes. but we have not wavered with our commitment to cultivation in our indoor modular facility, and our brand promise to consumers is fundamental to our strategy. we continue to maintain our focus on keeping our employees safe and adjusting to market demands.
our strong financial position, unique cultivation facility, and focus on premium inhalables have positioned us for improved performance in the second half of 2021 and beyond. i am excited about sundial's future and our competitive positioning. thank you, all. i will now pass it to jim for commentary on our financial results. 
jim keough -- chief financial officer
thanks, zach, and good morning to all who are listening in. i would like to remind everyone that all amounts that i mentioned this morning are denominated in canadian dollars unless otherwise stated. let's start with a review of the improvements that we've achieved in our liquidity and capital structure during the quarter. we opened 2021 with $60 million of cash on hand.
by the end of q1, that number was 873 million. and as of may 7, 2021, the company had an unrestricted cash balance of approximately $753 million, in addition to investments in marketable securities at market value of 327 million were a total of $1.08 billion when combined. our outstanding share count was 1.77 billion at the end of q1 and sits at 1.86 billion today. during the first quarter of 2021, sundial issued 857 million common shares pursuant to at-the-market equity programs, registered direct offerings, and warrant exercises for total proceeds of $854 million.
subsequent to the quarter-end, the company issued 85 million shares through its at-the-market equity program for total proceeds of $97.7 million. the first quarter of 2021 was a transitional period for sundial, and we have realigned our business into two segments for operational and reporting purposes. one being cannabis operations and the other being investments. by the end of the first quarter of 2021, the company had deployed a portion of the capital raised into several cannabis-related investments totaling $96 million.
during q1, the company realized $2.8 million of interest in fee revenue from loans to third parties and $12.9 million in realized and unrealized gains from investments in marketable securities. this revenue is being classified as income from operations reflecting the new segmentation of our operations, and we intend to continue to deploy significant capital, targeting a portfolio of enhanced risk-return opportunities in the cannabis industry to provide exposure to attractive debt equity and hybrid instruments. now, let me explain the net loss for the quarter in more detail. net loss for the three months ended march 31, 2021, was $134.4 million compared to a net loss of $64.1 million in the previous quarter.
effectively, all of this net loss arose from $130 million of noncash fair value adjustments that are required under ifrs reporting on the derivative warrants attached to the direct offerings that were issued during the quarter. there was no cash impact from the fair value changes resulting from these valuation adjustments. there will be no cash payment ever for the derivative warrants amount that is disclosed on our balance sheet. these two amounts will fluctuate each quarter with our share price until the warrants are exercised or expired.
for clarity, management estimates that if this revaluation was done using market conditions as of may 10, 2021, the fair value of the outstanding derivative warrants, which are shown as a liability on our balance sheet, would decrease by approximately $34 million. there would be a noncash gain on our income statement of the same amount. sundial continued to strategically deploy its capital throughout the first quarter and subsequent to quarter-end. to summarize our deployment of capital in our investment segment to date, sundial invested $22 million in indiva ltd., a canadian producer of cannabis edibles.
we entered into a strategic capital partnership with the saf group focused on cannabis-related opportunities and investments in canada and internationally. the first mandate of the joint venture is a special opportunity fund with an initial commitment of $188 million by sundial, in addition to commitments from third-party limited partners. sundial acquired just over 10% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the valens company inc. valens is a research-driven, vertically integrated, end-to-end developer and manufacturer of innovative cannabinoid-based products.
sundial also announced that it entered into an arrangement agreement pursuant to which the company will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of inner spirit holdings and the spiritleaf retail cannabis network for total consideration of approximately $131 million including cash of approximately 102 million. now, let's turn our focus to the operating results starting with adjusted ebitda. sundial recorded its first-ever adjusted ebitda of $3.3 million in q1 2021 compared to an adjusted ebitda loss of $5.6 million in the prior quarter. the significant increase was mainly due to realized investment gains and income from the company's strategic cannabis-related portfolio investments.
as discussed, this will be a core part of sundial's operations moving forward. in q1, we've seen cash flow improvements due to investment revenue, as well as realignment and refinement of our cannabis operating model. in the first quarter, cash provided from operations was positive $2.3 million before changes in working capital, including the first quarter of investment revenue. in the previous quarter, the company used $12.2 million from operations.
net revenue from cannabis for the first quarter declined by 29% to $9.9 million from $13.9 million in the previous quarter. sales were negatively impacted by provincial boards reducing inventory levels, retail market conditions, and continued price compression across the industry in sundial's product portfolio. average gross selling price per gram equivalent of branded products, net of provisions, was $3.15 per gram, compared to $4.14 per gram in the prior quarter, reflecting the industry price compression and a consumer shift to value products. general and administrative expenses were about 9% higher at $7.1 million, compared to $6.5 million for the previous quarter, reflecting legal and other fees related to the investment segment and the build-out of our direct sales team.
in q1 2021, sales and marketing expenses reflect spending discipline and seasonality at $950,000, compared to $2.3 million in the previous quarter. we have increased investment commitments in both our sales and marketing teams and have added key additional team members. adjusted gross margin before inventory impairment and fair value adjustments was negative $1.6 million, compared to $3.2 million for the previous quarter. this was despite our improvements from cost-optimization initiatives, our focus on margin accretive strains and skus, and improved cultivation outcomes due primarily to market price trends and to value-priced products.
there is more work to be done to improve our margins for cannabis operations. total capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2021 were not material, but we have budgeted $5.7 million in capital expenditures for full-year 2021 related to processing automation, minor facility improvements, and maintenance capital. now, i would like to invite andrew stordeur, president and coo of sundial, to provide remarks related to cannabis operations.
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, jim. as we continue to see volatility in the industry and continued price compression, sundial's ability to deliver high-quality inhalables through our commitment to cultivation excellence will remain a key component of our strategy. the price dynamics of the discount segments are not sustainable for sundial's portfolio of assets. moving forward, we will focus on improving our margin to product mix and strategic revenue management while continuing to further simplify our supply chain and our portfolio products.
while there is still room for improvements in those areas, we have made progress over the course of the first quarter of 2021. the sundial's commitment to cultivation excellence has been developed around three pillars of focus: people, process, and plants. now, let me start with people. in quarter 1, we restructured our supply and operations teams at our olds facility.
we believe that a more streamlined organization will allow our teams to become more nimble and make more informed decisions given the dynamic nature of the industry. we have recently invested in cultivation leadership and we'll also be adding product engineer capability at our olds facility to develop a more sustainable innovations launch program. we went from more than 100 skus at the beginning of 2020 to less than 40 skus at the beginning of this year. we launched three concentrate skus in the first quarter of 2021 under the top leaf and grasslands brands.
we signed a new partnership with stigma grow to develop additional hydrocarbon concentrate offerings under our top leaf brand. our innovation pipeline for the balance of 2021 is focused and we'll be launching several new products in the next few months. our second cultivation pillar is around process. with over 700 harvests since inception, sundial has tremendous access to cultivation data and insights.
our team is currently in the process of revamping our entire genetics playbook which will allow us to drive further cultivation consistency. in quarter 1, sundial harvested its highest potency flower since the olds facility's inception with top leaf's la kush cake initial lots producing potency in excess of 28% thc. the product has seen strong velocity since launch. we have increased our average potency results by approximately 15% year over year.
and finally, our third cultivation pillar is around plants. we continue to invest in developing a library of cultivars that look to achieve a combination of higher potency, more robust terpene profiles, and above-average yield. we received our first laboratory results and our new extended library of genetics and we'll prioritize these for launch in the fourth quarter of 2021. our focus is still on brand sales.
however, we have seen an increasing sales trend in wholesale market opportunities. we feel that sundial is well-positioned to take advantage of these b2b opportunities as other licensed producers divest from cultivation practices. these pillars are underpinned by our continuous focus on reducing costs. in the first quarter of 2021, our cultivation and production costs were reduced to an average of $4 million per month, from $10 million per month in the first quarter of 2020.
our top-line numbers regressed versus q4 2020 and year over year. as zach mentioned earlier, sundial will not pursue unprofitable revenue growth and we are unwilling to grow market share at all costs. we believe increasing our investment into our direct sales team will enable us to win by accelerating the distribution of our products through new customer acquisition, brand activation, and by improving education with both customers and consumers on our product portfolio. as a result, we added 13 dedicated salespeople to the organization in quarter 1 which significantly improves the breadth and frequency of our customer coverage and will be a key enabler to increasing our market share in the core and premium segments moving forward.
with an increased focus on driving the right assortment at store level, our new retail team increased distribution on sundial's priority skus by 25% across several key markets in the first quarter. while we are encouraged with the progress made in operations for quarter 1, we still have work to do on driving a sustainably profitable cannabis operation segment with cultivation excellence at our core. with that, i'd like to turn the call back to zach for closing remarks.
zach george -- chief executive officer
i thank our team for their efforts, our customers for their trust, and our shareholders for their continued support as we work to position sundial for success. thank you for joining us today and please stay safe. i will now turn it back over to the operator for the question period.

operator
thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question comes from tamy chen of bmo capital markets. please go ahead. 
tamy chen -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everyone. first, i wanted to ask if you could explain a bit more on the rationale for the acquisition of the inner spirit, you know, franchise and some corporate stores? is it to, you know, have your marketing team better engage with this network of stores to increase penetration of sundial products? just if you could elaborate a bit more on the thinking of why acquiring into retail.
zach george -- chief executive officer
hi, tamy. good morning. thanks for the question. unfortunately, we're going to actually punt on this question for now.
we are satisfying a number of conditions to close the transaction and we'll be providing a very fulsome update closer to the time of close, which as we said is early in q3. and we'd be happy to give a much more detailed answer at that time. 
tamy chen -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. fair enough. then, if we can pivot to what's been happening in the rec market here. so noticing, you know, in the press release and then in comments, you're talking about this sort of sustained price decline in flower in canada.
so i wanted to ask, you know, first off, why in your view this is sustaining? how long do you think it might continue? and how do you think about this overarching dynamic as you're trying to drive more higher-margin sales, which would naturally come with higher price point products? thanks.
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
hey, tamy, it's andrew here. thanks for the question. yeah, i think, first and foremost, the price compression continues, and i think we've seen that, you know, as of last year moving into this year as well. so as far as timelines go on that, we're going to be in that position i think as an industry for a while.
and i think largely that's driven by high inventory levels and really monetizing that inventory across all provinces with a lot of licensed producers. so it's here to stay for a while. but as you mentioned, you know, we're pretty optimistic given that this is a consumer product category that we're going to see, you know, the core and premium segments move in the right direction. that's going to take a little bit of time.
and i think, you know, the important thing for our position on that is, you know, we have the ability to not chase revenue and not chase market share in the discount segment. our balance sheet is extremely strong. and, you know, we have the ability to lead for a healthy industry dynamic. and as i think we stated in the opening comments, you know, one of the key actions we're taking is really get selective on key markets and want to make decisions on pulling out of some markets on the discount segment.
and i think that's a good thing for the industry and that's certainly a good thing for sundial. and, you know, we're going to continue to focus on. we mentioned the frontline sales investment that we have. i can tell you foolhardy that that team's not going to be focused on driving discount products and really renting market share.
they're going to be talking about our premium offerings, the top leaf, and certainly in sundial. and, you know, i think consumers want to hear that. certainly, our customers want to hear that. and that's really where we're focused on.
so we're in this for a little bit a while longer, no question, but we're pretty optimistic that, you know, the segment is going to move consistent with other more established categories in cpg. 
tamy chen -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from david kideckel of atb capital markets. please go ahead.
david kideckel -- atb capital markets -- analyst
hi, good morning. congratulations on the quarter. thanks for taking my questions. i want to go back a little bit to your strategy here, zach, your team, with acquisitions taking a stake in companies now.
not to mention the inner spirit holdings acquisition specifically, but can you maybe help us understand -- i mean, what is the overarching strategy here? we note that, you know, you are in the process of acquiring inner spirit versus, you know, taking a stake in other companies. i think you mentioned on the -- on your prepared remarks, balanced company. there's also indiva. so what is the overarching strategy here? is it a combination of both? or are there certain metrics you're looking for in certain companies to decide how to proceed? or just any commentary on the strategy there would be helpful.
thanks.
zach george -- chief executive officer
sure. good morning, david, and thanks for the question. so look, i think the strategy on capital deployment is very much in line with our commentary from last quarter. so we do see in canada consolidation on its way in a material manner and we are looking at opportunities in this space from really to two main perspectives.
one, in terms of classic m&a, where we can consolidate or be a consolidator, take a certain cost out of a structure and position ourselves well in the canadian market. and then we also have the ability through our partnerships and what we've done off of our own balance sheet to look at asymmetric investment opportunities, which are really just that where we see an attractive risk-reward. and typically, the opportunity to earn, you know, modest equity-like returns, in many cases, higher up in the capital structure. so when you look at some of the small stakes we've taken in the equity of certain businesses, the common theme that you see is really a differentiated model from our perspective that would not apply to certainly every company or business model in canada.
but from our perspectives, there are a few that really stand out in terms of capabilities and what we perceive as a strong future role in the canadian landscape. so we think that will evolve over time, you'll likely see us recycle capital in a number of instances. there are many reasons why, you know, smart m&a transactions never get completed. but we are -- we continue to have wide-ranging discussions with a number of parties in the industry and are trying to walk slowly toward these transactions that we think make a lot of sense for sundial shareholders.
david kideckel -- atb capital markets -- analyst
understood. thanks for that color. and i would agree with you, zach. for one, you know, this is very differentiated in what looks like a potentially lucrative business model.
so with that said, i think jim or andrew you mentioned two of your operating models share both the reporting and strategic purposes include both the cannabis is number one, and number two is your investment model. shifting back to your cannabis business right here, i think, zach, as well you mentioned, you know, you have the potential to stop unprofitable business segments within your cannabis segment. so i'm just wondering from the potential that you have now with your balance sheet with over a billion dollars and the investments you're making into companies, why bother with cannabis? and so far as, you know, we're seeing where the market is and all the challenges there when in fact your investment side of the business could potentially be much more lucrative in cannabis. so in other words, is all this trouble worth the effort? thanks.
zach george -- chief executive officer
let me just answer and then i'll pass it to andrew. but i think what we're seeing is, as we mentioned, a number of -- as you know as well, david, a number of our peers are effectively moving away from cultivation. we have what we believe is a world-class facility. as we've really learned to operate within that facility and refine our cultivation practices, we've reached improved results.
we do see this as a commodity business, at the end of the day. and so i think it's a contrarian perspective to take to effectively triple down on cultivation but one that we're embracing. and i think that you're going to see more cultivation get pulled out of the system, you're going to see a wholesale market that comes back in a very robust manner as this industry evolves. and you've got some, you know, a small number of very strong players that have very, very low-cost structures.
you know, what we're trying to attack is really the premium flower segment and it all comes down to really usable plant matter and cultivation outcomes. we need to have narrower, more consistent outcomes, and that's really the charge that andrew's been leading.
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
david, i'll just add to that. look, i think, you know, we were pretty mainly focused on inhalable, and that's obviously the largest segment inside of cannabis. you know, our right to win in that is really predicated on cultivation. now, as zach mentioned, you know, we have this small-budget scale facility that really will enable that strategy to really take hold.
and look, there are some small micro growers out there and they're doing a fabulous job, but nobody's done it at scale. and that's really our mandate, right? if we do that really, really well and this side of the business is all about making it as boring as possible and as predictive, as zach mentioned, as possible. so when we do that, and when we're able to actually drive that cultivation consistency at a scale that really nobody is doing in the industry, globally quite frankly, that's really our right to win and that's what we focus on. when we do that, it's going to have a significant impact on our ability to kind of drive our shareholders' value.
david kideckel -- atb capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's very helpful. thank you. and then if i can just squeeze one quick one related to both you guys were talking about here.
just with respect to your jv with the saf group and your previous commentary on the potential stack, are there opportunities then to build from within to potentially spin one of your own internal businesses out here and into a stack, or should we be thinking about these as more external opportunities? thanks, and i'm going to hop back into the queue.
zach george -- chief executive officer
sure, david. so, yes, you should be thinking about those vehicles today as oriented to pursue external opportunities. your point on spinning out segments could be a very important discussion, you know, two or three years out, to the extent that we have more scale and a stabilized business that we think, as a pure play, would have a better positioning in the markets in north america. we're certainly not there yet.
we're just at the early stages of the development of this platform but it's surely something that we're thinking about as we look further down the road. you know, given the constraints of the stack structure, you're likely not going to see the stack look at any of our internal assets as a qualifying transaction. and we expect to provide the market with an update on our partnership with saf, the third-party funds that we're engaged in raising today as well as any updates related to the stack in the next 30 to 60 days.
david kideckel -- atb capital markets -- analyst
ok. thanks very much and congrats on the quarter.
operator
our next question comes from pablo zuanic of cantor fitzgerald. please go ahead.
pablo zuanic -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
thank you. good morning. two questions, you know, one is regarding m&a, as you describe it. can you talk about opportunities if you're thinking of opportunities overseas or say in the u.s.? and related to that, i'm assuming that because of your u.s.
listings -- soluble u.s. listing, you are more limited in terms of doing businesses or acquiring businesses in the u.s. and the second question is more on the operational side. i understand, you know, you're going through a transition period, you have a war chest there with all that cash that was raised, but you have reported sales to the provincial board, say about 37% sequentially.
can you give some context around that number? you know, what were the retail underlying trends? i suppose you were better than minus 37. and then, just elaborate in terms of what you need to do better to improve that number, right? what i'm learning, and maybe i'm wrong, is that small companies can do very well in the value end or the lower price points, and other companies can do very well in the high premium, but the scale doesn't necessarily seem to be a recipe for success necessarily, right? so just talk about how you can improve the business relative to what was up, you know, the job that you reported in the first quarter. thank you.
zach george -- chief executive officer
sure. let me let andrew speak to revenue and the current market environment and steps we're taking to improve cooperation. but on the first question regarding m&a, pablo, you're correct to point out that our nasdaq listing creates challenges for us to directly invest in plan touching assets in the u.s. we think that opportunity set will evolve over time and there are various ways that we can take advantage of opportunities in the u.s.
as some of our peers have in a structured manner or through entering for distribution or product mix that is not thc-related, but that's an evolving scenario. we are getting presented with a lot of opportunities internationally. we have vehicles, we have the capital to look at and take advantage of those opportunities. but i will say that we are very committed and focused on being successful in canada and being a part of what we think will be a very healthy landscape when we emerge from the current dysfunction in the next two to three years.
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
hey, pablo, it's andrew here. thanks for the question. i'll break this up into two pieces because i think there was this concept around kind of what's happening in the industry and some of the dynamics there that we're dealing with in canada and then what are we doing about it specific to the operations. let me give you some color on kind of what's happening in certain on what we saw in q1 and we're seeing the same thing kind of in q2 with regards to industry headwinds.
so first and foremost, the industry was down in january and february. we saw a bounce back in march, but we had a slow industry to start with. i think you don't want to belabor the point around pricing dynamics but that's real, and the discount segment. i mean, we used to have value but now we've got value and discount and the discount segment is accelerating, you know, at an unsustainable pace and it's certainly not an area that sundial wants to lead on.
and i think that we saw some provincial boards do what they needed to do with regards to, you know, managing their inventory and reducing weeks of coverage, and that's really impacted us in the first quarter largely in western canada. that said, moving forward, you know, as i stated before, our strategy is still very much in the inhalables piece. and you know, we need to drive a better product mix, particularly in a brand like top leaf, and we have some outstanding strong pricing on top leaf. we're close to $7 a gram, you know, in the markets that we compete in that premium segment, and that's significant.
and as we drive a better premium segment mix into our profile, that's what we want to see and that's going to mean we're going to have to make some tough decisions but the right decision when it comes to walking away from the discount segment like markets or it's just doesn't make sense. let me just quickly touch on the upside. i'd love to say that the progress in the operation side and the facility follows kind of a 90-day window in a fiscal calendar but it's not that simple. we've been in operations really for about two and a half years here and we've been focused really on optimizing our costs over the past year.
and while that discipline will remain, it's also about taking the next step and doubling down on cultivation as we mentioned. in my opening remarks, i mentioned three pillars on that, and that's really around people processing plants, and it's in that order for u. it's very, very important. we have new genetics that is coming to market in q4.
we're excited about that. we're taking our existing commercial strains and we're streamlining that, and that's part and parcel to what we mentioned in the remarks as well around our sku optimization. it's all about simplifying the supply chain. we're seeing some of our counterparts go the opposite way.
and i don't think that's needed, especially if you want to play in the corner of the premium segments. you have to earn your right to win there. and that's really what we're focused on in the facility on the operations side. hopefully, i provide some color for you, pablo.
pablo zuanic -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
thank you. that's very helpful. can i ask maybe just one more? you know, when i talk to the many companies how they are -- i find that there are different strategies when it comes to strains, right? there are some companies that if i look at this kind of data, you know, almost 40% or 50% of their flower business may come from just one strain, right? whereas the other companies would have a more diversified strain portfolio in terms of strains. and then there's a third category that i consider the, you know, limited-edition companies that have a, you know, strains for the season, and then they change them later on.
and i'm just trying to -- i suppose they all make sense, but do you have a view on what's better right now, or there are just different strategies and to each their own? thanks. i'll pass it on.
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
pablo, it's andrew. a good question. look, you know, we're big believers in focus on core, get that right, and then earn your right to, you know, move into more diversification in your product portfolio. so, first and foremost, you know, we've got to make our current commercial genetics work, but we also know consumer preference moves over time.
and certainly, what we've seen in more established markets out of the u.s., you know, that cycle is, you know, six to nine months and you can really get a good strain and drive that forward. but then you're going to have to come in with a good innovation pipeline. and that process, given that we're in agri-foods business, you know, it takes time to run that r&d cycle. so, genetics will be a key part and that's part of my, you know, three-pillar kind of process i laid out there.
plans being the last piece of that, it's going to be a key part of our folks to move forward. and we have the facility with the small-batch scale capability to run that play, but i would say primarily focus and i mentioned in the sku optimization issue. we got to get the core right. our customers are asking for it.
i think consumers are looking for consistency in cultivation. again, i think we can deliver on that. that's what we're focused on in the short term here.
pablo zuanic -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from vivien azer of cowen. please go ahead.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. thanks very much. so, zach, i just wanted to pivot back to the portfolio cleanup that you guys engaged in in the quarter. so, you know, it makes sense that you would, you know, discount the grasslands product, you know, move it through the system so that you guys can now have a better footing as you orient toward, you know, profitable market share versus market share at all costs.
but as i look at your balance sheet, it looks like your inventories grew about 30% over the course of the quarter. so, can you help me reconcile that?
zach george -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, vivien. i'll let andrew talk about inventories and how that's feeding operations into q2 and beyond.
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
hey, vivien. thanks for the question. yeah, absolutely. i think when you have a, you know, a $10 million topline number, and as we grow out, i think, you know, that's a big focus for us.
so, you know, the best way for us to manage that inventory level to a sustainable rate is, you know, we want to have, you know, at least two to three months of inventory on hand, sellable inventory, the right quality inventory, and, you know, we're proactively managing that as best we can given our cultivation focus. and we've also got obviously a dynamic in the industry with provincial boards trying to get their weeks of coverage in inventory under control. so, it's very dynamic and it's certainly an area of focus for us, and it's very much predicated on our ability to grow a consistent quality product that consumers and customers want. once we do that, we can drive that top-line number up, and certainly, you know, you get that inventory level to where we needed to be which is, you know, about two to three months associated.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. and then just to follow up on that then, andrew. presumably, the inventory that you guys have on hand is better quality than you have talked about, the improvements in potency year to date. so then how do we think about gross margin, you know, go forward? was the negative gross margin in the first quarter truly a one-off and how do we think about recovering gross margin? thanks.
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. thanks, vivien. good question. look, i think the gross margin is certainly not across the entire portfolio.
i think that's the first piece i'd mention and there's certainly a pretty large range there on how we look at inhalables and the margin profile that we're able to drive. but look, maybe i'll touch on a couple of pieces and then if jim, zach wants to add in, please feel free to do so. but the big one is, you know, we saw kind of further price compression in the quarter. i'm not going to believe that point it is what it is and we're seeing that across the industry.
we had some discounts and allowances, as well as some returns. and that was, you know, really proactive for us because, obviously, the ability to manage the right assortment at a store level starts at what is in stock at the provincial level. so, you know, we want to make sure the freshest and highest-potency product is there. so, we were proactively managing that.
we had some discounts and allowances and some returns that we had to manage through a normal course of business. but, you know, as we get tighter on our inventory, provincial boards get tighter on their inventory and get more selective on their sku assortments, you know, we're certainly in a better position to manage that moving forward. and then my last point i'd say if you look at gross margin, we did have some, you know, some cultivation production variance in there due to increased power charges that we saw largely in february. and, you know, that's tough to manage, given our fixed kind of cost base in our asset in olds.
but we anticipate that to be onetime factors and certainly we'll see that kind of bounce back as we come into q2 and the balance of the year. but i'll pass it to zach and jim do you want to add anything to that?
jim keough -- chief financial officer
yeah. this -- vivien, this -- the point on our utility cost is an important one. so, we actually saw in the month of february our power prices effectively doubled. they're back down to basically january levels now, but that was a painful spike that impacted our cultivation and processing costs.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
can you quantify what the magnitude of that incrementality on the energy cost was?
jim keough -- chief financial officer
yeah. it was approximately $300,000.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. understood. thanks very much.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from shaan mir of canaccord genuity. please go ahead.
shaan mir -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
hi, and thank you for taking my questions. my first question is just on some commentary in the press release around the company seeing an increased sales trend for wholesale markets. i was wondering if you could detail some of the developments that you're seeing on that side, particularly as it relates across the different pricing spectrums. where are you seeing kind of that resurgence of interest? and then also if i tag on how does sundial expect to approach this segment of the market going forward? what should we expect from a branded products versus wholesale mix in the balance of the year? thank you.
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
hey, sean, it's andrew here. my apologies. that first piece of the question cut out for me. would you mind just repeating that and i'll take it from there?
shaan mir -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
yeah, sure. so, the first part was just on some of the commentary that was in the press release regarding increased sales trends on the wholesale market. so, i'm just wondering if you could detail some of the developments that you're seeing in those wholesale markets, particularly as it relates to a different price -- product pricing spectrum.
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
got it. got it. ok. thanks.
yeah. it's actually really interesting. where seeing kind of a full 180 when it comes to demand on b2b kind of wholesale side of it. you know, as we stated, we're seeing a lot of our peers, you know, simply divest from cultivation.
and, you know, that's driving a lot of interest in producers that can do that at scale, and sundial is certainly well-positioned to take advantage of that. so, i would say that, you know, the early days of kind of, you know, when we went legal here in canada, you know, we had a huge demand there on wholesale b2b. and i think, you know, we saw that kind of taper off a little bit in '19 to '20 and we're seeing that come back full force. so, i think that's really positive for us given our small-batch-scale approach and our focus on cultivation.
and i would say when it comes to the pricing side of what we're seeing in the market, you know, it's the same thing we're seeing on the retail side, quite frankly. you know, everybody wants, you know, above 20% thc. and you're starting to see a pretty big, you know, floor there when it comes to the ability to monetize and get products above 20%. so, if we can get above 23% to 25%, you know, we're seeing very, very healthy margins on that side.
but again, you know, nobody's really doing that at scale and there's a lot of larger companies that are really wanting, you know, maintain the right product, you know, coming in. and they just can't get that consistency through, you know, the different markets in which we're able to procure that product from at the prices they need to get at, given that the supply is pretty short in that high-potency range. so, i think that just gives you another bit of color there. in regards to what does it mean for us, i think it's just -- it's, you know, it was the core focus of our business early days.
we made a pivot in 2020 to really about 80% branded 20% wholesale. you know, we're still focused on the branded side, but we're going to be advantageous as it makes sense for us in our business as we have more of these conversations. and we look at, you know, scaling appropriately with the right cultivars and the right partnerships on the wholesale side.
shaan mir -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
thank you for the color there. my second question is going to pivot to talking on the cultivation and production costs in the month. so, you noted that average production and cultivation costs per month came down to $4 million in the quarter versus $10 million last year. if i remember correctly from the q4 reporting, i believe that figure was down to $2 million per month on a monthly basis.
so, just trying to get an understanding for why the sequential increase on that front and how that played into your margins. and then also, if there's any sort of forward commentary maybe detailing relative to q1 where you think a sustained average cost level is. i'd appreciate that. thanks.
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
jim, do you maybe want to touch on that? because [technical difficulty]
jim keough -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure. i'm happy to. i think as zach mentioned, we had some elevated costs. and i think he only mentioned one aspect of that.
i think we saw some other non-recurring elevated costs in that we did a complete replacement of -- in many of the grow rooms of the lamps. and then we had some other processes that we accelerated testing and other aspects that we accelerated that were on a temporary basis. so, it's, you know, the total number that i think we look at in terms of non-recurring costs was about $700,000. and i think we had to be clear also when we speak about the cogs numbers that you're referring to and the cost of c&p as some c&p costs, of course, are sitting now in the inventory as we talked about in the previous question.
so, not all of those are flowing through to our income statement. but i think that we'll -- we expect that we'll get down to a more normalized level of, you know, something in the range of $3 million to $3.5 million a month on c&p costs.
shaan mir -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
all right. thank you for the color and that's it for my questions.

2021-Q2,SNDL,2021-08-13 10:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good' morning. and welcome to sundial growers' second-quarter 2021 financial results conference call. [operator instructions] yesterday afternoon, sundial issued a press release announcing their financial results for the second quarter ended june 30, 2021. this press release is available on the company's website at sndlgroup.com and filed on edgar and sedar as well.
presenting on this morning's call, we have zach george, chief executive officer; jim keough, chief financial officer; and andrew stordeur, president and chief operating officer. before we start, i'd like to remind investors that certain matters discussed in today's conference call or answers that may be given to questions could constitute forward-looking statements. actual results could differ materially from those anticipated. risk factors that could affect results are detailed in the company's financial reports and other public filings that are made available on sedar and edgar.
additionally, all financial figures mentioned are in canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated. i'd also like to note that we're conducting the call today from our respective remote locations. as such, there may be brief delays, crosstalk or minor technical issues during this call. we thank you in advance for your patience and understanding.
we will now make prepared remarks, and then, we will move on to the question-and-answer session. i'd now like to turn the call over to zach george.
zach george -- chief executive officer
good morning, everyone. and thank you for joining us on our second-quarter 2021 earnings call. the first half of 2021 has been a transitional period for sundial and following on our aggressive restructuring in 2020, we have been able to rapidly reshape our business model to focus on a two-pillar strategy that, we believe, will position our shareholders for future success. the first pillar consists of our core cannabis operations where we're leveraging our strong financial position to align our operation as to what we expect to be a healthier and more profitable canadian cannabis market in coming years.
with the post-quarter acquisition of inner spirit, which will refer to moving forward as spiritleaf in keeping with the recognition of the brand in the retail marketplace, sundial is now vertically integrated. the acquisition of spiritleaf enables sundial to directly manage and influence all aspects of production, distribution and sales channels which, we believe, will result in increased sales and profitability. most importantly, the spiritleaf acquisition demonstrates our commitment to owning the relationship with the consumer. as we remain focused and committed to our cultivation and processing activities, our upstream cultivation results within our indoor modular facility continue to improve amid the intentional curtailment of activity in response to market conditions.
i am excited to highlight that we continue to improve our cultivation results and have achieved our strongest harvest outcomes in may and june 2021 with thc potency consistently above 20%. we continue to invest time and effort into our expanded library of strains which have yielded average thc potency in the mid 20% range during the research and development phase and commercialization of these strain is expected to occur in early 2022. the second pillar of our business is our investment operations, where we're putting our liquidity position to work by strategically providing our investors with exposure to the rapidly growing global cannabis industry. much of our capital exposure to date has been committed to our joint venture, sunstream bancorp.
the sunstream bancorp team is focused on deploying capital within the cannabis sector on an attractive risk-adjusted basis and is exploring a broad-spectrum opportunity within financial services. sundial's investments in cannabis-related credit facilities and the sunstream joint venture totaled $253 million as of june 30, 2021. these investments generated interest and fee income of $7.1 million for the quarter, compared to $2.8 million in the previous quarter and are tracking an annualized rate of return of approximately 13%. our balance sheet remains strong, and we remain debt-free.
we have a total capital base, including liquid securities, loan assets and unrestricted cash of more than $1.2 billion. sundial expects to benefit from a growing interest income stream as more of our capital is deployed and the resulting cash flow has materially buffered our pre-profit core cannabis operations to date. we have also made a small number of select equity investments in businesses that we believe can enhance our upstream and downstream capabilities. our second-quarter performance continued to be impacted by retrenchment in our cultivation activities and our refusal to push suboptimal product into the market.
as we mentioned in the past quarter, sundial has no interest in pursuing unprofitable revenue growth, but we are unwilling to seek the maintenance of market share at all costs. we have been focused on restructuring our cultivation activities, which has included changes to our processes, as well as workforce and other cost reductions. this has allowed us to continuously improve our cultivation outcomes and remain focused on best practices to deliver great results in potency, yield and terpenes, as mentioned previously. we're committed to excellence in cultivation in our modular indoor facility and our brand promise to consumer is fundamental to our strategy.
we're focused not only on affecting change in the challenging and unstable canadian cannabis industry landscape today but are charting the characteristics of a dominant and profitable business model in a more healthy and stable environment that we expect to evolve to within the next three years following necessary regulatory reform, industry consolidation and a greater balance between supply and demand. we remain focused on continuous improvement in our quest to delight consumers. thank you, all. and i will now pass the call to jim for commentary on our financial results. 
jim keough -- chief financial officer
thank you, zach. and good morning to all who are listening in. i'd like to remind everyone that all amounts that i mention this morning are denominated in canadian dollars unless otherwise stated. as zach discussed, the first half of 2021 was a transitional period for sundial where we have raised and deployed significant amounts of strategic capital and realigned our business into two segments for operational and reporting purposes, cannabis operations and investment operations.
i will start with our cannabis operations results and adjusted ebitda. in the second quarter of 2021, adjusted ebitda from continuing operations was a loss of $0.2 million, compared to earnings of $3.3 million in the prior quarter. decrease in adjusted ebitda was primarily due to the following factors. lower realized gains on marketable securities, increased smg&a associated with the cost of 2.4 million shareholders of record for sundial's agm and lower average sales prices.
this was offset by improved cost of goods sold per gram. comparing first-half year-over-year results, we're pleased that adjusted ebitda from continuing operations was $3.1 year to date, compared to a loss of $15.5 for the six months ended june 30, 2020. the $18.7 million increase was due primarily to the following. revenue from investments, interest and fees, including the sunstream joint venture of $22.1 million offset by reduced adjusted gross margin on cannabis operations of $5.3 million from the combined effects of lower sales volume, lower prices and reduced cost of goods sold per gram.
net revenue from branded cannabis products increased slightly in the second quarter to $7.3 million from $7.2 million in the previous quarter, despite provincial boards reducing inventory levels, challenging retail market conditions and continued price compression across the industry. these market dynamics impacted all of sundial's formats and brands in the second quarter. revenue from licensed producer sales was $1.9 million in the second quarter, compared to $2.7 million in the first quarter. average gross selling price per gram equivalent of branded products, net of provisions, was $3.19 per gram in the second quarter of 2021, compared to $3.15 per gram in the prior quarter despite continued price compression and a consumer shift to value products seen across the industry.
general and administrative expenses were about 42% higher at $10.1 million, compared to $7.1 million in q1. this increase was primarily due to mailing and distribution costs related to conducting our agm for approximately 2.4 million individual sundial shareholders. in q2 2021, sales and marketing expenses increased by 37% to $1.3 million from $950,000 for the previous quarter. sundial continues to follow cost discipline, specifically when it comes to brand development and promotion expenses, however we have resumed targeted sales and marketing investments on certain of our strains and formats.
adjusted gross margin before inventory impairment and fair value adjustments for the three months ended june 30, 2021 was negative $0.4 million, compared to negative $1.6 million for the previous quarter, as a result of sundial's ongoing focus on cost optimization and offering the most competitive and profitable strains and brands to its customers, against a backdrop of industrywide price compression and higher comparative operating costs associated with our premium facility. total capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2021 were $1.6 million compared to an immaterial amount in the first quarter. we had budgeted $5.7 million in capital expenditures for full-year 2021 related to processing automation, minor facility improvements and maintenance capital. sundial's mills net loss in the second quarter of 2021 was $52.3 million, compared to a net loss of $134.4 million in the previous quarter.
net earnings in the second quarter of 2021 were negatively impacted by a $60 million long-lived asset impairment charge on the olds facility. the company determined that indicators of impairment existed during the six months ended june 30, 2021, when utilization of capacity in the facility was curtailed to align cannabis production with current demand estimates. excluding this non-cash impairment provision, sundial would have had net income of $7.7 million for the quarter. let's review our liquidity and capital structure during the quarter.
we closed the second quarter of 2021 with $885 million of unrestricted cash on hand. and as of august 9, 2021, the company had an unrestricted cash balance of approximately $760 million in addition to restricted cash, long-term investments and marketable securities at a market value of $447 million for a total of $1.2 billion when combined. outstanding share count was 2.03 billion at the end of q2 and sits at 2.06 billion today. during the second quarter of 2021, sundial issued 252.9 common shares pursuant to at-the-market equity or atm programs and warrant exercises for total proceeds of $327.4 million for an average price of $1.30 per share.
company's atm facility has been inactive for 49 prior to yesterday's news release. subsequent to quarter end, sundial issued an additional 26.9 million shares related to the spiritleaf acquisition and settlement of related spiritleaf debt. as of today, the company remains debt-free. asset value per share at june 30, 2021, including cash, loans, marketable securities and the olds facility at net book value was approximately $1.34 billion or $0.66 per share.
now let's turn our focus to our investment operations. as mentioned earlier, sundial's investment income has been classified as income from operations as sundial intends to continue to deploy significant capital, targeting a portfolio of attractive risk return opportunities in the cannabis industry in debt, equity and hybrid investments. sundial continued to strategically deploy its capital throughout the second quarter and subsequent to quarter end. to summarize our deployment capital in our investment segment to date.
through the end of the second quarter, the company had funded several cannabis related debt and equity investments totaling $354.5 million including $187.6 million to the sunstream joint venture. these investments generated $9.4 million in investment revenue in the second quarter, including interest, fees and realized and unrealized gains on marketable securities. on july 7, 2021, the company announced that it had increased its commitment to the sunstream joint venture to $538 million from the previously announced commitment. in the second quarter, the company's portfolio of credit-related investments generated an annualized rate of return of approximately 13%.
sundial continues to strategically deploy its capital with a focus on maximizing cash flows and shareholder value. for example, on may 4, 2021, sundial announced it had acquired 10.1% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the valens company. now i'd like to invite andrew stordeur, president and coo of sundial to provide remarks related to cannabis operations.
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, jim. throughout the first half of this year, our top priority within cannabis operation has been on improving our cultivation consistency with a focus on the premium inhalable segment. while progress has been substantial, we continue to see tremendous opportunity for increased improvements with our facility operations for the balance of 2021. let me review some of the progress we have made over the second quarter of 2021.
sundial's commitment to cultivation excellence and our small batch at scale approach has been developed around three pillars of focus. people, process and plants. in terms of people, we continue to configure our supply and operations teams to adapt to the industry dynamics. we recently implemented a new pod structure inside of our olds facility to increase efficiency and effectiveness across all functions.
one of the primary objectives of our supply chain moving forward will remain on driving a simplified sku assortment with a focus on core inhalable available offering. year to date, we have taken a different approach on product innovation versus our industry peers as we have simplified our skus nationally by 65%. we're excited about our revised innovation pipeline for the balance of the year and remain focused on margin accretive offerings that supplement our existing core portfolio. our second cultivation pillar is around process.
we have implemented several improvements inside of grow rooms, primarily focused on room environment, plant maintenance and fertigation. in q2, we achieved the company's strongest cultivation results in may and june of 2021 with an average thc potency greater than 20% and yields above target. these products will be available to consumers in q3 2021. we have completed commissioning on our new fully automated pre-roll machine which has allowed us to double our annual production capacity while significantly reducing costs.
current capacity sits at 14,000 units per shift with further opportunity to increase over time. through a comprehensive review of our sundial portfolio, we launched three new palmetto cultivars in the second quarter of 2021 and shipped approximately 9,300 cases across the country. the initial consumer feedback on all three strains has been positive. during q2 2021, sundial also launched two concentrate products in the province of quebec, a sativa hash and an indica hash.
our third cultivation pillar is around plants. now i am very proud of our team inside of our olds facilities as they have been working hard over the past year on fully revamping our genetic r^d capability. the early results from this work are promising, particularly around potency, terpenes profiles and plant yield. we entered the commercial flowering stage of 13 new cultivars in the second quarter of 2021, some of which are exclusive to sundial.
the preliminary outcomes from these new strains provided results averaging higher than 22% thc and greater than 2% on terpenes. these cultivars are expected to be harvested in q3 2021 and select for limited release by year-end. subsequent to the second quarter, sundial has begun final packaging and is expected to launch a 28 gram la kush cake format under the top leaf brand in select provinces. we believe a large format premium offering in flower will provide consumers the choice and quality as expected from our top leaf brand, which is hang-drive, slow-cured, individually inspected, hand-manicured and hand-bottled for a differentiated experience.
i'd like to turn our attention to sundial acquisition spiritleaf. spiritleaf has done a tremendous job in growing the banner network to over 100 locations. we believe an optimal assortment of top-selling products coupled with a consistent premium shopping experience will continue to differentiate the spiritleaf store network. our integration work continues to progress as we look to unlock further growth opportunities and strong partnerships with their franchisee leaders across the country.
we will also be launching the spiritleaf franchisee advisory council to engage our franchisees and to obtain feedback and collaboration on strategic initiatives to drive the continued growth and success of the spiritleaf banner. our balance sheet strength allows us to position ourselves for the normalization of market conditions that is expected to evolve over the next few years without pursuing the short-term market share and unsustainable margins at all cost approach. we remain focused and have momentum around our cultivation excellence aspirations. while we need to balance cost and return, we continue to invest in capability improvements inside our cannabis operations as a key enabler to unlocking value for consumers and customers across the country.
with that, i'd like to turn the call back to zach for closing remarks.
zach george -- chief executive officer
thank you, again, for joining us today. this is an exciting time to be in the cannabis space. we remain very optimistic as we continue to execute against our strategy. i hope that you and your families remain safe and healthy and have an opportunity to enjoy this summer season.
we look forward to updating you on further progress that sundial makes as the year progresses. i will now turn it back over to the operator for the question period.

[operator instructions] the first question comes from tamy chen with bmo capital markets. please go ahead.
tamy chen -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thanks. good morning. first question is, i wanted to go back to the increasing your commitment to sunstream as pretty meaningful increasing the capital commitment. so do you mind to just elaborate a bit more? what are you seeing, i guess, in the pipeline that prompted you to raise the commitment so meaningfully?
zach george -- chief executive officer
hi, tamy. thanks a lot for the question. so yes, this market has been evolving very quickly. and we actually see a target pipeline well north of $1 billion in front of us.
of course, certainty that we can execute and close on that quantum of transactions. but our increased commitment is very much in line with the expanded opportunities that we see in front of us.
tamy chen -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
and this pipeline of well north of $1 billion, i presume that wouldn't just be in canada anymore. is that correct? are you broadening out beyond canada for these opportunities?
zach george -- chief executive officer
that's right, tamy. that wouldn't just be in canada. there are international credit and other opportunities that we're seeing.
tamy chen -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
got it. ok. and just the follow-up is, any additional color you can provide on how we should think about the potential uplift in your branded sales trajectory into q3 and then q4 with these new cultivars that you are launching? thanks.
zach george -- chief executive officer
yeah, so i will hand that to andrew to give a little bit more color, but obviously, tamy, we don't give forward guidance at this point in time, given the general lack of visibility in the industry. but i will let andrew share a bit about our excitement around cultivars and select innovation.
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
thanks, zach. and thanks, tamy, for the question. so yes, we are very excited, very optimistic around what we have got in the market currently. i think, the three that we're seeing very good traction on in some of the highest velocity sales that we put in the market particularly around la kush cake, which is on our top leap brands, romulan and platinum cookies under our palmetto brands that we're continuing to see that move in all markets that we have those products launched.
i did also mention that we're in the commercial flowering stage of 13 new genetics that we have been working hard on over the past year, and we are gonna be harvesting those in quarter 3. and depending on those results, we will look to potentially put some small batch in to select provinces this year. but as we noted in the opening remarks, we will scale most of those that we decide to bring to market in the early part of 2022, i am very excited and optimistic about that. so exciting kind of news coming on, on that front for cultivations, for sure.
tamy chen -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok, great. thank you.
operator
the next question comes from vivien azer with cowen. please go ahead.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi, good morning. thank you. in terms of the new cultivars that you have hitting the marketplace in 3q 2021, can you just talk about the wholesale commitments that you have already received around that product? is it accounted for? or do you feel assured that you are going to have shelf space to sell that?
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
hi vivien, it's andrew. thanks for the question. just so i am clear regarding the current ones we have in the market or the ones that we referenced as far as the 13 new genetics?
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
the new genetics. thanks.
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
ok, perfect. yeah, so actually, we have been communicating with our customers around just kind of our r&d plan. and part of our r&d plan going back a year ago was really around what our consumer is looking for and that was input from our research, as well as kind of the feedback from our customers. what i can say is, once we harvest these, obviously, got to go through the process and look at the results and make sure they meet the spec that we're requiring to launch.
but this currently is not in our plan here to go as far as our revenue and mix goes. so we look at that as potential upside, and we certainly have great feedback and customer commitments from the boards that we have presented into the retailers we have presented on these. so yes, it is something that we would have incremental to the plan year to go and we're just going to have to wait for those results as they come down this quarter.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
understood. and a similar question on the pre-roll. given that you have the new manufacturing equipment in place, do you feel confident that there is appetite in the marketplace for more pre-roll capacity?
zach george -- chief executive officer
yeah, look, i think, it's a great question. i'd view our commissioning of the new equipment and the automation that we brought into the facility over the last six months has been substantial. it starts with a pretty simple view from our end that better sales requires better cannabis. and that's inclusive of all the formats we put in there.
so we look at things like potency and quality improvements and good yields per square foot and sell product and cogs are kind of key success factors. but certainly to answer your question, pre-roll continues to be a segment that's continuing to grow. we're growing with that segment, and we have, obviously, got some new cultivars that we are putting in the market and the corresponding consumer customer feedback was really good on that. so we're well-positioned, vivien, on meeting the demand as our pre-roll and as the segment continues to grow.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
understood. thank you very much.
operator
the next question comes from frederico gomes with atb capital markets. please go ahead.
frederico gomes -- atb capital markets -- analyst
thank you, and good morning, guys. just wanted to touch showing the retail market. we're seeing many stores opening in canada. there's a lot of pressure coming especially from the value segment in retail.
so could you give us some color on your strategy there? how do you think that may impact your sales and margins and the spiritleaf network? and how you plan to compete there? thanks.
zach george -- chief executive officer
yeah, maybe i will talk to that first. thanks very much of the question. look, there's no question that the retail landscape is highly competitive, and we actually expect a significant amount of attrition in the space. so not all operators are gonna be successful here.
i think, on one of our previous calls, we talked about hitting a saturation point in retail. and so we think about the premium in-store experience and connection point with the consumer, which is really exciting to us, in the phenomenal platform that spiritleaf has built out along with financial stability as being key ingredient to success. and when you combine that with best-in-class technology capabilities, we think we will be in a great position to not just weather the storm would also be successful. we expect significant consolidation and actually quite a bit of bloodshed in the retail segment in canada.
and so we are excited to be competing.
frederico gomes -- atb capital markets -- analyst
ok, no, that's helpful. and then, just maybe if you could talk about in terms of the mix of owned stores versus franchises? how do you see that needs evolving? what is your strategy there for your expansion? and also, if you could maybe describe what's the value proposition there for franchisees that you guys have? what are the main advantages that spiritleaf offers for retailer to continue be becoming your franchisee? thank you.
zach george -- chief executive officer
sure. i will pass part of that question to andrew. we're not going to specifically guide to a mix or split between corporate and franchise locations. it's worth noting that we're also open-minded when it comes to managing multi-banner retail.
but in terms of the value proposition and the brand attributes, andrew, do you want to shed a little light with your perspective?
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, i think, we view this as, obviously, a great opportunity to ensure that the sundial portfolio is well-positioned inside the spiritleaf network. but we are also, we're gonna be really partnering well with our franchisees. and i think, i mentioned that in my comments with the regards to the franchisee advisory council. these operators, they have been doing this for a while now.
they understand what works. and we're gonna be leveraging some of the research and the data and certainly the actionable insights that we have to make sure that we have got the right portfolio. and that doesn't mean 500, 600 skus, the predator rule does not discriminate in cannabis. so i think, that's the value proposition we're going to bring.
it's certainly listen first, understand what's working, what's not working. the answers are there at the franchisee partners. and i think, we can add a ton of value as we have a different hat that we can wear and certainly looking at some of the brands that are out there, i want to make sure we have the right assortment in place. and of course, we are going to make sure that we can augment that accordingly with the sundial portfolio because we do think we have got a great assortment as well to supplement what consumers are looking for.
frederico gomes -- atb capital markets -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you. i will hop back in the queue.
operator
the next question comes from shaan mir with canaccord. please go ahead.
shaan mir -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
hi, good morning, and thank you for taking my question. the first one, i just wanted to touch on the revenue line here, specifically as it relates to excise taxes and the spread between gross and net revenue in the quarter. i was hoping you could help us understand some of the underlying components and the moving parts that went into that calculation, especially as we look at how the excise tax really resulted in a sequential decline on the net revenue while the gross revenue was up 8%.
jim keough -- chief financial officer
yeah, shaan, this is jim. let me just take that one and it really just relates around the mix between branded sales and lp sales. and lp sales clearly don't have the excise tax attached to them. and so it's just a function of that shift and it increased quarter over quarter to more branded product in q2 over q1.
shaan mir -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
ok, thank you. and my second question. so on vapes, that's been our core part of the inhalable strategy for sundial and so i wanted to touch on that a bit. this is now the second quarter where vapes are showing some weakness in the product mix.
and you previously noticed that was a result of some increased competition in this segment. i was just wondering what you views were on your ability to attack and drive sales in that segment and how sundial plans to recapture some of that momentum, whether it be through product innovation or increased marketing, whatever it may be? so what's the attack strategy and what do you think are the catalyst needed see those vapes sales start progressing once again? thank you. that's it for my questions.
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
it's andrew. thank you for the question. i think, it's a good one in regards to kind of what we're seeing in the segment. and obviously, our sales strategy for us to focus is on premium inhalables.
vape has been a big part of that strategy from day one. we were one of the first to launch. and obviously, you mentioned increased competition that's come into the segment has been aggressive. maybe just i will double click on that a little bit.
when you think about looking at the mix component side of vape, we have broad spectrum as kind of the anchor that we decided to go to the market with. the lion share of what we're seeing in the vape segment is really distillates, flavor distillate to be specific. and we are monitoring that accordingly. obviously, health canada has got consultation out with regards to how that's gonna be viewed moving forward.
so we're very aware that the potential regulations could change over time. and that's going to impact distillate, flavor discipline to be specifically as far as the relevancy goes on that front. however, all that to say, i think a couple of things that we're focused on with regards to continuing to build awareness on our great portfolio of vape offerings. and we're certainly looking at larger formats, particularly in one gram.
we think that's going to continue as far as consumer preference goes on that sizing. and we are also gonna be launching on the back half of this year under the top leaf brands some innovation with regards to live-resin. we think that's also another great differentiator. we have mentioned that in a previous call and we're excited to do that.
i think, that's going to create the right awareness that top leaf is here to stay when it comes to premium inhalables, and we will continue to focus on that side of it as well too. so fully holistic approach on it. maybe certainly been pressured, certainly by competition, but we have got some opportunities in the future here to go that are going to really add some relevance there for us.
shaan mir -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
thank you, andrew. and that's it for my questions. congrats on the quarter once again.
operator
[operator instructions] the next question comes from pablo zuanic with cantor fitzgerald. please go ahead.
pablo zuanic -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
good morning. look, when i look at your company, i appreciate all the efforts you are making on the cannabis side. but you still have only about, by my math, about less than 2% market share on branded rec, right. and of course, you have those $1.2 billion there on the balance sheet that you talked about.
so it's more how you deploy that capital going forward that creates value and necessarily going from 2% to 2.2% market share in rec. so if i am right about what i am saying and i have to say a comment here, you have been very disciplined about how you are using that cash, right. you didn't go and spend $350 million on a cbd brand like some of your peers. but i guess, the first question would be, how do you decide when you are making minority equity investments, whether it's done through sundial or through sunstream? because i mean, i suppose that, i mean, sunstream is not just lending, right.
it's also equity and hybrids. can you comment on that for us, please? thanks.
zach george -- chief executive officer
hi, pablo, it's zach. thanks for the question. i am happy to clarify. so the vast majority of the focus for sunstream right now is really driven by the robust opportunities that we see, is really focused around credit, structured credit and some hybrid instrument opportunities.
so when you are thinking about minority investments specifically, i'd say that it's a very small part of what we're focused on. and you are never going to see more than a small handful of names where we have minority equity positions. generally speaking, we don't see that as an area where the best risk adjusted returns would be. we're very focused internally, and we believe that the credit opportunity in cannabis is quite large and very attractive.
so when it comes to minority equity investments, those would typically be done off the sundial balance sheet and not through our joint venture relationship and sunstream bancorp. hope that helps.
pablo zuanic -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
that's helpful. but just to follow up on that. when you talk about structural credit and hybrids, i suppose that that may include warrants or compares that eventually could be converted into equity, right. am i right about that?
zach george -- chief executive officer
you are potentially correct, but that doesn't necessarily mean that we would end up owning the underlying equity. they are structured means earning that return, receiving cash. there's a lot of different ways that those economics can accrue to a lender or an investor.
pablo zuanic -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok, thank you. and the very last one. again, you have been very disciplined, in my opinion, but the industry is consolidating. some of your peers are making a lot of acquisitions.
so you are going to wait too long, i'd say, right. so is it about growing more in canada? is it about investments overseas, latin in america, europe? can you just remind us about that on the equity side? because i appreciate, again, yes, canada has potential but $1.2 billion, is it going to go all into canada equity investments? thanks.
zach george -- chief executive officer
it's a great question, pablo. yes. so just for perspective, in terms of that total capital balance, do we expect it to be entirely or the vast majority be deployed in canada? no, not necessarily. but we are highly focused on the canadian market and working on better understanding the evolution of the sector.
you will notice that many of our peers will direct investor attention away from canada focused on europe, focused on the u. s., bigger markets. we're going to take advantage of opportunities and that will largely be expressed through capital that's deployed through sunstream bancorp when it comes to international markets. but we're laser focused on understanding where we are going in terms of consolidation, attrition and business failure and also common sense regulatory reform, which we're starting to see and it's a key part of the equation as well.
pablo zuanic -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
great. thank you.

2021-Q3,SNDL,2021-11-12 10:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good morning, and welcome to sundial growers third quarter 2021 financial results conference call. yesterday, sundial issued a press release announcing their financial results for q3 ended on september 30, 2021. this press release is available on the company's website at sndlgroup.com and filed on edgar and sedar as well. the webcast replay of the conference call will also be available on the sndlgroup.com website.
presenting on this morning's call, we have zach george, chief executive officer; jim keough, chief financial officer; and andrew stordeur, president and chief operating officer. before we start, i would like to remind investors that certain matters discussed in today's conference call or answers that may be given to questions could constitute forward-looking statements. actual results could differ materially from those anticipated. risk factors that could affect results are detailed in the company's financial reports and other public filings that are made available on sedar and edgar.
additionally, all financial figures mentioned are in canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated. we will now make prepared remarks, and then we'll move on to a question-and-answer session. i would now like to turn the call over to zach george.
zach george -- chief executive officer
good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2021 earnings call. we are excited to update investors on our progress, and we'll answer many of the questions we have received, which are anchored around a few common recurring themes. we are pleased to announce sundial's first-ever quarter with positive results for both adjusted ebitda and net earnings. these results reflect the initial impact of the business transformation led by sundial's team over the last 10 months as we focused on the continued improvement of our cultivation practices and the accretive addition of the spiritleaf retail network.
despite the sustained challenges facing canadian industry participants, our financial position has never been stronger. as mentioned on our last earnings call, sundial has structured its operations into two segments: cannabis and investments. the acquisition of inner spirit holdings, which we refer to as spiritleaf, has expanded the company's cannabis operations to include a retail component. the october announcement of a definitive agreement to acquire alcanna is another important step in the development of our integrated business model.
we believe that we have hit a point of maximum retrenchment in our cultivation and production activities during the third quarter. our relentless focus on improvement in our cultivation activities, including the refinement of our processes as well as numerous cost reduction initiatives has resulted in exciting improvements in product quality, potency, cost structure, and gross margin. since the beginning of the year, we have seen our results in potency yield and terpenes improved month after month, hitting all-time best results for cultivation in the third quarter. we still have significant work to do, but acknowledging the material progress our teams have made is important.
sundial was the first canadian licensed producer to launch caviar cones, a high-potency, premium-infused pre-rolled product under our award-winning top leaf brand. we are seeing increases in our average selling prices and have improved our market share in the premium flower segment in important markets like alberta and ontario. we remain focused on sustainable profitability and continued improvement in all aspects of our operations. and we believe the premium segment will drive that profitability as the market matures.
in terms of our retail operations, the spiritleaf acquisition demonstrates our commitment to owning the relationship with the consumer. spiritleaf has proven its ability to grow its brand from coast to coast. and we plan to support this growth trajectory while also enhancing operational efficiencies and supporting our franchise partners. as we further develop and optimize our store network in canada, we launched a multi-store pilot program to improve the consumer experience through assortment, price, and engagement to meet the diverse needs of canadian cannabis consumers.
we also kicked off our spiritleaf franchisee advisory council to further engage and support spiritleaf franchisee partners while also obtaining feedback and collaboration on strategic initiatives, which will drive the continued growth and success of the spiritleaf banner. we are encouraged by our investment operations results as we continue to use our financial strength and liquidity position to invest strategically, providing our investors with broadened exposure to the rapidly growing global cannabis industry. since the beginning of 2021, sundial's investments in cannabis-related credit facilities and the sunstream joint venture have totaled 489 million. these investments generated realized interest and fee income of $19.2 million for the quarter and is tracking an annualized rate of return of close to 13%.
our balance sheet remains strong, and we remain debt-free. sundial is uniquely positioned relative to its peers as we seek to delight consumers and become a trusted industry partner. through our two-pillar strategy, we are looking to build a consistently profitable and scalable business delivering free cash flow within the 2022 calendar year. as mentioned earlier, i will also be answering investor questions.
and we'll do so after jim and andrew's comments. thank you all. and i'll now turn the call to jim for commentary on our financial results. 
jim keough -- chief financial officer
thanks, zach, and good morning, everyone. i would like to remind you that all amounts that i discuss today are denominated in canadian dollars unless otherwise stated. certain amounts that i will refer to on this call are non-ifrs gaap measures. please refer to sundial's management discussion and analysis for the definitions of these measures.
as we mentioned in our last conference call, sundial determined that beginning in q1 2021, we had two operating segments being cannabis and investments. the acquisition of inner spirit holdings limited has expanded sundial's operations to include a third retail segment. for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2020, there was only one reportable segment, and therefore, no comparative segment information. i will start with our consolidated results and adjusted ebitda.
we are pleased that for the third quarter of 2021, adjusted ebitda from continuing operations was $10.5 million, compared to a loss of $4.4 million for the third quarter of 2020. the increase in adjusted ebitda was due primarily to the following factors: sundial's investment operations yielded an adjusted ebitda contribution of $19.2 million, and we have included the results of spiritleaf from the date of acquisition on july 20, 2021. net earnings for the three months ended september 30, 2021, was $11.3 million, compared to a net loss of $71.4 million in the previous year. general and administrative expenses were about 33% higher at $9.6 million, compared to 7.2 million in the previous year.
the increase was mainly due to the inclusion of spiritleaf results subsequent to acquisition. in q3 2021, sales and marketing expenses, including spiritleaf subsequent to the date of acquisition, increased slightly compared to the previous year from $1.1 million to $1.3 million. sundial continues to focus on cost discipline, specifically when it comes to brand development and promotional expenses targeting sales and marketing investments on priority strains and formats in select markets. now let's turn to cannabis cultivation and production.
gross margin before fair value adjustments from cannabis cultivation and production operations for the three months ended september 30, 2021, was negative $4.9 million, compared to negative $17.3 million for the three months ended september 30, 2020. the increase of $12.4 million was a result of our ongoing focus on cost optimization, reduction of harvest inventory subject to potential impairment, and offering the most competitive and profitable strains and brands to our customers. net revenue from cultivation and production operations in the third quarter of 2021 was 8.2 million, compared to 12.9 million in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting consumer demand shifting to value segments, continuing industrywide price compression and the company's focus on margin-accretive branded sales over unprofitable share acquisition and wholesale revenue. as for our retail operations results, sundial's retail gross revenue from the spiritleaf network for the period from july 20, 2021, to september 30 was $6.1 million.
retail revenue was comprised of 3.9 million of revenue on sales to consumers from corporate-owned stores and 2.2 million of royalty revenue and franchise fees from franchise partner stores. systemwide retail sales were 33.5 million from july 20 to september 30, 2021, and 41.7 million for the full third quarter, setting new records for the spiritleaf retail network. gross margin for retail operations subsequent to acquisition was $3.7 million. now let's turn our focus to investment operations.
as mentioned earlier, sundial's investment income is reported as income from operations, as sundial intends to continue to invest a significant share of our available capital targeting a portfolio of attractive risk return opportunities in the cannabis industry in debt, equity, and hybrid instruments. to summarize the deployment of capital in our investment segment to date, during the nine months ended september 30, 2021, the company invested $489 million, including $323 million through the sunstream bancorp, inc. joint venture. in the third quarter, $181 million was directed to these investments, including $135 million through sunstream.
investment operations generated $19.2 million in investment income in the third quarter, including interest, fees, and realized gains on marketable securities, but excluding unrealized gains and losses. including unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities, revenue from investment operations in the third quarter of 2021 was negative 4.8 million due primarily to fluctuations in marketable securities closing prices, which are mark-to-market. in the third quarter, sundial's portfolio of credit-related investments generated an annualized rate of return of 13%. on november 9, 2021, we had an unrestricted cash balance of $571 million and remain debt-free.
now i would like to invite andrew stordeur, president and coo of sundial, to provide further remarks related to cannabis operations.
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, jim. we continue to make progress on our old facility transformation, focusing on cultivation consistency and operational improvements. as canadian consumer preferences continue to evolve, we remain steadfast in our view by growing high-quality cannabis consistently with appropriate cogs is a sustainable advantage. i am proud of our team's progress on material average potency increases with corresponding quality improvements, good crop yield and a higher percentage of sellable product over the past year.
we are reducing operational costs and have several initiatives implemented to support our efforts on accelerating sustainable profitability with our cannabis operations. continuous improvement of all aspects of cultivation and processing production, together with a strong, focused innovation pipeline, will enable our national own sales force and retail footprint to better meet customer and consumer needs. we are encouraged by the results achieved in the third quarter with further opportunities being realized as we doubled down our improvements across all facets of our business. let me walk you through the highlights of cannabis operations for the third quarter 2021.
our average weighted potency achieved in flower lots fully tested in olds set a record in q3 at 21.7%. this represents the highest potency average since sundial's inception and an increase of over 200 basis points versus the third quarter last year. our cultivation team has increased our percentage of harvest with greater than 24% thc potency in three consecutive quarters now, and over 40% of total harvest tested in q3 came in greater than 22% on potency. sundial's ongoing investments in innovation and cultivation practices generated continued crop yield stability in the third quarter, with results at 51 grams per square foot versus 49 grams per square foot in q3 2020.
we also launched our caviar cones under the top leaf brand. this launch, the first of its kind in canada, reinforce sundial's focused innovation pipeline around premium inhalables in the canadian cannabis market. in the first four weeks after launch, the top leaf forbidden lemon caviar cone was a top-selling sku in all spiritleaf stores in alberta, saskatchewan, and manitoba. sundial's premium portfolio remains well positioned to focus on the higher-margin inhalable segment.
in q3 2021, sundial's top leaf brand increased its market share within the premium flower segment in several key markets, including alberta, where market share increased by 1.7% in the quarter. we successfully completed a significant r&d initiative inside our olds facility by harvesting 12 new genetics in the third quarter, many of which are exclusive to sundial. several genetics have achieved the thc and quality specs required for our brand portfolio. and we remain on track to release in select provinces by year-end with full commercialization commencing in the first half of 2022.
i'm excited to announce that we will be onboarding a new head of supply chain this month. this new leadership role will be tasked with the continued optimization of our seed-to-sale supply chain transformation. ensuring sundial-branded products are readily available and at the appropriate inventory levels across the country will be a key part of this critical leadership role. further to our supply chain transformation initiatives, the recent announcements by the aglc to allow e-commerce in our home province for retailers in the first half of 2022 is encouraging.
given our significant retail footprint in the province, sundial has begun work to build a strong capability and a differentiated consumer experience through this important and growing b2c channel. and finally, i'd like to provide a brief update on the progress our team has made on our retail integration efforts subsequent to the close of spiritleaf's acquisition. we have recently completed several pilots within our spiritleaf store network, which further improved our understanding of and experimentation with products and services that best work at the retail level to benefit consumers, customers, and other retailers. we're excited to begin sharing and implementing these category growth drivers with our partner stores across the country as we look to optimize all aspects of retail operations.
we have made substantial progress with the availability of our sundial portfolio brands at store level. market share for our proprietary brands at spiritleaf stores across the country continue to build momentum. as at the end of september, our sundial-branded share has grown in both corporate and franchise partner locations with corporate stores leading the growth at 13.63% market share for sundial products versus 5.8% at the end of june 2021. with that, i'd like to turn the call back to zach for closing remarks.
zach george -- chief executive officer
thanks again for joining us today. this is an exciting time for sundial, and we are looking forward to the year ahead of us. we remain focused on our plan as we continue to make progress in a rapidly evolving cannabis environment. as transparency is a core value at sundial, we thought it was important to invite investors to directly send their questions for us to answer on this call.
we received close to 100 different emails from investors. we have read each and every one, and we thank our investors for their support and engagement. we are inspired by the level of diligence, strategic thinking and creativity expressed by many of our investors. 85% of the questions we received centered around four main themes.
so we decided to address these topics head-on. once we are done answering the questions, we will turn the call over to the operator for analysts to provide their questions. i first want to address nasdaq compliance and the possibility of a reverse share split or share consolidation. we are acutely aware that some of our investors are spending an enormous amount of time and energy obsessing over our nasdaq compliance and the potential for a reverse split.
we are compelled to address this head-on to stop the spread of misinformation and halt the use of flawed logic. first, sundial's management and board are unanimously committed to retaining our nasdaq listing. and we'll proactively take all necessary steps to remain compliant with nasdaq rules, period. also, the nasdaq has discretion to provide an additional extension beyond the february 7 deadline.
therefore, it is not a foregone conclusion that sundial will need to reverse split its shares prior to february 7, even if our shares continue to trade below $1. given the nature of the questions we have received, i think it's important to level set and make sure we all understand exactly what a reverse split is. i'm going to do this once, and i plan to never address it again. a simple example of a reverse split would be to think of it in terms of another currency besides shares.
in the context of u.s. dollars, a reverse split is comparable to you giving me four quarters and me giving you back a $1 bill. the result is that you will still have a $1 of value to spend. this is the same outcome when a company reverse splits its shares.
the implied market cap or total equity value of the company does not change, but the share count declines and the implied book or other value per share increases in the same proportion. second, flawed logic is being used to spread fear among our investors. this flawed logic is related to the causal relationship between all manner of share split and the price action of securities following such an event. the logic goes something like this.
when a reverse split occurs, the share is almost always then trade down following the split. this somehow suggests that the reverse split is the cause of the share price decline, which is a false premise. the reality is that many companies whose shares fall to a level that require a reverse split have deteriorating fundamentals and financial performance. if this trend continues, it makes perfect sense that the share prices and equity values would continue to also decline.
but please note that in those cases, it is usually the fundamentals of the business that drive the poor performance of shares, not the reverse split event itself. i can make a strong case for sundial's improved performance, but i would prefer to point to our unique attributes and track record and let investors make up their own mind. a small percentage of firms who default on their debt and get managed by the special loans groups within the banks ever make it out of live, but sundial did exactly that in 2020. over the last 10 months, sundial's business model has been materially repositioned, and we have one of the best balance sheets in the industry.
we have built a growing cash flow stream that has helped us to deliver record adjusted ebitda in q3 and have more than $0.5 billion in unrestricted cash to deploy in a disciplined manner. in fact, the third quarter ebitda reported yesterday is greater than what the analysts, according to bloomberg, have projected us generating in the entire 2022 calendar year. i want to say that one more time. the third quarter ebitda reported yesterday is greater than what the analysts, according to bloomberg, have projected us to generate in the entire 2022 calendar year.
if sundial can continue to deliver improvement in its results and create equity value in a demonstrable way, we believe that the long-term share price performance will take care of itself. i urge our investors to focus on the business and industry fundamentals in making investment decisions. by all means, stay focused and stay concerned, but let's please stop obsessing over a reverse split for the wrong reasons. the second theme i want to discuss is that of a repurchase of shares.
this is a theme that came through in many investor questions, and there was a strong suggestion that sundial repurchased a portion of its shares. given the recent downturn in our share price and the fact that we last raised capital approximately five months ago in june at above $1 a share, our board of directors is supportive of earmarking ca$100 million to repurchase shares at levels that will be accretive to net asset value per share, given the company's view of the trading price of sundial's shares may not fully reflect the value of our assets going forward. this may be done through the use of derivatives and the cash purchase of shares. investors should temper any expectations that we will recklessly chase shares higher to benefit short-term investors as this will not happen.
as fiduciaries, we are tasked with managing sundial for the benefit of all shareholders, not just those focused on short-term trading strategies. the third theme that was addressed by investors focused on entry into the u.s. i want to be very clear on this point. we have no interest in making large-scale cbd or other u.s.
acquisitions for the sake of a press release. as a canadian company listed on nasdaq, we are prohibited from engaging in any plant touching activity south of the border. yes, the u.s. represents a large, important addressable market.
it also represents a fragmented and competitive market that is seeing the emergence of cyclical downturns in select regions driven by oversupply and price compression. our sunstream joint venture with saf has deployed more than $300 million into u.s. credit opportunities and expects to be active into the end of the year. our limited partnership commitment to the sunstream joint venture provides sundial with attractive exposure to u.s.
markets and cash returns without the use of options on equity, which can materially delay the enjoyment of synergies and profits. the last topic to cover is dilution. as we have explained, in 2020, we brought sundial back from the brink of death. more than a few pundits have spent time drafting our obituary prematurely.
the out-of-court restructuring and subsequent raise of more than $1 billion drove material dilution represented a hard reset for the business. we have sufficient capital to weather the storm in the canadian cannabis industry for years, but our goals go well beyond survival. we are focused on the accretive deployment of cash in a disciplined manner and have not raised any cash via our atm or other equity issuance in almost five months and have no imminent need to do so. we view the issuance of shares for the alcanna transaction as both accretive and strategic and look forward to sharing the results of our capital deployments in 2022.
again, we want to thank everyone for sending in their questions. we view our investor base as a critical driver for our future success. without your support, we would not have the luxury of contemplating the rich opportunity set that lies in front of us. i will now turn the call back over to the operator for analyst questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions]. the first question is from pablo zuanic from cantor fitzgerald. please go ahead.
pablo zuanic -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
i want to ask two questions first. one on the retail side, if you can talk about how you're going to integrate the two very different chains, right? i understand one is a spiritleaf franchisee model. the other one is more of a discount model, or are they going to remain separate? but just talk about that, particularly in light of other retailers. so they're talking about price compression and competition and moving more into a discount model.
so if you can touch on that. and then two, in terms of capital deployment. yes, you've deployed more than 300 million at sunstream bancorp. but just remind us, as you look forward, you have sunstream bancorp, more money going there, more money going to the canadian operations or more money going to share buybacks.
so how do you handicap that? thank you.
zach george -- chief executive officer
thanks, pablo. it's zach. on the first question, we're going to have to delay a response. so as you know, we've announced a definitive agreement to acquire alcanna.
we expect the circular to be filed and available for review shortly. and we're not going to talk about integration on a transaction we have not closed yet. so we're excited to share more of the strategic path with you come the new year. in terms of pace of deployment, it's quite possible that we could end up deploying another 1 to $200 million, u.s.
that is, into select secured and structured credit opportunities into the end of the year.
pablo zuanic -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
all right. thank you.
operator
the next question is from shaan mir from canaccord genuity. please go ahead.
shaan mir -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
good morning, and congrats on the quarter. my first question is touching on pablo's first question, but focusing more on the spiritleaf chain. so we saw really strong margins from spiritleaf in the quarter at around 60%. but given the prominence of value buds and a lot of the retail offerings going toward discount models, just wanted to see if you've seen any headwinds to the spiritleaf margins in recent weeks? or if there's any thoughts around adjusting pricing at all, given the premium focus there?
zach george -- chief executive officer
sure. thanks for the question. appreciate it. there's no question that the entire cannabis retail space in canada is under significant pressure.
we've been talking publicly about peak retail in canada for almost six months now. so we think we're very well positioned with staying power and capital to weather what we think will be a pretty violent storm and a reckoning that's going to occur in 2022. and so we're certainly not immune from pricing pressures and from consumers who are highly sensitive to price. we are continuing to maintain price above some of the deep discounted rates that you're seeing in the space.
and we're working on merchandising and pricing strategies to address that in-store with spiritleaf going forward.
shaan mir -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
thank you. and then just staying on the spiritleaf transaction with that now closed. i just wanted to touch on the integration efforts a bit and maybe some takeaways you're seeing thus far. in the press release, i think you noted that the caviar cones are the top-selling pre-rolls in the spiritleaf chain today.
but maybe you could help detail some of the broader integration activities that the company has implemented or is in the process of implementing, particularly as it relates to increasing the sell-through of the branded sundial products through the spiritleaf chain. and i'll leave it there.
zach george -- chief executive officer
sure. so great question. obviously, we don't have the full quarter of performance, given the july close of the transaction. but we have in the months following our close seeing greater pull-through of sundial product.
and we've had some great success with recent sku launches. and we're starting to finally hit our stride in cultivation to live up to the brand promises we've laid out with consumers. so certainly a work in progress and believe that we'll be at a more steady state in terms of that pull-through and integration in the first half of 2022.
shaan mir -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
perfect. thank you for taking my questions. i'll pass it on.
operator
[operator instructions]. the next question is from frederico gomes from atb capital markets. please go ahead.
frederico gomes -- atb capital markets -- analyst
good morning, guys. thanks for taking my questions. congrats on the quarter. i just want to touch on your credit investment portfolio.
you guys set a 13% return there, pretty good. but can you comment on how you see the credit market evolving in cannabis? there's some talk about cost of capital gradually declining in this space and also the potential listing of u.s. msos and easier access to capital. so how should we think about the impact that could have in your opportunity set there and your ability to generate alpha? thanks.
zach george -- chief executive officer
yes, thanks. it's a great question, one we spend a lot of time thinking about. i would say that we do believe that over time, as the industry matures, you are going to see the cost of equity and debt come down across the space. you have some significant issues in canada right now.
and the cost of debt and equity is extremely high. in the u.s., you have a real lack of institutional and banking support, which is really the driver for the elevated cost of capital across the space. you're starting to see a bit of a cottage industry emerge of different groups using various structures to supply the industry with capital. and we have seen in certain markets, like florida and california, quite a bit of volatility and the emergence of cycles where you are seeing price competition and oversupply really start to bite in terms of company -- individual company results.
so look, we believe that this window of opportunity is going to remain open over the intermediate term, perhaps several years, and we will continue to evolve the model to adapt to any roll down in rates going forward. so we continue to take advantage of that. but don't really see anything in the near term that will derail the type of transaction and profile returns we're seeing in the pipeline today.
frederico gomes -- atb capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then on your share buyback program, i know that you mentioned that net per share would be one metric to look further to drive your decision to exercise that. but just thinking about the value of the business itself outside of nav and maybe just on the free cash flow that you expect to generate in the business, any metric that we can look for that will indicate a good opportunity for you guys to start buying back shares? thanks.
zach george -- chief executive officer
yes. another great question. and respect the ask, we're not going to give guidance in terms of the parameters that have been approved by our board for the repurchase of shares. we spent a lot of time focused on net asset value, focused on the potential future cash flow generation that our aggregate business is capable of.
and we're really excited for a time when investors and analysts start to move away from this robotic and revenue-based analysis, which we think is completely inappropriate when assessing companies in the space.
frederico gomes -- atb capital markets -- analyst
thanks. i'll hop back in the queue. thanks.
operator
this concludes the question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to zach for any closing remarks.
zach george -- chief executive officer

operator
good morning, and welcome to sundial growers first quarter 2020 financial results conference call. yesterday, sundial issued a press release announcing their financial results for the first quarter ended on march 31, 2022. this press release is available on the company's website at sndlgroup.com and filed on edgar and sedar as well. the webcast replay of the conference call will also be available on the sndlgroup.com website.
sundial has also posted a supplemental investor presentation found on the sndlgroup.com website. presenting on this morning's call, we have zach george, chief executive officer; jim keough, chief financial officer; and andrew stordeur, president and chief operating officer. before we start, i would like to remind investors that certain matters discussed in today's conference call or answers that may be given to questions could constitute forward-looking statements. actual results could differ materially from those anticipated.
risk factors that could affect results are detailed in the company's financial reports and other public filings that are made available on sedar and edgar. additionally, all financial figures mentioned are in canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated. we will now make prepared remarks, and then we'll move on to analyst questions. i would now like to turn the call over to zach george.
zach george -- chief executive officer
good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2022 earnings call. the first quarter of 2022 as both transformational and transitional for sundial. through our acquisition of alcanna, sundial is now canada's largest private sector distributor of both liquor and cannabis with an industry-leading balance sheet and access to capital. in terms of results, our net revenue was $17.6 million, including one day of revenue from the acquisition of alcanna on march 31, which represents an increase of over 78% over the first quarter of 2021.
had the acquisition of alcanna occurred on january 1, 2022, and revenue would have increased by approximately $162 million, a single day of contribution from alcanna and nova in q1 amounted to approximately $2 million in revenue. one of the most powerful highlights of this quarter is the material improvement in gross margins in our cannabis operations. while we have a significant amount of work yet to do, we have reduced costs and created a more balanced and diverse product mix that focuses on higher-margin, higher-quality cannabis. our cultivation techniques and processes continue to be refined, and we achieved our all-time highest average thc potency results of approximately 24% in q1.
i am proud of our team at our facility in olds, alberta and i would now put the quality of our flower up against any of our competitors. the cannabis retail experience and infrastructure acquired through spiritleaf in 2021 have now been bolstered with the alcanna-nova acquisition. the transaction has materially improved our talent entity, and these combined banners represent the largest cannabis retail network in canada, with average daily transactions north of 21,000 during q1 and more than $900,000 in average daily revenue. the insights gained from this critical distribution infrastructure will be key to owning the customer relationship.
across a broader retail value chain in cannabis and liquor sundial now has access to unique insights into tens of thousands of daily shopper transactions at over 350 retail stores. this will enable us to optimize offerings, pricing, and promotions in both liquor and cannabis locations to better serve customers. the company's access to a larger customer base also provides us with a strong foundation for e-commerce and direct-to-consumer strategies that will improve sundial's competitiveness. additionally, we will continue to assess private label opportunities and develop targeted merchandising strategies for our entire retail portfolio.
we remain committed to the development and support of the spiritleaf and value buds banners. following a two-year break due to covid, we are thrilled to welcome our spiritleaf franchise partners to calgary in june for our circle event, which will facilitate strategic discussions, education, and engagement with canada's top lps. nova's value buds banner has been highly disruptive in the canadian industry has become an absolute velocity machine in alberta, with a current average annual run rate of around $3 million per store, which is more than twice as much as the average retail door in the province. in less than two months, we have been able to increase branded product distribution by shipping products to value buds stores and have started to realize synergies against an integration plan that will be a focus for the balance of the year.
by the end of the first quarter of 2022, and sundial has deployed capital on several cannabis-related investments, resulting in a total of $650.2 million, including about $453 million to the sunstream bancorp joint venture. for the first quarter of 2022, the investment portfolio generated interest and fee revenue of $3.9 million, equity pickup of $4.1 million from sunstream, and an investment loss of $17.7 million on marketable securities, which includes unrealized losses on previously publicly disclosed strategic investments in village farms international and the balance company. the current rising interest rate environment has caused us to make noncash accounting adjustments to our largely fixed-rate sunstream portfolio, resulting in muted adjusted ebitda contribution for the quarter. sunstream remains the largest canadian-funded credit portfolio in the industry.
given rising interest rates and geopolitical turmoil as well as the cannabis industry being right with challenges such as oversupply, price compression, and saturation in the retail market. cannabis equity valuations have been under extreme pressure. as our investors are well aware, sundial has not been immune to these market challenges. while our shares have outperformed global and canadian cannabis indices on a one year and year-to-date basis through may 13, we believe that we are undervalued and are committed to the relentless pursuit of shareholder value creation.
sundial's debt-free balance sheet and ample cash reserves place us in an enviable position as we witness a violent and swift reckoning taking hold in the canadian cannabis market. continued aggressive cash consumption by our peers, reduced access to capital and waning investor risk appetite are likely to accelerate sector rationalization as the industry slowly moves toward the formation of an oligopoly. while the canadian sector is difficult and may be entering its starkest hours, the industry's rate of change is showing no signs of slowing down and will likely look vastly different over the next 12 to 24 months. we are keenly focused on the future state of our business and the industry as we focus on delighting consumers.
before i close, i'd like to provide an update on the previously announced share repurchase program. in light of sundial's management views on the company's liquidity, assets, operations, and the recent trading price of our equity, we view the repurchase of shares as an accretive use of capital. in addition, the company recently sought approval from the alberta and ontario securities commissions to enable sundial to sell put options to enhance this program. in summation, we remain optimistic about the future of regulated products in canada.
sundial remains focused on building long-term shareholder value through vertical integration, including the expansion of our retail network, the further streamlining of the company's operating structure, and an enhanced offering of high-quality brands to consumers. thank you, and i'll pass the call to jim for comments on our financial results. 
jim keough -- chief financial officer
thank you, zach, and good morning, everyone. i'd like to remind you that all amounts that i discuss today are denominated in canadian dollars unless otherwise stated. certain amounts that i will refer to on this call are non-ifrs gaap measures. please refer to sundial's management discussion and analysis for the definitions of these measures.
on the last day of march 2022, sundial acquired alcanna inc. and its 63% owned subsidiary, nova cannabis inc., and we are now reflecting a fourth operating segment, liquor retail. with the acquisition, sundial is canada's leading private regulated products retail platform. please note that the alcanna and nova inclusions are comprised of just one day of operations following the acquisition on march 31, 2022.
however, i will also discuss the estimated full first quarter 2022 results for these entities. i'll begin with our consolidated results. net revenue for the first quarter of 2022 was $17.6 million, including the 1 day of revenue on the acquisition of alcanna, an increase of 78% over the first quarter of 2021. had the acquisition of alcanna occurred on january 1, 2022, revenue would have been approximately $164 million and gross margin would have been approximately $36 million.
our gross margin improved to $3.4 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared to a loss of $3.5 million in the first quarter of 2021, a 200% improvement. we reported a reduced net loss of $38 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared to a $134 million loss in the first quarter of 2021. the $96 million improvement in net loss is primarily due to a net revenue increase of $7.7 million, share of profit from sunstream of $4.1 million in 2022, and a noncash change in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities of $122 million. this is partially offset by a downward change in investment revenue of $31 million and higher general and administrative expenses of $3.6 million.
we had an adjusted ebitda loss of $0.7 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared to adjusted ebitda of $3.3 million in the first quarter of 2021. the decrease was largely driven by fair value adjustments and central bank interest rate changes related to the sunstream joint venture in 2022 as well as realized gains on disposition of marketable securities in 2021. general and administrative expenses for the three months ended march 31, 2022, were $10.7 million, compared to $7.1 million for the three months ended march 31, 2021. the increase of $3.6 million was mainly due to increases in salaries and wages, office in general and professional fees due to the acquisition of inner spirit holdings in july 2021, and to a lesser extent, to one day of alcanna following the acquisition.
the increase in professional fees was largely due to the completion of our year-end audit. sundial had just over $1 billion of cash, marketable securities, and long-term investments, and no outstanding debt at march 31, 2022, and we had $361 million of unrestricted cash at may 13. now let's turn to cannabis cultivation and production. gross margin for the first quarter of 2022 was negative $0.2 million, compared to negative $3.5 million for the three months ended march 31, 2021.
the improvement demonstrates sundial's progress in supply chain and cost optimization despite price compression and lower revenue. andrew will provide more details on the improvements we have achieved to date. gross revenue for the cultivation and production of cannabis was $11.3 million for the first quarter of 2022 a small decrease of 3% compared to the first quarter of 2021. this reflects a further shift to branded product sales compared to the first quarter of the prior year.
sundial has terminated the service and sale agreement between sundial and sun 8 holdings inc. for consideration of approximately $3.1 million in cash and $2.9 million of sundial shares. sundial has decontracted the royalty and eliminated the annual royalty fee that sundial was paying to sun 8, which was $2.6 million in 2021. our cannabis retail results, including one day of nova, are as follows.
gross revenue for the three months ended march 31, 2022, was $7.5 million, including $0.7 million, representing one day of sales for nova. gross margin for the first quarter of 2022 was $3.3 million. and systemwide retail sales were $34.6 million for the first quarter of 2022, including that one day of nova revenue. the nova retail store results for one day were gross revenue of $0.7 million and gross margin of $0.2 million.
and while sundial does not account for the results of the nova retail stores prior to the acquisition date, the nova results for the full quarter were gross revenue of $49.8 million and gross margin of $9.4 million or 18.8% of sales. as for our one day of liquor retail results, gross revenue was $1.3 million and gross margin was $0.3 million. again, while sundial does not account for the results of the liquor retail segment prior to the acquisition date, the results of alcanna's retail locations for q1 were as follows. gross revenue for the ace liquor, wine & beyond and liquor depot banners was $115 million and gross margin was $27 million or 24.1% of sales.
and finally, i'd like to review our investment operations. by the end of the first quarter of 2022, the company had deployed capital on cannabis-related investments totaling $650 million, including $453 million to the sunstream bancorp, inc. joint venture. revenue from investments and loans in the first quarter of 2022 was a negative $9.8 million.
this is comprised of $3.9 million of interest on credits held directly by sundial, $4.1 million on share of profit from the sunstream joint venture, and unrealized losses of $17.8 million from investments in marketable securities, which are mark-to-market. downward performance of share prices from our strategic equity portfolio of canadian cannabis-related investments resulted in these unrealized losses. i would now like to invite andrew to provide further remarks related to cannabis operations.
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, jim. i'm pleased with our team's continued execution and commitment to cultivation excellence this past quarter. our cannabis operations are continuing to build momentum as we remain focused on driving to a sustainable, profitable business. the canadian cannabis market remains volatile with too much low-quality product and geographical pockets of high retail saturation.
these headwinds pose challenges but they've also forced our business to be opportunistic by differentiating through product, pricing, and a better understanding of the consumer and customer needs. our average net selling price in the first quarter of 2022 increased by 5% versus the first quarter of 2021 and showed an 11% increase compared to the fourth quarter 2021. this pricing and mix focus supported material improvements in our gross margin on a year-over-year basis with the first quarter of 2022 at negative $0.2 million, compared to negative $3.5 million in the first quarter of 2021. we are making progress with our gross margins in cannabis operations with more work required.
while our overall revenue increased, our cannabis cultivation and production revenue decreased slightly by 3% compared to last year, mainly due to industry declines, most notably in the province of quebec as january and february industry sales in that province declined by about 3% as measured by stats canada. from a quarter-over-quarter standpoint, we had some onetime factors through our previously announced licensing service agreement that positively impacted q4 2021 revenue that was not repeated in q1 2022. accounting for this one-time factor, our net revenue for cannabis operations is stable on a sequential basis and reflects the early progress and commitment to executing our retail vertical integration strategy across western canada and ontario. we have a strong plan that our team continues to execute against, underpinned by the five key initiatives announced at our year-end update.
now let me walk you through these initiatives and provide some additional context against each. we continue to make progress with our cultivation excellence focus. this has contributed to an improvement in our cultivation consistency with sundial's highest average weighted potency results achieved in the first quarter of 2022, coming in at 23.9% thc. this represents a 1.5% increase from the previous quarter.
further, sundial's average weighted yield per square foot broke a new record for sundial in march 2022 with a weighted average yield of 64 grams per square foot. as we continue to focus on cost, we have made significant progress in optimizing costs on pre-roll packaging and processes. from an operational standpoint, we continue to identify significant cost savings beyond our synergy initiatives. the company has made material improvements in its cultivation and innovation pipeline, which is contributing to an enhanced product portfolio nationally.
in q1 2022, priority sku distribution increased nationally by 1,389 points of distribution as measured by internal crm reporting. further, we continue to partner effectively with provincial board securing 159 new inhalable product listings nationally year to date. this innovation success rate represents a 92% strike rate versus the company's plan in an industry where provinces and retailers continue to scrutinize and rationalize skus. western canada represents the largest gain on new listings year to date with 104 skus followed by ocs with 20 skus, sqdc with eight skus in atlantic canada with 27 skus.
our vertical integration strategy is proving fruitful, and we expect to see better results in the coming quarters. some now continue to see brand share increases for its health brands sold in spiritleaf locations through the first quarter, and we continue to see product penetration momentum in the second quarter of 2022. finally, our fifth initiative is analytics and insights. with over 350 retail locations and thousands of daily shopper transactions, we have a unique advantage as one of the largest vertically integrated players in canadian cannabis.
the shopper insights are now being deployed with our franchise partners, other license producers, and our retail customers nationally as we like to take accountability for a healthier industry dynamic for all of our stakeholders. we look forward to sharing some of these important capability-building initiatives through advanced analytics and insights at our upcoming circle event next month. in summary, we remain focused and consistent in our approach with our cannabis operations division. while the industry continues to evolve, we believe our differentiated strategy is on target and beginning to show proof points of sustainable progress moving forward.
i will now turn the call back to zach for closing remarks.
zach george -- chief executive officer
thank you, andrew. our goal is to deliver sustainable profits and returns to shareholders through 2022 and beyond. by focusing on fundamentals and executing a contrarian strategy relative to our peers, we believe that we are in the process of setting sundial up for success. we have significant work ahead to reach our goals, and the path forward is unlikely to be a straight line.
through a vertically integrated model and an unapologetic focus on the canadian market sundial is on a differentiated path toward consumer delight and the creation of shareholder value. i'll now pass the call to the operator for analysts' questions.

operator
[operator instructions] the first question is from frederico gomes with atb capital markets. please go ahead.
frederico gomes -- atb capital markets
hi. good morning, guys. thanks for taking my questions. i guess my first one is on your buyback program and the plan of selling puts against your own stock.
is there a metric or metrics that you're looking at to buy back stock? is it going to be based on book value per share or net tangible book value? or some other metrics like that, that we should be looking at?
zach george -- chief executive officer
thanks, frederico. it's zach. yes, we're not going to give out specific metrics on the back. we will have significant transparency as any purchases or transactions require filing in line with securities regulations.
so there will be -- the market will be well aware of the transactions and where they are. but don't want to get into trading strategies on a public call at this time.
frederico gomes -- atb capital markets
ok. understood. the second question is just looking at your investments here in canada, your stake in village farms and valens. how are you looking at those investments right now, just given the decline in the stock prices.
if you look at balance, for example, stocks down 90% of the last year. so the amount that you pay for your state could now potentially -- is the market price of the company right now. so i'm just curious on how you're looking at those investments right now. it seems like the market is offering some great prices there.
so just your strategy going forward.
zach george -- chief executive officer
sure. so certainly, the mark-to-market impact across the space, but with those two securities specifically, has been painful as of late. but it also creates an opportunity, especially if you're thinking about potential industry consolidation or m&a. all else being equal, if you were looking at these companies as potential acquisition targets, you would welcome the decline in prices.
so specifically, we see some very interesting capabilities with both village and valens is a very unique manufacturing and processing capabilities in terms of 2.0 products. and village farms is a very well-run upstream cultivator, with extremely attractive cash cost of cultivation in their british columbia-based operation. so again, we do expect further consolidation in the industry. the timing is sometimes difficult to plan and there's many reasons why otherwise good transactions can stumble or not get done.
but we think that you're going to see further m&a in the space and don't think that the alcanna transaction is necessarily the last acquisition that sundial engages in.
frederico gomes -- atb capital markets
thank you. that's really helpful. and maybe just i could squeeze one more question here. on your portfolio, you mentioned that it's mostly fixed rates.
can you give us a sense on the weighted average fixed rate of that portfolio? and could you comment on the potential risk to your real rate of return there just given inflation and rising interest rates?
zach george -- chief executive officer
sure. jim, do you want to comment on average yields in the investment portfolio?
jim keough -- chief financial officer
sure. thanks, zach. yes. our weighted average return on the portfolio is around 13%.
and i think we disclosed in the press release that the impact of the fixed-rate changes was a little over $6 million in q1.
frederico gomes -- atb capital markets
ok. thank you. i'll hop back in the queue.
operator
[operator instructions] the next question is from pablo zuanic with cantor fitzgerald. please go ahead.
matthew baker -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
hi. this is matthew baker on for pablo. thank you for taking our questions. can you describe how the competitive environment has changed for sunstream bancorp? we think there's more supply and capital yields have also come down.
and also related to that, can you remind us of the growth plans for sunstream? thank you.
zach george -- chief executive officer
sure. so in terms of the competitive environment, there has been a bit of a cottage industry that's popped up in the u.s. various formats. you actually have publicly listed entities that have taken the form of bdc or mortgage or property reit models that i think you're well aware of.
i would say that many individual states are starting to go through their own cycles. and as some degree of oversupply and saturation impact of these markets. there are pricing and margin pressures out there. that being said, we're quite pleased to be, for the most part, senior point in the capital structure for these companies and are a strong partner to help them work through consolidation and other business improvement efforts that they have on the go.
and we've previously announced the commitment that our board has made to the sunscreen limited partnership fund and strategy, and there's no intention to update or increase that at this time, still working on the existing portfolio and building out the previous allocation.
matthew baker -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. and then for a follow-up question. we realized that the company now has four verticals, but would you consider entering the cannabis tech on our fintech space in a large way?
zach george -- chief executive officer
our sole focus right now is really the integration of this transformational alcanna transaction. so we do see a number of potential business opportunities in other lines. but really trying to stay focused on our knitting right now in terms of proper integration and getting our feet underneath us and really showing the market and our investors the benefits of this vertically integrated model. and thereafter, as we get to a more stabilized rate of profitability, we'll be able to lift our heads up and think about other opportunities, but we're really not looking to get outside of the four segments we're working on currently.
matthew baker -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
thank you.

2022-Q2,SNDL,2022-08-15 08:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good morning and welcome to the sndl's second quarter 2022 financial results conference call. friday afternoon, august 12th, sndl issued a press release announcing their financial results for the second quarter ended on june 30, 2022. this press release is available on the company's website at sndl.com and filed on edgar and sedar as well. the webcast replay of the conference call will also be available on sndl.com website.
sndl has also posted a supplemental investor presentation found on the sndl.com website. presenting on this morning's call, we have zach george, chief executive officer; jim keough, chief financial officer; tank vander, president of liquor retail; and andrew stordeur, president and chief operating officer. before we start, i would like to remind investors that certain matters discussed in today's conference call or answers that may be given to questions could constitute forward-looking statements. actual results could differ materially from those anticipated.
risk factors that could affect results are detailed in the company's financial reports and other public filings that are made available on sedar and edgar. additionally, all financial figures mentioned are in canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated. we will now make prepared remarks. then we'll move on to analysts questions.
i would now like to turn the call over to zach george.
zach george -- chief executive officer
good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2022 earnings call. andrew and i are thrilled to be speaking to you from applebee new brunswick in maritime canada today. before we provide the details on our operations and second quarter results, i want to discuss our companies rebrand. following our annual and special meeting of shareholders on july 25, 2022, sundial growers inc.
changed its legal name to sndl inc. our nasdaq ticker symbol has remained unchanged. the rapid and material changes we have experienced over the past two years have led to our original sundial growers identity becoming less relevant as we expand and diversify our business operations. as we reevaluated our company's purpose and realigned our values, we believe the new sndl brand acknowledges the evolution of our activities and operations as a company and the undeniable impact that investor support has had on the business.
the new sndl brand embodies our commitment to excellence in the regulated product space as we focus on delighting consumers by providing unparalleled experiences coupled with our ability to curate and deliver a robust selection of offerings throughout the regulated retail market. along with the new logo and brand identity, sndl has launched a new investor relations website at www.sndl.com, along with a rebrand video that gives a quick look on who sndl has become. as a reminder, with the alcanna transaction having been completed on march 31, 2022, sndl's business is operated and reported in four segments: liquor retail, cannabis retail, cannabis production and cultivation; and investments. in the second quarter, we made tremendous progress on our strategy and commitment toward becoming a leader in the canadian-regulated products industry.
sndl delivered a 2,344% increase in net revenue year over year with a record net revenue of $223.7 million. sndl's asset base and strong balance sheet position us well to develop unique competitive advantages that will lead to success in the canadian market. sndl's second quarter of 2022 gross margin grew to $43.1 million, up 1,627% from its second quarter 2021 loss of $2.8 million. this result is a record since sndl's inception, which is especially meaningful given the sustained macroeconomic challenges we continue to navigate.
despite material cost inflation, rising interest rates, continued cannabis price compression, and intense competition, sndl continues to drive toward improved results. scale is mission critical to sundial's success. the baseline costs of running a cpg-oriented company with a nasdaq listing outrageous e&o insurance rates, internal and external sox compliance costs, and the commercial cost of best practices in cpg put many of our peers in a position where they are wholly incapable of delivering sustainable profits in excess of the costs of managing this infrastructure. this dynamic is sure to drive further industry consolidation.
as a result of the alcanna acquisition, sndl is now canada's largest private sector liquor retailer, operating 170 locations under its three retail banners: wine and beyond, liquor depot, and ace liquor. the liquor retail segment's stable and growing cash flow profile, along with best in class retail operations expertise, has accelerated sndl's retail growth and vertical integration strategy. as covid 19 restrictions have largely dissipated, we are seeing liquor retail sales revert to a more normalized run rate as on-premise consumption returns in force. that said, despite the fluctuation in sales due to market conditions and retail competition, we have stabilized our margins through pricing and mix initiatives and are working to position the business for greater future profitability.
tank will provide more comments on our liquor segment shortly. turning to our cannabis retail segment, the retail landscape remains highly fragmented and ripe for consolidation as we have begun to see more retail closures on the back of unsustainable saturation in certain markets. our expanded retail networks solidifies sndl's market share and its exposure to a broader consumer base. this past quarter, value buds and spiritleaf's combined market share represented approximately 9.8 share in the privatized provincial markets, solidifying sndl's position as a leading national multi-banner cannabis retail operator.
market share for sndl's products and our retail network continued to increase, highlighting the benefits of the company's vertical integration strategy. we see an opportunity to build a publicly listed, multi-banner, pure-play retail cannabis business with the scale and infrastructure to best serve canadian cannabis consumers with distinct retail experiences. this will require the reorganization of our current retail license exposure into a single enterprise. this strategy may see benefit from the small loans we have made to canadian retailers that could become acquisition candidates.
we expect to provide more detail on this opportunity in the coming months. we are pleased with our cannabis brand sales in the second quarter in an environment that continues to be highly competitive. this is the first quarter since inception that our cannabis operations have generated positive adjusted ebitda. we continue to be encouraged by our thc potency and yield results, which have hit new all-time highs during the quarter.
and sndl's efforts in tailoring our product innovation strategy based on increased data analytics and access to a broader consumer base are starting to yield results. by the end of the first quarter of 2022, sundial had deployed capital into several cannabis-related investments with an ifrs fair value of $561.7 million, including $462 million to the sunstream bancorp joint venture. this joint venture has credit exposure to a handful of operators, including jushi, skymint, ascend, parallel, columbia care, and afc gamma. we have adjusted the fair market value of our investment portfolio to reflect current market conditions in the cannabis industry and credit markets.
sunstream remains the largest canadian funded credit portfolio in the industry. while our goal is to generate attractive returns as a strategic capital partner for these borrowers, in certain cases we may see defaults or other restructurings create an opportunity for sndl to gain a meaningful operating footprint in a single or multi-state format. the broader north american cannabis markets are experiencing price and margin compression while facing a brutal mix of excess supply, tax, and regulatory regime challenges and a lack of access to capital. at this point in the cycle, we are seeing very few new potential credit deployment opportunities that meet sunstream's strict underwriting standards and view the repurchase of shares as attractive on a relative basis, given sndl's current valuation, which implies a discount to the value of our cash and investments and a negative value for our liquor and cannabis operations.
we have shown this math with a net asset value buildup in our new investor deck, which i invite you to review. it's worth noting that we are one of the only lps in canada that can largely consider the repurchase of shares, and we do not need to dilute shareholders in the near term to solve balance sheet issues or to secure working capital. despite our encouraging results, we are well short of our corporate goals and know that our business still has room for both improvement and growth. we expect to realize cost savings across all of our operating segments and our canada integration work will continue into early 2023.
the reckoning that i've been talking about for the last two years is certainly here. we are focused on demonstrating prudent capital allocation and proving the efficacy of our strategy and its benefit to shareholders. sndl is uniquely positioned with the potential to be a leader in the canadian regulated product space. we continue to explore significant opportunities to enhance our capabilities in a manner that's complementary to our vertically integrated model.
we believe that our culture of continuous improvement with a focus on cost control and efficient operations will drive strong future results. i am humbled to work with and serve our more than 2,500 employees and thank them for their continued dedication to our mission. thank you. and i'll pass the call to jim for comments on our financial results. 
jim keough -- chief financial officer
thank you, zach, and good morning, everyone. i'd like to remind you that all amounts that i discussed today are denominated in canadian dollars unless otherwise stated. all results for the second quarter of 2021 comparatives exclude the subsequent acquisitions of spiritleaf and alcanna, which closed on july 20, 2021 and march 31, 2022, respectively. certain amounts that i will refer to on this call are non-ifrs measures.
please refer to sndl's management discussion and analysis for the definitions. as we have previously discussed, sndl now reports its financial results under four segments: liquor retail, cannabis retail, cannabis, and investments. i'll begin with our consolidated financial highlights. with this first full quarter subsequent to the acquisition of alcanna, we achieved net revenue in the second quarter of 2022 of $223.7 million, compared to $9.2 million in the second quarter of 2021, representing a more than 2,000% increase.
our gross margin grew to $43.1 million in the second quarter of 2022, the highest since sndl's inception, up over 1,600% from a loss of $2.8 million in q2 2021. net loss for the three months ended june 30, 2022 was $74 million, compared to a net loss of $52.3 million for the three months ended june 30, 2021. sndl recorded an adjusted ebitda loss of $25.9 million for the second quarter of 2022, compared to an adjusted ebitda loss of $0.2 million in q2 2021. excluding the investment segment, which was primarily impacted by fair value adjustments for sunstream, adjusted ebitda would have been $9.6 million.
as of june 30, 2022, sndl had $900 million of cash, marketable securities, and long-term investments and no outstanding debt. and as of august 11, 2022, sndl had $362.6 million of unrestricted cash. sndl's general and administrative expenses for the three months ended, june 30, 2022 were $40.3 million, compared to $10.1 million for the three months ended june 30, 2021. this increase was mainly due to salaries, wages, and office and general expenses from the alcanna and spiritleaf acquisitions.
effective july 25, 2022, sndl's common shares were consolidated on a one share for each 10 shares outstanding basis pursuant to shareholder approval at sndl's annual and special meeting of shareholders. the company has now regained compliance with the nasdaq minimum closing bid price requirements. in the quarter, sndl repurchased 528,000 shares at a cost of $2 million. the company continues to see a significant dislocation in its valuation when compared to the underlying asset base.
let's take a closer look at our retail liquor segment now. the second quarter of 2022 is sndl's first full quarter reporting liquor retail revenue subsequent to the acquisition on march 31, 2022. and the segment's stable and growing cash flow profile, along with best-in-class retail operations expertise, has significantly impacted sndl's growth. gross revenue for liquor retail sales for the three banners combined was $148.6 million for the second quarter of 2022.
gross margin in the liquor retail segment was $33.5 million or 22.6% of sales. despite fluctuations in sales due to market conditions and retail competition, we've stabilized margins through management of pricing and product mix. now let's turn to cannabis retail. with the acquisition of our interest in nova cannabis inc.
through the alcanna acquisition, our expanded retail network has significantly increased our retail share and exposure to a broader consumer base. gross revenue from the cannabis retail segment for the second quarter of 2022 was $63.5 million, compared to $7.5 million for the first quarter of 2021, a 746% increase. value buds sales were the material driver of the increase with $56.3 million for the second quarter of 2022. systemwide cannabis retail sales, including sales from our franchise partners, was $92.8 million for the second quarter of 2022.
gross margin for cannabis retail this quarter was $13.9 million or 21.9% of sales, significantly increased from $3.3 million compared to q1 2022. through our cannabis cultivation and processing operations, we remain committed to providing quality product offerings for our customers while focusing on cost optimization in the most competitive and profitable strains and brands. our cannabis cultivation and production finance results are as follows. gross revenue from the cannabis segment for the second quarter of 2022 was $15.4 million, compared to $11.3 million in the first quarter of 2022, a 36% increase and a 21% sequential improvement from the first quarter of 2022.
net loss for the cannabis cultivation and production segment was $8 million. adjusted ebitda for q2 2022 was $3.5 million, compared to negative $11 million in the same period of 2021. this represents sndl's first positive adjusted ebitda quarter in the cannabis segment, which can be attributed to higher sales volumes, improved margin on an adjusted basis, reductions to sndl smg&a and a greater discipline over inventory management, driving a reduction in price discounts for provincial board sales during the first half of 2022. and lastly, i'd like to review our investment segment.
revenue from our investment segment for the second quarter of 2022 was a disappointing loss of $35.1 million, compared to $2.4 million in the second quarter of 2021. the decrease was primarily due to non-cash fair value adjustments, reflecting an increase in the assumed risk-free interest rate and the deterioration in overall cannabis credit market conditions during the quarter. as of the end of the second quarter of 2022, sndl had cannabis credit and equity investments with a fair value of $562 million, including $462 million related to the sunstream joint venture and $100 million in canadian credit and equity holdings. i would now like to invite tank vander, sndl president of liquor retail, to provide further remarks on that segment.
tank vander -- president, liquor retail
thank you, jim, and good morning, everyone. i'm tank vander, the president of liquor retail for sndl. as you have heard some zach and jim, we made some substantial progress this past quarter in the business. the liquor segment strengthened sndl's ability to own the customer relationship and shape industry dynamics.
in terms of liquor operations, we have a total of 170 stores and we operate under three banners. wine & beyond is rest in canada's largest liquor store. our stores are known for their incredible selection, unique product offerings, and our staff's excellent product knowledge and customer service. liquor depot is a convenience retail liquor outlet with over 20 locations in alberta.
ace liquor discounter has more than 130 locations in alberta, where you'll find a great selection, better prices, and friendly knowledgeable staff. we are targeting a broad range of customers with a diversified retail portfolio. the covid-19 pandemic significantly affected consumer behavior with respect to retail liquor consumption. the unusually high volume trend has normalized as consumers return to bars and restaurants.
as a result, we have experienced a slight decrease in liquor sales compared to the past two years. we believe that sales are starting to stabilize as customers start getting back into a more normal routine. in terms of our financial highlights, gross revenue for liquor retail sales for the three banners combined was $148.6 million for the second quarter of 2022. our adjusted ebitda for the second quarter of 2022 was $15.5 million.
gross margin in the liquor retail segment was $33.5 million. despite fluctuations in sales due to market conditions and retail competition, we stabilized our margin through a pricing and mix strategy. sndl is leveraging our scale store footprint and warehousing infrastructure to enable strategic buying decisions that drive margin and competitive pricing. while customer count is done by 5% year to date, largely due to a return to on-premise consumption in a post-covid-19 environment, the average basket size is up 2%.
the company sees larger basket sizes at -- on our wine & beyond locations, where consumers come for the experiences destination shopping approach to liquor retail. sndl's liquor banner's market share in alberta was 17.6% in the second quarter of 2022, with wine & beyond representing 2.9% with only 11 stores showcasing the continued and increasing popularity of the banner. sndl is exploring opportunities to expand the wine & beyond store footprint in alberta, british columbia, and saskatchewan. moving forward, the company will continue to optimize profitability and cash flow for the liquor retail segment by focusing on cost discipline and margin accretive products.
we will leverage sndl's extensive inventory and retail footprint to enable leading e-commerce experiences and touchpoints. we are also planning on growing our preferred label program to increase our competitive differentiation and optimize gross margin. thank you again for your time this morning and i will pass it on to andrew.
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, tank. we made strong progress this past quarter in our cannabis operation segments, highlighting the early benefits of the company's vertical integration strategy. i'm very proud of our team's efforts as adjusted ebitda was $3.5 million, which represents sndl's first positive adjusted ebitda quarter within its cannabis operations. the significant improvement in q2 adjusted ebitda can be attributed to higher sales volumes, improved margin on an adjusted basis, reductions to sales, marketing, general and administrative costs, and greater discipline over inventory management, which drove a reduction in price discounts for provincial board sales during the first two quarters of 2022.
our top line grew year over year by 21% and showed a 36% sequential improvement from the first quarter of 2022. while our business and industry face many headwinds, we remain consistent with our execution against a plan launched this year to drive sustainable profitability within our cannabis operations segment. let me highlight some of our progress against this plan and how we're continuing to position are cannabis operations for the future. i'll start with cultivation excellence.
our cultivation outcomes through our indoor purpose-built facility in old alberta hit new high points in the second quarter of 2022, with average potency for the month of june, achieving north of 25% thc. our average weighted yield continues to remain consistent at 57 grams per square foot. our second key pillar for 2022 is around cost optimization. with better and more consistent cultivation outcomes, we've been able to attack our margin profile.
further investments in process and automation remain a key focus for the second half of 2022, particularly around increasing our pre-roll and bottling throughput in several new formats. while price compression continues to be an extended headwind for the industry, we've been able to increase our provincial board price per gram by 32% on a year-over -year basis. we continue to believe that disciplined pricing through strong revenue management capability is a key enabler to accelerating margin growth for key customers. further, our end-to-end supply chain improvements implemented over the past two years continue to drive discipline around cost optimization, which is helping partially offset higher power and inflation costs.
moving to the second half of 2022, we do expect margin pressure on our portfolio given the challenging industry backdrop. monetizing sellable inventory through a national brand pack price and channel strategy is currently underway. we've enhanced our product portfolio. we continue to drive consumer value through a disciplined product innovation pipeline.
this is backed by access to a broad consumer base and intentional application of data analytics to meet the unique needs of the market. some notable highlights include: on the top leaf brand, we launched two limited edition infused pre-roll offerings, spaceberry fuel and pink platinum haze caviar cones. as the first producer to bring infused pre-rolls to the canadian recreational market, we remain committed to the segment and view it as a significant opportunity to drive improved margins and better sales. we plan to deliver an expanded infused lineup in the second half of 2022 with additional formats and formulations.
our commitment to premiumization and quality has enabled the top leaf brand to claim the #1 spot for premium flower brands in quebec market and holds the #1 spot for premium ounce offerings in alberta. under our palmetto brand, we have expanded our large format offerings in two key segments with our romulan and blue dream cultivars, both launching in new 28 gram formats. we have also relaunched our vape portfolio with one gram distillate vapes in four innovative new flavors: raspberry kush, clementine haze, super tropic haze, and dragon fruit kush. a minimal flower launched in the second quarter of 2022 and has received positive consumer views.
in british columbia, palmetto middle flower has exceeded tread in points of distribution, with more growth expected. finally, we are excited to announce we have expanded our brand footprint into newfoundland and labrador to drive increased national market share. sndl products are now available in all 10 provinces across canada. we remain committed to proving our vertical integration strategy within canada.
we're also looking to be optimistic internationally, given our indoor cultivation progress and flower demand. we have received our international export permit and are on track to dispatch our first shipment to israel in the third quarter of 2022. to close, we're on track with our plan and the results are starting to show early signs of progress. i'm extremely proud of our team's effort to date and believe we have a clear path to further differentiate and shape a very competitive and challenging industry.
i'll now turn back the call to zach for closing remarks.
zach george -- chief executive officer
thank you, andrew. our goal is to deliver sustainable profits and returns to shareholders. we believe that we are setting sndl up for success by focusing on fundamentals and building credibility as a trustworthy partner to industry stakeholders and a source of delight to consumers. through a vertically integrated model and an unapologetic focus on the canadian market, sndl continues to distinguish itself from the competition.
i will now pass the call to the operator for analyst questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] the first question is from frederico gomes with atb capital markets. please go ahead.
frederico gomes -- atb capital markets -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my questions. my first question is on your liquor retail segment. so you mentioned that wine & beyond is becoming more popular and that could be expanded to other provinces.
so could you maybe talk a little bit more about any details you could share on the economics of the wine & beyond banner? how it's different from other -- the other vendors in your portfolio in terms of sales per store, no margins as well as the capex needed for opening new stores that you're planning on? thank you.
zach george -- chief executive officer
sure. thanks, frederico. i'll let tank jump in to answer this one.
tank vander -- president, liquor retail
thanks, zach. so on the growth opportunities, we are looking at this columbia and saskatchewan and hopefully another two to three stores in the alberta market. to answer your question on what's different between wine & beyond and other stores, wine & beyond attracts a much larger customer segment and it offers the highest selection and the most competitive pricing in the liquor retail segment in alberta. on capex, wine & beyond usually costs -- the build out of the wine & beyond is anywhere between $1.5 million to $1.8 million at this current pricing in the market.
it might fluctuate a bit with current conditions due to increase in materials and whatnot, but it's usually -- the last few we have done are -- have gone under $2 million. does that answer your question?
frederico gomes -- atb capital markets -- analyst
yes. yes. that's really helpful. thank you.
and then maybe moving on to your cannabis retail segment. so it seems like the number of stores in the spiritleaf network has remained relatively flat recently. and most of the revenue you have in that segment is coming from nova cannabis, which is performing really well. so could you maybe talk about how you see the different performance that both vendors are having right now? and do you have any specific plans to improve the performance of spiritleaf, both in your corporate-owned stores as well as in your franchise network?
zach george -- chief executive officer
yeah, sure. absolutely. so the thing to remember, frederico, is that the spiritleaf model is a blend of corporate-owned locations along with franchise exposure. so it's not really an easy apples-to-apples comparison when you look at nova.
the target shopper is also very different. so the discount brokers of nova has turned those doors into highly competitive velocity machines and you can see a line of sight based on greater scale to profitability, which hasn't hit on a sustained basis yet, but the margin profiles are very different. and what i would say that we're seeing in the market -- my comments are in line with what we've been saying for the last several quarters in that we're really looking to optimize performance at retail and not looking to blindly open a large quantity of new doors into an already oversaturated market. we don't think that that's a smart strategy.
and we're seeing now virtually most retail in the country on a private basis coming up for sale or looking for some type of strategic solution. this is a business model that requires scale. it's very hard to operate successfully and profitably at a small scale. so independent operators and even some small chains are having some significant problems.
and what we're seeing is at this point, the build versus buy equation, when you think about relative capex obligations, has in some cases inverted. so we're carefully watching for instances where we may selectively open new doors versus acquiring other banners. we do believe that there are different and distinct target shoppers that exist in the retail cannabis space in canada, and we also believe in the benefits of multi-banner retail. and so i think the steps we take to grow that platform well will reflect that going forward.
frederico gomes -- atb capital markets -- analyst
ok. thanks for that. i'll pass it along.

shaan mir -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
hey, good morning and thank you for taking my question. just the first one here. so in the release, it was noted that the company exported its first products into israel in q3. so congratulations on that.
just wanted to get some more color on your international strategy. specifically, are there any other international markets of interest to you that sndl would look to enter in the next 12 months or so? and if so, is there any commentary that you could provide on where the companies are in the regulatory process for tapping those new markets?
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
hey, shaan. it's andrew here. thanks for the question. appreciate it.
in regards to export, just one bit of correction. we have not executed that transfer yet, our first one to israel. that is pending in quarter here for q3, but we're on track. and i'll touch a little bit around kind of our view in regards to domestic versus international.
and i think one thing we've been pretty consistent on is it's focusing on canada. we do believe canada is worth fighting for and we certainly have a good position and good strategy, i think, moving forward here to prove that model out. so our focus remains on canada would be the first thing i'd say. when it comes to looking at international, i think what we're doing is we needed to get our cultivation, we need to get our operations on the ground here done and set up to a position where we felt that we could look and have some optionality for exporting out of the country.
and i think that's where we're at right now. we feel really confident on where our product quality is. we have demand for that product quality outside of canada. we're starting in israel.
we have a nice contract that we signed that we're going to be deploying against here for the back half of 2022 and potentially to 2023. so we're going to start there and we're going to be opportunistic as we think about where those other opportunities look like in other parts outside of canada. and we're in israel now focused, but we're certainly looking at other markets. germany is interesting, obviously.
there's a lot of attention being there with regards to what that regulatory framework is going to look like in future. there's opportunities in places like australia. so we're going to be, again, opportunistic where we go. we're certainly well-positioned to do that now.
but i would just say that our focus remains canada in the short, medium term and we're looking at those opportunities as they come down and we'll certainly capitalize it if it makes sense for our business.
shaan mir -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
ok. thank you for the color there.  and then my next question is on the retail side. so i've read a couple of recent media reports that show that ocs has shut down its delivery services just due to a cyberattack on its logistics network. i know many retailers i've spoken to in the past rely on weekly deliveries to keep their shelves stocked.
so i just wanted to get a sense for how you think this will have an impact on your two retail lines and if there's any steps that you're taking or any any protocol in place that's helping you mitigate the potential impact here.
zach george -- chief executive officer
sure. look, it's a great question and it's going to be a bit of a macro answer, shaan. so we don't expect any material disruptions in our retail business from the some of the technology or cyber attack or cyber security issues that occurred with the ocs. what i would point out is that we're seeing movement in terms of the regulatory overlay at many different levels across the country.
and so for example, you saw that the alberta board, the aglc has changed its stance on window coverings, which was becoming a significant security issue and making making the environment convenient for would-be thieves who have put some of our staff members at risk over time. so we think that those robberies will decrease as a result of the change in regs. and we're seeing some common sense regulatory reform come into the discussions across many different provinces. i think ontario has had its own growing pains and is trying to sort out the appropriate role of government in this industry.
and i would expect that to change over time. but certainly the -- that cyber attack got a lot of attention. we don't actually expect it to pose any material disruption to our business.
shaan mir -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
thank you. i'll pass it on.
operator
the next question comes from pablo zuanic with cantor fitzgerald. please go ahead.
pablo zuanic -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
morning. just questions regarding sunstream. so if you're going to expand, please, on the asset writedown. i mean, was this just related to one specific credit or was it just an adjustment for the portfolio as a whole? if you can give more color there? and i don't know if you disclosed this, but can you talk in more detail about the book? i know you mentioned some of the companies there but is this portfolio very concentrated, say, on parallel? so that's one question.
and then the second one, i think you mentioned that if some of these companies default, you may be able to take over the assets or take equity in the company. just remind me of the regulatory side of things if you do that, right, because sundial is nasdaq-listed. can sunstream actually owned u.s. plant touching assets? thanks.
zach george -- chief executive officer
sure. so, pablo, because a number of these borrowers are private and we have confidentially obligations and we haven't given the broad detail on the individual loans themselves, wo we've prepared a no-names revenue waterfall in our investor presentation, so we'd be happy to walk you through that. in terms of the ifrs fair value assessment, that's something that we apply to all assets, including credit assets every quarter and we try to take the most conservative approach possible. certainly we've seen an increase in the risk free rate, which feeds into the discount rate for all of our assets.
there have been some positive changes, which would actually improve value. plus you have the contribution of interest income that nets against any write downs. so this is not something that we expect to continue in this magnitude sequentially or indefinitely for sure, but was something that was prudent that we need to do. and this will be similar to any investments or exposure that most of your coverage universe has in cannabis would have been subject to fair value adjustments over the last several quarters.
and you're seeing that with sundial as well. in terms of the second question, i don't want to get too deep into this, but i know that you're well aware of structural means of actually having capital exposure to u.s. single-state and multi-state operators without engaging directly in plant touching behavior activities. and so should an opportunity like that arise and become concrete, we will certainly be forthcoming with the structural details of how any such transaction would work.
pablo zuanic -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
right. but just another point. i mean, if i may follow up. given the tough conditions of the market over there, right, and the difficulty for a lot of these companies to get access to capital, i mean, when this be an opportunity for you guys to be more aggressive on the equity side of things more than on the debt side? i mean, what am i missing something there? meaning, sure, people that don't want to get diluted, they would rather borrow from you.
but you're saying you don't want to expand the book because of the quality there. but so if those companies need capital, i don't want to make it sound like you're a vulture fund here, but this would be an opportunity for you to take care of the stakes. not necessarily convert the debt into equity, but just putting new money where that will make sense.
zach george -- chief executive officer
yeah. look, that's -- pablo, that's exactly the question that would be on the table, but i would put it in the following terms. so if you think about equity performance across north american cannabis, it's been nothing short of horrific. you have most equities down 70% to 90% over the last year, and that's almost without exception.
so if you think about the modest non-cash impairments that we've put up on credit, they really pale in comparison to the broader equity performance. when you have a situation where any given hypothetical credit goes into a restructuring and may default and not be able to satisfy its obligations, and you would you would potentially face the acquisition of that credit, there's a lot of question as to what form new capital investment should take. and it may, as you suggest, be equity. but you're suggesting that somehow we're not being aggressive or proactive based on the decision as to whether it was going to be credit, or preferred or some other instrument, i don't think that's the right measure.
i think that we have sufficient capital in a market that is short capital in a very distinct form. and so to the extent that that becomes a prudent opportunity for us to enter the u.s. market, we will execute on it. but i don't think that the bright line measure on it on sort of our level of aggressiveness or interest will be reflected in a decision as to whether the next dollar investment is done in the form of equity or debt.
pablo zuanic -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. and just to follow up, so regarding the $463 million you've committed, canadian, of course. just remind us. so you've contributed the money to sunstream, and that is the bulk of sunstream.
so -- but then you share the profits and the fees and the interest with the saf group. so i'm just trying to understand what does saf bring in to the table here, why are they taking apparently such a disproportionate cut to the earnings when they are pretty much putting down no capital down?
zach george -- chief executive officer
yeah. good question. pablo, i've answered this question for you two or three different times. so we are co-manager, non-controller, co-manager of the portfolio with saf.
so saf is a top alternative investment firm based in western canada. and in partnering with them, we gain access to analytic and back office expertise that we would otherwise have to build a pretty substantial team that would involve significant cost organically. so in terms of your comment around disproportionate share of returns, that's simply not true. we are the other half of the co-management team and so we receive basically a rebate on what is a very market-based management fee.
and i know there's been potentially some confusion about who has -- who the actual lp capital base is attributed to, but that would be sundial. so there's no sharing of the actual capital base with the co-manager of the fund.
pablo zuanic -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
got it. i don't want to be critical, i mean, in this open forum, right. but i just find that there's other people that have taken the risk and put money down in the industry, whether it's the reits or somewhere in new ipos we've seen or bdcs. and they didn't need the help or another partner for this analytics.
i'm just -- again, i'm not trying to be negative here, but i'm just trying to understand. you have all these billion dollar on the balance sheet, you have the 463 that you put in here, but you still need the help from someone else and where there's been a lot of other companies that have been able to do this on their own and apparently with similar or even better results.
zach george -- chief executive officer
yeah. so, pablo, i think the -- when you look at the ipos that have occurred and the other financing vehicles in the space, number one, i would just remind you that we have the largest canadian funded credit portfolio in the cannabis space. number two, a number of those ipos which came out, they're now trading in the b2c realm and elsewhere. they're trading at a meaningful discount to book, which means that their access to capital is meaningfully restricted.
and so -- and we're also keenly aware of the quality of credit and where we are in the cycle when it comes to u.s. opportunities. so i think you'll see those results from those financing vehicles really start to show in the coming quarters, but not getting into that. i'm just -- i'm not sure why having a partner is somehow a reason for criticism.
but clearly, that's the line of questioning that you're on. so happy to get into the track record of our partners and the benefits we see here or off line.
pablo zuanic -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
that's fine. thank you. and one last one, if i may. just on the $100 million credit portfolio for canada, can you break that down? how much -- is that heavily retail or is it mostly producers? just a little more color there.
thank you.
zach george -- chief executive officer
yeah. so that credit exposure would include the both zenabis, a number of other small credits that we have out to select retailers and the small equity exposure we have in canada as well.
pablo zuanic -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
thank you.

2022-Q3,SNDL,2022-11-14 10:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good morning and welcome to sndl's third quarter 2022 financial results conference call. sndl issued a press release this morning announcing their financial results for the third quarter ended on september 30th, 2022. this press release is available on the company's website at sndl.com and filed on edgar and sedar as well. the webcast replay of the conference call will also be available later today on the sndl.com website.
sndl has also posted a supplemental investor presentation found on the sndl.com website. presenting on this morning's call, we have zach george, chief executive officer; jim keough, chief financial officer; tank vander, president of liquor retail; and andrew stordeur, president and chief operating officer. before we start, i would like to remind investors that certain matters discussed in today's conference call or answers that may be given to questions could constitute forward-looking statements. actual results could differ materially from those anticipated.
risk factors that could affect results are detailed in the company's financial reports and other public filings that are made available on sedar and edgar. additionally, all financial figures mentioned are in canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated. we will now make prepared remarks, and then we'll move to analyst questions. i would now like to turn the call over to zach george.
zach george -- chief executive officer
good morning, everyone, and welcome to sndl's third quarter 2022 conference call. q3 proved to be another encouraging quarter for our company. our focus on operational execution and sustainable profitability has enabled us to deliver record revenue and operating cash flow this past quarter. i've spent almost three years openly discussing the challenges facing our company and the cannabis industry.
and for the first time, i see contrary indicators suggesting that the canadian industry is nearing a trough, warranting a more bullish stance. despite the imperfect rollout of the canadian legal cannabis market, a massive oversupply of licenses and products, and continued pricing erosion, there are reasons for optimism at sndl. in a sense, things in the canadian cannabis industry are so bad that they're good. we are seeing an unrelenting oversupply of flower inventories and an acceleration of bankruptcy filings among peers.
our team continues to work hard every day to turn industry headwinds into tailwinds for our consumers and investors as we drive toward improved results. our liquor retail business continues to reach a normalized run rate following the return of on-premise consumption post-covid, and we expect seasonally strong results in q4. this segment has provided operating cash flow that has had a stabilizing effect on our consolidated results, and we are pursuing new initiatives that we believe will drive further accretion. notably, we are in the early stages of developing across segment loyalty program and intend to offer point-of-sale analytics as a service in both cannabis and liquor in 2023.
our strong business technology team is a differentiating factor for sndl, and we are excited to unlock the team's capabilities. scale is mission-critical to our success. the baseline costs of running a cpg-oriented company with a nasdaq listing, high director and officer insurance rates, internal and external sox compliance costs, and the commercial costs of best practices in cpg put many of our peers in a position where they're incapable of delivering sustainable profits above the costs associated with managing this infrastructure. this dynamic will drive further industry consolidation, and we believe our vertically integrated cannabis business gives us the advantages required to be a strong member of a future oligopoly in canada.
it is worth contextualizing the growth that the sndl team has built this past year. we have grown our revenue at a staggering rate of more than 1,500% on a year-over-year basis. we now manage more than 350 liquor and cannabis stores, making us the largest private market liquor and cannabis distributor in canada. sndl's retail strategy is predicated on its quality store locations, wide range of products, and differentiated retail experiences.
we also own and operate canada's largest indoor purpose-built cannabis cultivation and processing facility, with a diverse brand portfolio ranging from value to premium. our cannabis retail and cannabis operations are key enablers in sndl's vertical integration strategy. with the scale of data and insights generated through our retail network, we are able to continuously tailor our innovation strategy to play in high-velocity product segments, as well as white spaces in the industry, in order to delight consumers. our integration work and cost-control initiatives will continue into 2023 as we remain focused on opportunities related to alcanna and the recently acquired assets of zenabis and expect to close the proposed acquisition of valens in january of 2023.
with valens, sndl aims to be a leading canadian manufacturer, with broad cannabis product capabilities, strong optionality related to low-cost procurement, and best-in-class innovation potential. the acquisition enhances our positioning by combining a diverse brand portfolio and extensive retail footprint, low-cost biomass sourcing, premium indoor cultivation, and manufacturing facilities. as one of the largest purchasers of biomass in the country, we expect the pro forma company to take advantage of the current market oversupply, which will enhance margins and provide desperately needed working capital to certain industry participants. sndl is well on its way to becoming one of canada's largest adult-use cannabis manufacturers and retailers.
and with our retail insights and financial strength, sndl should be able to adapt quickly to emerging and evolving consumer trends. at the company's inception, prior leadership prudently focused on inhalable formats that have made up more than 80% of sales in the industry. that said, market dynamics change quickly in cannabis, and valens provides increased capabilities with a full suite of cannabis products, including ingestibles and beverages. sndl will also have the highest pro forma of canadian cannabis revenue on a last fiscal quarter annualized basis once we complete this acquisition.
we do not intend to participate in the knife fight that is ongoing between canadian cannabis companies. we seek to be a partner to the industry, promoting best practices, responsible consumption, and sustainability. in terms of our investment segment, to the third quarter of 2022, sndl had deployed capital to several cannabis-related investments with an ifrs fair market value of approximately 678 million, including 527 million to the sunstream bancorp joint venture. this jv has credit exposure to a handful of operators, including jushi, skymint, ascend, parallel, columbia care, and afc gamma.
in the next few weeks, we expect to provide investors and stakeholders with more clarity about our sunstream portfolio activities. while our goal is to generate attractive returns as a strategic capital partner for these borrowers, in certain cases, we may see defaults or other restructurings create an opportunity for sndl to gain a meaningful operating footprint in a single or multistate format. our transformation is far from complete, but with an improving portfolio, cost discipline, and continued organic and acquisitive growth, we are well-positioned to reach our objectives, including the generation of sustainable free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. i am privileged to serve passionate professionals, including more than 2,500 employees, who continuously work to transform our business and delight consumers daily.
our vertically integrated model, dedicated team, best-in-class balance sheet, and scale are competitive advantages we've built for the express purpose of giving ourselves the flexibility to succeed under multiple economic and regulatory scenarios. and these are the advantages that will lead us in our next leg of growth. thank you, and i'll pass the call to jim for comments on our financial results. 
jim keough -- chief financial officer
thank you, zach, and good morning, everyone. i'd like to remind you that all amounts discussed today are denominated in canadian dollars unless otherwise stated, all comparative results for the third quarter of 2021 exclude the subsequent acquisition of alcanna inc., which closed on march 31st, 2022. certain amounts that i will refer to on this call are non-ifrs gaap measures. please refer to sndl's management's discussion and analysis for the definitions of these measures.
before i go into greater detail of sndl's financial results under each of our four operating segments being liquor retail, cannabis retail, cannabis operations, and investments, i will begin with our consolidated financial highlights. it's a pleasure to announce that sndl achieved record net revenue for the third quarter of 2022 of $230 million, compared to $223 million in the second quarter of 2022 and $14 million in the third quarter of 2021. this represents a 3% increase sequentially and an increase of over 1,500% year over year. sndl also achieved an adjusted ebitda of 18 million for q3 2022, up 169% from q2 2022 and up 74% from q3 2021.
our cash flow provided by operating activities was 8.6 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to cash used in operating activities of 17.9 million in the second quarter of 2022 and cash used in operating activities of 56 million in the third quarter of 2021. our gross margin grew to 50 million in q3 2022, a record since sndl's inception, up 17% from q2 2022 and an increase of over 2,700% from q3 2021. general and administrative expenses for the three months ended september 30th, 2022 were $45 million, compared to 9 million for the three months ended september 30th, 2021. the increase of 35 million was primarily because of increases in salaries and wages, as well as office and general expenses from the alcanna and inner spirit acquisitions, with sndl now employing more than 2,500 personnel across all segments.
net loss for the three months ended september 30th, 2022 was 98.8 million, compared to net income of 16.7 million for the three months ended september 30th, 2021. this increase in net loss of 115 million was largely due to higher g&a expenses, about 35 million; depreciation and amortization, 7 million; asset impairment of intangibles and goodwill from the inner spirit acquisition, 86 million; finance costs of 8.3 million; and change in fair value of derivative warrants of 32 million, all partially offset by an increase in gross margin of 48 million, lower investment losses of 12.5 million, and transaction costs of 4.9 million. as of september 30th, 2022, sndl has $988 million of cash, marketable securities, and long-term investments, and no outstanding debt. i'll now review the results for our liquor retail segment.
sndl currently operates 169 locations, predominantly in alberta, under its three retail banners: wine and beyond, liquor depot, and ace liquor. gross revenue for liquor retail sales for the three banners combined was 152 million for the third quarter of 2022, an increase of 4% compared to the third quarter of 2021, despite alberta's off-premise liquor retail volumes sales being down this past quarter compared to the same period last year. gross margin was $35 million, or 23% of sales in q3 2022, compared to 33 million in q3 2021. we continue to maintain the margin year over year through a pricing and product mix strategy in q3 2022.
let's take a closer look at our cannabis retail results next. we currently own and/or operate 183 locations under two retail banners: spiritleaf and value buds. gross revenue for the two banners combined in the third quarter of 2022 was $66 million, compared to 6.1 million in the third quarter of 2021, a 985% increase. value buds' sales were the material driver of the increase with 58 million of revenue during q3 2022.
our gross margin for q3 2022 was 14.5 million, or 22% of sales, compared to 3.7 million in q3 of 2021. and this is primarily due to value buds' new locations and aggressive pricing strategy. i'll now turn to sndl's cannabis operations results. gross revenue from the cannabis operations segment for the third quarter of 2022 was 16.5 million, compared to 15.4 million, a 7% increase over the second quarter of 2022; and compared to 11 million in the third quarter of 2021, a 49% year-over-year increase.
we're pleased to announce that we achieved a record gross margin in the third quarter of 2022 of 0.2 million compared to negative 1.9 million for the three months ended september 30, 2021, and negative 4.3 million for the prior quarter. the significant improvement was mainly a result of a 2.3 million reversal of inventory impairment in q3 2022, which demonstrates sndl's progress in implementing supply chain excellence. next, i'll review our investment operations. as of the end of q3 2022, sndl's cannabis-related investments had a carrying value of 677 million, including 526 million in the sunstream bancorp inc.
joint venture. for q3 2022, the investment portfolio generated interest and fee revenue of 4.3 million, compared to 3.3 million in q3 2021. our share of profit of equity accounted investees generated from investments by sunstream was 9.2 million, compared to 9.9 million in q3 2021; and investment loss of 5.5 million, as compared to a loss of 18 million in q3 2021 on marketable securities, which includes unrealized losses on publicly disclosed strategic investments in village farms international, inc. and the valens company inc.
finally, let's discuss activities that affected sndl shares. effective july 25th, 2022, sndl's common shares were consolidated on a one-share-for-each-10-shares outstanding basis. as of september 30th, 2022 and november 11, 2022, sndl had an unrestricted cash balance of 291 million and 361 million, respectively, and a total of 236 million post-consolidation shares outstanding as of november 11th, 2022. for the nine months ended september 30th, 2022, sndl purchased and counseled 1.7 million common shares at a weighted average price of $3.61 canadian or $2.75 u.s.
per common share for a total cost of $6.1 million. the share repurchase program was scheduled to expire on november 19th, 2022. on november 11th, 2022, the sndl board approved extension of this program by an additional year. i would now like to invite tank vander, president of liquor retail, to provide further remarks on our liquor retail segment.
tank vander -- president, liquor retail
thank you, jim, and good morning, everyone. i would like to start by saying i'm proud of the liquor retail team's continued focus on operational performance and dedication to delivering an exceptional retail experience for our customers. the liquor segment strengthens sndl's ability to own the customer relationship and shape the retail experience, and our positive results illustrate that capability. our third quarter results feature sales of 152.5 million, a 4.5% increase from the third quarter of 2021 and a 5% increase from the second quarter of 2022.
this result was achieved despite the decrease in off-premise sales across the industry this past quarter due to customers returning to a normal routine after the covid-19 restrictions were lifted. the adjusted ebitda for the liquor retail segment increased by 198% in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the previous year, from $4.6 million to $13.7 million. gross margin in the liquor retail segment was 35.6 million, or 23% of sales in the third quarter of 2022, compared to 33.6 million in the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 5.7%. while the yearly gross margin growth is positive and we have maintained it sequentially, central procurement teams carefully planned buying on limited-time offers to increase margin.
we continued to stay competitive with pricing, especially with our discount banners such as ace liquor, and capture further market share with a great variety of value products for our customers. sndl is leveraging the scale, store footprint, and warehousing infrastructure to enable strategic buying decisions that drive margin and competitive pricing. one of our liquid retail strategies to gain current gross margin results remains with our preferred label sales. preferred label sales were 10.7 million in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of approximately 1 million compared to the third quarter of 2021.
our liquor retail segment model was built on the premise of operational efficiencies to provide as much value to our customers while ensuring sustainable profitability. despite wage increases, we are able to reduce our payroll costs by 3% compared to the previous quarter. we also reduced our operating expenses for the liquor business by approximately 6% in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the previous quarter, from $6 million to $5.7 million. our diligent focus on cost efficiencies allows us to offer competitive pricing to our community, leading to stable revenue growth.
our customer count for all our banners is up by 1% year over year, and the average basket value is up 3% despite inflation pressures. we see larger basket sizes at our wine and beyond locations, where consumers come for the extensive offerings and experiential approach to liquor retail. we currently have 11 wine and beyond locations in alberta and one location in kelowna, british columbia. in alberta, wine and beyond stores account for approximately 3% of the market share in the province compared in line with the previous quarter, proving the success of the destination shopping concept.
our third quarter sales results for wine and beyond were $33.8 million, a 43% increase from the third quarter of 2021. the increase was mainly due to our four additional stores open this past year. we are very proud to announce that wine and beyond celebrated its 10th-year anniversary this past september. we commemorated this milestone with our community by running a 10-week-long celebration that included local beer partnerships, exclusive single-barrel releases, exciting tasting events, and various in-store promotions.
sdl operates 169 liquor stores in alberta. our liquor banners' market share in alberta, where we predominantly operate, was approximately the same as previous quarters, with 17.6% in the third quarter of 2022. market share data is based on management's estimates using available industry data. moving forward, we will continue to optimize profitability and cash flow for the liquor retail segment by focusing on cost discipline, margin-accretive products, and differentiated preferred label offerings.
we will leverage sndl's extensive inventory and retail footprint to enable leading e-commerce experiences and touchpoints. looking to 2023 and future expansion, our approach will be calculated and focused on current market conditions. thank you again for your time this morning, and i'll pass it on to andrew for sndl's cannabis operations update.
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, tank, and thank you all for joining today. this is another encouraging quarter for our cannabis operations, building off our positive momentum in 2022. we are beginning to see the scale of our vertical integration strategy deliver our intended results and maturity of our operations solidify our path to long-term profitability. coupled with our focus on cost optimization and enhanced product strategy, we are successfully executing our 2022 plan.
our focus on cultivation excellence continues to show positive returns as gross revenue from the cannabis operation segment for the third quarter of 2022 was 16.5 million, compared to 15.4 million, a 7% increase in the second quarter of 2022; and compared to 11 million, a 49% year-over-year increase. sndl achieved a record gross margin before fair value adjustments for the three months ended september 30th, 2022 of 3.6 million, or 31%, compared to negative 4.9 million for q3 2021, an increase of 8.6 million or 176%. these substantial improvements demonstrate sndl's progress in delivering sustainable top-line growth through managing our product mix, pricing, and volume initiatives. i'm also pleased with our continued focus on implementing supply chain excellence to drive discipline around cost optimization despite intense price compression, higher power costs, and overall cost inflation.
to further expand on our product mix strategy, we have increased our inhalable offerings nationally from vape, large-format flower, and both infused and traditional pre-roll formats to meet growing consumer demand and drive market share in these keystone segments. we continue to make progress in our cultivation strategy, reflecting industry dynamics. our access to increased data and analytics through our vertical integration at retail enables us to target white spaces and enhance our portfolio offering. we are excited to announce the launch of the value buds' private label in partnership with nova cannabis, which arrived in alberta in early november and will launch in ontario early in the first quarter of 2023.
the value buds' offering focuses specifically on large-format flower and is uniquely curated for the value buds consumer. the initial launch includes four skus in both 14-gram and 28-gram pack sizes with fully compostable packaging. we recognize our role in reducing cannabis packaging waste. we're also looking at opportunities for significant cost savings.
i'm excited to report on this with more detail in the fourth quarter, but the early sentiment from consumers has been very positive. to further build on our large-format offerings, under the palmetto brand, we launched several flower skus in the third quarter to fill growing industry demand, including 14-gram formats of both our romulan and og kush dried flower. moving to pre-rolls, this category, inclusive of infused offerings, continues to accelerate, representing seven out of 10 of the fastest-growing segments in our own retail locations. pre-roll share revenue and own retail has increased by almost 10% since january 2022.
as such, we have expanded our top leaf's caviar cone offerings with two new flavor blends launched in the third quarter. we're also excited to launch our caviar cones reserve pack in q4 as part of our holiday campaign. the palmetto brand will launch a newly infused pre-roll in q4. this enables us to compete in various price points and pack sizes within one of the fastest-growing inhalable segments in canada.
finally, to build on our vertical integration and export strategies, sndl completed our first international shipment to israel in the third quarter of 2022, and through our acquisition of the zenabis business, we are looking to accelerate further international opportunities. while our primary focus remains on the canadian market, international export will prove to be a beneficial expansion for our cultivation and processing operations. the additional monetizable inventory procured from zenabis and increased production capabilities further enable our supply chain to expand our large-format flower offerings to our leading retail footprint nationally. in closing, we remain on track with our plan, and i'm proud of how our team continues to execute during a very challenging time within the industry.
we're optimistic about the momentum built in 2022 and closing the year strong. thank you, and i'll pass it back to zach for closing remarks.
zach george -- chief executive officer
thank you. overall, i am encouraged by the progress we are making across all aspects of our business. i'm proud of the way our team is executing with purpose, confidence, and resilience. our work is far from complete, but sndl has a tremendous opportunity to continue forging the path forward for regulated products both in canada and internationally.
the team is committed to building a world-class business, and we are excited about the possibilities ahead. thanks to all, and we look forward to updating you on our progress into the end of 2022.

thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question comes from shaan mir of canaccord genuity. please go ahead.
shaan mir -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
good morning and congrats on the quarter. my first question is on the cannabis operation. so, just based on some of the third-party tracking data we subscribed to, we saw that september adult-use sales had come down slightly for your brand specifically toward the end of the quarter, and that kind of sustained into october. so, i was wondering if you could provide any -- some color on the dynamics there.
and more specifically, what indications do you have or that you've started to capture a majority of the revenue synergies expected from that alcanna transaction? or do you see other ways to leverage that platforms toward expanding your branded sales from here?
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, hey, shaan. it's andrew. thanks for the question. look, i think first thing i'd say is we're on our plan for our own retail in our vertical integration strategy.
so, i think that's tracking as we expect it to track. and i would also say, too, like we're -- you know, as we've stated before, you know, our focus isn't, you know, driving for short-term market share. as you can look at our earnings results here, we've been really focused on the margin profile through mix and volume and pricing. and you can see that start to pay dividends for us as we build out more sustainably.
obviously, market share is important for us. and a couple of things maybe i'll mention on that point. i think -- as i stated, we're on our track for our own retail. we're looking at some of the data that we're getting through our own retail, and that's obviously vast.
and some of the areas that we're focused on, you know, particularly as i mentioned in my comments, is around the pre-roll offerings. and, you know, i think that's a big opportunity. we see that segment continuing to grow both from traditional pre-rolls, as well as infused. so, you know, we're focused on [technical difficulty] you know, we've got a fairly large offering moving into some of the large-format flower.
that has not been something that we've had in our portfolio throughout the last couple of years. so, we'll start to see some of that play out in q4. and, you know, shaan, as you know, that's where primarily the majority of that volume is shifting. it's certainly moving away from that 3.5-gram moving into large-format flowers.
so, i think that's also some good tailwinds for us as we think about kind of the year and then getting into 2023. i don't think that's going to stop, particularly given the oversupply in the market. and i think, look, i think there's the last component i'd say is as we think about, you know, our recent acquisition of zenabis and the flexibility and optionality that provides us on low-cost flower and continuing to play in that segments as the industry kind of figures itself out with pricing, i think that's a positive. and then, you know, as zach mentioned in his comments, you know, we're excited about the pending close, the balance and through that, you know, that midstream manufacturing side, you know, that's going to further accelerate our ability to play in these white spaces that our current portfolio doesn't necessarily offer.
so, i think those are some areas there are market share that i think are really important to understand the context.
zach george -- chief executive officer
so, to add to that -- just to add, like it's important to keep this in context, right? so, we closed the alcanna transaction at the end of march. so, when you think about share of shelf inside the nova network, it started at zero. ok? so, this is not a light switch. we are going to -- we've moved very, very carefully on a sustainable basis and focused on, you know, where economic margin is.
but also, we're trying to drive the right assortment. we're also trying to optimize the performance of the retail network itself. and so, you should expect this to be a two-year process as we transition and manage the assortment and mix going forward. 
shaan mir -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
thank you. my next question is just on your views toward the u.s. operation. so, obviously, your balance sheet is a position of strength here.
and with canopy making that announcement for the kind of usa structure, it seems like there may be a door that might open up a bit for you to leverage that balance sheet in the u.s. so, just wanted to get a sense, is this something that sundial has given any thought to, particularly using a similar structure to make opportunistic plays in the u.s., or is the focus still here to remain on building that credit book there?
zach george -- chief executive officer
yeah, thanks for the question, shaan. so, as you know, our pace of deployment has slowed. so, we have seen the cycle really start to creep in maturing markets in the u.s. and so, you've seen pressure on flower prices.
i would say that we think that the cycle in canada is as much as several years ahead of what we're seeing in the u.s. so, we expect more competition and pressure in the u.s. as those markets mature. we feel quite good about our position with a half-billion-dollar credit portfolio through our sunstream venture.
and as i mentioned, i think that's going to be a pretty dynamic book. in some cases, we will very much be passive strategic suppliers of capital. or in other cases, you know, there's still a need for additional working capital and, in some cases, recapitalizations of businesses. and we're, you know, well-suited to provide leadership and help drive those processes.
so, we think 2023 is going to be quite an interesting year in terms of our existing capital footprint in the u.s.
shaan mir -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
ok. thank you for the answer there. and once again, congrats on the quarter, and i'll pass it along.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from frederico gomes of atb capital markets. please go ahead.
frederico gomes -- atb capital markets -- analyst
hi, good morning. congrats on the quarter. thanks for taking my questions. my first question is on the cannabis retail segment.
i saw that the number of spiritleaf's stores declined this quarter, and apparently, that's coming from your franchise network. so, could you comment on what's driving those store closures? now, given the current environment in retail, how are the economics looking like to spiritleaf franchisees and what are you doing to maybe improve that? thank you.
zach george -- chief executive officer
it's a great question. very cool. appreciate it. so, we've seen quite a bit of activity and change in the retail portfolio.
so, we've been actively opening doors. in certain cases, closing doors. you'll recall that, you know, a lot of the site work or franchise partner selection was done by prior leadership. and so, still working to optimize that network.
and i would expect sort of every iteration of what you would expect to happen, you know, going forward, including organic openings, closings, and growth by acquisition. so, this is really a natural process where the, you know, the portfolio needs to be pruned in a hyper-competitive environment. but overall, the network is functioning, as you would expect, given the dynamics and the difference in the pricing structure that's in the market today.
frederico gomes -- atb capital markets -- analyst
ok. thank you. and then in terms of your first international shipment this quarter to israel and now with zenabis, you know, how should we look at the potential increase in international sales there? and are you looking at other potential markets such as germany, for example?
andrew stordeur -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, thanks, frederico. it's andrew here. appreciate the question. yeah, absolutely.
i think our first transaction is -- particularly with export is always the most challenging dealer-wise. so, really pleased with our team's ability to execute that on the sndl side in q3. we just obviously closed on the zenabis acquisition on november 1st. so, it's, you know, last two weeks here, we've been kind of moving forward there, understanding further opportunities.
we look at export, as i mentioned in my commentary, as great optionality for our operations businesses. as canada kind of figures itself out, we obviously are maintaining our focus on the domestic market. we have lots of interest in our flower, both from a legacy zenabis standpoint and some existing contracts, but also moving forward as other markets and regulatory frameworks figured themselves out. in regards to what the future holds on that front and other markets, we're looking at all of them.
you know, we're going to be pretty focused on the current agreements that we have in place, fulfilling those, but we're setting up our operations to have the optionality required as more regulatory, you know, figures itself out depending on which country, and we're starting from continue to look at that. but, you know, that's still some ways away, particularly in markets like germany as we figure that out.
frederico gomes -- atb capital markets -- analyst
ok. thanks for that. i'll hop back to queue.
operator
this concludes the question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to zach george for any closing remarks.
