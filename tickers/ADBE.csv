shantanu narayen -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
thanks, mike and good afternoon. q3 was a record quarter for adobe, with strong revenue and continued growth across our entire business. we delivered $2.83 billion in revenue in q3, representing 24% year-over-year growth. gaap earnings per share for the quarter was $1.61, and non-gaap earnings per share was $2.05.
adobe's strategy to empower people to create and transform how businesses compete is fueling our continued success. the ability to deliver a personalized relationship with every customer using digital technology is a mandate for every business. internal efficiency, including a paper-to-digital revolution, is critical to achieving that imperative. in addition, design and creativity has never been more relevant. everyone has a story to tell from professional photographers, to immersive content and experience designers, to students and small business owners, and they need to tell it on an ever increasing number of canvases.
adobe is innovating to expand these market opportunities, and customers around the globe continue to count on adobe creative cloud, document cloud and experience cloud to run their businesses, transform how they work, and bring their creative ideas to life. in our digital media business, we drove strong revenue growth in both creative cloud and document cloud in q3. net new digital media annualized recurring revenue or arr was $386 million, and total digital media arr exiting q3 grew to $7.86 billion. q3 creative revenue was $1.65 billion, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. creative cloud is the creativity platform for all. through a relentless focus on innovation across different media types, devices, and segments creative cloud has become the one stop shop for creative applications and services as well as the leading source for creative inspiration, learning, training and community. our goal is to ensure that creative cloud applications and services make every creative possibility a reality for every one of our customers.
adobe's vision is that mobile devices and tablets should be used for creation in addition to consumption. adobe lightroom, our complete system for photo editing, achieved significant growth on mobile devices with q3 monthly active users growing 130% year-over-year. in q3, new adobe ids created from adobe mobile apps rose more than 40% year-over-year, showing that mobile continues to be a healthy on-ramp for subscriptions. in q3 we announced adobe fresco, a groundbreaking drawing and painting app, which will be available first on ipad later this fall. fresco digitally reimagines the process that artists have traditionally used whether it's chalk, pastels, oil, or watercolor paint. like photoshop transformed and democratized photography, we believe fresco will change how artists use digital to draw and illustrate. apple will feature fresco in hundreds of its retail stores as part of its ipad pro big draw campaign.
at adobe we believe that creative skills should be a core part of school curricula and that steam, not just stem, should be a focus in education. we've expanded our adobe ambassador network to target more than 100 colleges across the country, where students evangelize creativity and lead on-campus workshops to help fellow students learn to use adobe creative products. last week, we launched a new program with reddit to encourage young creators to contribute their personal designs to a giant, global canvas on the reddit front page. this was the biggest community event on reddit based on total contributions and participation. these types of partnerships give us an opportunity to introduce creative cloud to millions of next-generation creators. adobe max is the world's largest creativity conference. in november, we'll welcome our global creative community and partners, more than 15,000 live attendees and nearly one million virtual attendees and unveil significant new adobe creative cloud innovation.
with document cloud, we are accelerating the transformation of paper to digital processes and reinventing how people scan, edit, collaborate, sign and share digital documents. q3 document cloud revenue and net new arr were records for a quarter, and we grew total document cloud arr to $993 million. key document cloud customer wins in q3 included deutsche bank, saudi aramco, dell and the us department of veteran affairs. as with our creative products, our document cloud customers increasingly expect business processes to be seamless across desktop and mobile devices. in q3 more than 2.5 billion pdfs were opened in adobe reader on mobile devices.
adobe scan, which has become the top document scanning app for both ios and android, has close to 35 million installs, with downloads increasing more than 30% year-over-year in q3. strong uptake of our document cloud mobile applications, as well as continued strength in acrobat subscription adoption is driving momentum in the business. in addition, we launched new web-based services that offer instant access to adobe pdf creation and compression capabilities from any browser. we believe these services are not only relevant to individuals looking to quickly get work done, but also developers who need to build best-in-class pdf document support into their web applications. we are investing in creative marketing campaigns to drive awareness of these capabilities and target new users.
adobe sign, our leading cloud-based electronic signature solution, continues to gain traction among businesses and organizations. this quarter we introduced adobe sign for small business, providing small and mid-market businesses enterprise level e-signature capabilities. in our digital experience business, we achieved experience cloud revenue of $821 million for the quarter, which represents 34% year-over-year growth. our vision is to help every business become an experience business. this means enabling them to deliver engaging experiences that anticipate and meet the needs of their customers at every stage of their journey, from acquisition to purchase and renewal. we believe customer experience management is a significant growth opportunity for adobe. experience cloud is the industry's most comprehensive offering providing content and commerce, customer journey management, and customer data and insights to power experience-driven businesses across all industries. in q3, experience cloud was named a leader in seven gartner magic quadrant and forrester wave reports. key experience cloud wins in q3 included delta airlines, t-mobile, capital one, and best western.
we are the undisputed leader in this large and growing market, and we continue to expand the opportunity in front of us, extending our footprint from b2c to b2b, from enterprise to mid-market, and from the cmo to the cio, cto, and ceo. content and commerce are the foundation for every digital business. we continue to drive strong performance with adobe experience manager for multi-channel experience delivery. through integration with magento commerce, we are making every experience shoppable. this has led to strong performance of our integrated content and commerce offering, and magento commerce bookings growth of more than 40% year-over-year in q3. multi-channel campaign management is another differentiated pillar of the adobe experience cloud. the integration of marketo with adobe campaign gives adobe the industry's strongest offering in the customer journey management and orchestration space across both b2b and b2c.
earlier this year we introduced adobe experience platform, the industry's first real-time platform for customer experience management. adobe experience platform will solve a critical challenge every enterprise is facing, how to harness massive amounts of valuable customer data that is siloed and not easily accessible or actionable. adobe experience platform stitches together data from across the enterprise creating real-time unified customer profiles, enabling the activation and delivery of hyper-personalized experiences. by combining adobe experience platform with adobe analytics, adobe audience manager and our new real-time customer data platform, or cdp, we are creating a new, comprehensive customer data and insights offering for the digital enterprise that is unmatched. adobe experience platform has been several years in the making and we've seen tremendous enthusiasm from customers for this solution with multiple pilot deployments already in market. we continue to be the leader in customer experience management, which has a tam of more than $70 billion by 2021. while we experienced some bookings delays in q3, our robust product roadmap and customer pipeline positions us for multiple years of strong growth.
at adobe, we continue to invest in our employees, who are the heart and soul of our company. last week at our annual adobe for all summit, we reaffirmed global gender pay parity for our workforce, and shared new details and data on our opportunity parity initiative, which examines fairness in promotion rates and access to new opportunities for our employees. adobe is the leader in several large and growing categories creativity, digital documents and customer experience management. we remain excited about the opportunities in front of us and confident in our ability to drive strong top line and bottom line growth. john?
john murphy -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thanks, shantanu. in q3 fy '19, adobe achieved record revenue of $2.83 billion, which represents 24% year-over-year growth. gaap diluted earnings per share in q3 was $1.61 and non-gaap diluted earnings per share was $2.05. business and financial highlights in q3 included record digital media revenue of $1.96 billion, including record creative revenue of $1.65 billion and record adobe document cloud revenue of $307 million; strong net new digital media arr of $386 million; record digital experience revenue of $821 million; remaining performance obligation or rpo, grew to $8.77 billion; cash flow from operations of $922 million; repurchasing 2.6 million shares of our stock; and approximately 92% of our revenue in q3 was from recurring sources.
in our digital media segment, we achieved record revenue with 22% year-over-year growth. the addition of $386 million net new digital media arr during the quarter grew the total to $7.86 billion. within digital media, we achieved another strong quarter with our creative business. creative revenue grew 22% year-over-year in q3 and we increased creative arr by $314 million. strong acquisition, upsell and retention of creative cloud subscriptions continued during q3 and were driven by new user growth, helped by many global initiatives to generate demand, including targeted campaigns and promotions, a large funnel of users coming from desktop and mobile; and leveraging adobe's brand and new products to expand into adjacent creative categories; increasing adoption of single app offerings, including adobe premiere pro for video and adobe illustrator for artwork; continued growth in international markets, including greater than 40% year-over-year unit growth in key emerging markets; ongoing success in the enterprise, including new logos, seat expansion and services adoption which drives higher contract value; and adoption of creative services including adobe stock, where revenue grew greater than 30% year-over-year.
our momentum with document cloud accelerated in q3. we achieved document cloud revenue of $307 million, which represents 24% year-over-year growth, and we added a record $72 million of net new document cloud arr during the quarter. strong document cloud performance during q3 was driven by subscription demand across key routes to market with individuals, small and mid-market businesses, and large enterprises. the continued migration of acrobat perpetual customers to subscriptions, enterprise services adoption and the conversion of free mobile reader users to paid subscriptions. adobe sign revenue grew greater than 25% year-over-year.
in our digital experience segment, we achieved quarterly experience cloud revenue of $821 million, which represents 34% year-over-year growth. experience cloud subscription revenue was a record $679 million, growing 37% year-over-year. while we had strong overall revenue in q3, our subscription bookings growth for marketo in the mid-market did not meet our expectations, which is being addressed by increasing our focus and investment on demand generation and inside sales. in addition, there were analytics cloud subscription bookings delays with related shortfalls in consulting services bookings and revenue associated with the launch of our new adobe experience platform. we are confident the enhanced innovation in analytics cloud, the introduction of our real time cdp product, and the ongoing global roll out of the adobe experience platform will convert strong customer demand and the current pipeline into bookings starting in q4. we now expect to grow our total digital experience subscription bookings in fiscal 2019 by greater than 20% year-over-year.
from a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, fx decreased revenue by $8.5 million. we had $10.8 million in hedge gains in q3 fy '19, versus $9 million in hedge gains in q2 fy '19. thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $6.7 million. from a year-over-year currency perspective, fx decreased revenue by $38.3 million. the $10.8 million in hedge gains in q3 fy '19 versus $16.8 million in hedge gains in q3 fy '18 resulted in a net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains of $44.3 million. in q3, adobe's effective tax rate was 5% on a gaap basis and 11% on a non-gaap basis.
our trade dso was 44 days, which compares to 41 days in the year-ago quarter and 42 days last quarter. remaining performance obligation or rpo was approximately $8.77 billion exiting q3, which compares to $8.37 billion exiting q2. deferred revenue exiting q3 was $3.26 billion. our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting q3 was $3.65 billion, and cash flow from operations was $922 million in the quarter. in q3 we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares at a cost of $750 million. we currently have $5.85 billion remaining of our $8 billion repurchase authority granted in may 2018 which goes through 2021.
turning to our targets, considering second half digital experience bookings and consulting revenue, in q4 fy '19 we are targeting revenue of approximately $2.970 billion. digital media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 20%. net new digital media arr of approximately $450 million. digital experience segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 23%. net non-operating expense of approximately $20 million. tax rate of approximately 11% on a gaap and non-gaap basis. share count of approximately 490 million shares. gaap earnings per share of approximately $1.68 and non-gaap earnings per share of approximately $2.25.
we look forward to a strong finish for the year, and sharing insights with you about our strategy and opportunities at our financial analyst meeting at max. i'll now turn the call back over to mike.

we would now be happy to take your questions, and we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. operator?

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question today from keith weiss with morgan stanley.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you guys for taking the question. and very nice quarter, particularly on the digital media side of the equation. it does sound like you guys are having some sort of go-to-market and disruption impacts on the digital experience side of equation. i was hoping you could dig in a little bit further to help us explain exactly what's going on that side of the business. what does it take to fix that? because definitely something like you were much more optimistic about that business a quarter ago.
and then maybe one for john. is there any margin impact in terms of the increased investment and inside sales and some of the go-to-market stuff that is going to take to get experience cloud back up to the growth rates you guys are expecting?
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
great. keith, as you pointed out it was a strong quarter. we were pleased with the growth across the businesses. since i suspect that there'll be a couple of people asking about digital experience. let me go into a little bit more color on that particular opportunity. and let me clarify that there wasn't any impact associated with macro. the interest from enterprises, all sizes, different verticals in our comprehensive solutions remains incredibly strong. and even if you look at the targets that we've provided, it's clear that we are delivering strong revenue growth while actually accelerating the subscription bookings year-over-year on what is a much larger book of business because we do an apples-to-apples comparison.
i think as you think about q3, it's clear we have leading solutions in the first mile and the last mile. so adobe experience manager campaign and magento had strong growth. the magento acquisitions being viewed exceedingly well by customers. it's clearly very strategic and we grew the book of business greater than 40% in q3 and actually have done a really good job of taking magento into the enterprise.
the other part that we are absolutely clear about is that there is a new generation of enterprise software that's going to emerge, which will be required to digitally engage with customers across all these multiple channels. what it has to do is deliver first mile content experiences. that's the content and commerce fees. it has to segment audiences now in real time across multiple channels. you have to do customer journey management and orchestration and you have to provide data and insights to enable these ai services. we've been focused on this opportunity, just like we created the digital marketing category. we believe this is absolutely crucial for the experience business and so we build the adobe experience platform from scratch to deliver. what we call dome [phonetic] in terms of how we run our own digital business. customers are really excited. it's the first software actually that exist that's designed to specifically integrate the needs of the cmo, the chief revenue officer, and the cio.
so our strategy with the adobe experience platform is that we want to actually augment the analytics capability, the audience manager capability with what we are doing with these new services as well as the real-time cdp in the market. we're really excited about the multiple installations that we have as well as the interest globally. you know you can argue we were maybe a tad aggressive keith, about the timing adoption, but this phase shift that we've seen in no way diminishes the magnitude of the opportunity or my belief in the lead that we have. and so as i think about the business, as we think about the targets, we are leading in this particular category we saw as i said some delays in the bookings, but that has in no way changed our excitement and optimism about the business. so hopefully that helps to give you some color associated with each of the businesses.
the last thing i would say is that we talked about marketo specifically, and there i would say our natural inclination was to perhaps focus our aspirations on the enterprise business, serve our existing customers that's going well. mid-market continues to be a huge growth opportunity. we have the leading product in that space and much like we drove growth in the magento business, our focus will now be the same on magento as well as marketo. and so we've created a unified organization it's going to drive a line demand generation, customer support. we have the right individuals in the field, it's organized the right way. so i'm excited about that as well. i know i was a little long, but i thought i'd just give you color associated with all of those businesses and again the adobe experience platform that is really our platform that deals with future of what we are doing around analytic services, what we are doing around campaigns services. and so when bookings are light you certainly see some impact on consulting as well.
john murphy -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
and keith this tends to your question on investments. you know they've been factored into the targets that we issued for q4. and as you can see in those targets, we continue to expand our operating margin as we had expected through the year, as we said the second half would accelerate expansion. so the investments are embedded in those targets. and as shantanu said, we're focused on really driving the mid-market motion like we did with magento.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
excellent. thank you guys.
operator
next we'll hear from kirk materne with evercore isi.
kirk materne -- evercore partners -- analyst
thanks very much. maybe i'll flip over to the digital media side of the business, which also had a really strong quarter. shantanu, maybe [indecipherable] stood out to me was actually some of the subs growth in the emerging markets. and can you just provide a little bit more detail on that sort of -- how do you feel like you're monetizing those opportunities? how that's coming along? and maybe just talk a little bit about the opportunity maybe internationally, because i know that you are just taking off right now. thanks.
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
sure krik. and yeah, when we look at digital media arr both across the creative as well as the document business, we just continue to see strength. if you look at our targets for the combined year, i mean it's clear that driving approximately $1.6 billion of net new digital media arr creativity and design have never been important. a couple of points. the first is mobile. what we've been doing with the mobile applications and having mobile be an on-ramp, especially in international as well as key emerging markets. what we've seen with the lightroom system that we've developed, photography is such a universal phenomenon and lightroom is a great product.
so we're driving adoption across a couple of dimensions. the first is the number of people who come in from mobile and only buy a mobile subscription through an app store. the people who come in through mobile, but then realize that there is more to adobe's creative offerings and then come in and download a desktop application as well as then adopt it. we're seeing significant growth for document cloud also in these international markets as they are migrating from the perpetual version of the product as well as engaging on the web. this is something that we started to talk about, which is people just coming from a web, they want to create a pdf. they want to export pdf that seeing traction.
so -- and frankly, stock. we actually did some really interesting work with stock. stock was primarily a us product, but as you have more international content, as you have the search capabilities available. so the services revenue is also increasing. so you know just across the board as we talk about new customer acquisition, as we talk about focus on engagement, mobile certainly as momentum and services like adobe stock, both in the us as well as international.
and the last thing i'd say is that the ddom that we have really gives us insight into what's effective in those markets. so rather than have a one size fits all, where we spend our money digitally, how we engage with our customers, how do we price the products appropriately, china is again seeing really good growth as it relates to our team offering in creative cloud. and so across the board, it just reflects creativity is important and we're the leader.
kirk materne -- evercore partners -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from brent thill with jefferies.
brent thill -- jefferies -- analyst
great. shantanu, just back on the digital experience business. if you plug in your fourth quarter guide, you're going to come in a few points below your full-year guide. and i'm just curious, i think the marketo mid-market and some of your explanations makes sense, but this has been something historically that's been fairly inconsistent. i guess the question is how do you get back to more consistency in making numbers in this business. and if you could just comment, as it relates to your [indecipherable] taking so long to get some of the seat for the new role. thank you.
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
well a couple of questions in there brent. and the first one is, i would say, as i pointed out at the beginning, we are growing our subscription book of business, which is a much larger subscription book of business, greater in 2019 than we did in 2018. so i think putting that in perspective, i would say, clearly with the mid-market our motion was perhaps a lot more in the enterprise, we saw tremendous success with magento in the enterprise and creating a demand generation machine. i think having that aligned the organization, part of what i've done is i've been running this business is to align all of them quicker. i wish i'd done it even earlier in terms of having a combined magento and marketo mid-market offering because that demand generation is a machine. so i'm confident that we will see improvements as a result of those organizational changes.
and the adobe experience platform, when you look at it brent, nobody as delivered something like this. it is so innovative, we talk about it being groundbreaking, and much like we did with digital marketing, which is when we first came out. we were decades ahead of the competition we feel excited about that. customer interest is high. there is an ongoing on-ramp and maybe we were tad aggressive, but when you're the leader and you're driving such innovation we have to be optimistic about what we are doing for customers and we experience firsthand what it takes. so we're confident that we will continue to grow that business the way we have.
and as it relates to the organization. i think i mentioned this last time as well. i intentionally put that on hold, because i needed to get all of those organization aligned. the product road map, the innovation road map that exist right now brent, is stronger than it's ever been. as a result, i think of our various helped over the last six months. what we are doing with delivering new services, the ai and intelligence services that are available, the delivery of the adobe experience platform, what we've done with content and commerce. aligning that and getting that unified that is clearly the sweet spot of where abhay is helping and where i've focused. and i think that would not have happened without somebody doing that directly. and so i'm actually pleased that i did it and aligned the organization first. so it's in great shape for somebody when they come in.
brent thill -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from jennifer lowe with ubs.
jennifer lowe -- ubs -- analyst
great, thank you. and maybe just to follow up on brent's question a little bit, because there was a number of different -- different items that came up there both in terms of getting greater product alignment in terms of marketo and magento and also organizational alignment. so is it possible, just sort of at a high level, give us a sense of how much of this is a product-related issue of just trying to get the products working together versus just organizational? and as you think about how long this will take to kind of get back to where you'd like to be, is that something that could happen in a quarter or two or could this be a more extended timeline to get all the things working the way you want them to?
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
so jennifer again multiple questions there. first let me end with that which is in q4, we expect substantial increase in quarter-over-quarter bookings in that particular business. so let me start off by that. i think when you introduce and upgrade to the analytics, which is now available through the adobe experience platform, the customer adoption has been good. it doesn't have to do with the product issue. the product is years ahead of the competition, as i said. it's a new motion, i mean what we went through as we went through our digital transformation, people have to get ready for that adoption and we are seeing that right now we're seeing the on-ramp. so i would put that less as any product issue, definitely not a customer demand issue. and it's just one of those things that you work through and you work through aggressively to ensure that customers get the value that they want. and again in q4, we expect a substantial increase in quarter-over-quarter bookings based on the pipeline and based on what we would do.
jennifer lowe -- ubs -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
next we'll hear from mark moerdler with bernstein research.
mark moerdler -- sanford c. bernstein & co. -- analyst
thank you and congrats on the quarter also. this quarter even with the integration work in sales expansion driven by marketo and magento acquisitions, you delivered a really good operating margins. given what you're looking it sounds like you're going to do in terms of the increased mid-market focus in other areas. is there any reason why we shouldn't continue to see that margin continue to move up? thank you.
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
well, mark if you look at our sort of guidance for q4 and look at what the operating margin guidance would be, on the revenue that we outlined and gaap and non-gaap eps. it's clear that we are continuing to focus on the margin as well. and i think at the beginning of the year, we had said you would start to see margins back in the 40%, that's certainly there. however, big picture, i would say we're really focused on the long-term opportunity and continuing to drive top line growth, but the margins and the leverage in the model, you saw that in q3 as well across the business. and you are right in that the mid-market motions more marketing and generated by demand through the website and less through a direct sales. so that would be better margins than perhaps an enterprise business.
mark moerdler -- sanford c. bernstein & co. -- analyst
perfect. thank you, i appreciate
operator
jay vleeschhouwer with griffin securities has our next question.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
thank you. good evening. shantanu, i'd like to ask a sequel to the technology question i asked a quarter ago, although without the plethora of three letter acronyms that we talked about at the time and still have a little bit intend to understand how you're thinking about your technology or platform as a driver to content velocity usage and ultimately retention.
so the question tonight is about aem. next year is the 10th anniversary of the day acquisition. and best we can tell, you've quintupled or more the revenue from that product. so perhaps you could just talk about how you're thinking about the ongoing momentum in aem, any fundamental investments or architecture you work, you need to do or are doing in aem to continue to drive that as the focal point of dx? and then just a quick clarification. in terms of the fixes that you talked about at least for the mid-market, in dx are you planning to accelerate or implement any more of the self-service capabilities that we've talked about there besides the inside sales and other things you talked about tonight?
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
so let me answer the second question first jay, which is certainly both the magento and marketo. we have both sales of capabilities as well as a ecosystem of partners. as you know with magento having the open source community help us, not just with bringing us leads, but also helping integrate with any point of sale or inventory or supply chain systems. it's a huge advantage and i think we're leveraging that. and also as it relates to magento, we've already integrated that with our aem.
on aem, content just continues to be a significant, significant differentiator and i referred to it earlier as the first mile experience that every customer has with the digital enterprise, some really exciting things under way there. as you know, when we acquired day software that was a perpetual business. i think we effectively transitioned it to be managed services business. we have some really exciting plans under way that we're starting to deliver to customers as it relates to fully satisfying that and making that even more self-serve in terms of people using that technology. when you think about what's happening with what's called headless content management, that's area of significant investment for us. so that people can automate their content production.
aem assets, which is the assets product, there is a lot of excitement for that for content velocity as you pointed out. we talk a little bit less about aem forms, but aem forms also is a way in which people want to use aem technology. so aem has really become a platform, it your web infrastructure. what's really exciting for us is there isn't a digital event that happens, whether its debates, companies introducing product launches, sports events that aren't completely run sort of on adobe technology and that's really exciting to see when we see these spikes in our traffic we know what's happening on -- in virtually every online event an aem is at the core of that.
aem had a strong quarter. it continues to be a way in which people are replatforming their web and so stay tuned for more, but hopefully that gives you a glimpse of some of the things that we're doing. the move to saas, the move toward headless content and asset management are maybe three of the ones i'd identify.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
thanks shantanu.

our next question will come from heather bellini with goldman sachs.
heather bellini -- goldman, sachs & co. -- analyst
great, thank you. i just wanted to go back to a couple of questions that were asked previously. one, just thinking through the digital experience and some of the comments you made, can you give us a sense, is it -- is there anything to do from a competitive standpoint here? is it really all go to market and i'm just wondering kind of who you're seeing most frequently, and if that's changed.
and then i think to jim's [phonetic] question, kind of talking about margins. i was wondering if you could speak a little bit about opex growth. and based on your comments and your guide for the -- for q4 and as such the full year, when we think about your comment about investing for growth and margins, how should we be thinking about the pace of opex growth going forward? i mean you guys have been 20% or higher for the last few years, obviously there's m&a included in that, but should we be expecting just given the opportunities that are ahead of you kind of similar type growth rates as we start to think about the periods ahead? thank you.
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
sure. so let me answer the first question. while there may be some point solutions that have point competitors or products that aren't there in the market that do similar technology. for the vast majority of what we offer in digital experience, we're the undisputed leaders and really as we talk about the innovation for new things like adobe experience platform, the real-time cdp what we are doing with intelligent services, heather -- there really isn't anybody else who is offering capability similar to what we have in the market.
i think as it relates to m&a, if that was the question, there is nothing major that we look at and feel like is gap currently in our portfolio. i think you know the combination of magento and marketo and what we've done with the adobe experience platform that gives us without a doubt the leading platform and significant portfolio to continue to drive growth. i think what we are doing on the document side with the verbs [phonetic] and having the ability for people to embed pdfs, so think of it as a pdf service. we're pretty excited about the opportunity associated with that and we talk about creative.
so hopefully that gives you a flavor as we talk about the $100 billion addressable market that's really driving our growth at this point.
heather bellini -- goldman, sachs & co. -- analyst
and then the question on opex rate, opex growth.
john murphy -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yeah, well on all expense really, i mean i think when we look at margins in general where our goal is to continue to invest in top line growth, but then obviously drive efficiency is both and how we look at our cogs and how we're looking at the rest of the p&l. and so you see that here in q3, we're able to -- very through a lot of like relentless fiscal discipline contributed to the lower opex in q3 than probably was modeled and that came through obviously in the eps performance. and you'll see that again in q4 as we model that out, you see the operating margin expand again in q4 based upon our target. so we're diligently focused on that from time to time like we did with the acquisitions. we found opportunities to invest in growth and we'll do that, but the idea is to really always focus on growing our earnings as fast, if not faster than revenue.
heather bellini -- goldman, sachs & co. -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
our next question will come from saket kalia with barclays capital.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
hi guys, thanks for taking my question here. john, maybe for you, and i apologize for the background noise, adobe continues to do a good job on generating new creative arr and so as you think about next year understanding that we aren't giving guidance yet, can you just talk about some of the puts and takes to how arr may look next year, particularly with some of the benefit of pricing that we got in fiscal '19?
john murphy -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
when i look at arr more philosophically, because obviously we have analyst day coming up where we'll actually talk a lot about next year, we've laid out many, many times the different drivers that we have and shantanu covered a number of them when he talked about that earlier to the earlier question. so we have international markets, we've got new products, we've got single apps and mobile on-ramp that are really driving new users to the platform and that's one of our biggest growth areas and that's still a focus for us. we have -- i think other folks have asked about promotions before as well and we use those and we've seen through ddom model that they're very effective in driving new users and then converting those to paid users. so overall, we've got a number of vectors that we believe we can continue to grow arr in the future and beyond.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
very helpful, thank you.
operator
alex zukin with rbc capital markets has our next question.
alex zukin -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. so maybe just the first one about the -- if it's possible to unpack kind of where the greater magnitude of the bookings -- kind of headwinds came from, whether it was more the mid-market marketo side or whether it was the analytic side? and then just maybe one for john, about the cash flow out performance in the quarter, it was bit below our numbers. was there -- were there any one-time issues there that should self-correct?
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
alex, as it relates to the bookings i would in order of sort of priority first talk about the analytics as it's moving to the adobe experience manager. so the combination of analytics and audience manager sort of moving to experience platform with the real-time cdp and then to a lesser extent the marketo mid-market. so that's sort of how i would look at it as people are transitioning and upgrading to the adobe experience platform.
john murphy -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
and on cash flow, we're actually pretty happy with the performance, but we did have some one-times in the quarter. we ended up taking advantage of some favorable vendor pricing by doing a couple of large prepayments and then also we had some timing of some tax payments in the quarter as well. so those impacted that, but excluding those items we have been well above $1 billion in the quarter.
alex zukin -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
perfect. thank you guys.
operator
next we'll hear from sterling auty with jp morgan.
sterling auty -- jp morgan -- analyst
thanks. hi guys. you mentioned the softness in the marketo bookings was specifically mid-market, can you give us a sense of what percentage of that business is usually targeted toward mid-market? and is there a different kind of product set or requirement than what you're currently offering that you think you need to deliver to get it back on track?
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
no, sterling. i think first to put it in perspective, we saw growth. we are talking about the acceleration in mid-market the way we did it for magento in terms of sort of growing it across the enterprise. and so i think it's really all about having the demand generation machine, which is easier to fix in terms of getting that sort of motion going again in the company.
and in terms of it being self-serve, i mean the product is actually applicable already across the mid-market and enterprise. so there no product issues there, it really has been, as i said, the natural inclination was to go in the enterprise. and so, continuing to accelerate the mid-market in addition to enterprise, like we are focusing on magento and having that as an aligned organization so we can leverage our marketing is the two changes we've made.
sterling auty -- jp morgan -- analyst
and the general split, enterprise versus mid-market in that business?
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
we have such good market share across both of those segments as the leading b2b segment, it really is well penetrated across both if there is any -- this -- probably more penetration in the mid-market and the smaller size of the large enterprises than the large enterprise. sterling, if i were to give you some color on the current penetration within the enterprise.
sterling auty -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
our next question will come from kash rangan with bank of america merrill lynch.
kash rangan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
all right, thank you very much. shantanu, i just want to clarify, generally when you put out a new newly integrated platform, the enterprise market is the one that's a little bit more demanding. so they are the ones that are likely to delay purchasing, but here it appears that it's more in the mid-market side. so i'm just curious to get a little bit more color what else could do you need to see in the product by which the customer base can move forward with confidence, and i've got to believe that just based on the new guidance for q4 that we're not expecting a snap back in marketing or what used to be called marketing cloud bookings. so therefore should we expect whatever you expected for this year to actually happen next year while not being specific about growth rate? thank you so much.
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
so kash, first with respect to the bookings, let me again reiterate what we said in the prepared remarks, which is we would expect the overall subscription book of business for all of the experience cloud across mid-market, across enterprise and across all solutions to be greater than 20%. so i wanted to make sure that that was understood despite what we saw in q3.
i think as it relates to your first question, the integrated platform that is really aimed more at the enterprise and that's the natural migration of analytics and audience manager customers. i think the mid-market is specifically as it relates to marketo. so i just wanted to clarify that and so there are no issues with respect to adoption in the enterprise, if anything as i said we were maybe a tad aggressive with how quickly they would adopt it. but we do expect to see substantial bookings in q4 quarter-over-quarter.
kash rangan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. and the outlook for this combined newly integrated platform going into next year, what are the things that you could do our customers can do that they could not too with the previous product. just trying to understand qualitatively how this changes things for adobe, that's it. congrats.
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
well, you know i think what we've been through kash with our own move to digital, the ability to have a real-time platform where you can actually activate what happens to customers across multiple channels it doesn't exist. i mean the first generation of dealing with the customers is a record in a database, that is completely inadequate in terms of how people can engage with customers. so this is absolutely groundbreaking in terms of what can be done. so think of it as how many times have you gone to a website, you've bought a product, and then the ad for that product continues to dog you for weeks and maybe sometimes to add insult to injury, it actually says there is a discount now available for that product.
that's sort of the thing that we're addressing or when you call into customer support and you've done something in a retail store or you've done something online and it has no idea about who you are and what you did. so i think this real-time cdp, the other massive movement that you know is happening is between known and unknown and the movement toward that with browsers. so we're the first to convert what was our leading position with dmp or data management into real-time cdp or a customer data platforms.
so this is the ability to have one single unified view of customer across multiple channels, understand how you acquired them, understand how you engage with them. so that's really what i think is an imperative for every company during digital transformation. so that's our opportunity and our lead.
kash rangan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
exciting. thank you so much. best wishes.
mike saviage -- vice president of investor relations
operator, we're coming up on the top of the hour. maybe we'll take two more questions, please.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from walter pritchard with citi.
walter h. pritchard -- citi -- analyst
hi, thanks. sorry for the background noise here. john, just a question for you on pricing as a driver. i've noticed in the past what you've outlined and in this quarter you've outlined the different -- some of the different drivers in the script. and i didn't see pricing there, i'm wondering sort of how pricing in both the expiration [phonetic] of promotional pricing as well as some of the pricing actions you've taken over the last 18 months are faring as drivers of the creative business compared to what you've seen in our recent quarters? thanks.
john murphy -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
sure walter. pricing is certainly is a lever, it's not one that we have ever used really as a driver for an annual price increase to increase arr for instance. one of the things that we look at is with the value that we're providing to the customers and when we provide the value and we see that value resonate with customers then we price it accordingly. what we saw this year of course was the price increase that we did i should say last year for north america and then this year internationally in australia and japan, we've seen those price increases be well accepted. we've customers who have stayed on the platform and the value was resonating. so it's something that we'll look at, it's not a core driver, but something that is one of the many levers that we can use to grow.
walter h. pritchard -- citi -- analyst
great. thanks, john.
john murphy -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
you bet.
operator
our final question will come from chris eberle with nomura instinet.
christopher eberle -- nomura instinet -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for taking the call. just wanted to touch on advertising really quickly. we had noticed that in back in august, google had shut out adobe dsp from their ad exchange. can you talk about if that had any effect at all or maybe just kind of remind us the size of that business now and if its material at all? thanks.
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
so the easy answer to that is it really had no impact. that was a one day in one part of europe as a result of a customer who used it inappropriately and we were back up and running. so that really had no issue. i mean the advertising business for us is an important part of the experience cloud business. it allows the cmos to have real attribution associated with their marketing spend, it helps with customer acquisition as the on-ramp to a digital business. so it plays a strategic role and we have good offering and that it cuts across all of the different channels that people are looking to acquire customers on namely, tv, search, display and video. so i think in particular where we are strongest right now is certainly in helping people with the new media types such as video and tv. so that's it as it relates to the ad business.
i mean given that was the last question, i continue to believe that adobe is not just driving, but we are creating large market opportunities. we were pleased with our fiscal performance in q3. and i'm particularly pleased with the product road map and innovation that we're delivering across all three clouds to what is increasingly an incredibly diverse set of customers. our strategy empowering people to create and helping businesses transform is certainly working and we are executing against that strategy. design and creativity have never been more important, you've seen the strength in both the creative as well as the document business. and digital transformation and digitization continues to be an incredible opportunity. clearly fy '19 will be another record year with strong cash flow and margin expansion. and as a plug, i'm particularly excited about the innovation that we're going to showcase at max, is going to be our largest creative event and i hope to see you join us in la for both max as well as our fa meeting. thank you for joining us today.

2021-Q3,ADBE,2021-09-21 17:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good day, and welcome to the q3 fy '21 adobe earnings conference call. today's call is being recorded.
at this time, i turn the conference over to jonathan vaas, vp of investor relations. please go ahead.
jonathan vaas -- vice president of investor relations
good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. with me on the call today are shantanu narayen, adobe's president and ceo; and john murphy, executive vice president and cfo.
on this call, which is being recorded, we will discuss adobe's third quarter fiscal year 2021 financial results. you can find our q3 press release, as well as pdfs of our prepared remarks and financial results, on adobe's investor relations website.
the information discussed on this call, including our financial targets and product plans, is as of today, september 21, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainty and assumptions. actual results may differ materially from those set forth in these statements. for a discussion of these risks, you should review the factors discussed in today's press release and in adobe's sec filings.
on this call, we will discuss gaap and non-gaap financial measures. reconciliations between the two are available in our earnings release and on adobe's investor relations website.
i will now turn the call over to shantanu.
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, jonathan. good afternoon. i hope you are all staying safe and healthy.
adobe had another outstanding quarter, as people across the globe continue to embrace new ways of storytelling, learning and customer engagement in a digital-first environment. this quarter, we delivered significant new product innovations, announced the exciting acquisition of frame.io and continued to increase customer engagement across an ever-expanding customer base. we are executing on our strategy of unleashing creativity for all, accelerating document productivity and powering digital businesses as reflected in our strong performance.
in q3, adobe achieved $3.94 billion in revenue, representing 22% year-over-year growth. gaap earnings per share for the quarter was $2.52 and non-gaap earnings per share was $3.11.
in q3, we drove record performance in our digital media business, achieving $2.87 billion in revenue, representing 23% year-over-year growth. net new digital media annualized recurring revenue or arr was $455 million, and total digital media arr exiting q3 grew to $11.67 billion.
creativity has always played a central role in the human experience. over the last year, we have all witnessed the way creativity has sustained us. we've shared photographs with loved ones on different continents, taught art classes to students at their kitchen tables and launched entirely new businesses online. building on decades of leadership, adobe continues to pave the way in core creative categories, including photography and design, while pushing the boundaries across a wide range of emerging categories such as ar and 3d.
whether it's the latest binge-worthy streaming plus series, a social media video that sparks a movement or a corporate video, creation and consumption of video is experiencing explosive growth. in august, we announced an agreement to acquire frame.io, a leading cloud-based video collaboration platform. video editing is rarely a solo activity and it's traditionally been highly inefficient. frame.io streamlines the video production process by enabling editors and key project stakeholders to seamlessly collaborate using cloud-first workflows.
the combination of our leading video editing offerings, including photoshop, premiere pro and after effects with frame.io's cloud-based review and approval functionality will radically accelerate the creative process and deliver an end-to-end video platform. the addition of frame.io creates an opportunity for adobe, in conjunction with the partner ecosystem, to expand beyond video editors to a broader set of customers, teams and enterprises. we hope to close the frame.io transaction in q4 and look forward to welcoming the team to adobe.
next month, we'll host adobe max, the world's largest creativity conference. max has always been the place to be inspired, connect with the creative community and experience the latest creative cloud innovations. our programming will feature iconic speakers, including oscar-winning writer/director/producer chloe zhao, actress tilda swinton and snl star and executive producer kenan thompson. this year's fully digital experience allows us to expand our reach and engage with
more people across our global creative community than ever before. max will be hosted on adobe's custom digital event platform, built on adobe experience cloud.
in q3, we achieved creative revenue of $2.37 billion with strong new user acquisition, engagement and renewal across all creative products and geographies, with particular strength in our creative cloud for teams offering. q3 creative cloud highlights include innovative enhancements to our photography offerings, including new services and ai-driven capabilities in lightroom; creative cloud applications now running natively on apple's new silicon m1 chip,
delivering a boost in performance; the release of adobe substance 3d collection, a suite of interoperable tools and services that support 3d creativity; partnerships such as the great untold wit netflix, enabling next-gen creators to tell their stories; and key customer wins at the department of education of the philippines, facebook, nike, rutgers university and the u.s. department of the interior.
document cloud is accelerating document productivity by powering the paper-to-digital revolution and enabling all document actions to be frictionless across web, desktop and mobile. from complex legal documents to sales contracts to employee welcome kits, documents are at the core of work. using the power of ai with adobe sensei, document cloud is automating workflows and adding new value across all document verbs.
in q3, document cloud achieved record revenue of $493 million, growing 31% year over year. driving this performance was increased unit demand for acrobat subscriptions globally and strength in the smb segment. q3 document cloud highlights include continued adoption of adobe sign in acrobat with transactions growing over 10x in the last three years, growth across acrobat web and frictionless pdf, which optimize the customer journey and capture organic search-driven demand, increased adoption and usage of mobile applications including acrobat, scan and sign, with over 100 million monthly active users, proliferation of liquid mode, an adaptive and responsive mobile experience, with over 300 million pdf files reflowed in the last year, key customer wins at daimler ag, fujifilm, micron and pwc.
businesses of every size across every category are investing in customer experience management. adobe experience cloud is powering cxm for b2b and b2c companies with applications focused on customer journey management, data insights and audiences, content and personalization, commerce and marketing workflows. adobe experience cloud empowers companies to deliver predictive, personalized, real-time digital experiences across every touch point of the customer lifecycle.
in the digital economy, companies are relying on digital presence and commerce as the dominant channels to drive business growth. according to the adobe digital economy index, u.s. consumers spent over $541 billion in e-commerce from january through august, 58% more than what we saw two years ago.
in q3, we delivered experience cloud revenue of $985 million, driven by strong performance across both subscription and professional services. q3 subscription revenue was $864 million, representing 29% year-over-year growth. as businesses reopen around the world, interest in adobe cxm solutions as an enterprise priority is resulting in increasing spend in both software and services.
q3 experience cloud highlights include product innovations, including new personalization capabilities in adobe experience cloud to help customers move from third-party cookies to first-party data strategies; workfront momentum, reflecting the need for workflow and collaboration to deliver global campaigns and growing customer interest in a pioneering marketing system of record; key partnerships in commerce with walmart to integrate their omni-channel fulfillment technologies and with paypal to offer a robust, secure and integrated payment solution for companies of all sizes; continued industry analyst recognition, including being recognized as a leader in the forrester wave: digital experience platforms and achieving the highest score of all participating vendors for current offering. adobe was also named a leader in the 2021 gartner magic quadrant for personalization engines and a leader in the gartner magic quadrant for digital commerce; strong customer adoption of adobe sensei-powered capabilities in adobe experience cloud as over 80% of customers now rely on our ai-powered capabilities to drive data insights and optimization; key customer wins at accor, the australian government, bertelsmann, capital one, cvs pharmacy, daimler ag, facebook, ford motor company, fidelity brokerage services, honeywell, real madrid and the gap.
adobe's strength has always come from our most important asset, our people. i want to thank our 25,000 plus employees for their dedication and resilience, our customers and partners for their trust as we continue to navigate a dynamic external environment.
i am proud of the continued industry recognition we receive as a great and equitable place to work. this quarter, adobe received a 100% score on the disability equality index for best places to work for disability inclusion, and we were named to people magazine's companies that care list for the fifth consecutive year.
last week, we held our adobe for all virtual conference designed to bring employees together around our shared values of diversity, equity and inclusion. as part of that event, we reaffirmed pay parity. we continue to pioneer opportunity parity to ensure that employees are offered equal career development and growth across all demographic groups.
as part of our ongoing efforts to bring in more diverse talent, adobe has established partnerships with historically black colleges and universities and hispanic-serving institutions. this new program offers a $1 million donation to schools, scholarships, internships and career readiness programs. our goal with these deep, focused partnerships is to provide opportunities for students to learn technology and creative skills.
the health and safety of our employees remain our top priority. our offices are slowly reopening to fully vaccinated employees on a voluntary basis. as we look ahead to the future of work at adobe, we will remain hybrid and flexible and continue to do what's best for our employees and our business. i'm confident that adobe's culture of innovation, category-defining products, strong brand and the unwavering dedication of our employees will drive our continued business success and a strong close to the fiscal year.
john?
john murphy -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, shantanu. our financial results feature strong growth across revenue, digital media arr, digital experience subscription revenue, rpo and eps, demonstrating the power of our category-defining offerings. in a digital-first world, adobe's market opportunity is larger than ever, and we are investing for sustained growth through product innovation and by driving awareness and demand for our products with customers of all sizes. with our data-driven operating model or ddom, we continue to leverage our experience cloud technology to create personalized experiences for our customers in real-time, driving traffic to adobe.com and app stores to acquire new customers.
as a result, in q3, adobe achieved record revenue of $3.94 billion, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. business and financial highlights included gaap diluted earnings per share of $2.52 and non-gaap diluted earnings per share of $3.11, digital media revenue of $2.87 billion, net new digital media arr of $455 million, digital experience revenue of $985 million, cash flows from operations of $1.42 billion, rpo of $12.63 billion exiting the quarter, and repurchasing approximately 1.7 million shares of our stock during the quarter.
in our digital media segment, we achieved 23% year-over-year revenue growth in q3, and we exited the quarter with $11.67 billion of digital media arr. as anticipated, with regions beginning to reopen across the globe, we saw pronounced summer seasonality in q3. this is consistent with the experience of businesses across industries, as evidenced by data from the adobe digital index, which showed that june and july marked the highest consumer travel season in two years. this correlated with lower web traffic, while individuals enjoyed their summer holidays. we do see continued recovery in the smb segment associated with the reopening.
we achieved creative revenue of $2.37 billion, which represents 21% year-over-year growth, and we added $348 million of net new creative arr. our strong q3 results demonstrate continued demand for our offerings and execution, driven by our ddom insights. third quarter creative growth drivers included strong engagement, retention and renewal across all creative products and customer segments; new user acquisition for creative cloud all apps, driven by global marketing campaigns; continued recovery in the smb segment with our creative cloud for teams offering, including through our reseller channel; driving subscriptions for our flagship products, including our photography and video applications on both desktop and mobile; and adoption of our 3d and immersive applications, including adobe substance.
adobe achieved document cloud revenue of $493 million, which represents 31% year-over-year growth, and we added $107 million of net new document cloud arr in the quarter. digital documents are essential to the changing nature of work, and we saw the paper-to-digital transformation continue in q3 as document cloud remained our fastest-growing business.
third quarter document cloud growth drivers included adoption of [technical issues], driven by the increased need to collaborate in a hybrid work environment; increasing unit demand for acrobat subscriptions globally; strength in new licensing and renewal for our acrobat for teams offering in the smb segment; and continued adoption of our acrobat web and acrobat mobile offerings.
turning to our digital experience segment. in q3, we achieved revenue of $985 million, which represents 26% year-over-year growth. digital experience subscription revenue was $864 million, representing 29% year-over-year growth. we continue to see subscription revenue acceleration in digital experience, as large and midsized enterprises increase their investments in customer experience management.
business performance in digital experience during the quarter was driven by strong deal volume, including several large adobe experience platform deals; momentum in adobe commerce, with strong revenue growth and new customer acquisition; merchant services growth through new strategic partnerships; increasing adoption of our workfront and customer journey management offerings; strong customer retention, as we focus relentlessly on value realization for our customers; and demand for adobe's professional services.
operating expenses increased in q3, as we continued to make strategic investments and increase headcount. we began to reopen our facilities and return to moderate levels of business travel. the majority of our employees continue to work from home, while the return to business travel is expected to ramp slowly. and we expect to further ramp our hiring in q4.
from a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, the impact of fx net of accounting for hedging activities caused a sequential currency increase to revenue of $10 million. from a year-over-year currency perspective, the impact of fx net of accounting for hedging activities caused a currency increase to revenue of $80 million.
adobe's effective tax rate in q3 was 14.5% on a gaap basis and 16% on a non-gaap basis. the sequential reduction in our gaap tax rate is primarily due to a decrease in u.s. tax accrued on foreign earnings and tax benefits associated with share-based payments. our trade dso was 36 days, which compares to 37 days in the year-ago quarter, and 35 days last quarter. rpo grew by 22% year-over-year to $12.63 billion exiting q3, benefiting from strong enterprise licensing during the quarter.
our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting q3 was $6.16 billion. cash flows from operations in q3 were $1.42 billion, sequentially down from q2 due to increases in prepaid expenses, income tax payments and a decrease in accrued expenses. we repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $1 billion. we currently have $14.1 billion remaining of our $15 billion authority granted in december 2020, which goes through 2024.
the following q4 targets factor current macroeconomic conditions and typical year-end seasonal strength, including an expected increase in back-to-school spending and year-end enterprise licensing strength. total adobe revenue of approximately $4.07 billion. digital media segment revenue growth of approximately 20% year-over-year. net new digital media arr of approximately $550 million. digital experience segment revenue growth of approximately 22% year-over-year. digital experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 26% year-over-year. tax rate of approximately 17% on a gaap basis and 16% on a non-gaap basis. share count of approximately 480 million shares. gaap earnings per share of approximately $2.52. and non-gaap earnings per share of approximately $3.18.
given adobe's year-to-date performance and our q4 targets, we are clearly on track to exceed our updated annual targets for fiscal 2021 provided in march. with the massive opportunities across creativity, digital documents and customer experience management, we continue to invest and drive strong business results.
i will now turn the call over to the operator to take your questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we'll take our first question from alex zukin with wolfe research. please go ahead.
alex zukin -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the question. maybe just -- can we double click on the seasonality commentary in the quarter. because if we look at the beat versus guidance on kind of net new digital media arr, it looks -- yeah, at the same time, you had kind of the weakest beat, but then the strongest guide in the last three years, which kind of speaks to and confirm some of those seasonality comments that you made. can we just dive in to get a better sense of exactly what drove that for the creative cloud business and then separately, what you're seeing in the enterprise adoption, particularly around aep and on the cdp front that's driving some of the really strong guidance there?
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
happy to do that, alex. so first on your dme question, as it related to the arr, overall, we were really pleased. and i think it really speaks to the strength of our ddom and the insights that we get associated with the business. i think going into the quarter, we had expected that the consumer with a little bit more return to normalcy as what's happening in the environment. now, this may have been a little prior to the delta variant that we expected travel to increase and therefore, as a result as summer seasonality and summer holidays was really sort of a two-year time-off from what they had to do. so, as expected, we saw a little bit of less web traffic on that particular front.
the smb was a highlight for us. the smb, which was impacted a little bit more. we are continuing to see strengths associated with the smb. and to your point about the guide, i mean i think our optimism and the relevance of our products and what's happening with digital as a tailwind really leads us to guide as you pointed out to $550 million, which would be the largest ever guide that we've given for a q4. and if you take a step back, relative to the approximately $1,750 million arr guide that we had given at the beginning of the year or the $1.8 billion that we've given in march, we're going to exceed easily all of those numbers.
so as it relates to individual categories, imaging continues to do really well; video continues to do well; the acrobat business, which is reflected both in the creative cloud and the document cloud is doing well; max is going to be an exciting. so net-net, i would say that the growth prospects for that particular business and the growth drivers remain intact, but again, very much in line. and this is what we feel good about the insights that we're getting on the business. so that's to answer your question on dme. and again, remember, we have a seasonally strong quarter in q4 for dme. the enterprise deals tend to be a q4. we also see education start to ramp up in q4. so that hopefully gives you some color as to what happened in q3 and what we expect in q4.
and on the dx side, to your second question, really pleased with what we saw in the adoption of the adobe experience platform and the applications on top of that, the adobe journey optimizer, the customer journey analytics, continue to see strength. i think we're very unique and differentiated in the platform that we have the real time nature of what we are doing with personalization. and again, there, i think if -- last year there was a lot of interest in that particular digital transformation and customer experience management. i think people recognize that this needs to be an enterprise spend priority for all of the businesses, irrespective of size, which is why both in terms of the q3 performance as well as the q4 targets we continue to think that digital experience will also do well. so hopefully, that gives you color on both, alex.
alex zukin -- wolfe research -- analyst

we'll take our next question from kirk materne with evercore isi. please go ahead.
kirk materne -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi. yes, thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. shantanu, i was wondering if you could expand a little bit more on a couple of the bigger experience platform wins that you had. are these existing customers competitive? and i guess if you had to step back, what's helping you all within these kinds of larger deals? i was also impressed with 80% of your clients seem to be using some of the ai-powered capabilities, which is to be really high uptake rate or take rate. so i was just kind of curious if you expand on some of those larger experience platform deals you had this quarter. thanks.
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure, kirk. at the end of the day, i think the macro trend that everybody is finding is that a digital presence in commerce and data and insights and analytics is absolutely sort of table stakes for anybody doing business. and so, i think everybody started with a website, everybody started with the analytics, but i think where we've delivered the adobe experience platform and what we are talking about our personalization, i think that's a key differentiator. and whether you're a b2b company or a b2c company, you just have to invest in this particular business. and i think the team has done a particularly good job both of messaging in different industries. the healthcare industry, for example, continues to do well and there is more interest associated with that. the consumer businesses are starting to see a little bit of a comeback, as there is a little bit more normalcy.
and so, a lot of them we're going after existing customers, we're going after new logos and selling more, but i would say it's the strength of the experience platform, the ability to have these profiles, the behavioral data that we're collecting in real-time, the marketing message associated with telling them that they really need to focus on getting their first-party data to be an asset that they could put on their balance sheet and the nature of what's happening with digital commerce. i think all of those are trends. and then, we win the deals because of the strength of our offering and the fact that we are really pure play marketing that is significantly differentiated relative to anybody else.

we'll take our next question from gregg moskowitz with mizuho. please go ahead.
gregg moskowitz -- mizuho securities -- analyst
okay. thank you very much for taking the question. shantanu, i know that you only have three quarters of data thus far, but is workfront driving larger average deal sizes in dx? is that something that's already showing through?
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's a great question, gregg. and then maybe as i had responded to kirk as well, i should have talked about the big thing that we're hearing from our customers in that space, gregg, is they have more and more campaigns, they want to do agility of the campaigns. these are global and how do they not only have an integrated suite of products, but how do they get the workflow to be more efficient, especially as you're all working in a hybrid or working from home environment. so workfront is definitely helping us. it's helping us with existing customers. it's helping us with deal sizes. and in many ways, it's the glue both to enable if you have people, technology and processes. it's helping with the processes part. but the promise of what we've also said there in terms of this pioneering marketing system of record. that's another area for the interest. and i think this was always a great company. i think they were looking to become more general purpose. i think what anil and the team has done was [phonetic] really focusing on marketing workflows and solving it for all of the different personas. that's definitely resonating, but all of the large deals that we do, workfront is definitely a part of the interest and a part of the bill of materials associated with that.

we'll take our next question from keith weiss with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
excellent. thank you guys for taking the question and very nice quarter. and maybe digging a little bit more on the m&a side of the equation. we've definitely heard really good things about workfront getting into a lot of deals upfront. perhaps, can you characterize sort of the performance of workfront versus your expectations and kind of the contribution you're seeing in the quarter? secondarily, with frame.io, just for a clarification, is that in the forward arr guide? so is that included in the $550 million for q4? and then perhaps, more broadly just on m&a strategy, the last two big deals seem to have a common thread in terms of collaboration. is that just a sell side analyst putting together two data points and drawing the trend line, or is that sort of a particular area of focus for adobe in terms of adding to the portfolio on a go-forward basis? thank you, guys.
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
so, keith, i actually think there were three questions in that. so let me parse each one of them. first, i think as it relates to workfront, we are very clearly targeting a need that exists. and we had originally, i think, said something like workfront would do a $140 million or a $150 million in revenue for fy '21. and then, i think we've said that it's on track to significantly beat that and that continues to be the case. as we do these larger deals, keith, we don't breakout workfront. and so, that's the way we think about the business, but workfront is definitely appealing to that.
your second question, as it relates to frame.io, no, it is not in the arr guide. i mean, clearly, until we close the deal, we would not. and so, when that happens, as we said, we expect that to happen in q4. we'll certainly update you on what that happens as it relates to frame, but we're excited about that.
and your third question as it relates to collaboration as a team, it's part of what we've been talking about for a while, if you remember what we done with xd in terms of being able to do live editing. i think what we've done with the multi-surface applications, where our applications run on mobile devices or ipads or tablets as well as desktops. it's just one of those themes that people are working from different locations. people are increasingly working with people. and so, i think you know we have the ability to really provide value for our existing customers and attract new customers.
i think with frame in particular, we're excited because it expands dramatically the potential of the number of people who will become participants in the video workflow. and if they become, i hope you like the videos that we placed at the beginning of the earnings call and it's all of that stuff is being done remotely, and so, we're pleased. and as you know, we're always thoughtful, keith, about the acquisitions and making sure it's a case where we can bring significant value both to our shareholders and to our customers.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst

we'll take our next question from michael turrin with wells fargo securities. please go ahead.
michael turrin -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hey, there. good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. on margin, the year-to-date margins are now above 46%. i think you previously referenced potential for more of a second half step down there. so just how should we think about the margin profile here and other benefits you'd point to that could normalize, assuming more of a return to normal?
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
john, do you want to start, and then i can add?
john murphy -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, that would be great. yeah, you're right. the margins at 46% this quarter. we had indicated that with the more of a reopening across different regions, we would start to see our facilities come online, our business travel come back, and certainly continue our hiring ramps. with the delta variant probably slowed that down a little bit and so that contributed to margin expansion you saw in q3, but overall, it was an outstanding quarter for all of our businesses. and what we've said is the -- the long road [phonetic], the path to margin expansion is related to revenue growth, given the leverage in our model. and after the contributions from the revenue performance in the quarter continued expense savings that i just talked about, that contributed overall to the performance, but we expect those expenses to come back in a phased reentry now, maybe a little slower than we originally thought when we talk about the second half.
but that being said, when i think about our original targets in december, it implied margin expansion. we did our updated targets in q1, it was even larger margin expansion from what we saw, but we're executing against these huge market opportunities and we'll continue to do that with an eye on continued topline growth, such as areas that shantanu touched on, which is 3d and immersive adobe experience platform, sign stock [phonetic] mobile, all that.
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well said, john. and maybe the only other thing i would add is that i -- certainly, i think when you look at some of the t&e or facilities expenses, it's a little artificial in terms of what's happening on expenses, but our big position is when you have $110-plus billion addressable market, i think driving profitable growth is where we are focused on, which is why i think john also referred to, we continue to be in the market to hire talent to make sure that we can continue to address all the market opportunities that we have. and so, we're focused on driving profitable growth.

we'll take our next question from jay vleeschhouwer with griffin securities. please go ahead.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
thank you. good evening, shantanu and john. shantanu, for you first, as i'm sure you recall over the last number of years, particularly at a conference like max, we've talked about the integration in many ways the unique integration that you have between digital media and the dx business and if you recall, it's gone by a certain acronym over time. the question is, can you quantify or in some way describe the business effect of that combination, even going back to the old dps days of how this mutuality does in fact help you drive business through the integration across the two segments?
relatedly with regard to dx specifically, you'll recall that over the last number of years, the company is often refer to you're having about four dozen or so use cases that you were targeting for dx. that was a number of years ago. so perhaps you could talk about how the number of targeted use cases has increased for dx in the last number of years, particularly now with the introduction of payment services and other new capabilities.
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure, jay. first, i think as it relates to your question around the integration between the clouds, as you know, first, let's even talk about acrobat, right, because so much of the acrobat business is reflected both in creative cloud and document cloud. and so, that's one very tangible example of how we've integrated the clouds. i think taking a step back, the area that i would say is of the most interest to customers right now is what we have referred to in the past also as content velocity, which is people are creating more digital assets. they are spending more on content and how they both ensure that all of that content seamlessly is distributed, whether it's a marketing campaign, whether it's something that goes on a mobile application, whether it's something that goes on the website.
and so, i think that's the hard problem that we've been able to help facilitate for our customers, which is creating all of this content and making sure that it's -- the delivery is accelerated through marketing campaigns is an area of real integration between dme as well as dx. and where that shows up also in the revenue is the continued growth off aem and aem assets specifically, because that's where the assets are really flowing between these two solutions. so hopefully, that gives you a little bit of the flavor i think to the earlier questions that gregg and others had -- and kirk had asked. i mean, it also on the workflow, that's when people are looking at it and saying, wow, if my freelancers have created content, how is that now being reflected in the dx. so that's what i would answer your first question.
i think as it relates to the dx use cases and we should certainly do an update, it's increased very dramatically. and the ones that i would say, maybe as highlight is the b2b use cases. the number of large b2b companies that are coming to us and saying, hey, we recognize that whether it's for lead generation, whether it's for identification of customers, whether it's for even doing commerce, that's been a fairly big driver. i would say regulated industries, which is the original push around customer experience management was b2c and consumer-based companies. now, i think you're seeing way more of those workflows and use cases in regulated industries. so, that's another one that i would do.
i would say the global aspect of this, which is you have companies, whether you're an automotive company or you're a fast food company and you want to do this globally. i think that's a use case that we've seen a fairly dramatic increase, but so hopefully, that gives you one. and then, this is where the partner ecosystem candidly also is driving so much more. and so, the partner ecosystem is also building a lot of their value-added solutions on top of our horizontal platforms.
so net, i would say, it doesn't matter what business you are, what size you are, part of dx is relevant to what you need to do in order to engage with your customers.

saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
okay, great. hey guys. thanks for taking my question here. john, maybe for you, just maybe just to switch gears a bit. i was wondering if you could just talk about seasonality in the document cloud business specifically. i think the net new arr there has historically sort of been up into the right kind of through the year. i guess, the question is, are we getting to a point in that business where the seasonality could start to look a little bit more like creative, or are there any things to maybe consider for document cloud arr seasonality this quarter?
john murphy -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i think when we look -- think about the situation we've been in the pandemic and the need for more paper to digital transformation that's impacting, not just enterprises and institutions that have obviously seen great growth in, but individuals as well as they're engaging with the services that they use. as we said, i think when you look at the individual offerings that we have across creative and document cloud, we just saw a little bit lower traffic there, but that's associated with, we believe, with individuals enjoying their holidays and it's pretty indicative using our own adobe digital index data that shows that june and july were the highest travel months in two years.
so i think that seasonality is hitting it a little bit, but again, we've got such a strong presence in both institutions, educational, governments and enterprises on document cloud that we still see great growth and strength and it's demonstrated in just the continued terms of that business, which is our fastest growing business right now.

ken wong -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
great. thank you for taking my question. this one for you, shantanu. you guys have a history of bringing your professional tools down to the consumers. you had light additions, you have mobile additions. i think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned the addition of frame.io creating additional opportunities in the -- in sort of across the customer base, teams and enterprises. i guess, do you envision this as a platform that could be brought down to consumers, prosumers, or is this still mainly going to be in that professional bucket?
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
ken, it's a very important area of expansion for us. i mean i think the creative has always been a segment that looks to us to deliver mission-critical products that enable them to make a livelihood, but the halo effect of that, when you look at what we talk about at our analyst meetings and how big our communicator business already is as well as the outreach of that even into the consumer business, but stay tuned. on that front, i think as we talk about our product roadmap and the excitement that we have to fulfill this vision of creativity for all and target a broader and broader and broader set of customers with some great solutions using our artificial intelligence and sensei technology. we have some very exciting things underway that will start to be served to customers.
so very excited about that opportunity. it's a big opportunity. it's already a big business for us. i mean, when we talk about the fact that we're adding over $0.5 billion of net new arr as our expectation for q4, a significant portion of that is also going to what you would call communicators or prosumers and we're going to be delivering more and more really phenomenal products targeted at that customer segment.

we'll take our next question from kash rangan with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
kash rangan -- goldman sachs & co. -- analyst
thank you very much. congratulations, shantanu and team on a fantastic quarter. shantanu, i remember, i think it was on max 2019, we talked about video and how that could be as big of an opportunity as photos and i'm curious to get your thoughts on the total available market that is new and incremental to adobe's creative business as a result of the acquisition that you made of frame. and in particular, you used the word dramatically expands the scope of what you can do meaning collaborators in addition to content creators. can you just talk about what you meant by that? if you could just put a finer point, this does mean that the creative tam will be larger than what wall street thinks, which has always been the case for the past 10 years or so?
and secondly, not to -- not that it's a negative, but with the seasonal pattern in summer showing some sign of activity where people back [phonetic] on vacations, etc., is there at all any risk that digital transformation takes a bit of a back seat as we go shopping, not online, but go to stores. therefore, e-commerce activity might actually slow down a little bit, but the secular trends still pretty solid in terms of an adjustment or reinforce [phonetic] some adjustment or maybe not, but i just wanted to get your thoughts on that. thank you so much.
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, kash. i mean, as it relates to your first question around video, i think we've been signaling for a while that video is really one of the exciting expansion opportunities for us. and that's really played out. it's played out from the products that we have delivered. premiere and after effects continuing to be the leaders in that category. certainly, photoshop and illustrator used a lot. but if you look at what's happening with all these streaming plus services, right, i mean, there isn't a company that isn't delivering a streaming plus service. and so, i think the insatiable demand for video among consumers is only requiring more and more companies to have these streaming services and deliver more genre as it relates to video.
all of that work right now. i mean, we talked a little bit of what we are doing as our partnership with netflix as well. all of that is happening now with people in different locations through a collaborative process. so, anytime you can take a creative idea and make that happen quicker, faster to the right audience, that's only going to be incredibly valuable to our customers. and so, i think that trend is only going to continue. and so, we feel really good about what's happening in that particular space with video frame. we used to use frame a bunch in the production of our own videos, and it's been exciting, as we've talked to different people who after the acquisition of frame have come and said, hey, adobe, that's such a great product, but we think we can do more with it. so i think that gives us a lot of optimism around whether it's the script writer, whether it's the reviewer of that, whether it's a creative agency just being able to -- or all the corporate videos that's being done.
and so, certainly, i think as you add that as enterprise product as well, you can certainly get a lot more tam associated with it. we will update our tam's cash as we typically do. i think jonathan referred or will talk about how we do our q4 as well as our 2022 and we'll talk to you about tams on that front. but really excited about that. i think the external partnerships that exist for frame and how it's plugged in not just to the adobe solutions, but other solutions is also an area of strength.
and i think to your second question around shopping and online, when we look at our dx business and the success that we had in q3, i mean, a big part of that is more and more companies are certainly doing the multi-channel, omni-channel, whatever they want to call it. and i think that's only going to continue to be a driver of our digital experience solutions because today, that stable stakes. and so, we just look at it and say, whether you're shopping in store or whether you're shopping online. you need a solution that treats you like a customer that we know of.
and so, i think that's going to only be an imperative for companies. i mean, one thing we should have probably talked about also is if you look at our q3 results, i mean there were stronger than what we had said. there were a couple of non-recurring items as part of that. and some of that actually had to do with usage in commerce. and so, we are seeing that usage also ramp up. so i just wanted to get that also out there as we talk about the shopping online and shopping in the store.
and in terms of the demand for our dme solutions, we expect, as we said the seasonal q4 will be the strength and as education comes back and there is more and more end of quarter activity not just within adobe, but all companies, that's going to lead to increased demand and acceleration.

j. derrick wood -- cowen & co. -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. john, i wanted to come back to the document cloud business because it looks perhaps to me that there were some outsized strength from licensed products that may have been in lieu of revenue coming from arr products, and i think you can see this with total document cloud revenue growth actually accelerating even though total arr growth decelerated, so is that the right assessment? should we be looking at total revenue, not arr? and i guess, so, is there any reason for a mix shift toward more licensed products? and as you look into q4, given it's a big ela quarter, should we expect that to continue?
john murphy -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, no, i mean -- we'll certainly, i think you're going to see strength in ela as shantanu and i spoke about in terms of q4, we did see [phonetic] expansion in q3 as well. but we are still migrating base of customers as well. so, arr is still going to be important for us and we want to drive more arr. i think the strength in arr growth frankly over the last -- over a year really has been really impressive. it's always gone to give us this opportunity to drive subscription growth, but ela are not going to give us outsized revenue in q4. it's going to be, yeah, sizable contribution, but again, we're driving subscription, that's the strategy. and we do still have customers that by perpetual [phonetic], and so there'll be some fluctuations to that.

we'll take our next question from parker lane with stifel. please go ahead.
j. parker lane -- stifel -- analyst
yeah. hi, thanks for taking my question. shantanu, i was wondering if you could talk about the nature of creative wins in the public sector with organizations like the department of interior. what are these type of organizations historically relied upon for creative needs and how full are they embracing the features of the creative cloud versus using maybe a particular application like photoshop or a distinct set of applications? thanks.
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
to your point, i think public sector has always been an important part, but i think it's just the amount of content that people are creating is increasing. and when the amount of content that people are creating, then content management becomes an important issue, workflow becomes an important issue and standardization of the products. and one of the things we did really well is what we called our named user deployment and how? when we have these enterprise licensing agreements, we offer enterprises the ability to download and distribute within the companies and the more we do training and evangelism of the products, that leads to adoption.
so i would say there is an element of standardization, there is an element of more content. i mean even if you're a public sector company right now, i mean what you transact online is becoming dramatically greater than it's ever been, because the physical presence is seeing cut back as a result of what's happened in the pandemic. so i think all of those are macro trends that are going to continue, but we've also done a really good job of actively making sure we evangelize what the solutions are good for. we do more training within these enterprises. we allow these named user deployments, as i said, which then leads to true-ups and the ability to get them into higher bands. so i think the execution on the sales front associated with going into these enterprises, that's getting better and better.

brad sills -- bank of america securities -- analyst
great. thanks guys for taking my question here. just with your view across the broader marketing stack here with experience cloud, i'm curious what you're observing with regard to these customer 360 initiatives. are you finding customers are taking more of multi-product deals here to get that view across multiple channels here, e-commerce, marketing automation, cms, you've got workflow automation in there? are there any combinations of any of that that you're seeing trending more recently than in the past? thank you so much.
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it clearly has been a push for us, brad, in terms of what we are doing, which is how do we sell the entire suite offering. and i think every year, we give you an update on how that is actually indeed, how we are selling it. and so, from our perspective, the marketing stack -- what's completely unique about us is the data and insights that we're getting, the ability to do commerce and the digital presence. i think as it relates to customer 360, where we are unique -- and i think we're years ahead of any other large company that has space is this real-time nature of what we have delivered, it's scalable. we've got billions of profiles. and so, i think a lot of other companies are talking about how they take something that may be in a record somewhere, and do things with it. but for us, it's the activation of that data and that's where i think most people are really excited about what adobe has to offer.
and the other thing that i think has really happened as people recognize that they have to get control of their first-party data. i think a lot of interest used to exist about customer acquisition and third-party data. but i think right now, it's about, do we have even control of our first-party data, do we have control of our behavioral and what is happening on multiple channels and the fact that that can be very easily answered as it relates to what we have done with the adobe experience platform.
and last but not least, i mean, remember, we're the only company that can go in and say, hey, we have a b2b business and a b2c business and when we talk about how we are using this in terms of the playbook on adobe.com, i think that really opens up a lot of people's ideas as to how they can use this and utilize it. and so, i think the playbook that we delivered for the ddom earlier this year and how we talk about what they can do, i think that's what -- that really resonates with customers.
brad sills -- bank of america securities -- analyst

we'll take our final question from brent thill with jefferies. please go ahead.
brent thill -- jefferies -- analyst
shantanu, the dx growth accelerated from q2. can you just walk through the drivers of what you're seeing in terms of that acceleration? and maybe for john, just as it relates to seasonality with magento and commerce in the q4, anything that to keep in mind there do you just feel like this, you keep powering through these tougher comps, given the tailwinds you're seeing in that business? thanks.
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, brent, i think what really drove that revenue was both subscription as well as the services. and as you know for the services, we're again really reliant on a large partner ecosystem. but if over the last 18 months, as we've always talked about the interest is high, how they're all implementing it. and so, as they continue to implement it and as they continue to say, we need to invest in these solutions, i think that's driving it.
and i think to your point, if you take a step back, we -- i think guided to something like 19% revenue at the beginning of the year and 22% in subscriptions, we then increase that in march to 20% and 23% respectively. and we just posted 26% and 29%. and so, and if you look at it for q4 as well, as you point out with the large comps, we continue to be excited about that opportunity.
so i think this is front and center. it's an enterprise priority. and i think since people are saying, we've got to deal with this new reality, there is no time to waste in terms of implementing it. again, there were, as we said, a couple of non-recurring items. some of those had to do with usage in commerce and that actually is also indicative that may be a little bit more depends on the quarter, but it's up into the right as far as we are concerned in terms of the business opportunity and the business.

shantanu narayen -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no, go ahead. sorry, john. i didn't hear you.
john murphy -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, no problem. i was just going to just come up with the top on that -- on brent's question on seasonality related to commerce, of course, q4 is the strong commerce quarter anyway, given the holiday spending time. so, we're excited about the opportunity there as well. it's just trying to step [phonetic] us up into the right. i think we have a great momentum.
shantanu narayen -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
and overall, since that was the last question, i mean, again, i think we were really pleased with our performance in q3. we do expect a strong end of year for our business as you saw from our targets. it's clear that we're in this unique position that we have three large growth opportunities ahead of us, and we're executing well against all three of those and the innovation and the roadmap that exist across all three of those clouds just gives us continued optimism that we will serve our customers well, and we feel fortunate. i think the future of work and the fact that it's more hybrid will only continue to emphasize digital as a priority for companies of every size, and so whether that's an increase in content for personalization, whether that's more automation of digital documents and whether that's every business thing, we need to understand how to do customer experience management. i believe adobe is very uniquely positioned to drive those particular macroeconomic trends. but thank you for joining us today. we look forward to max as well as the q4 earnings call.
and with that, i will turn it back over to jonathan.
jonathan vaas -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, shantanu, and thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. as we mentioned in the press release today, we look forward to connecting with you again on thursday, december 16 for our q4 earnings and virtual financial analyst day. we will be sending out more details in the coming weeks. and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us at ir@adobe.com. i look forward to speaking with many of you soon and we appreciate your interest in adobe. this concludes the call.

operator
please welcome jonathan vaas, vice president of investor relations.
jonathan vaas -- vice president of investor relations
good morning and thanks, everyone for joining us today. i'm jonathan vaas and welcome to our financial analyst meeting. you should have a copy of the press release which we filed this morning at approximately 5:00 am pacific time, as well as a copy of our slides that we posted to the investor relations website. i'm hopeful to have an opportunity to meet with many of you in person this year. for now, i'm really pleased to be able to be here with adobe's leadership team and engage once again virtually and we have a great program for you today.
with the webcast format, the live presentation we'll be doing today will be a streamline version of the long form information that we posted to the investor relations website that has all of the information you're used to receiving from adobe. so we'll cover a portion of those slides today and then we'll go ahead and do q&a at the end. let's take a quick look at the agenda.
shantanu will kick things off with a brief welcome and then ann will present adobe's vision and strategy for the future. anil will go over our digital experience strategy and david will cover digital media strategy after that. and then dan durn, who joined in october as adobe's chief financial officer will provide a detailed financial summary as well as discussing adobe's long-term strategy. then shantanu will wrap things up sharing his vision of the long-term opportunity and we'll go to live q&a.
before we get started, as a reminder, some of the information we'll be providing includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results may differ from those statements and we encourage you to review the risk factors in our sec filings for more information. additionally, we'll be providing both gaap and non-gaap financial metrics. reconciliations between the two are available on adobe's investor relations website.
i will now pass it over to adobe's chairman and ceo, shantanu narayen.
shantanu narayen -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning and thanks, jonathan. welcome to this virtual 2022 financial analyst meeting. adobe had another outstanding year in 2021. i'm incredibly proud of the dedication and resilience of adobe's 25,000 employees all around the world in delivering breakthrough technologies for our customers. i'd like to start with a recap of the tremendous accomplishments we had across every dimension in 2021. as a product geek at heart, i take immense pride in our team driving hundreds of innovations across adobe creative cloud, document cloud and experience cloud.
earlier this week, we introduced creative cloud express to enable anyone to express their idea simply and beautifully. creative cloud express is the start of a brand new journey to introduce first time creators to adobe creative tools, while adding significant value to all of our current creative cloud subscribers. i think it marks a new chapter of creation, collaboration and sharing on the web and leverages the unique technology and capabilities of adobe's flagship products. it also builds on the collaboration capabilities we debuted at max including illustrator and photoshop on the web, creative cloud spaces and creative cloud canvas.
with the addition of frame.io, we're now incorporating review and approval functionality to deliver a powerful collaboration platform for end-to-end video collaboration and we're continuing to add magic to our flagship applications and we are enabling them to run natively on new hardware like apple's m1 chip as well as microsoft windows surface and pen. in document cloud, acrobat web now supports 21 frictionless verbs, create, export, extract and edit, for both text and images in pdf.
we've seen tremendous growth in acrobat online as people tap our powerful free browser-based document tools to handle important tasks on the fly without the need to download any software. in addition, we made outstanding progress with pdf support within both the chrome as well as edge browsers. and on the experience cloud platform, we extended our real-time customer data platform to b2b customers bringing together individual and account profiles across systems to give b2b companies a single view of their customer for the very first time. we launched adobe journey optimizer harnessing over 20 years of industry-leading email, marketing and cross-channel campaign management expertise to empower brands to design and deliver personalized experiences across the entire customer journey in a single application.
with the new acquisition of adobe workfront, we're now empowering companies to optimize business outcomes by connecting creative and marketing professionals to manage all creative workflows across the entire marketing lifecycle. in addition, we've advanced our industry leadership in key areas across our portfolio. clearly underpinning our three clouds is the magic and power of adobe sensei, our artificial intelligence and machine learning framework, a significant differentiator for adobe and an enabler to more rapid innovation.
we continued our investment in the adobe experience platform as the foundational platform for strong governance capabilities across our experience cloud business, accelerating innovations like real-time customer data platform and adobe journey optimizer on a global scale. we take our responsibility in the creative community very seriously, and as part of the content authenticity initiative, we published a draft specification as an open standard to combat online disinformation. i am amazed at the resiliency of our employees and we pioneered all new digital event experiences with adobe summit and adobe max, extending our reach and engaging millions of people around the world.
i'm also tremendously proud of the industry recognition we continue to receive for our brand, our workplace, our culture and our practices. and just to name a few examples, we were again named a top riser on interbrand's best global brands list. we're named to fortune's 100 best companies to work for for the 21st year, people magazine's company's [phonetic] companies that care list for the fifth year, fast company's brands that matter list, and i think what's more significant for a lot of investors moving forward, the dow jones sustainability index for the fifth year, and one that i'm particularly proud of, a 100% score for being the best place to work for disability inclusion.
when you look at our financial results, it puts us in a incredibly rare position in the industry. not many companies can drive the top line and bottom line growth, with an impressive margin the way we do and we powered through $15 billion in 2021 and we accomplished some significant milestones in q4, our first $1 billion digital experience revenue quarter, our first $3 billion digital media and $2 billion in cash flow, just some incredible financial statistics. dan durn, our new cfo will cover our q4 as well as our fy '21 results in greater detail. since he joined adobe in october, i've really appreciated his experience and partnership and i look forward to him sharing his perspective as well as having significant impact on adobe's growth in the decade to come.
i'm also delighted to announce that anil chakravarthy and david wadhwani have been promoted to the president of the digital experience and digital media businesses respectively. i value their leadership and contributions and they will share more color around each of our businesses. while 2021 was awesome, i'm actually most excited about what's to come for 2022 and beyond, in the over 20 years that i've been at adobe. we have this immense market opportunity. we have an incredible technology innovation roadmap and the best leadership team of any company on the planet. and i think what we've done is provided 2022 targets that demonstrate the strength of the underlying business, three incredibly large growing opportunities across our clouds, continued focus on execution based on the current economic climate. i think the one change that we all are experiencing is as the company scales beyond $15 billion, we also have to focus on fx expectations given the recent strength of the us dollar.
but as excited as i am to talk about 2022, today is really sharing about adobe's tremendous growth story and how we're going to be driving the next decade of growth, because that's really what underpins our growing over $200 billion addressable market opportunity. as you'll hear throughout the day from our leadership team, our growth is anchored across these 5 key pillars, our proven track record and our focus on creating and leading categories. the ever increasing expanding set of customers that we serve, from consumers to creative pros, to first-time creators to small and medium businesses, to the largest enterprises in the world. our ability to deliver incredible technology platforms that enable whole new classes of applications and accelerate our innovative cadence.
the important shift we continue to make from building applications to enabling new business models, apps, services, artificial intelligence and platforms that's paying dividends. and last but not least, an incredible global ecosystem of partners that spans the entire customer lifecycle, from experience creation and marketing, to delivery and ongoing support. and i think the message for you as investors is across every dimension, across every business. our aspirations are higher and we are thinking bigger. there is this incredible once-in-a-lifetime expansive opportunity in front of us and i think we're uniquely positioned to capture it.
and now to provide color on the strategy on how we're going to expand markets and categories, i would like to welcome ann lewnes who recently celebrated her 15th year at adobe, our incredible chief marketing officer, who has also taken on the additional responsibility for corporate strategy. ann?
ann lewnes -- chief marketing officer and executive vice president of corporate strategy & development
thank you, shantanu, and good morning everyone. over the past two years, we've witnessed a profound global shift to all things digital. everyone, from students to small businesses, to the largest global brands, has had to make this dramatic pivot. technology innovation, the proliferation of new devices and platforms and the increased desire and ability for anyone to create and deliver great digital experiences, have all accelerated the move to a truly digital world and there's no going back, whether it's through your phone, tablet or pc, it's easy for anyone anywhere to create, work, learn, connect, shop, unwind and launch and grow businesses.
while there continue to be massive challenges in the world, digital has also empowered us. through the democratization of creativity, the development of rich digital experiences, the ability to work and learn from home, to shop and sell products online or to connect with those you love, we are moving society forward. digital has fundamentally changed everything. according to adobe analytics, online spending during the 2021 holiday season is projected to be $200 billion and total e-commerce spending is projected to reach $1 trillion in 2022. it's clear that digital is a requirement to conducting business today.
from your favorite local restaurants to fortune 500 companies across every country and every industry, digital is powering today's businesses. companies are automating mission-critical document processes like hr and legal, to drive increased efficiency and agility. at the same time, customers now expect rich personalized digital experiences that are relevant, engaging and consistent across any device. it's well documented that digital-first businesses drive greater long-term growth and customer loyalty. at adobe, our own technology has enabled us to transform into a digital-first business.
companies like adobe are measuring every single customer interaction, to understand behavior, intent and ultimately to drive business impact. we do that by providing personalized digital experiences at scale through adobe.com across all of our digital channels and increasingly through our products. digital has not only changed the way we live and work, but also how we connect with one another. anyone can create or participate in an online community, whether it's with your family, friends, colleagues or those with whom you share interests and passions and with the emergence of the creator economy, it's possible for enterprising content creators to build both a large following and monetize their passions, products or services.
today, there are seemingly unlimited number of social platforms and ways to engage with ones' desired audience. the ease with which you can share, promote and monetize content, products and services, has enabled a whole new level of connection and commerce. we're also finding new ways to work together even when we're apart, through the proliferation of collaboration solutions like frame.io, which we acquired in q4. adobe's mission to change the world through digital experiences is more important than ever before.
the digital world runs on adobe's tools and platforms. and through our unparalleled innovation, creativity, scale and advanced data-driven operating model, we are continuing to catalyze the growth of digital. hundreds of millions of people across the globe use our products every single day and we're impacting every aspect of society. adobe continues to be uniquely positioned to lead in this next digital era.
our three industry-leading cloud offerings are mission critical across every geography and audience. with creative cloud, we're unleashing creativity for all, giving anyone anywhere the tools to express their creativity. with document cloud, we're accelerating document productivity, modernizing how people view, share and engage with documents. and with experience cloud, we're powering digital businesses of all sizes, giving them everything they need to design and deliver great customer experiences. underpinning our three clouds is the power of adobe sensei, our advanced aiml framework that enables us to deliver a steady stream of unparalleled innovation.
over the last year, we've seen the critical role that creativity has played in the world. creative cloud is empowering everyone from the high school students to the social media influencer, to the most demanding creative professional to tell their story. the creative cloud tam is projected to be approximately $63 billion in 2024. $25 billion of that tam comes from our core base of creative professionals who purchase creative cloud applications and services like adobe stock. new growth drivers in this segment includes 3d and other immersive experiences, as well as web-first collaboration tools like frame.io. $13 billion of the tam is coming from communicators, non professional creators, including small businesses, students and marketers.
as you'll hear from david, many communicators are already using creative cloud and we hope to serve even more of them with products like creative cloud express, which we just launched on monday. the remaining $7 billion of tam comes from consumers including hobbyists and social media users. the biggest growth drivers here are mobile applications, in categories like video and imaging such as adobe's photoshop express. digital documents are core to the future of work. pdfs and document workflows empower everyone from individuals to the largest enterprises to be productive anytime, anywhere. we're excited about the document cloud strategy and the large addressable market which is projected to grow to $32 billion by 2024. $10 billion of that tam is coming from knowledge workers, business professionals who typically use our core acrobat desktop subscription offerings. growth is expected to come from the expansion of digital document use cases, e-signatures and increased collaboration capabilities.
$8 billion of the tam is coming from communicators who are using acrobat web and mobile applications to create, scan and edit pdf files for both business and personal use. growth in this segment is projected to come from expanding the premium pdf base and capturing demand from new files, with offerings designed for web and mobile use cases.
finally, $14 billion of the tam is coming from enterprises who are using document services including acrobat and e-signature solutions, as well as apis that developers use to seamlessly integrate with key line of business applications. growth drivers in this segment include apis to build powerful document workflows and expanded use cases. whether it's b2b or b2c, businesses of every size across every category are investing in customer experience management.
adobe experience cloud empowers companies to deliver predictive, personalized real-time digital experiences across every phase of the customer lifecycle. our total addressable market for adobe experience cloud is estimated to be $110 billion in 2024. $33 billion of the tam is coming from the data insights and audiences category, which includes adobe experience platform, real-time cdp and adobe analytics, including our new customer journey analytics offering. future growth drivers include the increasing demand for a unified customer profile and personalization at scale.
$49 billion of tam is coming from the content and commerce category, which includes our adobe experience manager and adobe commerce offerings. the volume of content needed by businesses to engage customers across every touch point is exploding and the pace at which it must be deployed is accelerating. the need for a seamlessly integrated commerce capability is accelerating at that same pace. $18 billion of the tam is coming from the customer journeys category, which includes adobe campaign, marketo engage and our new adobe journey optimizer. growth in this segment is expected to come from the continued need for businesses to engage with their customers across an ever-increasing array of channels.
new to the tam this year is the $10 billion marketing workflow category, which includes adobe workfront acquired last year. growth here is expected to come from the increasing need for teams to efficiently plan, track and execute marketing campaigns.
adobe has always been relentlessly focused on looking around the corner, inventing new growth opportunities and successfully driving growth within our existing businesses. we have pioneered and are leading three massive categories, creativity, digital documents and customer experience management. this week, we announced creative cloud express, our exciting new unified web and mobile offering that's perfect for anyone looking to quickly and easily make and share standout content. creative cloud express is great for first-time creators and communicators, but will also provide value to our current creative cloud subscribers. it's a great example of how we continue to expand our customer base and grow our tam.
we win by creating enduring technology platforms, from sensei to the adobe experience platform, they are the foundation for product innovation and our industry-leading applications and services. since transitioning creative cloud to a subscription model 10 years ago, we have continued to innovate our business models, building applications, services and platforms, to bring value to market faster, better serve new customers and leverage new monetization models. it would be impossible to do all this alone. we have built a large ecosystem of partners from agencies to solution integrators to isvs, that customize and extend our solutions to the needs of our joint customers. we continue to see massive opportunities from creative cloud, document cloud and experience cloud. with the market tailwinds, our world-class innovation and the best employees in the world, we believe we're well positioned for our next decade of growth.
and now, i'd like to introduce anil chakravarthy, president of our digital experience business.
anil chakravarthy -- president of digital experience business
thank you, ann. hello, everyone. good to be here with you. and i look forward to sharing more on our momentum, opportunity and strategy for the digital experience business. it's really an exciting time for us as ann shared.
let me begin by discussing a couple of highlights from q4. we had strong performance across the board. our segment revenue crossed over $1 billion for the first time with 23% year-over-year growth. our subscription revenue grew to $886 million, up 27% year-over-year. and our subscription bookings in q4 we're up over 50% year-over-year. and with that, we were up over 40% year-over-year for the full year fy '21. a lot of that was powered by the success of our adobe experience platform and the native apps that run on it. it's foundational to our digital experience business.
we invested early in the platform and have a significant head start having launched the platform in 2019. our growth has accelerated. earlier this year, we disclosed that we had passed over $100 million in revenue. and at the end of q4, we surpassed $250 million in book of business. and we have seen a 300% year-over-year growth in customer count. the scale that we are operating in production is massive, over 21 trillion segment evaluations per day and our ecosystem is extremely broad, with over 300 partner integrations.
and as shantanu and ann both mentioned, we have really accelerated our innovation over the past 18 months, with new native applications and services, powered by sensei. a great example of this is major league baseball. they are leveraging digital to transform experiences for their customers, with a focus on reaching that next generation of fans and this is across all their channels, at home, on the go and in-venue in the ballpark, they are focused on personalization at scale, delivering that right experience at the right time via the right channel to all of their fans.
and it's not just major league baseball, it's clear that every business is a digital business and customer experience management is critical to business success. the changes and the tailwinds that we have seen during the pandemic are here to stay. and this has contributed to a strong momentum in our digital experience business. couple of examples here again, significant growth in average annual recurring revenue across our top 1000, 100 and 25 accounts. we have seen strong growth across all accounts greater than $1 million in arr and all of our customers are building long-term partnerships with us. as an example, the combined total contract value of our top 10 accounts is $760 million, which is three times higher than what it was at the end of fy '19.
when we think about customer experience management, it is imperative for every company today to deliver personalization at scale to millions of customers. that's how they reach and engage all the customers across the world. and it's critical for them to do that to deliver that next level digital business growth. it's all about personalized experiences that are tailored to the individuals, delivered in real time and delivered seamlessly across online and offline channels, based on first-party data and making sure that they honor customer preference and privacy.
and that's what we focus on. our strategy is battle-tested and helps companies across the world achieve personalization at scale. we offer customers the best of both worlds. integrated ai-enabled comprehensive applications delivered on a real-time cloud-scale platform. we have strong momentum with workfront, with the ability to unify marketing workflow and increase marketing agility for all customers. and we are the strategic partner for customer experience management. i hear this from customers all around the world every day. and our ecosystem of partners is expansive with over 4,000 partners as ann mentioned, across isvs, tech partners, system integrators and agencies.
this is how we make this happen for our customers, through the adobe experience cloud. we focus on four key categories, content and commerce, data insights and audiences, customer journeys and marketing workflow, all delivered on a common platform which is the adobe experience platform. we've had a strong innovation engine over the last 18 months, and that's continuing both on the application layer, as well as the platform, with ai and machine learning capabilities in the platform powered by adobe sensei. this is a huge moat for us, with the combination of a comprehensive set of applications and an integrated platform.
in closing, i am incredibly excited about the opportunity we have for the digital experience business. we have strong momentum and we are the clear leader in the customer experience management category. we have a large growth opportunity to help every company deliver personalization at scale to millions of customers around the world. and we have the best technology across our adobe experience platform and the native applications, with the ability to grow rapidly as we have shown over the last couple of years.
with that, it's my pleasure to turn it over to david to cover the digital media business. david?
david wadhwani -- president of digital media business
great. thanks, anil, and hello everyone. i've been back at adobe now for about six months and i'm really excited about what i see. as some of know, i ran the digital media business during the transition to creative cloud and while the business has certainly matured since the early days of that transition, some things haven't changed. our product teams keep delivering incredible innovation and our business continues to show strong momentum and before we dive into what i'm personally excited about for fy '22 and beyond, i want to hit on some q4 highlights.
our digital media business in the quarter delivered $571 million of net new arr in total. with that, creative cloud crossed $10 billion in arr and we saw continued strength in our creative cloud offers, while seeing outsized growth for substance, which grew 100% year-over-year, thanks to increasing demand for 3d and the emerging metaverse platforms. we also saw outsized growth in our mobile applications, which grew over 55% year-over-year. our mobile applications have now generated over 400 million mobile ids to date and has been a great source of new user acquisition for us.
on the document cloud side, we grew arr 31% for the year, ending at $1.9 billion. a bit of color behind these numbers, we now have 2.5 billion mobile and desktop devices with reader or acrobat installed on them. we're seeing explosive growth in acrobat web, where we saw monthly active users grow over 100% since last year and our strategy of integrating adobe sign and acrobat is clearly paying off for us, with 85% year-over-year growth in adobe sign transactions in acrobat. in aggregate, we ended the year with approximately $12.2 billion of arr.
and while we posted a great fy '22 -- fy '21, we have even more exciting opportunities ahead for us. let's start by talking a little bit about creative cloud. the big picture here is that we're living in a time where content and creativity and design has never been more valued, where content is fueling the global economy, where the digital consumption is exploding and where virtually every business needs a digital presence. we're living in a world where creative expression is considered a 21st century skill in education. and we're living in a world where we're seeing emerging 3d and immersive technologies like the metaverse creating demand for all new types of content. all of this continues to drive incredible tailwinds for creative cloud.
in particular though, i wanted to spend a minute on the rise of the creator economy, where we're seeing a growing number of individuals, solar printers and small business owners creating businesses from their passions and monetizing their content, their goods or their services online. the creator economy is already big with nearly 100 million small businesses on social media and with the majority of them saying, that their online presence is more important to their success than their physical presence.
now despite it being big, it continues to grow at an incredible rate with nearly 4.5 million new businesses minted in the us alone last year, which was a record. this has been a significant contributor to our success and a major contributor to the over 600 million free and paid monthly active users across our digital media products, who were not considered creative professionals. and of course, this expansive opportunity needs an expansive strategy that drives our mission for creativity for all.
in the next few minutes, i'll lay out how adobe can help anyone who wants to express themselves in creative ways. from a small business owner to the highest end production house, adobe has a solution for them because of our investment in five key areas. and since we just launched creative cloud express, i wanted to start by discussing how we empower the world with content-first task-based creativity. let's go ahead and start by looking at a video of creative cloud express and what it can do.
creative cloud express is the result of years of end-market learning from our web and mobile products and it's built on four key pillars. first, we remove all barriers to adoption. it's free to get started. it doesn't require a desktop download because it's 100% web in mobile. it doesn't have a learning curve and users can create an account and publish content in minutes.
second, it's got an unparalleled content library, so novice users can build beautiful images and social media posts, digital flyers and more in minutes. this includes 175 stock images from adobe stock, 20,000 fonts and thousands of templates and design assets and it's all powered by a universal search capability that surfaces the right content and recommendations at the right time.
third, it leverages decades of adobe's product innovation. as you'd expect, we have great workflows with our creative cloud applications, but it also includes a slew of sensei-based quick actions that make creating and editing images, videos and pdf easier than ever before.
and fourth, we understand that people create content with the intent to distribute it. so creative cloud express has integrations for single-click publishing to social media services and you can expect to see that our recent acquisition of contentcal will benefit ccx users with even more social planning and publishing capabilities in the very near future. creative cloud express is easy to use and it's easy to get started with. users can have a lot of success with the free-tier, but they are also presented with premium features and content at an affordable monthly price. ccx is also entitled with most cc existing plans, which we expect will drive higher engagement and retention in our core creative cloud customer base.
and the go-to-market motion is very familiar to us. we'll combine our digital acquisition funnels and our product led growth motion tuned for web in mobile. this gives us an opportunity to continually iterate and optimize user journeys, while ramping this business over-time. we also plan to leverage our existing footprint across education, reseller and enterprise to scale the business. we're thrilled to have creative cloud express in market today. it's been amazing to see what people can make with it and we really couldn't be more excited about this moment and what this means for a start of a whole new journey for adobe.
so moving beyond creative cloud express, we also have a lot going on across creative cloud as a whole. we're advancing the state-of-art in imaging, video and design and more, by building new capabilities across desktop, web and mobile. for example, we introduced photoshop and illustrator for web at adobe max and we released a series of new sensei-driven ai/ml capabilities, including neural filters and auto masking in photoshop and auto captioning in premiere, just to name a few.
we also continued our focus on democratizing 3d and immersive. substance 3d now supports end-to-end 3d workflows. users can design parametric 3d assets in designer; compose rendering virtual scenes in stager; add texture, color, effects in painter; and create 3d materials with sampler. this enables fully virtual photoshoot, saving companies a lot of money and a lot of time and speeds-up asset and scene creation for inclusion in games, videos and the emerging metaverse platforms.
collaboration is another big area of focus for us. we're putting into -- we're integrating collaboration directly into our apps and existing creative workflows. we're very excited about the frame.io acquisition and see tremendous opportunity across individual, corporate and media workflows with that product. we shipped a public beta of share-for-review workflows at max and we demoed spaces in canvas, which we believe will enable teams to organize their creative assets and host live working sessions.
and last but certainly not least, we continue to produce content that inspires and educates our users through services like adobe live. we help users monetize their work through services like adobe stock and we help them connect and inspire each other through services like behance, which now is closing in on almost 29 million members. these five strategic pillars work together to ensure that anyone with creative needs can find a solution at adobe, whether they are a creative professional trying to keep up with the increasing content demand or they are a communicator, participating in the creator economy or a consumer looking to up their game in photography or a student developing 21st century skills.
we use our data-driven operating model, ddom, to engage them as they express their interest online, by perhaps searching for something like compositing in photoshop or designing a twitter post. based on their intent, we then route them to one of our creative cloud apps, one of our mobile apps or one of our frictionless web quick actions. we make sure that they have early success and then we introduce them to other capabilities in creative cloud or creative cloud express before converting them to and engaging them as a paid user. this digital motion combined with our reseller partners, our direct sales teams, gives us an amazing global footprint and reach.
so in summary, everything is going digital and content is fueling the digital economy. the result is a massive and growing tam for creative cloud as ann talked about earlier, and our offerings which now include creative cloud express, continue to expand to meet market demand for both professionals and non-professionals. we couldn't be more excited about the opportunity ahead for the creative business.
and as you know, the other part of the digital media business is of course our document cloud, which is also experiencing significant tailwinds. demand for pdf has never been greater. in fact, web searches for pdf have doubled in the last decade and we believe the reason for this is that pdf has become the de facto format for unstructured data. pdf has also been the de facto standard for business to business collaboration, where nowhere is this more pronounced of course than with e-signatures. this makes pdf an essential part of modernizing any business workflow. and adobe is uniquely positioned to take advantage of this trend.
our apps are installed on over 2.5 billion devices and we've opened in our apps, we've opened or created 320 billion pdfs in the last 12 months alone. we continue to be a leading destination for pdf viewing and we saw 100 million free and paid signups over the last year. and we see that acrobat can be a gateway to related services. adobe sign transactions in acrobat as i mentioned earlier, have increased 85% year-over-year as we continue to deepen the integration between the two offers.
our strategy here is clearly working and we are investing across five key motions to make sure it continues to. first, our document verbs strategy has been very effective. we now have 21 verbs in market, everything from edit pdf to convert pdf to rotate pdf and we're seeing continued -- and we're continuing to optimize our digital acquisition and increasing our share of voice across the 80 million pdf-related searches that happen every month.
second, we're proliferating e-signatures by integrating them into acrobat across all services, desktop, web and mobile. given our early success here over the last year, you can expect to see us continue bringing these products closer together in the years ahead.
third, we remain committed to making pdf more intelligent for both interacting and reading. adobe is reinventing mobile pdf viewing with liquid mode. we're accelerating document productivity with automated form field detection and we're helping transform unstructured data to structured actionable data with our ai/ml based extract functionality.
fourth, we're unlocking business workflows through our pdf and sign apis. this empowers developers to build document automation solutions that transform how their businesses work.
and fifth, we're leveraging our diversified go-to-market motions to reach anyone with a document need. our global resellers and inside sales teams give us amazing access to a broad base of business demand. our enterprise sales team allow us to sell tops-down to cios looking to transform their business and perhaps most importantly, our digital funnel continues to drive individual users into our conversion funnels. knowledge workers, communicators, it decision makers and developers, all have frictionless on boarding pathways.
our data-driven operating model helps customers discover adobe technology when they're are searching for pdf-related verbs and we engage them in ways that provide quick success on web, mobile and desktop before upselling them to premium features products, services or apis that broaden their engagement with adobe over-time. in short, document cloud is incredibly well positioned for the years ahead.
i hope this gives you a sense of why we're excited about both the creative and document businesses. in summary, both businesses are benefiting from significant tailwinds that are underpinning their large and growing tams, both businesses are realizing the market benefits by leveraging our amazing brand awareness, our go-to-market footprint and our incredible pipeline of innovation and both businesses have the opportunity to supercharge their existing data-driven operating model by pairing it with a product led growth motion as our capabilities increasingly are accessed by users on web and mobile. so we're really excited about the year ahead.
and with that, i wanted to turn it over to dan.
dan durn -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks david. and before i jump in, i also want to thank him for letting me borrow his sweater today. let me begin by saying how thrilled i am to be here today and be a part of this amazing team at adobe. having just been here for a few months, it's obvious what a special company this is, and i couldn't be more excited about what's ahead.
now let me jump in with adobe's q4 results. adobe achieved revenue of $4.11 billion, a significant milestone which represents 20% year-over-year growth. gaap diluted eps was $2.57 and non-gaap diluted eps was $3.20. digital media segment revenue was $3.01 billion. the business' first $3 billion quarter which represents 21% year-over-year growth with net new digital media arr of $571 million. digital experience achieved its first $1 billion quarter, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. digital experience subscription revenue was $886 million, representing 27% year-over-year growth. we had record cash flows from operations of $2.05 billion in the quarter and we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of our stock.
turning to our three strategic clouds. it was a tremendous finish to the year. in q4, adobe achieved $2.48 billion in creative revenue and added $430 million of net new creative arr. we exited the year with more than $10 billion of ending creative arr with strong performance throughout the year. growth drivers in the quarter included acquisition of new users on adobe.com, strength and our teams' offering, seasonal q4 strength in the enterprise and success co-selling frame io with our creative cloud enterprise offerings. however, while we saw increased demand for offerings during the black friday and cyber monday weeks, we did not see the traditional spikes we have had in previous years. this is consistent with this year's industry trends, in line with e-commerce holiday shopping data from the adobe digital economy index.
adobe document cloud achieved $532 million in q4. revenue continues to be our fastest growing business. we added a record $141 million of net new document cloud arr in the quarter with ending arr of $1.93 billion, growing 31% year-over-year. our integrated document platform is clearly resonating with customers around the globe. we continue to see momentum with enterprises small businesses and individuals using web and mobile first tools.
in digital experience, we achieved our first $1 billion revenue quarter. we're seeing strong demand for our real-time experience platform and app services, as large enterprises are making investments in adobe to drive customer experience management and personalization at scale. we drove record q4 net subscription bookings and for the full fiscal year, we grew net asv greater than 40% year-over-year.
let's look quickly at the annual numbers. adobe's financial performance in the year was outstanding with both top line acceleration and margin expansion in the year, resulting in more than $7 billion of operating cash flow and remaining performance obligations grew 23% year-over-year to nearly $14 billion, absolutely world-class performance.
now let's discuss what a unique investment opportunity adobe is. these are some of the outstanding qualities of adobe that have energized me about the opportunity and it's what ultimately brought me here today. there is a fundamental shift toward digitization that's accelerating around the globe and i believe adobe is better positioned than any other company to capitalize on these opportunities. combining that with adobe's financial track record as well as industry defining products and platforms, the result is an immense runway ahead of this company for growth.
let me elaborate a bit more on my view of this opportunity. in the years ahead, there's going to be fundamental shifts in all aspects of our lives, all of them digitally enabled. digital enablement will increasingly shape and define how we live, how we create, how we communicate, how we collaborate, how companies serve their customers, how companies compete and how economies function. these changes are both powerful and pervasive, i call it the digitization of everything. the digitization of everything is accelerating and i believe what happens in the next 10 years is going to define the rest of the century, similar to what happened in the industrial revolution, except now digital content and data are going to be the fuel of the digital economy. this is a generational opportunity and we're talking about unlocking trillions of dollars of economic value in the global economy.
when you look at adobe's foundational strengths, there is very few companies that are as leveraged to the digitization of the global economy as well as we are. from the way people create and communicate, to the future of productivity and digital collaboration in a distributed work environment, to the digitization of businesses, driving customer engagement with data-driven insights to personalized customer experiences, but do it at massive scale to ai and machine learning, global trends toward digitization have so many intersections with adobe's unique strengths. again, digital content and data are the fuel of the digital economy and i believe no one is better positioned than adobe to be the digital enabler of the world.
how many companies on the planet have this profile, how many companies have this opportunity? not very many. when i think about our near-term strengths combined with our long-term opportunities, there is a uniqueness here that's incredibly exciting.
let's double-click on the company's financial performance and take a closer look at what i'm talking about. starting with revenue growth. you can see consistent sustained revenue growth over the last four years as the company has grown subscription revenues at a 24% cagr; that has been the strategy, continuing to grow while producing a revenue stream that's even more ratable and predictable. i'm incredibly impressed by this team's acumen what they've been able to accomplish as well as by the contribution to revenue growth from newer initiatives including adobe stock, substance 3d, acrobat web, sign, creative cloud, mobile apps and the adobe experience platform.
underlying this financial performance is an incredibly diverse business from our broad base of customers to diversified products and platforms comprehensive business models and go-to-market reach that spans across all geographies. with growing and diverse revenue streams, the company has been able to expand profitability over the last four years while accelerating the top line. adobe's disciplined execution and investment rigor has enabled the company to balance long-term investments while also focusing on profitability. this time period also includes the integration of several strategic acquisitions, magento, marketo, algorithmic, workfront, frame.io. it's impressive the way adobe has managed to combine expanded profitability with strong sustained top line growth and m&a integration.
let's talk about rpo. contractually, committed future revenues which make adobe's future performance incredibly predictable and reliable. exiting fiscal year 2021, rpo grew 23% on the strength of our enterprise bookings. rpo consists of deferred revenue and unbilled backlog with the current portion expected to flow into revenue over the next 12 months. it's also important to note that most of our adobe.com subscriptions are billed monthly and don't show-up as deferred revenue. the remaining contractual commitments of those subscriptions, which average about six months in length at any given time are included in unbilled backlog.
the cash flow performance really speaks for itself as you can see the way our operating cash flows have accelerated over the last two fiscal years. sustained growth and profitability at scale is not easy to achieve, the momentum at adobe is strong as evidenced by our first $2 billion quarter of operating cash flows. a strong capital structure with robust investment-grade credit rating positions us to continue to drive growth and provides flexibility, making access to capital affordable for adobe.
let us talk about our capital allocation strategy. first, we focus on investing in the business to drive long-term growth. given the tremendous opportunities in front of us, some of our recent innovative r&d initiatives include our next-generation data platform as well as creative cloud express, which we announced earlier this week. we're going to continue to invest in sales and marketing to scale those businesses globally. second, our cash and investment balances as well as our debt capacity enable inorganic growth opportunities, you've seen the way we've accelerated growth and made accretive strategic additions over the last fiscal year with workfront and frame.io.
lastly and importantly, we focus on returning capital to our shareholders. our stock repurchase program is funded through growth in our operating cash flows, and you can see how successful we've been in driving down the average shares outstanding over the last four years. since 2018, we've returned approximately $12 billion to shareholders through our stock repurchase program. exiting q4, we have $13.1 billion [phonetic] of remaining stock repurchase authority through the end of our fiscal 2024.
the hallmark of a great technology company is consistent innovation in category-defining products. adobe has done that across all its businesses and we'll dive into each of them next to discuss the performance drivers. first creative, the company has driven sustained arr and revenue growth which accelerated from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021. let me tell you about the underlying data-driven operating model used to drive this performance. it all starts with innovation and the most comprehensive industry-defining portfolio of products. our brilliant marketing campaigns generate awareness about adobe's offerings and drive traffic to adobe.com to engage customers to try, buy, use and renew. it's about taking creators on a journey first with simpler applications including our mobile, tablet and web applications, connecting them with vibrant creative communities and then providing journeys that empower them to do more as they advance including services like adobe stock, cloud libraries and collaboration features.
now with the addition of frame.io and creative cloud express, we're continuing to grow the business by broadening the aperture and reaching new creators and stakeholders that will power the world's content. we continue to drive strong growth for document cloud again you see this in sustained revenue growth with arr growing even faster as the business shifts to being increasingly subscription-based with approximately 90% of document cloud revenues in fy 2021 now being subscription. the main document cloud growth driver continues to be new user acquisition, we're seeing strong growth of acrobat on adobe.com across geographies, growth on the web as well as in mobile and seat expansion in the enterprise, pdf and document workflows our mission-critical to the way people work and collaborate in the digital first world.
as anil mentioned earlier, there's tremendous growth opportunity within our cohort of large customers. as we focus on cross-selling and moving them along the maturity curve toward the transformational adoption of our entire platform and set of customer experience management solutions. the average arr and total contract value of our largest customers demonstrate how massive this opportunity is and we grow by adding new logos to our customer base and then expanding within those accounts on multi-year journeys.
as impressive as this company's track record is, i believe there's even more growth ahead of us. i fundamentally believe there is a $1 trillion market cap opportunity in adobe's future. having crossed the $15 billion mark in revenue. what does the path to $30 billion look like? and then from there how we're going to get to $45 billion? it starts with an estimated $205 billion tam and a huge ecosystem that we've built around our market-leading products and services. how are we going to get there? we're going to continue to broaden our appeal to a wider universe of customers, engage and retain our current customers across all geographies. we're also going to grow by innovating and investing to enter new categories that further complement and expand our growth trajectory, better enable our customers in the digital era.
when we execute on that strategy over the next decade, our scale and success will put adobe in a class that only a few software companies have achieved. having passed the $15 billion revenue mark, we're going to start reporting revenues in constant currency given the potential impact of foreign exchange movements, following a year in which fx was a tailwind to reported revenues, the recent us dollar strength is expected to result in a headwind to our reported revenue and growth rates for fiscal year 2022. consistent with our annual practice, we've revalued our digital media arr balance to account for the movements in the fx rates.
for operating expenses, we continue to save on travel and facilities in fiscal year 2021, while many of our employees continue to work from home. we expect these expenses to ramp throughout fy 2022. we also plan to invest in increasing headcount and integrating frame.io. we believe these are critical investments we're making -- we believe these are critical investments we're making and we're going to focus relentlessly on the organic growth opportunities ahead.
lastly, fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week fiscal year with an extra week in q1, that week added approximately $267 million of revenue and $25 million of net new digital media arr. the math around the return to a 52-week fiscal year is expected to be a 2 point headwind on our full year fy '22 growth rates and a 7 point headwind in q1.
here's adobe's fiscal year 2022 annual targets. we show our segment growth targets on an actual and adjusted basis in constant currency factoring for the additional week last year. total adobe revenue of approximately $17.9 billion, net new digital media arr of approximately $1.9 billion, digital media segment revenue growth of approximately 14% year-over-year or 17% on an adjusted basis. digital experience segment revenue growth of approximately 14% year-over-year or 17% on an adjusted basis. digital experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 16% year-over-year or 19% on an adjusted basis. tax rate of approximately 17.5% on a gaap basis and 17% on a non-gaap basis. gaap earnings per share of approximately $10.25 and non-gaap earnings per share of approximately $13.70.
for q1 of fiscal 2022, we're targeting revenue of approximately $4.23 billion. net new digital media arr of approximately $400 million. digital media segment revenue growth of approximately 8% year-over-year or 17% on an adjusted basis. digital experience segment revenue growth of approximately 11% year-over-year or 18% on an adjusted basis. digital experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 13% year-over-year or 20% on an adjusted basis. tax rate of approximately 16% on a gaap basis and 17% on a non-gaap basis. gaap earnings per share of approximately $2.63 and non-gaap earnings per share of approximately $3.35.
i want to conclude by sharing what this company has achieved over the last four years. whether it's revenue growth and profitability, outstanding cash flow generation and shareholder returns, adobe's track record demonstrates why this company is in class of its own. i firmly believe that our best days are ahead.
thanks so much for your time today. i'm going to now pass it back to shantanu.
shantanu narayen -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, dan and thanks as well to ann, anil and david for outlining the opportunities across our three industry-leading clouds. as i said earlier, i'm incredibly excited about adobe's future and our ability to not only lead, but also create new categories. i think if you zoom out a little bit and think about it from a macro perspective, all over the world, it's clear that digital is empowering individuals, transforming businesses and connecting communities. and frankly, digital is going to play a much bigger role in work, life and entertainment going forward.
we've seen the rise of the creator economy and the democratization of creativity, work and education and now hybrid and here to stay in that form. cloud and web technology advances are powering unprecedented levels of real-time collaboration. document workflows are increasingly going to be automated. and most important, the mandate for a digital business is more urgent than ever before, as customers now expect digital-first experiences that are both contextual as well as personalized. e-commerce growth is building on the record highs achieved during the pandemic.
from a technology base, artificial intelligence and machine learning have become indispensable facilitators of our daily lives. and so i think in short, digital technologies are enabling more people to create, collaborate, learn, work, be productive and make a living than ever before. i love our mission and the ability to change the world through digital experiences puts us as the nexus of all of these trends. we are incredibly well positioned to drive meaningful impact across every aspect of society and that will benefit billions of people around the world for years to come.
as we think about the company, at adobe we believe it's not just what we do, but it's also how you do that it really matters. from the very beginning, john warnock and chuck geschke, our founders, committed to building a company that does the right thing and the sense of purpose has guided our evolution and growth over the past four decades. i think we are all witnessing the shift in the role that companies have to play in sort of social issues and the expectations that stakeholders and investors have for corporations. as you reflect on how companies have responded to the covid-19 pandemic, it's been remarkable. with that, stakeholders around the world are looking to the private sector to become more active in social issues and people are making decisions on the products that they buy and the places that they work, based on where companies stand.
as our products have become ubiquitous and we help many more companies harness the transformative power of our digital technologies, our responsibility and our commitment to corporate citizenship has also grown dramatically. and i believe that the issues on which adobe is uniquely positioned to make an impact, are on adobe for all, making sure we create a diverse and inclusive culture for our employees, as well as position that for our customers and partners. on the belief that technology will transform and in addition to providing technology, we have a responsibility to understand what that means. and i think most important, to being able to allow everyone who has a story to tell their story, the notion of creativity for all.
the reality is that we've been leaning into these for several areas already and our efforts on making a real impact across the company and our customer communities for many years. but i think it's this purpose that motivates our employees to focus on having more impact and frankly inventing in the future. i love the fact that our strategy has remained relatively consistent for the past decade. our strategy to unleash creativity for all, to accelerate document productivity and to power digital businesses is more mission-critical than ever before.
i think most companies would be thrilled frankly to have one of these growth opportunities. and we're fortunate that we have three businesses that are absolutely in the sweet spot of where the world needs technology to play a more important role. we have the right strategy. it's applied to an exceptional and growing opportunity and so we are no way opportunity constrained.
i'm going to end with how i started. i believe that adobe is uniquely positioned to drive the next decade of growth. we have a proven capability to create and lead categories and we're always looking around the corner, to the white space that exists, that will provide new opportunities for adobe. we're thinking bigger about every part of our business, how we scale and how we expand the customers that we serve. we continue to focus on innovation, delivering leading products, services and platforms as we leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning.
we're continuously thinking about innovating in business models as well, to rapidly deliver more value to a larger set of customers, to capitalize on global growth opportunities and to enable new monetization models that are emerging. and at the end of the day, our technology support a vibrant and growing ecosystem of partners that create, customize and extend our solutions to meet the unique needs of our joint customers. but at the end of the day, our greatest asset as being an intellectual property company and what's truly driving our growth, is our highly engaged global employee base, over 25,000 strong to whom i'm eternally grateful.
thank you again for joining us today. i believe 2021 was a fantastic year and we clearly expect that momentum to continue in 2022 and beyond. as we look forward to our 40th anniversary next year, adobe stands in an enviable position, an impressive track record of innovation, category and brand leadership, great financial performance and multiple growth opportunities. coupled with the expanding market opportunity, the depth of our technology platforms and the motivated employee base, i certainly believe that adobe's best days are ahead of us.
and with that, we'll roll a video while we assemble the management team for our q&a.
okay. are we on for q&a. great. i know we are on for q&a. before we get started, let me introduce two other members of the executive team who are also here with us to answer the questions that you might have. gloria chen, our chief human resources officer who has also run strategy in the past, as it relates to any questions that people have about the pandemic or what we are doing with our global employee base. how do we continue to make sure we ensure that we have the best talented and motivated employees. and scott belsky, our chief product officer of creative cloud, frankly the visionary behind all of the great innovation that we're delivering across desktop, mobile, collaboration, including the new web-related functionality that we showed at max, as well as what we did with creative cloud express.
and so with that, i'll turn it over to jonathan to help navigate the q&a.
jonathan vaas -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, shantanu. so we've shared a lot of information today. you can clearly see the team's enthusiasm around the growth opportunity ahead. now, we'd like to go ahead and take your questions. so for folks who are on the phone, if you haven't already done so, please go ahead and queue up for questions. quick reminder, we do ask that each of you limit yourself to just one question per person. that will allow us to get through as many people as possible.
and with that, i'd like to go to the operator. operator, can we go ahead and take the first question please.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] first question will come from saket kalia with barclays. please go ahead.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
okay, great. hey folks thanks for taking my question here and congrats anil and david on the promotion and welcome dan.
anil chakravarthy -- president of digital experience business
thank you.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
maybe the question is -- maybe to start us off, i'd love if we can address the digital media net new arr in the quarter, particularly within creative. i think dan you had mentioned that we hadn't seen spikes that maybe as high as we've historically seen around cyber monday and black friday. i was wondering if the team could just go in a little bit deeper into the results versus the guide and then maybe comment on the competitive backdrop within creative specifically?
anil chakravarthy -- president of digital experience business
why don't i start with that saket and then i'll certainly have others add. i mean as we look at the digital media arr accomplishment over the quarter, firstly, it was a record quarter as well as it was a record year. and when we think about what our digital media guide was, i mean, we certainly expected frame to close in the quarter and it closed pretty early in the quarter. and so what we do is we think about a range of outcomes and what that might do and certainly we wanted to focus on frame as well, but it was probably not explicitly factored into the quarter.
when you consider it from different customer segments. the team business actually performed really well right through the quarter. and so the teams offering and the strength in the small and medium business was great. enterprise, we actually actively redirected and pivoted the team to think about video and frame and how we were continuously selling it, as i said it closed early in the quarter and so enterprise had the traditional q4 strength as well that we normally expect.
the individual demand was actually fairly strong right through the year, as dan mentioned, maybe the one slight change is that, as you think about what's happening with online shopping, while we continues to see demand up into the right we perhaps did not see as much of the spike as you would have perhaps seen traditionally in either the black friday or the cyber monday weeks. but apart from that strength and demand continues to be strong and clearly we've factored that into our guidance for fiscal 2022, which is the strongest arr guide that we've ever guided to. i think as it relates to the product and the differentiation, maybe i'll have scott touch on that and then david can certainly speak to other issues of the business.
scott belsky -- chief product officer and executive vice president of creative cloud
sure in terms of product differentiation for creative cloud. i mean, what a year we had, we delivered some of the mind-blowing adobe magic throughout our actual pro products, neural filters and photoshop for example, a lot of the collaboration features and we really made a proclamation that creative cloud going forward will be as much about collaboration as it is about creativity, which if you think about it invites many more stakeholders of creativity into the fold. and that's what we're seeing across all of our enterprise as well as small businesses.
everyone wants to be a stakeholder and have a say and be able to jump in and give feedback, and so we're building our products for the future to enable that. i also want to mention, of course, last week we launched creative cloud express and this is just the start of an amazing new chapter for us. we've had a number of products in the market in our incubation zone we call it as we learn about how to really fulfill our mission of creativity for all. and now we've galvanizen all of the learnings, all of the signals and we just couldn't be more excited about the new journey we're on here with that product in particular.
david wadhwani -- president of digital media business
and i'm happy to add a little bit more from the business perspective as well, all the innovation that scott talked about and has been driving. one of the big things that you have to recognize is that is really what's driving the tam growth that and talked about earlier both in terms of expanding the base of people we can access with something like creative cloud express and also increasing the value that we're providing to our creative pro base. so as you start looking at where we are going with the business, we're building on the momentum as we talked about we had a to almost $2 billion of net new arr added in fy '21, we had a strongest guide ever and it's really on the back of that.
one more thing with regard to creative cloud express and how that will start to drive opportunity for us, it can start by actually adding a lot of new users to the franchise. one of the things that we've been doing a phenomenal job with and i think this expands is bringing new users to adobe getting them successful with what they're doing and then start to mature them up the value curve into creative cloud subscription or now creative cloud express subscription. but we're also making this available to all creative cloud customers. this is something that we see a lot of creative cloud customers occasionally want speed and content first development. for those user as we see the opportunity to really drive higher engagement and retention even beyond where we already are. and then as you start to have more plans that are separated for the kinds of things people want to do it gives us the opportunity to drive more price optimization across the lines as well. so we're very excited about where we're heading and what this really adds to the mix we have.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
got it. thanks very much guys. very helpful.
operator
and our next question will come from alex zukin with wolfe research. please go ahead.
alex zukin -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey guys. thanks for taking the questions. maybe i'll go a little bit more direct we're -- the [phonetic] investors. if i look at the guide, if i look at the performance of this year or quarter and we assume that frame.io was not in the guide, it's the first time i think adobe that you've actually not outperformed your guidance for the quarter. and so i realize that there are definitely worth in q4 that may have impacted that. just give us a sense of like what do we now split back there and you had to look back at the covid impacts of both the second half, the holiday season or how should we think about the confidence in your guides for the next year vis-a-vis your historical cadence or historical pattern and seasonality?
anil chakravarthy -- president of digital experience business
yeah alex. i mean, i'll take that and if you think about it, our first as people who covered us for a long time we take our guidance very seriously, and let me maybe roll back a little bit to what we accomplished in 2020 and then how we guided for 2021. as you know, we guided a little bit below what our 2020 guidance was, in 2021 when we started and we certainly outperformed that guidance as it relates to digital media arr accomplishment in 2021. and if you look at how we have guided for 2022, it's actually a little bit closer to our 2021 guide as a starting point. and so clearly we continue to be incredibly optimistic associated with the underlying strength of the business, the overall need for creativity just continues, we don't believe in any way, shape or form there were sort of pull ins, i know that sort of exists for other companies we just continue to see secular trend and some of the new initiatives that we have underway.
i mean we really pivoted the team to be thinking about enterprise and video, we have creative cloud express, the usage is going to build dramatically, we already have the largest communicator business i think among the creative community. so we're incredibly optimistic about how that business looks. and then if you look at it from a quarterization perspective, again, let's just go back and look at what we guided in q1 of 2021. as you know, when we guided to a number we were factoring in the $24 million [phonetic] that we outlined was an additional part of what we accomplished as part of the 13 versus 14 week. and so if you look at it's very much in line, in other words, the trends of the business continue and the optimism in the business continue. so that's how i would think about it alex.
alex zukin -- wolfe research -- analyst
that's super helpful. and then maybe just one for anil on cdp. the last time we talked about cdp product, i think you talked about us being surpassing $100 million in arr margin clearly but from your commentary, it sounds like a, i think to perform really, really well and it's really a growth balance for the entire digital experience. where are we with that business today, if there's any way to dimensionalize work for the growth trajectory in your perspective?
anil chakravarthy -- president of digital experience business
we see a lot of momentum, the market clearly customers looking at us and say they have the right vision, and we have the right product to really think about a range of use cases that supported by the adobe experience platform. and we've done a really nice job of integrating our applications with the adobe experience platform so that you could able to populate the data from our analytics platform and then use the data for activation across all kinds of channels. so in terms of scale, in terms of performance, in terms of the range of use cases, data governance, etc., it's really enterprise ready right now and enterprises are beginning to see that this is at the heart of their digital experience and the digital customer engagement. so we feel like we're in a really good place right now with it.
alex zukin -- wolfe research -- analyst
perfect. thank you, guys.
operator
up next, we will hear from keith weiss with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
excellent. thank you guys for taking the question. i wanted to dig a little bit into -- i think david, you started getting into this with the positioning of express and how we should think about that. how does the express positioning relates to kind of what you guys were trying to do with spark and those mobile offerings in terms of an entry ramp, is it kind of in between those two? to what extent should we think about this as defensive to some of the emerging competitors that are ramping up in the marketplace?
and is there any risk of downshifting the existing creative cloud customers who need a lighter weight solution, now it appears a, cheaper offering, if you will, is there any potential that you could see some downshifting within the base of people trying to price optimize there or to the contrary, does this allow you to sort of pull price up on the core creative cloud? can you just help us with those kinds of questions on the positioning around the portfolio now?

okay. maybe i'll start, keith and then david, certainly you can add to it. if you take a step back, i think this just speaks to the enormous opportunity that exists for creators and if you look at our offerings already today, keith, i mean we have an incredible diversity of offerings, we have photoshop express on mobile, that's doing great as it relates to the arr and we have you know, the creative cloud product that also allows now the substance 3d products that's probably the most expensive and so, i think with online and our ddom, we now have absolutely the ability to target and personalize our offerings against -- against a broader set of customers and to make sure that we make it all net positive, and net from a customer satisfaction, as well as a net positive from the arr that we accomplish.
a couple of other things. i mean first, our creative business with the communicator segment is already the largest creative business in the world. i mean, when you think about what's happening with photoshop or lightroom or the express set of products and i think what express really does is, it actually adds value to every single creative cloud subscriber. i mean there are creative cloud subscribers who are incredibly proficient in video, who sometimes want to do a quick flyer associated with it and so i think this brings more and more and more people into the fold.
it's similar frankly to what we've done with the document cloud, where when you think about what's happening with this organic demand that we've created for pdf and so net-net, i think it's accretive and then i'll hand it over to david to speak specifically about how this might roll out, but it is actually an enabler for us and it unifies frankly all of the different creative offerings that we've already had for the communicator segment.
david wadhwani -- president of digital media business
yes. just adding to that, we look at this as a really pivotal moment in terms of our ability to -- to fulfill a need that we know our customers have. if you -- if you think back to what we talked about earlier, we have 400 million ids that have been created on mobile devices already. we have 600 million monthly active users across our digital media products that are not creative professionals and creative cloud express represents an opportunity to give all of them something that we can onboard them to in an effective way.
as shantanu also talked about, one of the things that we find really exciting about this is that our creative cloud base as well is looking for -- sometimes often they're looking for the power and precision of our creative flagship applications, but sometimes they just want a velocity-driven content-first creative creation model too and by giving creative cloud express to most of our creative cloud plans, we expect to drive even higher engagement and retention there.
and the last thing i want to say is that, this fundamentally expands how we think about our go-to-market motion. we have talked for the last many years about our data-driven operating model and how that drives our ability to pull and acquire users, bring them into our acquisition funnels. with product-led growth because of our increasing investment in mobile and web, we have the ability to do a lot more quick iteration and optimize the user journey. so that conversion of that 600 million mile into -- into paid and premium customers and engagement with them continues.
and the last thing i will say is that, i don't think you can look at this market as you've got non-professionals and professionals. we have a lot of non-professionals that really want to use the power and precision of -- precision of creative cloud. and so we look at this as this ongoing seamless journey from the first time you come and you want to do something with creative expression, you can do it for free with creative cloud express. we then move you up that change so you have the premium content and availability of the premium features and content in creative cloud express paid plan. and then we see people are able to actually move all the way up to the power and precision of creative cloud. so it's really a seamless end-to-end journey.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. is that what you're talking about when you mentioned price optimization? is it just having more gearing within that pricing?
shantanu narayen -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. certainly, keith. so we've talked about price optimization being it. i mean, for the first time as you saw with the 3d products, we did not include it as part of creative cloud all applications because of the value, but certainly i think as we get a better feel for all of the different offerings that we have, there are some offerings that are probably underpriced relative to the value that they are providing. but our focus just continues to be, attract more people to the platform and deliver more product value. scott, were you going to add something on creative cloud express?
scott belsky -- chief product officer and executive vice president of creative cloud
i was just going to say, i mean, i think, david you covered certainly the opportunity for creative cloud express for the broader franchise. but one of the very exciting things that we've learned over the last few years is -- is really around the distinct customer needs that were just not covered frankly by spark or photoshop express, other things we were doing or other kinds of competitive tools out there and i just wanted to share a few of those, because i think they are really relevant.
i mean first of all, we're seeing a lot of these customers that come in wanting to make something with a template, they want to be able to go further. so our product team is actually very excited about the prospect of a customer being able to make something and then take it to the next level using one of our more pro-ish applications like photoshop or illustrator. also the desire for artificial intelligence, a lot of customers come in from small businesses, etc, and they have an idea of what they want to make, but they want some assistance in making something remarkable. they want fonts to be recommended to them, they want colors that will perform better in social media, and so we have an opportunity to do that.
and then finally, the idea of a multimedia editor was another really important insight for us in the development of creative cloud express. because what we learned is that, while a lot of customers come in through the top of the funnel because they want to make a flyer, they want to edit a video, they want to edit an image and when they come in, they actually realize, maybe i'll add some animation, maybe i'll add some sound and before you know it, it's a multimedia creation. and so we're very much building creative cloud express not just for where the customer is now, but where we see the market going. people are going to want to stand out with their media and that's something that i believe adobe can uniquely deliver with this product.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
outstanding. super helpful guys. thank you.
operator
up next we'll hear from kirk materne with evercore isi. please go ahead.
kirk materne -- evercore isi -- analyst
yes. thanks very much. anil, i was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the strength you're seeing in the enterprise side, on the experience cloud front. obviously rpo was really strong. i assume a lot of that strength came from the experience cloud side and what continues in the next year, because when you look at the fiscal '22 guide, obviously ddom, that i assume some of that's just workfront being anniversary. but can you just kind of tell us what you're sort of assuming continues in -- in the strength of business this year going into next year. what has momentum in that business that you feel good about and where are some of the potential points of leverage in terms of upside next year? thanks.
anil chakravarthy -- president of digital experience business
well, we definitely see some of the tailwinds we saw during the pandemic continuing and every company, b2c companies, b2b companies and companies that are experimenting with new business models, direct-to-consumer for example, they're all starting to invest across the board in digital experience and we see that play out across all of the categories that i laid out. definitely with one view of the customer, a single view of the customer that carries through the unified profile that we have in the adobe experience platform, that is at the heart of all customer engagement. so if you kind of map it to how we think of our ddom, everything from discover to try to buy to use to renew, that whole journey needs a common unified profile, so that you can deliver a consistent experience across all channels and that's a major investment that all companies are making.
and so what we've been able to do is, to really take advantage of all of the knowledge we have and the applications we have across all of these areas, and populate that data in the adobe experience platform and that gives us a clear head start for with every company and then say -- then opening it up by saying that it is open to developers, the data model is an open data model, it runs on top of a cloud so that its horizontally scalable, that has really made it something that any enterprise of any size can use, but they can also get started in a particular geography or in a particular business unit or a customer segment and scale from there. so i'm really excited. i think across our categories, we definitely see a lot of strength and more as we now see some of the trends that we've just talked about with the creator economy and so on, that will continue to add more use cases that will be built on top of the platform.
david wadhwani -- president of digital media business
and kirk, if i were to add a little bit more to that. i mean, when you take a step back and think about what we've accomplished, we created the digital marketing category and we said there is a much larger opportunity as it relates to this customer experience management. the innovation that went into the building of the experience platform and the unification frankly of everything that analyst talked about whether it's content and commerce with its data and insights, whether it's the marketing flow associated with workfront which is also doing well. there really isn't another company that enables somebody whether you're the market or the chief revenue officer, the chief digital officer to very quickly say i want to get all my data, whether it's online or offline into one particular place an even more important to activate it, and so i think from my perspective, the momentum associated with having this unified platform and you can get customers really up and running so rapidly that's pretty amazing.
the second thing i would say is that we've done a really good job with the digital strategy group as well as what anil outlined earlier about these transformative accounts. and so again, as we shared in the data, the ability to sell multiple solutions, the ability to upsell, the ability to co-sell, i think that's also gives us a lot of confidence that now we have the platform we have the absence services on it, we have the ai associated with it and i think if you take a step back there isn't a company that doesn't want to talk to us about a, adobe how did you do it and b, how do we really make sure that we can get this up and running and activated faster. so i really hope in 2022, you will see how we make increasing progress in terms of not only just the selling but the provisioning and frankly the value realization. and i think we've done a good job on that front as well under anil's leadership.
kirk materne -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you.
operator
all right. up next we'll hear from mark moerdler with bernstein research. please go ahead.
mark moerdler -- bernstein research -- analyst
thank you very much for taking my question and congrats on the quarter and the year. i'd like to drill in a little bit because i'm getting a lot of questions obviously, dan following up on your prepared presentation, you discussed how subscription has sustained 24% growth. and when you look at the overall guidance i'd like help us better unpack what are your puts and takes that are impacting you specifically year digital media side and also on the experience like and also if you can give us any sense on how much you're figuring fx, headwind in arr revenue it much appreciate it?
david wadhwani -- president of digital media business
sure. thanks for the question. i think the best place to start is underlying performance of the business. i think we're exposed to great market opportunities, company has got the right strategy and performing well against those strategies. as we think about performance in the current environment, against that backdrop of good performance, we want to strip out noise in the one-year look ahead set of numbers, and i think there's two things that we point to when we separate the noise from what's been communicated. first is fx, second is the extra 53-week versus 52-week and so let's go one layer deep in each of those. as we think about the 53 versus 52 week, that's about a 2% arrowed to growth for the overall company in fiscal '21 and as we window into fiscal '22 that's going to be about a 2 point headwind. because that extra week occurred in q1 and you look at q1 fy '22, it's about a 7 point headwind from just that one extra week alone as we look long quarter forward.
as we take a look at fx and we think about the currency moves not surprisingly, fx for our business over 2021 also added about a 2 point tailwind from a growth perspective broadly speaking, across the business. as we look forward into the next year, it creates about a 1 point headwind given the recent moves that we've seen over the last couple of weeks. i'm sorry, the last couple of months of the dollar strengthening versus a variety of currencies around the globe. that gives you a sense of the magnitude of the moves from both of those two factors as we extract underlying performance from a bit of the noise we see. if we were to go to one click further down and take a look at how both of those factors affect the digital medium business versus the digital experience business. i would say from the 52 versus 53 week dynamic, you'll see more of that upside and more of that headwind from a growth standpoint impacting the dme business than you do the dx business, but it's just a slight difference between the two businesses depending on how we engage commercially with our customers and i can go into that a little more detail if you'd like, on the fx side, you see a similar dynamic you see slightly accentuated performance to the upside and downside tailwind and headwind from fx on the digital media business than you do on the dx business, it's a slight change but you see a slight bias to the upside and downside of dme versus dx.
i think that unpack the numbers and gets to the true underlying performance of the company. and as you take a step back and look at how our businesses have performed over the last couple of years, you'll see what we've just guided is about in line with where we've been for the last couple of years. so again, the company continues to perform pretty well.
jonathan vaas -- vice president of investor relations
maybe mark, i'll just add a couple of things to that. first is, as dan tells me which is first welcome to the big leagues and so i guess when you're $15 billion of revenue it's neither practical and it's frankly too expensive to hedge all the fx exposure that you were accustomed to maybe we are doing. so if you strip out that fx part and if you think about arr, just very tactically to be clear what we do is we have an arr at the beginning of the year with the strength of the dollar in november, you could argue it's the hardest compare on a pure fx and then we bought devalue the beginning book of business on arr and then we are using that dollar rate for the arr for the quarter.
and so then again if you think about it at a $1.9 billion guide that we have for the arr, clearly, the underlying strength of business and the units that is not what's impacting the business. so just, i think that's the other way that i unpack what was the impact of fx as well as to specifically tell you how we take the dollar rate at the beginning of the year for the arr calculation.
mark moerdler -- bernstein research -- analyst
that's extremely helpful. i really appreciate. dan if you don't -- on the difference between the two business can you drill down a little bit more by the extra week is somewhat worse, a little bit on digital.
dan durn -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, so as you look at how we engage with customers, you engage with customers through adobe.com and other channels on a daily basis and you're exposed to every single extra day of that week to the upside and the downside depending on which year you're in. on the dx business the vast majority of our -- not the vast, the majority of our revenues will get booked on a daily basis, but there are parts of that business that engage with customers on a monthly basis. and as you can imagine, when that extra week falls in a month and you engage with customers on a monthly basis, you won't see the upside or the downside on that business. so on a like-for-like basis you'll see more of that dynamic flowed into the digital media business than you will the dx business. but again, as you think about a 2 point tailwind fx in fy '21 and a 1 point headwind in fy '22 you're talking about slight separation to the upside and downside and depending on which year you're in to this dynamic.
mark moerdler -- bernstein research -- analyst
perfect. i very much appreciate and thank you for the detail.
dan durn -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. you're welcome.
operator
next we'll hear from gregg moskowitz with mizuho. please go ahead.
gregg moskowitz -- mizuho -- analyst
okay, thank you for taking the question. and thank you for hosting this event one of your competitors in the document cloud space recently cited softening demand and execution issues, naturally your business is a lot broader than theirs but have you seen any changes as it relates to customer engagement within document cloud?
shantanu narayen -- chairman and chief executive officer
greg, we had a phenomenal quarter and document cloud. i think we had record net new arr $141 million in net new arr for the document cloud. i think the team has done a really good job of integrating that so maybe i'll have david speak a little bit to how just integrating sign as well into the acrobat business as one of the verbs is really i think helping really make it more pervasive. david?
david wadhwani -- president of digital media business
yeah. as shantanu said, we're very excited about the momentum we're seeing the document cloud business as a whole. we have -- we benefit from this incredible reach we have, as i mentioned earlier between our inside sales folks and our reseller partners, really anyone that has a document need is coming and flowing into our funnel and then certainly with the benefit of the enterprise selling in the top-down, we're able to go and have solution-oriented conversations with them. but one of the key areas that we've been focused on over the last 12 months that have really been productive for us is to leverage our footprint in terms of our desktop applications, predominantly things like reader across mobile desktop and web, and drive awareness and utilization of our services through that. as i mentioned earlier, we saw 85% year-over-year increase in terms of adobe signed transactions that were successfully completed or initiated in acrobat and you can expect to see us continue to do that. we want signatures and adobe sign to be available to anyone that uses acrobat going forward and we'll continue to double down on that strategy.
shantanu narayen -- chairman and chief executive officer
and maybe just one last thing to add on that, gregg. i mean, one of the exciting things that again i think the team has done is, now this extension that we have in chrome, as well as what we are doing and we announced the extension of the partnership with microsoft. so again, i think the distribution of adobe pdf with all the magic that we have with liquid mode and mobile and sign, i think that just really enables us, given we have the apis and the developer motions to really even further extend that. but this notion of automating document workflows is just going to continue to go up into the right.
gregg moskowitz -- mizuho -- analyst
that's terrific. and then a quick one for dan, you spoke about fx and the extra week a moment ago, but how much is an increased or more normalized level of t&e expected to impact your operating margins in fiscal '22, how should we think about that?
dan durn -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so as i think we look into 2022, we in the prepared comments talked about, as the world begins to open up, we're going to get on airplanes. we're going to spend time with customers. you'll see some of the facilities costs come back. this is about growing and scaling our business and engaging with customers and solving their highest value problems. so you will see some of those costs come back and that's reflected in our guide. and so when we take a look at the opportunity in front of us and we think about the runway for growth, we think about how well we're positioned in each of our respective businesses and we think about where the world is going and the key enablement role we as a company can play to enable that digitization of the world.
we're going to invest for growth. we're going to invest in market-leading and defining products and we're going to continue the lead -- to lead the way we've done in the past. so you'll see some of that complement the investments we're going to make. and then as you think about the adobe experience platform, and you think about creative cloud express, we're going to invest in sales and marketing to grow and scale those businesses globally. so we're going to be oriented to growth and you'll see that reflected in both the performance and the decision-making going forward.
gregg moskowitz -- mizuho -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
and up next, we'll hear from brent thill with jefferies. please go ahead.
brent thill -- jefferies -- analyst
dan, welcome to the team. just on the margin side, i mean i think we all understand your margins have gone up 590 basis points in the last three years. so capping the air breaks a little bit on margin makes sense. but when you think about the long-term trajectory still for adobe on the margin, you believe you're capped in the mid 40%s or you still believe long term the margins to trend more toward 50%? and i had a quick follow-up for shantanu.
shantanu narayen -- chairman and chief executive officer
dan, do you want me to? i think 60%s comes after 50%s brent if you're thinking about numbers on that scale. i -- we have as dan said, such incredible opportunities and one of the statistics that he showed, that was really hopefully, brent and you know us, how we think about the businesses, which is we are investing in these long-term really growth rates, but we've been able to do all these acquisitions and really do a fantastic job of keeping our margin.
and so i think it again is all about the growth opportunity. you know it, we have an unbelievable leverage model. and so the leverage model will demonstrate itself. and if you look at our 2022 targets, it actually continues to show a lot of optimism in what we can do. i think frame.io is a little dilutive. and again, as he said, some of these things, the experience cloud and what we are doing with getting more experience cloud adoption globally, what we are doing around document cloud and creative cloud and creative cloud express, i mean we want to make sure that we are spending wisely.
ann is the expert on attribution not just within the company but in the world and so we'll continue to do it. but we do believe that -- and this is a question that you've also asked in the past, which is the value that customers are getting, is there an ability to continue to drive higher price offerings and all of them are there. i mean we're just excited about all of these different things, but i wont count on 50% anytime soon right now. i'd rather count on accelerated growth brent.
brent thill -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. very clear. shantanu, just for the quarter, forget the guide. i think many of the analysts have asked this question, what happened in q4, and this is not a quarter that we're all used to seeing from you. so from your perspective, is this just a digital digestion from a huge adoption we've seen the last year, is adobe execution. i don't think it's competitive, but i think many are still asking all of us the question throughout this analyst day with the stock down, what happened from your perspective?
shantanu narayen -- chairman and chief executive officer
brent, so let me maybe again talk to a little bit on the adobe digital index and then i'll come back to our business. if you look at the adobe digital index, what has clearly happened over the last 12 months, 18 months, even pre-pandemic but certainly during the pandemic, is there is more and more activity happening online. that is a secular trend that's actually not going to change. we see it, there is more energy, there is more traffic, there is more activity associated with what's going online. if you look at what i think a lot of companies are looking at, the traditional spikes that you may have seen, a couple of weeks, the black friday week or the cyber monday week, i think those are maybe a little bit more muted, because it's a little bit more of that traffic, you're seeing actually a steady growth as opposed to those spikes.
so if i take a step back and think about our digital media business teams and the small and medium business, nice performance. if i look at the enterprise, as i said, traditional close to the quarter. if i look at the individual business, a little bit of those spikes that we would have seen, we did see growth. we did see growth in both of those weeks, but it was perhaps a little bit less than that. and then you're back to again the secular demand. so as i think about the business, it's not about the long-term demand, it's not about the market leadership of our products. i think it's just a little bit of how maybe online shopping globally has changed a little bit, in terms of what the experience is.
so that's what i attribute it to and we're back on q1, look at our guide and let's go execute against the opportunities that we have. so i'll really point to a little bit of those couple of weeks and it's not just adobe, it's certainly represented. if you look at the adobe digital index and what we thought was the growth rate going to be for the entire community and how that got a little muted. so that's the way i would look at it.
brent thill -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks, shantanu.
shantanu narayen -- chairman and chief executive officer
operator, we're coming up on the top of the hour. let's take two more questions, please.
operator
absolutely. our next question will come from brad sills with bank of america securities. please go ahead.
brad sills -- bank of america securities -- analyst
oh, great. thanks guys for taking the question here. i wanted to double-click a little bit on the tam expansion that you've seen from your perspective with the -- the core creative professional end of the market. i think two years ago you were $15 billion, now you're forecasting $25 billion, is there are a certain persona that you think is driving a lot of that expansion in the tam, just in the core business versus say a couple of years ago, when you look forward toward the addressable market?
shantanu narayen -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. there is a -- there are three things that are really driving that. first is just with the increased demand for content. we are seeing more creative professionals coming to the markets, that we are seeing the base of people we can sell to as creative professionals, continuing to grow. we also are able to provide more value. as people are trying to accelerate the velocity of content, they have to build content more quickly. so things that scott and team are doing around the addition of collaboration, means that we are able to add more value. the frame.io acquisition is a great example of that. but we've also added some core new collaborative capabilities to creative cloud itself.
and third is the emergence of these new content types. we've been all tracking the growth of 3d, but also now with the emergence of the metaverse, we're starting to see more demand for new types of content and if you look at the performance of substance 3d and the fact that business as an example grew 100% year-over-year, it shows you that the business and the growth that we're seeing is tracking to the tam expansion that ann talked about earlier.
brad sills -- bank of america securities -- analyst
got it. great. and one more if i could please. with all the effort and work you've done integrating the suite for experience cloud between magento and core cms, now you have workfront, is -- are there different entry points that the enterprise customers are starting with within that suite, now that you've delivered on a more integrated offering there?
shantanu narayen -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, absolutely. we are starting to see customers who start with commerce and now they want to have a much better web presence and they work with our -- us on content management and they want to focus on marketing agility and efficiency, and that leads to workfront. so that's a different entry point that we see now. we also see a number of our customers as they think especially about different patterns in commerce, b2b commerce, b2b2c commerce, etc, they are expanding from the content management presence they have with us and picking us up on our vision of making it a truly shoppable experience and so that's starting to move in the other direction as well.
brad sills -- bank of america securities -- analyst
great to hear. thank you so much.
operator
and lastly, we will hear from kash rangan with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
kash rangan -- goldman sachs -- analyst
the good thing about going last is, i've got three minutes and you're stuck with me or two minutes. i'm kidding, i'll try to make this -- i'll try to make this brief. shantanu and dan, i was intrigued by your comment that you plan to double the size of the company to $30 billion and beyond that to $45 billion. and dovetailing that to shantanu's observation that you're looking to accelerate as opposed to go for margin expansion, which is great. with that construct in mind, it's certainly when i look at your guidance, it doesn't suggest any deceleration, but maybe a little bit of conservatism, if anything. if you could just talk about the levers in your business, shantanu, that could cause the company to do better than expected or downside levers as well for fiscal '22, that would be great.
but more longer-term, if you look at metaverse, the concept of metaverse and how satya nadella talks about the equivalent of metaverse on the business side, how we work, combination of virtual and presence, he outlines a view of the word that is fairly compelling, i'm curious how you have thought about how adobe is positioned for that word, the metaverse in the consumer context and enterprise virtual work context as laid out by satya? thank you so much.
shantanu narayen -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, thanks for the question, kash and before i get to the metaverse, maybe the one thing we didn't quite cover is, if you look at the big trends that people are talking about, kash, the one thing we're maybe not in is evs and batteries, right. so that's perhaps the one area of digital that adobe is still not really involved in. as i think about web 3d and as i think about the metaverse, what it really means and implies is that, things that you are accustomed to doing in the physical world, increasingly more and more of that you're going to do in the virtual world. and so if you think about it that way, whether you're doing shopping, whether you're playing games, whether you're creating, co-creating with other people, whether you're expanding it, the aspect of creating all of that metaverse was, what better company in the planet than adobe to be able to do that.
so that's that one dimension which is this exponential need for content, is only going to increase. i think the other way i think about what's happening in the metaverse and if you think about it from that point of view is, where prior only physical goods in creativity were deemed worthy of buying, i think now even all these virtual goods are going to have a value associated with. and so when you think about what's happening with nfts and blockchain, again adobe i think is incredibly well positioned. we've already demonstrated some leadership in that with what we've done in photoshop, and so i think the commerce aspects associated with not just large businesses, and we talked about the large businesses, but even individual businesses, i think adobe is uniquely positioned.
i think opportunities like that, adobe is probably a little bit more conservative than others in order to, in terms of putting it directly in our forecast for the year. but make no mistake, i mean we are thinking about how these new opportunities, the fact that we bought a 3d company a while ago, the fact that we have aero and we are working with all of the os providers in terms of thinking about augmented reality and virtual reality, we're absolutely in the middle of it, we're not just counting it in terms of what happens in terms of revenue of the top.
but if you take even more of a step and go to your question associated with how do we think about the opportunity, i will actually say kash, as we were all preparing as a group to prepare this, we had so much material and we were talking about how do we try and condensate. so i really hope you look at what jonathan forced us to do, which is, the deck has so much more information in it, we were trying to really provide sort of a abstract of all of that material, and i think it just reflects the interest that we have. i mean, all three of our businesses and let's go maybe digital experience, we've been talking about that for a while and you're seeing just some tremendous adoption of our solutions in that. digital is only going to go up into the right. and i think adobe is incredibly well positioned.
the real-time customer data platform, the experience platform how we've unified our products, it actually reminds me of the really heavy lifting that we did many years ago, in what we did on our content creation tools with the unified profiles and the data and insights to deliver value to our customers. so it feels really good. i think what we are doing around document cloud, on the web, across surfaces, pdf, liquid mode in terms of the ai, we're really spending a lot of time thinking about how businesses are going to automate, what it means to have a hybrid work environment which is clearly a big trend and really making sure that we unify that with respect to our innovation. so really fantastic job by the teams there across all surfaces.
and certainly, creative cloud, the heritage of the company, this notion of everyone who has a story to tell, i actually tend to think of it as the webs now come alive. the webs now come alive and perhaps one of the things we didn't talk about, the biggest asset even on the web is adobe's file formats. so the ability to deal with the photoshop file format, the ability to deal with illustrator for logos, the ability to deal with in design, if you want to create these flyers and actually for the creative community to participate in this massive community that's been created, we've done all the heavy lifting that now makes that magic possible. and we have a broader set of offerings than ever before in terms of being able to target people wherever you are in the world. we have pricing flexibility and we have a ddom that allows us to do it. so i just take a step back and look at it and say, you know what, adobe is really uniquely positioned. we have a fabulous team. we didn't talk enough about that.
certainly my colleagues here and dana who is not on the stage, but our gc as an executive team as well as the 25,000 employees, don't take for granted what we have in terms of this motivated staff. and so i just look at it and say, we're focused on topline growth, to the questions that brent and others asked, we're always going to be focused on making sure that we have profitable growth and focus on the margin as well. but i feel just uniquely excited about the opportunities that we have.
the one thing i missed is, unfortunately, we're not all together and please stay safe, stay healthy during this holiday season. i think that's the really important thing. but as a management team, and as a employee base, i could not be more excited about the future that adobe has and so, thank you very much all of you for joining us virtually and thank you for the team for all of the work that went into the preparation. have a nice day.
