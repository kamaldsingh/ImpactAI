michael p. dickerson -- vice president, corporate communications & investor relations
thank you, and good morning, everyone. welcome to the aaron's company fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. joining me this morning are douglas lindsay, aaron's chief executive officer; steve olsen, aaron's president; and kelly wall, aaron's chief financial officer.
many of you have already seen a copy of our earnings release issued this morning. for those of you that have not, it is available on the investor relations section of our website at investor.aarons.com.
during this call, certain statements we make will be forward-looking, including our financial performance outlook for 2021. actual results in the future may be materially different than those discussed here. this could be due to a variety of factors including, among other things, uncertainties associated with the duration and severity of the covid-19 pandemic and related impact on the economy and supply chain. i want to call your attention to our safe harbor provision for forward-looking statements that can be found at the end of our earnings release. the safe harbor provision identifies risks that may cause actual results to differ materially from the content of our forward-looking statements. also, please see our form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020, and other periodic filings with the sec for a description of the risks related to our business that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. listeners are cautioned not to place undue emphasis on forward-looking statements, and we undertake no obligation to update any such statements.
on today's call, we will be referring to certain non-gaap financial measures, including ebitda and adjusted ebitda, non-gaap net earnings and non-gaap eps, which have been adjusted for certain items, which may affect the comparability of our performance with other companies. these non-gaap measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings release. the company believes that these non-gaap financial measures provide meaningful insight into the company's operational performance and cash flows, and provides these measures to investors to help facilitate comparisons of operating results with prior periods and to assist them in understanding the company's ongoing operational performance.
let me add one comment, as it relates to our basis of presentation. for the month of december, 2020, our results represent the consolidated statements of the company and its subsidiaries, and is based on the financial position and results of operations as a stand-alone company. for all periods prior to december 1st 2020, combined financial statements include all revenue and cost directly attributable to the company and an allocation of expenses from our former parent related to certain corporate functions and actions. a more detailed explanation of our basis of presentation can be found in our form 10-k filed today.
with that, i will now turn the call over to our ceo, douglas lindsay.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
thanks, mike, and thank you for joining us today. first, let me take a moment to recognize all of our talented team members for their determination and commitment in 2020, which enabled aaron's to accelerate our key strategic priorities in a very challenging year. our fantastic team members at our stores, distribution and service centers, woodhaven manufacturing and store support center worked tirelessly to provide products and services to our customers, while accelerating our digital and real estate transformation. we overcame the challenges posed by the covid-19 pandemic, while continuing to meet the needs of our customers and safeguarding our team members. at the same time, we delivered annual revenues that exceeded our expectations for the year and an adjusted ebitda that was higher than we've generated in several years. in addition, during the year, our team has worked diligently to establish aaron's as a new stand-alone publicly traded company. the spin-off transaction closed on november 30th 2020. and following the spin, we are well positioned with a strong balance sheet and cash flow profile to execute on our go-forward strategy.
while some uncertainty remains regarding how the corona virus may impact the economy or consumer behavior, i'm more energized and optimistic about our future than ever. our business has never been more nimble, and we continue to make investments in technology, decisioning, e-commerce and store operations that are yielding higher productivity and lease portfolio performance.
in the fourth quarter of 2020, same-store revenues rose 3.4% as compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to strong customer payment activity, improving lease portfolio size and higher retail sales. the fourth quarter was the sixth out of the last eight quarters with positive same-store comps, with 2020 representing the first annual positive same-store revenue growth since 2013. additionally, we ended 2020 with a larger and healthier lease portfolio than we had at the beginning of the year. the larger portfolio size is a result of better collections, fewer product returns and lower write-offs, which was enabled by improvements in operational execution, the roll-out of centralized decisioning technology and enhancements to our customer payments platform. we achieved this larger portfolio despite revenue written into the portfolio that was flat in the fourth quarter. recall that our implementation of decisioning technology in the second quarter of 2020 effectively reduced new lease originations and therefore, revenue written by 6% to 8%.
moving to our e-commerce channel. revenues grew 39% in the quarter and represented approximately 13% of total lease revenues compared to 10% in the fourth quarter of 2019. thanks to the tremendous efforts of our team; traffic to our aarons.com site continues to increase year-over-year, as our customers are increasingly going online in search of affordable products for their homes. in the fourth quarter, e-commerce traffic was up 29% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. despite the significant increase in traffic at aarons.com, e-commerce recurring revenue written into the portfolio declined 1.2% as compared to last year's fourth quarter, due to both decisioning optimization and lower conversion of traffic. conversion is not what we would expect it to be due to the inventory shortages resulting from the global supply chain disruption. however, our inventory position continues to modestly improve in the first quarter of 2021, which should lead to higher conversion rates. i'm encouraged by the progress of our e-commerce initiatives, including our evolving analytics and digital capabilities. improvements in online customer acquisition, conversion and decisioning are leading to margin growth and continued positive momentum in this important channel.
in 2020, we also accelerated our strategy to consolidate, remodel and reposition our store footprint with our new gennext store concept, which includes enhanced shared rooms, digital technologies, expanded product assortment and improved brand imaging. as of the end of the year, we had 47 gennext stores opened and have more than 60 additional stores in the 2021 pipeline. our gennext stores are performing well, delivering new lease volumes that are higher than the corporate averages and in line with our expectations. while the new stores still represent a small portion of our overall store count, we believe over time the execution of our gennext store strategy will provide meaningful lift to our overall performance.
overall, i'm pleased with our full year of 2020 and fourth quarter results. and i'm encouraged about the future and our new chapter as a financially strong stand-alone public company. as we look to 2021, we remain focused on our key strategic initiatives of simplifying and digitizing the customer experience, aligning our store footprint to our customer opportunity and promoting the aaron's value proposition of low payments, high approval rates and best-in-class service.
and now, i'll turn the call over to our chief financial officer, kelly wall, to discuss our financial results.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
thank you, douglas. for the full year 2020, consolidated revenues were $1.735 billion, a decline of 2.8% compared to the full year 2019. this decline is primarily the result of a reduction of 253 company-operated stores in 2019 and 2020 partially offset by a 1.8% increase in same-store revenues for the year. adjusted ebitda for the full year 2020 was $208.9 million, an increase of $43.6 million or 26.4% compared to the full year of 2019. as a percentage of revenues, adjusted ebitda was 12% compared to 9.3%, an increase of 270 basis points over the prior year. this increase in adjusted ebitda is primarily due to an improvement in customer payment activity, fewer lease merchandise returns and efficiencies in store operations, including pandemic-related staffing reductions in the second and third quarters of 2020. write-offs were 4.2% of lease revenues in 2020, a 200 basis point improvement over 2019. annual non-gaap earnings per share was $3.02 in 2020, an increase of 43.8% compared to $2.10 for prior year 2019.
turning to the fourth quarter of 2020. revenues were $430 million, a decrease of approximately 1% compared to the same quarter last year, despite the closure, consolidation and acquisition of a net 75 company-owned locations throughout the year. adjusted ebitda was $53.7 million for the fourth quarter compared to $51.2 million for the same period of 2019, an increase of $2.5 million or 4.8%. adjusted ebitda margin was 12.5% of revenues compared to 11.8% in the same period a year ago, an increase of 70 basis points. the improvement in q4 2020 adjusted ebitda margin was primarily due to the reduction in inventory write-offs, partially offset by comping over the impact of one-time benefits realized in the fourth quarter of the prior year period. these one-time items in 2019, related primarily to gains from real estate sale and leaseback transactions and other miscellaneous items. excluding these one-time items from 2019, adjusted ebitda margin in the fourth quarter of 2020 would have improved approximately 250 basis points. diluted earnings per share on a non-gaap basis for the quarter increased 11.3% to $0.79 versus $0.71 in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the continuing strength of customer payment activity and reduced lease merchandise write-offs. operating expenses were down $1.2 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to an $11.7 million reduction in write-offs, offset primarily by an increase in advertising spend and the previously mentioned benefit of real estate transactions that took place in the fourth quarter of the prior year. during the fourth quarter of 2020, the company's store labor expense increased compared to the second and third quarters, during which labor expenses were lower due to pandemic-related store closures and furloughs. write-offs in the fourth quarter were 4.3%, down 300 basis points from the prior year fourth quarter, due primarily to the implementation of our new decisioning technology, improved operations and the benefit of government stimulus. cash generated from operating activities was $355.8 million for the 12 months ended december 31, 2020. cash from operating activities grew $169.8 million year-over-year, primarily due to improved lease portfolio performance, lower inventory purchases and one-time tax benefits resulting from the cares act, partially offset by other changes in working capital. at the end of the year, the company had a cash balance of $76.1 million and less than $1 million of debt. in addition, concurrent with completing the spin-off transaction of november 30th, the company entered into a $250 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which was undrawn at the end of 2020, giving the company more than $300 million of liquidity as of year-end.
before i review our outlook for 2021, i want to remind you all that in november, prior to completing the spin-off transaction, the legacy combined company accelerated the payment of its regular quarterly cash dividend, which would normally have been paid in january 2021.
turning to our 2021 outlook. we currently expect total revenues in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion. this represents a $50 million increase to the bottom end of the preliminary outlook we provided in connection with our spin-off roadshow in november, which is summarized on slide 17 of the roadshow presentation and is available on the investor relations section of our website. adjusted ebitda is expected to be in the range of $155 million to $170 million, representing an increase in the midpoint of our outlook as compared to the preliminary outlook we provided in november. as it relates to the seasonality of our financial results, we expect that both revenues and earnings will be somewhat higher in the first six months of 2021 compared to the second six months of 2021. free cash flows, which we define as operating cash flows of less capital expenditures, are expected to be $80 million to $90 million. capital expenditures are also expected to be between $80 million and $90 million for the year. this outlook assumes a few key items we want to highlight. first, no significant deterioration in the current retail environment or in the state of the u.s. economy as compared to its current condition. second, a gradual improvement in global supply chain conditions. and finally, no incremental government stimulus or supplemental unemployment benefits.
to summarize, 2020 was a successful year for aaron's, despite the many challenges our team members and customers faced. to echo douglas's earlier comments, i am encouraged by the opportunity ahead of us. the unique nature of aaron's recurring revenue business model combined with our strong balance sheet, cash flows and operating leverage enables us to perform well during this period of uncertainty.
with that, i will now turn the call over to the operator, who will assist with the taking of your questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] your first question will come from anthony chukumba from loop capital markets. your line is open.
anthony chukumba -- loop capital markets llc -- analyst
wow, i got to ask the first question on your first call as a publicly traded company [technical issues] traded company. i am honored.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
thank you, anthony.
anthony chukumba -- loop capital markets llc -- analyst
being a little more serious, doug, congrats on a great finish to a great year. i guess i have a couple of questions. my first question is on capital allocation. so, you ended the year with essentially $76 million of cash and virtually no debt, $1 million worth of debt. you're going to generate another $80 million, $90 million of free cash flow, and your stock is trading at kind of a [indecipherable] multiple. so, i guess, i'm just wondering how do you think about capital allocation in terms of cash dividend and also share repurchases.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
yeah, anthony. hey, this is douglas. thanks for being our first questioner on our first earnings call. glad to have you here. yeah. so, we've actually -- we've got a very nice setup on our balance sheet, as you mentioned, and great cash flow prospects. as kelly mentioned, in 2021, we're going to be deploying -- give a bit of that cash that kelly laid out into internal investments in technology and real estate strategy. and that's been laid out in our outlook. we continue to focus, however, on returning capital to shareholders and that is super important to us. as you recall, at the time of the spin, when we did the roadshow, we indicated that we expect to pay a dividend of $10 million to $15 million on annual cash dividends. and that continues to be our expectation. kelly mentioned in his prepared remarks, we did accelerate our normal january dividend into november of 2020, so our shareholders wouldn't miss a payment while our new board formalizes that dividend policy and makes plans for the future and the future of our capital structure. so, that's all in process. we've also historically used share buybacks in the past to return capital to shareholders. it's something that we've been discussing. and we'll discuss as a management team, as a board, and will give you more information on that in the future, if that is something we want to pursue. and lastly, i would say, almost, is while m&a activity is not our primary focus right now, we're open to looking at strategic opportunities as they arise and we will continue to do so as part of our direct-to-consumer strategy and sort of pursuing our core strategy in the business. so, i've listed these specifically in the order of focusing on executing our existing strategies, returning capital to shareholders and then opportunistic m&a as we look to the future.
anthony chukumba -- loop capital markets llc -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then, just one follow-up question. so, in terms of the guidance, you talked about the fact that you expect sales mix stronger in the first half than the second half. i am assuming that we're seeing some sort of lingering impact from stimulus. i know that compares a little bit easier in the first half as stores were closed. i guess my question is, to the extent that there are additional disclosing consumer stimulus measures enacted, and i know that the administration is working on [indecipherable] taxes the right now, is it safe to assume that there would be upside to your current guidance?
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yeah. hey, anthony. it's kelly. you're correct. as we pointed out on the call, our outlook does not include any benefit of incremental stimulus that may be past this year. if you look back at last year, certainly we and others benefited from the stimulus that was pushed into the market. but again, it's difficult for us to forecast exactly what impact that's going to have on our business, which is obviously why we didn't include it in our outlook. a few things to note, right? while there is generally consensus it seems around the size and the makeup of what stimulus may look like, we don't know when it's going to start; we don't know, i guess, formally when it's going to end, either, right? so, it makes that a little bit challenging. the other thing that's unique this year is, as we were going into the pandemic in early 2020, the economy was in great shape, unemployment was at record lows, our customer was in a really good spot. as we sit here today, obviously, unemployment's elevated; customers, we believe, are behind in rent payments and other obligations that they have. so, we don't know exactly how they may use that stimulus when it comes available to them relative to how they used it last year. and finally, i think we'd be remiss to not point out that there is some uncertainty, right, around the tax season this year. we know it's delayed. we know that there is a high probability that our customers will have some liabilities this year that they haven't had in the past. so when you put all that together, it makes it very difficult to forecast. but as a general rule, our customer, whether it's due to rising wages, right, increasing employment or government stimulus, when they have greater liquidity, we tend to do better.
anthony chukumba -- loop capital markets llc -- analyst
got it. that's very helpful. thanks. thanks so much, guys. keep up the good work.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
thank you, anthony.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
thank you, anthony.
operator
and your next question will come from kyle joseph from jefferies. your line is open.
kyle joseph -- jefferies llc -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. congratulations on a good quarter. regarding the outlook, to your point, is better than when you provided it in november. can you give us a sense of that, because you had a bigger portfolio at the end of the fourth quarter. was that because of some incremental performance following the stimulus in december? and what really drove the improvement in the outlook?
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yeah. it was really a few things, kyle. so, we did continue to have strong collection activity, right, as we believe as we moved to the end of the year that was less impacted by stimulus and continued to be positively impacted by the roll out nationally of our centralized decisioning platform earlier in the year, as well as just the incredible performance that our operating team is putting forward in the field. so, those are two things that continue to kind of drive that. the other is, we are ending the year slightly higher, right, than what we were thinking as we were completing the roadshow. and then, to a much lesser extent, we did get some stimulus in december, which has helped in the first few weeks of the first quarter.
kyle joseph -- jefferies llc -- analyst
got it. and then just one follow-up from me, focusing on credit. would you, in this '21, sort of anticipate write-off levels normalizing? and then can you walk us through the outlook for credit performance in kind of the post-centralized underwriting, how performance has been versus your expectations? and then i guess the third leg of this question would be, highlight how e-commerce credit performance has been versus your expectations.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
yeah. hey, kyle, it's douglas. i'll let kelly talk about the outlook and what we've assumed there, but i'll just make a general comment on. as you know, and just to remind everybody, we rolled out centralized decisioning in the second quarter of 2020. a large piece of our portfolio now has been centrally decisioned. while we can't exactly differentiate our collections -- our strong collection performance this year, how much was related to that versus stimulus, we do look at the pools by sort of scoring bands, and we have great confidence that centralized decisioning is improving our results, sort of keeping customers in the right-size deal and making a stronger and healthier portfolio as we move forward. so, that's been really successful.
i think the biggest win there is probably the reaction by our team members. it simplified processes in our stores and made us more efficient in our labor model, which is great and sort of a win-win from all sides for aaron's for the customers and for our team members. in terms of e-commerce, this is, again, a big win. as you know, we had centralized decisioning in e-commerce for a long time. we've been continuing to optimize our models there and really restrict, and we've commented on this, and our recurring revenue written was down. part of that down recurring revenue written was us further optimizing our decisioning on e-com. and that has really benefited us over the course of the year and by the end of the fourth quarter, we are seeing losses that were close to half of what they were the previous fourth quarter.
so, we're seeing considerable margin flow-through in e-com and we're really happy about the decisioning there. i'll let kelly talk about 2021 write-offs.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, kyle, we've obviously enjoyed lower write-offs this year than we experienced last year and also lower than what i would consider our more normalized historic levels. as it relates to our outlook, we do expect to start to return back to those more normalized levels as well. i believe on -- during our roadshow discussion, i had put out there a range of 4% to 5% in 2021, and we currently expect that the year will play out in that range.
kyle joseph -- jefferies llc -- analyst
[technical issues] answering my questions, and congrats on a [technical issues] end to 2020.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
thanks, kyle.
operator
and your next question will come from brad thomas from keybanc capital. your line is open.
bradley b. thomas -- keybanc capital markets, inc. -- analyst
hi, good morning. douglas, kelly, mike, let me add in my congratulations as well on a great year and a first quarter here as a public company.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
thanks, brad.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
thank you.
bradley b. thomas -- keybanc capital markets, inc. -- analyst
one of my --- sure, sure. one of my first question -- i have two questions. my first question is going to be around how you all are thinking about write-offs, and you've addressed this a bit. but at this point, in overall, just trying to look at crystal ball as we figure out how will behavior in america change over the next 12 to 24 months ahead, but how are you thinking about what normalized write-offs should look like, particularly as a vaccine gets out there and some of the stimulus gets behind us?
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, just a couple of thoughts on that. but if you look at our total collection percentages, forget write-offs, last year in 2020, i mean, we were collecting 200 plus basis points higher on our portfolio than we had if we look at historic years or five years prior to that, sort of a normalized range. while we believe that stimulus helps that, we think as the vaccine rolls out and as potentially we get more stimulus and there will be a normalizing of write-offs over time, so as we move into the year, we'll see more normalizing. if we get further stimulus, we should be supported in some way. that 200 basis points of improvement is not necessarily all stimulus. it also included the benefit of centralized decisioning, which kelly mentioned. and so, as we look forward, if we have no stimulus, we would expect it to revert back to kind of our five-year averages, which is losing the 200%. and that obviously translates into both revenue reductions in the portfolio because revenue is our collected revenue, not our potential revenue, and it also translates into write-off performance, which we would see normalizing as well.
so -- kelly, i don't know if you have any additional comments to them?
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
no, i think you covered it properly.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
okay.
bradley b. thomas -- keybanc capital markets, inc. -- analyst
that's great. and then, my follow-up question, douglas, is going to be if you could help talk about some of the things that you're doing with e-commerce and with customer intention, just given the changes in the competitive landscape. and i would say that i'm on the receiving end of more calls to look at this space than i have in a long time, given spacs that are happening in the group and acquisitions of b2c players that are occurring. and so, it seems that competition is definitely heating up. on the other hand, you've just put up three of the best quarters of same-store sales in a long time. so, if you could talk a little bit about the competitive landscape and how do you feel, like, your in-store offering and e-commerce offering are perhaps better positioned than maybe investors perceive to face the competition? thanks.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
sure. i mean -- first, let me say, i'm really proud of what the team has accomplished over the past five years. we've modernized our platforms, we've centralized processes, we've built a fully transactional e-commerce business at scale, and our analytics and data systems are driving value in our company every day. and all of this is on the back of our growing e-commerce platform and an omnichannel experience for our customer that we think is definitely leading in the industry. as you know, e-com has always been a competitive advantage for us. we've got a large store network that we can leverage with global supply chain and last-mile logistics. and as we grow that, we really feel like we can drive margin performance over time. also importantly, we're acquiring on the e-com a younger, newer customer to aaron's; many of those that are shopping on our e-com site after our store hours. and so, we think we've got a huge benefit of our embedded infrastructure and layering e-com on top of that. as you saw in the quarter, we continue to drive more traffic to our site. i think the big number there was traffic was up 29% in the quarter, thanks to the terrific work that our teams are doing in customer acquisition and search; and conversion of that traffic while lower during the quarter due to inventory has also been improving over the course of the year and we expect that to get back to normalized levels in 2021. so, we're super excited about that. it's currently 13% of revenue. we expect it to be a bigger part of the business as we move forward. and as i mentioned on the last questions from kyle, probably what's most encouraging is the control of the health of the e-com portfolio and the loss rates that have been coming down.
so, as we think about e-com, we're kind of it -- i mean, even though we feel like we're in, like, inning three, i really feel like we're in inning one. we've got a lot to do. i'm going to let steve just talk briefly about our roadmap for it on e-com.
steve olsen -- president
sure. thanks, douglas. as we discussed in the investor roadshow, we have a multi-year roadmap to drive our e-com business really focused around digitizing that journey for the customer and then putting them in control. a few things in '21 that we're working on in this area are, first, i'd call up personalization. we want to continue to connect our site to the point of entry for the customer and then give them content that's relative maybe to their prior site experience. we want to continue to enhance the shopping experience, whether that's content, whether that's better filtering of functionality and obviously, an expanded assortment that we continue to add to. we're going to continue to focus on our site performance to make that a great experience and hopefully remove any friction for that customer and modernize our self-service platform, so really putting the customer in control, allowing them to really manage their accounts, their payments, get servicing that they need and asking questions. so, we're really excited about the road map we have for e-com and it's really going to build upon as we move throughout the year.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
yeah. so, mr. brad, i think as we look to the future, direct-to-consumer online is hugely -- a big part of our strategy and hugely important to us. we're adding more products and we will be looking at any and all things and going to help advances in that area.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yeah. and brad, it's kelly. i have just one more thing to add, right, that we view as a differentiator around our model. i mean, we take a true omnichannel approach and stores are key element of our strategy, which enables the return of product from customers. so, that does a few things. right? obviously, better experience for our customer. right? and the second thing is that with returns, with that model, we can go deeper into the risk portfolio to serve more customers. and then finally, we're able to extend terms. so, up to 24-month terms, which allow for lower monthly payments for our customers.
bradley b. thomas -- keybanc capital markets, inc. -- analyst
perfect. that's all really helpful. thank you all so much.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
and your next question will come from bobby griffin from raymond james. your line is open.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
good morning, bobby.
bobby griffin -- raymond james -- analyst
thank you for taking my questions, and congrats on having spinned on and now operating as a public company on your own.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
thanks, bobby.
bobby griffin -- raymond james -- analyst
i guess, ultimately, i want to dive a little bit into 2021 guidance and just maybe understand a little better what's assumed for written revenues into the portfolio in 2021? if we start to lap the centralized decisioning changes you guys made in 2q of 2021, written revenues then start to grow back into the portfolio as we lap that?
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yes. bobby, there's kind of a few things going on there as it relates to the portfolio. obviously, as part of our real estate repositioning and remodeling strategy, we expect to continue to consolidate stores. as we laid out in the roadshow, over the next five years, there's -- 20% to 30% of our current company-owned stores will be merged into existing stores with their markets. that leads to a reduction in the portfolio. so -- but i'd say that on a same-store set, right, we have a combination of continuing kind of at our current pace of revenue written in. but at the same time, collections, as we've mentioned before, will begin to return to more normalized levels. we believe that offsets though, in terms of the impact that has on revenues with a higher quality portfolio. so, one of the real benefits for our centralized decisioning is that we sit here today with a much higher quality book of leases. and so, as we collect more on those leases and have less returns as a percentage of the total pool, the expectation is that will ultimately result in kind of 0% to 2% positive comps for the year.
bobby griffin -- raymond james -- analyst
okay.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
and bobby, the way i'd...
bobby griffin -- raymond james -- analyst
[speech overlap] i'm sorry.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
the way i think about it is, we'll be comping through the second quarter against that revenue written. so, our approval rates are down 6% to 8%. so, you should expect pressure over the first two quarters against the prior year. and then, a relief of that pressure in the second half of the year. i think one of the bridging items that kelly was getting to on same-store revenues is that while revenue written into the portfolio is a leading indicator of the size of the portfolio, so is what we churned out of the portfolio. and last year, we churned out considerably less customers than we had previously and we'd mentioned that product returns were lower, as were write-offs, and that's a component of our portfolio health that we're keeping customers in the portfolio. we would expect in 2021 to have higher churn than we did ex-stimulus, than we did in 2020, which puts pressure on the portfolio and therefore, even though we have a larger size to begin the year, we see it more normalizing and that's why we're guiding to a 0% to 2% same-store sales.
bobby griffin -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. yeah, i was -- i should have probably cleared my question up, but i was thinking more on a comp basis, realizing you guys are closing stores. just for modeling purposes, is there a rough estimate of store count closures that we should assume or relocation that we should assume in 2021 in our models?
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think our plan this year is probably to close roughly 50 stores.
bobby griffin -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. okay, perfect. and i guess lastly from me, you mentioned you saw a little bit of uptick with the recent stimulus, i think the $600 checks. but just looking at that, was the customer behavior similar to the first stimulates where the prepayments or what they looked at or what they bought or just anything that help us think about how your customers behave this round? and maybe we can kind of translate that a little bit into what would happen if there is another around of stimulus versus the first time we got it back in the summer months, in the heart of the pandemic?
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yeah. bobby, that's a great question. i mean, unfortunately, it's very difficult for us to answer. right? because -- i mean, first -- when that first round of stimulus came in, we also rolled out centralized decisioning nationally. there was also the proven operations under our new chief store operations officer, ryan malone, that was driving that as well. so, it's hard for us to disaggregate exactly how much of the lift that we saw in 2020 is attributable to stimulus. you put on top of that, it's -- the way it's flowing out is different. so, you might recall that customers received the stimulus over a longer period of time back in q1 and q2, whether that was checked in [indecipherable] or just delays in the electronic transfer of funds. and on top of that, the one-time stimulus also includes the enhanced weekly unemployment benefit. you roll forward to december, what did we see. right? so, the $600 rolled out. it rolled out much quicker, because folks were expecting it and it was more quickly delivered. on top of that, that $600 did not include any monthly unemployment benefit, which quite candidly, i think, as we sit back and think about it, is the bigger driver of the stimulus, because we benefited from that over a period of months [phonetic] in 2020, whereas this $600 stimulus in december was a one-time pop. at the same time, and i mentioned this earlier, our customers are just in a different spot at the end of 2020 and at the beginning of 2021 than they were going into pandemic. so, how they used the stimulus was likely much different.
bobby griffin -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then i guess lastly for me, just on the supply chain. you guys called it out in the release that the guidance assumes in moderating, giving a little better. but when we look at it sequentially, has all categories that were seeing issues started to improve? or has there been some categories that have taken a step back in terms of availability or move in the right direction across the board?
steve olsen -- president
hey, bobby. this is steve. i'm glad to answer that. i would say that we've seen moderate improvement across all categories. so, from a demand perspective, you're seeing that the categories that throughout the summer and into the fall, that we're continuing to grow, whether it was appliances, computers, things like that. but from a supply perspective, we work daily with our suppliers to pre-plan the flow of inventory wins coming and what their outlook is. so, we're optimistic and believe that we'll see continued modest improvement across all our categories as we moved into '21.
bobby griffin -- raymond james -- analyst
great. well, i appreciate the details. best of luck here in the first quarter.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from alex moroccia from berenberg. your line is open.
alex moroccia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
good morning, guys. thanks for taking my questions. just starting with macro-level one. can you discuss the impact that a minimum wage increase would have on your business from both an expense standpoint, as well as how it may change your customer profiles?
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
it's a great question, alex. so, the $15 minimum wage. i'd first want to kind of point out a few things, right? it's kind of working its way through the system in dc. but there seems to be some consensus around how that may look, although there doesn't seem to be consensus yet that it's going to pass. but in terms of how it's going to look, it will be phased out over a five-year period. and with that, what we can say is that in 2021, so this year, there would be no impact to our personnel expense, if it goes through as contemplated. and as you roll into 2022, the impact on our business would be less than $1 million in terms of the increase to personnel expense. beyond that, it just becomes much more difficult for us to kind of forecast, because there's a few moving parts, right? we are continuing to consolidate our stores. we're also continuing to invest in technology, which not only improves the customer experience, but it's also improving our efficiencies. so, again, while no impact this year, modest impact in 2021 and beyond that, difficult for us to forecast as our operations continue to evolve.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
yeah, alex, and this is douglas. it's important to note that our base wage rate across our store networks is close to that number. and we have also variable pay that, as well, makes sense of that number. and so, our comp ranges are higher than $15 in total -- on average, across the portfolio.
alex moroccia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
okay, and i understood. that's really helpful. and then just a follow-up on the comments you made regarding inventories in the supply chain at the moment. how much revenue do you think was left on the table in 2020? and then how do you make sure customers come to aaron's before other peers, ones of appliances and electronics in particular, get restocked?
steve olsen -- president
yeah, sure. so -- hey, alex. this is steve. i'll answer the second half of the question first. through all of our marketing, whether it's broadcast, whether it's email, whether it's digital, we are weekly marketing messages around our assortment offering, around our price points and really tying that to our value proposition and why we think aaron's is a great place to shop. and we are seeing the benefits of that through q4 in the performance. as far as impact of inventory, i guess earlier in 2020 and as it moved through, tough to quantify. i'd say that like most people out there, we saw probably a low point during the summer months, but that has continued to improve. what we definitely can say, and we mentioned in our prepared remarks, is definitely we saw an impact to e-com as our e-com business is supported by our new inventory that we carry in our fulfillment centers. but we have the luxury of having pre-leased or returned merchandise in our stores. so, that allows us to balance our inventory between new and improved products throughout our network.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think it's also important to note, we serve a large target market of just roughly 30% of the u.s. population with products that they look for on the payment. and that's what really differentiates us, payment, and we believe our payments are very competitive in the marketplace. and that combined with our high approval rates and best-in-class service, i think, is a compelling value proposition for our customers and that's why customers continue to shop. we, as part of our strategy, will continue to evangelize that and use that in our marketing and other customer acquisition channels and we think we've got a lot of room to run there. so, we're super optimistic about that and the technology and support systems that we put behind it.
alex moroccia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
all right, great. thank you both.
operator
and your next question will come from john haas from bank of america. your line is open.
jason haas -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks. it's jason haas. thanks for taking my question.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
hey, jason.
jason haas -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys. so, i wanted to ask on decisioning. maybe if you could provide some color on whether that's -- if you've been able to loosen that at all relative to 3q, just given the stimulus that's coming. it sounds like maybe your customer base is maybe more mixed in terms of the health of them. but, yeah, just curious, any color on how that decisioning compares?
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
yeah. i don't want to speak specifically to any loosening or tightening or anything else we've done. what i will say is, we continually optimize our decisioning and we did so all of last year in 2020. we are optimizing our e-com decisioning, which led to great benefits in that portfolio for us and as we rolled out our centralized decisioning at our stores, we've continued to see performance of lease pools and we're optimizing. some of that optimization is giving sort of our higher-scored customers and our decisioning matrix more purchasing power with us, and some of it is finding areas where we need to sort of adjust our model. and so, i think we've been doing that over the course of the year and we're seeing the benefits of that, and we will continue to do that on a monthly basis.
jason haas -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great, thanks. and then final question, a little more longer-term focus. is there still an expectation that -- i understand ebitda will be, i guess, down year-over-year in 2021. but i think there is an expectation that it would grow after that, due to the store consolidation strategy. so, i'm curious if that's right, that's how we should be thinking about it longer-term?
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
jason, yes, it's kelly. you're correct in continuing to think about it that way. you recall it correctly. in our road show presentation, we did outline kind of a five-year view, and that included sequential year-over-year growth in earnings after kind of this 2021 reset year, if you will. revenues are expected to decline at the front end of that five-year period and then about midway through reverse course and start to grow, as we continue to roll out our new stores and see the benefit of those stores and kind of the growth that they're currently demonstrating and that kind of takes a larger percentage of the portfolio and then translates into both top line growth and bottom line growth.
jason haas -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great, thanks. and if i could add in one more question, you mentioned that staffing levels have picked up, i think, sequentially quarter-over-quarter. i think -- i know there were some cuts there due to the pandemic. it's been tough to get a read on that just because i'm not sure to what extent centralized decisioning has allowed you to take out some labor hours. so, i'm curious if 4q staffing levels have returned to normal, or are we still running at a lower rate because of the pandemic, or is there sort of like a lower term, long-term rate because of that centralized decisioning? thanks.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
sure. jason, it's douglas. so, first of all, we're open for business on all of our stores across the u.s. and canada right now. and so, what you're seeing in our labor costs in q4 is reflective of full portfolio being open. what i would say generally is, we're better staffed now than we were in q2 and q3. so, labor has come up. we're still understaffed relative to historical perspectives and not at our target levels for this year. our 2021 outlook, however, reflects full staffing of our portfolio. so, that's really important to know that reflects full staffing. it does also reflect sort of, what i call, sort of right level staffing for the technology that we introduced last year in centralized decisioning. for the payments, we're now taking 70 plus percent of our payments outside of store. and so, we've really made it easier to run an aaron's store and that's all reflected in our staffing outlook for 2021.
jason haas -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great, thank you. that's really helpful.
operator
and your final question for today will come from john rowan from janney. your line is open.
john rowan -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
good morning, guys.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
good morning.
john rowan -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
doug, i think you said earlier that there'll be tax liabilities this year for the consumers that they are not expecting or haven't been there in the past. just wondering if you could be specific as to what you're referencing.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
yeah. we were -- i think kelly referred to that. we were referencing, as we look out to the end of the first quarter, beginning of the second quarter, our customers will be receiving tax checks as they usually do. so, from what we can tell, those tax checks may be -- the size of those checks may be pressured by withholdings for unemployment taxes that were not withheld or chose not to be withheld by the consumer during the year. and so, we may have pressure on those checks that could put pressure on that overall tax season.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, john, unemployment benefits, right, are taxable. so, to the extent that that's not addressed in any legislation that may come forward, all right, then it would create a tax liability for our customers they're not accustomed to seeing, given the unprecedented level of unemployment benefits they received last year.
john rowan -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
okay.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
well, yeah, in some states, they are -- they don't withhold those federal taxes. at some stage, you have to opt in. so...
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
correct.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
if you have bigger order consumers, you don't opt in to pay those taxes. they will owe those taxes this year, for last year.
john rowan -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
and then, are you going to be seeing or did you see any weather interruptions? and is that included in the guidance for one-half earnings being stronger than two-half earnings?
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
yes, of course. we, like everyone else, experienced the weather issues over the last few weeks. we had stores in texas and in the middle part of the country shut down for a period of time. a bigger news about our business is, we have a recurring revenue model that allows us to withstand the shocks to the system as we did last year with covid-19. and so, we've got a portfolio that keeps on rolling. our customers have returned to us once the weather cleared up and we've seen a rebound there. but all of that has been reflected in this guidance for 2021.
john rowan -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
okay, and then just lastly. i think, kelly, you said 50 store closure for 2021 is a good guide. is that kind of a good cadence to get us down to the correct store number through the 2025 guide? or is there going to be a deviation from that run rate post 2021? thank you.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
yeah. so, it is douglas. so, what we think about that is we're going to continue to be optimizing and repositioning our portfolio over the course of the year. we have a number of opportunities i mentioned, collapse two or three stores into one store in certain markets with our new gennext concept, and we'll be doing that. i believe what we guided to on the roadshow was about a 20% to 30% reduction in our portfolio over the next five years, which equates to roughly 300 stores. so, that should put us on track for that. i think in any given year, we may accelerate or decelerate based on real estate opportunities, but that would be tracking to that ultimate goal.
john rowan -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
all right, thank you.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
thanks.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer

operator
thank you for standing by and welcome to the aaron's company first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i'd now like to hand the conference over to michael dickerson, vice president of corporate communications and investor relations for aaron's. mr. dickerson, please go ahead.
michael p. dickerson -- vice president, corporate communications and investor relations
thank you and good morning, everyone. welcome to the aaron's company first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. joining me this morning are douglas lindsay, aaron's chief executive officer; steve olsen, aaron's president; and kelly wall aaron's chief financial officer. after our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.
many of you have already seen a copy of our earnings release issued this morning. for those of you that have not, it is available on the investor relations section of our website at investor.aarons.com.
during this call, certain statements we make will be forward-looking, including our financial performance outlook for 2021. i want to call your attention to our safe harbor provision for forward-looking statements that could be found at the end of our earnings release. the safe harbor provision identifies risks that may cause actual results to differ materially from the content of our forward-looking statements. also, please see our form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020, and other periodic filings with the sec for a description of the risks related to our business that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements.
on today's call, we will be referring to certain non-gaap financial measures including ebitda and adjusted ebitda. non-gaap net earnings and non-gaap eps, which have been adjusted for certain items which may affect the comparability of our performance with other companies. these non-gaap measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings release.
with that, i will now turn the call over to our ceo douglas lindsay.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
thanks, mike and thank you for joining us today. i'm very pleased with the strong start to 2021 and the positive momentum in revenue and margins we delivered in the first quarter, demonstrating the strong operating leverage in our business. consolidated revenues increased 11.1% year-over-year in our first full quarter as a stand-alone public company. the revenue increase included same-store revenue growth of 14.8% and we reported adjusted ebitda margin that improved to 15.4% of revenues. this is the first quarter in over a decade that the company has delivered double-digit same-store revenue growth. our teams in the field and our store support centers and woodhaven are performing at a very high level and are energized and engaged.
as i visit aaron's stores around the country to support our operations team, i'm seeing a strong sense of pride and optimism about our brand and our competitive position. our team members and customers are embracing the innovation that we are delivering and the dynamic lease-to-own market. over the last five years, we've significantly transformed the company for the goal of continuing to provide an exceptional customer and team member experience while also driving greater efficiencies in our operating model. i'm proud to say that as of today we have a centralized decisioning platform that provides greater control and predictability resulting in a higher quality lease portfolio.
we have enhanced digital payment platforms that are enabling over 75% of monthly customer payments to be made outside of our stores. we have an industry-leading, fully transactional e-commerce platform that is attracting a new and younger customer, and we have a portfolio of 51 gennext stores that is currently outperforming our expectations with many more store openings in the pipeline. all of these initiatives are underpinned by the investments that we have made in enhanced analytics and when combined with our more efficient operations are enabling us to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth. these transformations to our business model are contributing to our outstanding performance in the first quarter of 2021.
we are encouraged by the continuing improvement and the quality and size of our same-store lease portfolio, which ended the quarter up 6.2% compared to the end of the first quarter of 2020. this improvement was primarily driven by strong demand for our products, few release merchandise returns, and lower inventory write-offs. in addition, our customer continues to benefit from the ongoing government stimulus, one of the most meaningful contributors to our strong portfolio performance was centralized decisioning, which we implemented across all company-operated stores in the u.s., in the spring of 2020. today, nearly 70% of our portfolio is made up of lease agreements that were originated using this technology. centralized decisioning delivers consistency and predictability in the performance of our lease portfolio. it enables store managers the flexibility to focus their time on growth-oriented activities such as sales and lease servicing. we believe our algorithms provide better outcomes for both the customer and aaron's with the goal of having a greater number of customers achieve ownership while at the same time reducing our cost to serve. we continue to refine this decisioning across our various channels, and we expect this will continue to drive greater productivity from our lease portfolio.
another contributor to our strong performance in the quarter was our e-commerce channel, which represented more than 14% of lease revenues. our e-commerce team has really delivered, driving traffic growth to aarons.com by 12.8% and increasing revenues by 42% in the first quarter as compared to the prior-year quarter. e-commerce lease originations increased as compared to the year-ago quarter despite the significant shift of customer activity through our online platform in march of 2020 as stores closed during the early days of the covid-19 pandemic.
in addition, e-commerce write-offs improved by more than 50% compared to last year's quarter, primarily as a result of ongoing decisioning optimization, operational enhancements, and strong customer payment activity. our e-commerce team continues to deliver ongoing improvements through our online customer acquisition, conversion, and servicing capabilities, which is leading to margin growth and continued positive momentum in this important channel. our e-commerce growth in the quarter is enabled by our stores, which are not just showrooms and service centers but are also last-mile logistics hubs delivering an expanded assortment of products with same or next day delivery.
finally, our real estate repositioning and reinvestment strategy is gaining momentum and we expect it will drive future growth. our new gennext stores have larger and more modern showrooms, expanded product assortment, and improved brand imaging and digital technologies. to date, we have opened 51 new gennext stores and have generated results that are meeting or exceeding our targeted internal rate of return equally as encouraging, monthly lease originations in the first quarter. our plan for 2021 is to plan to open in the second and third quarters. while we're excited about both the early financial results and the infrastructure we're building to accelerate our progress, we continue to maintain a disciplined approach around our execution of this strategy.
before i turn the call over to kelly, let me reiterate how pleased i am with the strong performance of our teams and the results we have delivered in the first quarter of this year. we remain focused on our key strategic initiatives of simplifying and digitizing the customer experience, aligning our store footprint to our customer opportunity and promoting the aaron's value proposition of low payments high approval rates and best-in-class service.
i'll now turn the call over to kelly wall to discuss our financial results.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
thank you, douglas. for the first quarter of 2021, revenues were $481.1 million compared to $432.8 million for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 11.1%. the increase in revenues was primarily due to the improving quality and increased size of our lease portfolio and strong customer payment activity during the quarter, aided in part by government stimulus and partially offset by the net reduction of 166 company-operated and franchised stores compared to the prior year.
as douglas called out earlier, e-commerce revenues were up 42% compared to the first quarter of the prior year and represented 14.2% of overall lease revenues compared to 11.3% in 2020. on a same-store revenue basis, revenues increased 14.8% in the first quarter compared to the prior-year quarter, the first double-digit, same-store revenue growth since 2009, and our fourth consecutive positive quarter. same-store revenue growth was primarily driven by a larger same-store lease portfolio and strong customer payment activity, including retail sales and early purchase option exercises. we believe this growth is partially a result of the government stimulus programs passed in 2020 and 2021. additionally, the company ended the first quarter of 2021 with a lease portfolio size for all company operated stores of $128.8 million, an increase of 3.6% compared to the lease portfolio size as of march 31, 2020. lease portfolio size represents the next month's total collectible lease payments from our aggregate outstanding customer lease agreements. please see our form 10-q filed this morning for additional detail.
operating expenses excluding restructuring expenses, spin-related transaction costs and the impairment of goodwill and other expenses, which were both recorded in the first quarter of 2020 were down $1.5 million as compared to the first quarter of last year. this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in write-offs, store closures and the impact of the covid-related reserves recorded in 2020, partially offset by higher personnel costs related to variable performance compensation, higher marketing expenses and an increase in bank and credit card related fees.
adjusted ebitda was $73.9 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared with $34.7 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of $39.2 million or 112.9%. as a percentage of total revenues, adjusted ebitda was 15.4% in the first quarter of 2021 compared with 8% for the same period last year, an improvement of 740 basis points. the improvement in adjusted ebitda margin was primarily due to the items that drove the total revenues increase and a 310 basis point reduction in overall write-offs to 3.1% of lease revenues, including both improvement in the e-commerce and store origination channels compared to the prior year. the improvement in write-offs was due primarily to the implementation of new decisioning technology, improved operations, the benefit of government stimulus and the impact of covid-related lease merchandise reserves recorded in the first quarter of 2020 and not repeated in 2021.
on a non-gaap basis, diluted earnings per share were $1.24 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to non-gaap diluted earnings per share of $0.30 for the same quarter in 2020, an increase of $0.94 or 313.3%. cash generated from operating activities was $20.2 million for the first quarter of 2021, a decline of $36.6 million compared to the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher inventory purchases, partially offset by higher customer payments and other changes in working capital. during the quarter, the company purchased 252,200 shares of aaron's common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $6.3 million.
as of the end of the quarter, we had approximately $143.7 million remaining under the company's share repurchase authorization that was approved by our board on march 3rd of this year. the company's board of directors also declared our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share last month and we paid the dividend on april 6. as of march 31, 2021 the company had a cash balance of $61.1 million, less than $500,000 of debt and total available liquidity of $295.5 million. turning to our outlook, based on our performance in the first quarter of 2021 and the passage of the american rescue plan act in march, we have revised our full-year 2021 outlook. for the full year, we expect consolidated revenues of between $1.725 billion and $1.775 billion representing an increase in our revenue outlook of $75 million.
we also expect adjusted ebitda of between $190 and $205 million, representing an increase in our adjusted ebitda outlook of $35 million. for the full year 2021, our outlook for the effective tax rate, depreciation and amortization and diluted weighted average share count are unchanged. we have also increased our full-year same-store revenue outlook from a range of 0% to 2% to a range of 4% to 6%. similar to our original outlook, total revenue and adjusted ebitda in the first half of 2021 are expected to be higher in the second half of 2021. this outlook assumes no impact from the expansion and acceleration of the child tax credit payments expected to begin in july 2021. additionally, our updated outlook assumes no significant deterioration in the current retail environment or in the state of the u.s. economy, as compared to its current condition and a continued improvement in global supply chain conditions. with that, i will now turn the call over to the operator who will assist with your questions.

good morning, thanks for taking my question and wow, i mean just wow, great results. congrats on that.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
thank you.
anthony chukumba -- loop capital markets llc -- analyst
i guess i have a couple of questions. first question, you mentioned, kelly just mentioned on the supply chain, just wanted you to give us an update, i know supply chain was a bit of headwind late last year. i was wondering if what you're seeing in terms of supply chain now [technical issues] market maybe that [technical issues] drivers. thanks.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
hey, anthony. it's douglas. thanks for the question. yeah, i just want to say, i'm really proud of the team. we got a lot of momentum and energy in the business right now and both channels are really performing well. i think in terms of supply chain, we're seeing continued improvement there in our inventory levels, and we definitely have sufficient inventory to run the business right now. i'm going to kick it to steve olsen, just to give you a little bit more detail on what's happened in the last quarter and our outlook for supply chain.
steve olsen -- president
yeah, thanks douglas. good morning, anthony. yeah. as douglas said, we're seeing continued improvement and that continued throughout q1 and absolutely supported the high level of demand that we saw across categories. as we look through the balance of the year, we believe we're going to see continued improvement from q2 to q3 and it's really now just about fine tuning that inventory across categories and across price points just to get to that exact level we're looking for.
anthony chukumba -- loop capital markets llc -- analyst
got it. and then just one, outlook [technical issues] but i am going through my notes and you had said when you provided your guidance [technical issues] expecting about a 4% to 5% write-off rate in 2021, given the reduction, the write-off rate and given the improvements that you've talked about with centralized decisioning and [technical issues]. i was just wondering if you could -- if that guidance could change at all. thank you.

yeah, hey, anthony, it's kelly. that guidance still kind of holds for the rest of the year. i mean as a reminder, right, as we go through q3 and certainly into q4, absent the impact of the changes to the child tax credits, the stimulus is going to start delaying. and so we will kind of model our business to be in that 4% to 5% write-off range as we're fine tuning the optimization of our lease decisioning and so we expect to continue to see that flow through into the p&l.
anthony chukumba -- loop capital markets llc -- analyst

kyle joseph with jefferies. your line is open.
kyle joseph -- jeferries llc -- analyst
hey, good morning guys, congratulations on a really, really strong start to the year. i just want to dig into the impact on -- of stimulus on the quarter and i don't know if you can give us kind of the trajectory of the comp between january, february and march and even into april, just based on when we saw stimulus hit. i just want to get a sense for consumer behavior and buyout activity versus new leases, if you could walk us through that?
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
sure i'll start. it's douglas. from what we're seeing with the customer, they are more liquid than we've really ever seen. we recognize it's difficult time where there is higher unemployment right now but our customers are receiving cheques and getting stimulus payments and despite the unemployment challenges, they are making more payments than we've seen in a while, more online payments, more customers achieving ownership and there is really strong demand for our product. and you saw that come through in our comp store sales up 14.8%. i would say as we sort of chunk that same-store sales number, i'd say, about a third of that performance is relative to the larger lease portfolio size and that's in part due to lower churn out of our portfolio because of the liquidity in the marketplace, but also because of our centralized decisioning. so that's a third of that and as i mentioned on the call, our same-store lease portfolio is up about 6% in the quarter, which at the end of the quarter, which is a good number. about another third of our same-store comp in this quarter was related to just strong customer payment activity, renewal rates of our customers and our lease portfolio were much higher, and we saw that really spike when the checks came out in march and so that was super helpful. and then about a third of our performance in our comp stores of 14.8% was related to higher retail sales and higher early payouts that we've seen in previous years. and so that's kind of the way we're looking at it. so how much stimulus contributes to each of those pieces. we definitely know the retail sales in epo was helped by stimulus. it's hard to disaggregate on the payment side and on the lease portfolio side, the contribution of stimulus relative to all the other things we're doing in the business to streamline payments and decision our customer to have a healthier portfolio. we know those are influencing the business and we're really pleased with where the business is today. in terms of outlook, i mean i'll let kelly really speak to -- as we look at that -- those comps going forward.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yes, kyle. so obviously we posted a very strong first quarter and then we're guiding to between 4% and 6% for the year as we see that play out in qs 2, and 3, and 4. first, want to remind you that for q3 -- q3, and q4, we're comping over nice increase in the last year, right? 7.3% up in q3 last year, 3.4% up in q4. so what you're going to see is q2 will be strong and in q3 and q4 will be less than q2 as that kind of flows through the course of the year, get a little a comp in over. but again, in total that up 4% to 6% for the year, something we're very excited about.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
yes, and one thing i also want to mention about the health of the portfolio, since we rolled out centralized decisioning, we have more levers than ever to control our performance and really optimizing performance of our portfolio. the churn or the reduction in our product returns and write-offs that we saw this quarter is nothing new. we've been experiencing that since we rolled out centralized decisioning in april last year, and so when you combine sort of our ability to move the levers up and down and control the health of the portfolio with the strong demand we're seeing, we're optimistic about what we've done in the business and our ability to drive portfolio performance in the future.
kyle joseph -- jeferries llc -- analyst
got it. very helpful. one follow-up for me. obviously, you guys have two quarters now as an independent company, going back to the longer-term kind of five-year plan you guys laid out in november. given the really strong two quarters out of the gate, can you talk about your confidence in executing on that longer-term plan?
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yes, kyle. it's kelly. i'd say that we're as confident as we've been at any point since the decision was made to split the two businesses last year. just the performance across the business, obviously q1 speaks for itself. but what you're not seeing behind the scenes is us continuing to fine-tune our model, right, and the investments we're making around on the marketing side, the investments we're making around our real estate strategy, the investments we're making in technology, the people that we brought on board. as douglas mentioned in his prepared remarks, everyone is super excited about where we're at and where we're headed. so yes, i'd say we feel really good about that five-year plan.
kyle joseph -- jeferries llc -- analyst
got it. congrats again on a good quarter and thanks for answering my questions.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
thank you, kyle.

alex moroccia with berenberg, your line is open.
alex moroccia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
thanks. first one is about your addressable market. in many cases, we've seen consumer balance sheets that are stronger today than pre-pandemic. however, have you seen anything that implies customer credit quality has improved through all the government stimulus?
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
yes, this is douglas. yes, it's tough to say. we've got, we have customers that are graduating. first of all, we believe our market size is roughly the same, we know in recessionary times our market expands, we're in actually very unique times right now because of the stimulus that's in place. what we're seeing with our customers, our customer has more liquidity than they've had in the past. and with that liquidity, they're not necessarily going out and buying more things for cash. they're still using our product offering, which is the lease to get into low monthly payments and they're paying their monthly obligations at a more regular rate. so that's one general thing about the customer. in terms of credit, we are approving more customers. they're are coming in through our portfolio and seeing a higher quality customer in our portfolio and we believe that's happening for two reasons. one, there's just the liquidity out there is making our customer have better credit quality and two, that the -- we have customers coming into our space or falling down into our space from credit tightening up above. so we -- we're seeing definite demand in this space more so than we saw in the past year or two.
alex moroccia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
okay, great, and second, the strength in e-com really stood out to me. given the amount of online competition, can you remind us how your customer acquisition and retention strategies differ between e-commerce and in-store?
steve olsen -- president
sure. hey, alex. this is steve olsen. the key difference is on our acquisition strategy. it really starts with our digital marketing efforts. so we are -- continue to invest in direct more of our marketing dollars to these digital marketing efforts and really about targeting the right audience and then engaging them with a relevant content and messaging and then from there it's about giving them a great user experience on our website. we continue to expand our assortment that we offer on our website. we continue to get more visibility to both our inventory, both in our fc, and our stores, and then give them the right functionality to navigate. and that calls the third piece and douglas has talked about. i'll just mention that e-commerce decisioning engine. it's been the backbone of our e-commerce platform for over five years, and it really helps us to make the right decisions with our customer.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
yes, alex. the last thing i'd say on that is, we feel like we have a real competitive advantage in the e-com. if you think about our embedded infrastructure stores, our stores are not just retail showrooms. they are service centers, and they are last-mile logistics hub. so as we expand our product assortment and find better ways and more efficient ways to convert the customer online, it's a high margin business and we're attracting a new and younger customer, and in many cases, we're getting more and more products online that we can deliver same day or next day. so, that's super encouraging and i'm really proud of the progress the team has made not just in customer acquisition but in conversion and delivery. and it's an exciting channel for us.
alex moroccia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
all right, that's helpful. thank you all.

jason hass with bank of america, your line -- your line is open.
jason haas -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great, thanks for taking my questions. i wanted to dig into the guidance change a little bit. so you had a really strong 1q, so i'm curious to know how much of that raising guidance was due to heeding expectations you are bidding your plan in 1q versus whether anything changed with your outlook for 2q, 3q, and 4q.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yes, great question, jason. it's kelly. so certainly, a large part of that raise is the fee that we had in q1, but that's kind of got to piggyback on some of the things that, douglas and steve have been talking about. we continue to see great performance in terms of our customers making payments as well as us driving demand and new agreements. so with the larger portfolio size, the higher customer payment activity and the resulting lower write-off. we felt it was prudent to just kind of take out that outlook, not just for the qnb, but also for the performance that we expect to see through the remainder of the year.
jason haas -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. that's very helpful, and then as a follow-up, can you give a little bit more longer-term. i'm curious, just given the recent strength, if that causes you to change your plans for reducing the store base if you feel like maybe it made sense to us to keep some of the more stores open just given the strong performance. and then i think there has been some questions that i've received just about any potential to accelerate that pace of closures. so i'm curious if anything has changed with regards to that long-term plan?
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
hey jason, nothing's really changed. we continue to assess it, but our strategies are the same. our objective is to have fewer more profitable stores in the same margins we're serving today. so -- but having a bigger storefront presence that's also a logistics hub, servicing hub but also having a growing e-commerce presence and that's not about sort of shrinking to grow. it's effectively being optimizing our markets and being more efficient in our markets, lowering our cost of service, still servicing those markets. and i mean we're super excited about that strategy and as you see during the quarter. i mean we've opened to date 51 stores and that's a combination of renovations in place, repositioning and these 2 to 1 or 3 to1 merge strategies, which in the case of those mergers, we think we're just creating a more efficient store footprint for the markets we're serving.
in terms of moving faster, i do want to call out which i've done in the past. so, we've intentionally shortened lease term over the past few years to be able to pivot our portfolio and we're really are optimally positioned to do that and we're really making great progress there. we have scaled our operations teams and our real estate teams to move faster and we have implementation teams on the ground actually, real time implementing these store roll-outs. however, we're really trying to take a disciplined approach to our site selection, given the long-term commitments of these leases which are, let's call it 5 to 7 years. so, we may do a 100 stores next year, which is approximately 10% of our portfolio, which would effectively be kind of where we are at the end of this year as well. and again, this will be a combination of renovate in place and relocations. but it's, of course, always as with real estate subject to market conditions permitting landlord negotiations and construction timelines which limit us but our efforts will be if this continues to work, which we believe it is and we'll try to accelerate our progress as much as possible in a disciplined way.

tim vierengel with northcoast research. your line is open.
tim vierengel -- northcoast research -- analyst
thank you. i guess, just one quick maybe higher level question just centered around your sense of decisioning commentary and based off maybe my understanding or our team of here, e-commerce write offs versus in-store typically been much higher historically and i was wondering in a normalized environment outside of all this noise from stimulus if you guys think that e-commerce write-offs can be in line with the expected write offs longer term or e-commerce will continue to be held at more risky than brick and mortar. thanks.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
yes. i'm really proud of what the team's accomplished with their e-commerce business and optimizing decisioning there, we've made several changes to our decisioning over the past few years. as you may know, our e-com decisioning, centralized decisioning is sort of more established -- we've had it out there for 5 plus years and really seeing the benefits of that. we don't approve as many customers in e-com, but we're getting smarter about our approvals. our loss rates there have come down considerably they improve year-over-year about 50% and they continue to improve.
the delta is now much lower than it used to be between in-store and e-com write-offs and -- but i don't think however that they will ever sort of match each other and there's a couple of reasons on e-com, we have a much higher occurrence of new customers as we go and attract a new customer, a new customer naturally has a higher write-off and on the e-com, it's mainly new product, which if you think about our stores have a mix of pre-leased and new products and pre-lease products are more highly depreciated and have a lower book value and so when you're writing off an asset or a piece of inventory on the e-com, it tends to have a higher book value per skew. so combination of new customers and new product always naturally have higher loss rate but we're really, really pleased with the way we're performing there.
tim vierengel -- northcoast research -- analyst

bradley b. thomas -- keybanc capital markets, inc. -- analyst
hi, thanks. good morning. let me add congrats as well on a great start to the year here.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
thank you.
bradley b. thomas -- keybanc capital markets, inc. -- analyst
i just wanted to follow up on that last, sure, well deserved. i just want to follow up on that last question about the write-offs, you're obviously doing some really compelling things like around the central decisioning and so i guess as you kind of piece apart this unusual time we're in where customers are behaving in a much more capable in the year to ahead here, where do you target the write-offs?
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
and i appreciate you kind of calling that out. i mean, i'd be remiss if we didn't also point to just the great performance of our teams in the field. the centralized decisioning one part of it and important part, but the daily activity that goes on across our teams to work with our customers to ensure that they are in a position to make those payments and to collect on those monthly payments is making a big difference as well. so we're running a much more balanced business today than really, you know i've seen, since i have been here for sure, and that's helping.
as it relates to kind of the longer-term view here, it's very hard for us to kind of parse through the data and understand exactly how much of this improvement is attributed to the government stimulus, but we do know just in looking at our modeling and going off our expectations coming into the cycle with our centralized decisioning that, that piece of the business is performing well and we would expect that to continue. just a little bit of insight right as we think about the back half of this year and certainly as we start to put our thoughts around the following year. our expectations is that the business will continue to perform at levels north of what we saw in -- call it that, 2017-'18-'19 fiscal periods and that kind of underlines our confidence that it's as much what we're doing on our end to drive the business forward as it is the increased flexibility that's been provided by the government. so, hopefully that helps a little bit as what we're thinking about longer term and just a reback, i think we've mentioned before, right, our target is 4% to 5% write offs. that's unchanged as we sit here today. that may change going forward as we continue to give -- improve and get even better, allow managing the portfolio centrally, but right now that's what we're -- worked from the global managing of business.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
yeah, brad and i can't emphasize when we talk about our portfolio have been up 6% year-over-year. how big an influence the lower returns and lower write-offs are to the size of the portfolio is not just a p&l metric where we look at net book value about of our revenue reduction in our churn, which is a reduction and returns of write-offs increases the value of our lease portfolio, which is a recurring revenue portfolio we benefit that for that in future periods.
bradley b. thomas -- keybanc capital markets, inc. -- analyst
absolutely, that's really encouraging to hear. i want to follow up on the new store concept as well, douglas, you gave some comments on it and it sounds like it has some encouraging results. could you talk a bit more about how you parse out -- how the your stores are doing versus sort of other factors and you talked about -- i think overall store strategy but can you talk more on that about the potential to accelerate their openings?
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
sure. yeah, so i mean i think i mentioned we have 51 stores to date, we've been keenly watching their performance, as you might imagine and we measure them on two factors, one is against the pro forma and we've got pro forma expectations that are in terms of buyback in irr and as i've said, these stores are exceeding our pro forma, but we also look at them versus a control group and early in the sort of rollout of these stores we're really looking at demand curves and kind of how we are driving new originations in these stores and what we're seeing on the demand side is delivery lift that about 19% greater than our legacy stores in the first 12 months.
so that's very encouraging and we're tracking to our pro forma, we're tracking to our targets for capital deployed in our payback periods and so we're really encouraged by that. we'll continue to monitor it as we open more stores, the way we think about these things in the future is it's not a one size fits all, we have a suburban strategy, we have our rural strategy, we have concepts of work in each of those markets. some of our stores will be larger stores with static showrooms and about i'd say 60% of those that we've built to date are like that. and about 40% will be in smaller markets, we have smaller showrooms we'll still introduce the technology and the footprint in the modern brand image that we wanted to display in those stores. so, we're super excited about that. we've invested heavily in analytics to drive our strategy. we've built a real estate analytics team that -- where we believe we know where our customer is and how to position those stores in markets. we believe we can serve our 700 markets with fewer stores as we've said before and do that efficiently while freeing up working capital and driving earnings growth and free cash flow. so we're very bullish on that initiative and so far, everything's working according to plan.
bradley b. thomas -- keybanc capital markets, inc. -- analyst

[operator instructions] bobby griffin with raymond james, your line is open.
bobby griffin -- raymond james -- analyst
thank you and good morning everybody. congrats on a good quarter. appreciate you taking my questions.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
thanks bobby
bobby griffin -- raymond james -- analyst
the first thing i want to dive into is more just kind of the changing business model here e-commerce continues to mix up very impressive results. as you're seeing that happen, are you able to find and notice incremental labor savings opportunities in the store infrastructure given that bigger and bigger portions of your business is coming from online.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
hey bobby, it's douglas. i would say generally, yes. but i wouldn't point directly to e-com. e-com's increasing volumes in our store, which is great. our average customer per stores continues to grow and so we need labor to serve those customers, as you know, e-com has an acquisition channel and what enables our e-com platform is our built-in infrastructure stores and so to the extent we're driving greater volumes we may need more servicing. that being said, however, we're getting leverage on that labor and the technology that we're putting in place is freeing up our people to do more value-added things in the stores, such as selling and are renewing leases. we have definitely seen lower staffing levels this quarter coming out of the pandemic than we have in the past and i attribute that not only to sort of efficiencies in e-com but efficiencies in our payment platforms and efficiencies in our centralized decisioning. centralized decisioning alone, we took a transaction that used to take 30 to 45 minutes and turned it into a transaction that takes 8 to 10 minutes to do and so we're freeing up capacity for our people to do other things, which is great and not needing as much labor in the stores. that being said, the business continues to grow and so we will prudently scale labor as it grows over time.
bobby griffin -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, that's very helpful. and i guess secondly, for me, when you look at great 1q big ebitda at be maybe $30 million versus street, increase in the guide as well i think by $35 million. so most of the guidance came from the 1q numbers lease versus our street model, which could have been off versus how you guys looked at it, but is that just a sign that you think most of the stimulus impact will be contained in 1q so the favorable impact from the $1400 cheques and things like that will be a mostly 1q '21 benefit or is there just some conservatism built in there too, because we don't exactly know how the stimulus will play out in the second quarter, anything around how you guys framed up stimulus carrying forward inside that guidance range would be helpful.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yeah, hey bobby it's kelly, a little bit of color there. so i think you hit on a key point that $30 million references versus consensus. that's not -- that would be versus our internal plan. so, as you know, we provide an annual guide. we don't provide quarterly numbers, what i'll tell you is that from in terms of stimulus impact on our customer and then how that impacts us as a company, we believe that the upfront check that they received december and then also working all our we've cheques received recently. that's kind of largely in q1 and it shows up some degree, varies beginning in q2. there is a continued benefit associated with enhanced unemployment that's been provided. obviously unemployment rates are coming down, which is good for us but those customers of ours that rely on the unemployment cheques. we expect them to continue to see elevated levels through august when those cheques run out at least on the government side, or the federal government side of the ledger. so long story short, q2, q3 continue to benefit at some level from this enhanced stimulus that we've been seeing. again, we called it out in our prepared remarks. but what we haven't factored in yet is any impact from the change in the child tax credits, right. but then we do know based upon what the government has said and with the irs has said is that our customer will start receiving some form of refund in july. what we don't know yet is exactly how that's going to be used here, it could in effect the second tax season. right. in the course of fiscal year or something our industry has never seen before. so, if you want to think about an area where we're being conservative maybe that it, but i guess we just don't know yet enough to be able to factor that in with any specificity that inform our guidance to you all.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
bobby, the only thing i would add to that is when large cheques come out like the $1400 cheques there tends to be different behavior in terms of payouts and other things and then the smaller cheques over time and so we'll wait to see what that looks like a later of part of these are.
bobby griffin -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, i appreciate that. that's very helpful. i guess 2 quick follow-ups. i mean, one on the covid-related reserve that were booked in 2020. kelly, do you guys already release those or will you release those back to more normal levels at some point?
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
they're the ones that are specific to write-off of lease merchandise. we've not released them completely, right, i think just as the way our reserve calculations work as we continue to see very strong customer payment activity, and as a result, low write-off activity, that percentage is naturally kind of coming down in terms of the percentage of the portfolio that we're going to get. so it's to be seen how that's going to play out through the course of this year and certainly into next year. and we do expect at some point it will return back to some more normal level of activity by our customer. but to answer your question specifically, we haven't released any material portion of that of the items, just a small piece.
bobby griffin -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. okay, that's helpful. and i guess the last thing for me was the utility on the balance sheet. just how do you -- you guys great cash balance, no debt basically i mean when you think about using funds for buyback and different things like are you managing for a target liquidity or how are you considering like -- do you want to keep $300 million of liquidity dry powder or anything like that to help us think about how you frame up looking at the balance sheet for buyback in different activities?
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yeah, great question. as we think about our balance sheet right now and specifically the liquidity, the one thing we want to make sure of is that we have as the supply chain continues to normalize, right, which we is going to use cash in the short term, as that happens right. as we continue our real estate repositioning strategy as well as the investments we're making on the technology side, we want to make sure we have adequate capital to fund those strategies, which at $300 million of liquidity, we believe we do and then douglas mentioned wanting to accelerate as best we can, the execution of those strategies, we kind of run scenarios to say we're able to do that without taking risk of site selection and things like that. we want to make sure we are capital to fund the business. outside of that, it's just continuing to be opportunistic as to where we see the share price and then just time, right. if you look at q1, our board approved the $150 million share repurchase authorization at the beginning of march. so, we had about 3 weeks in the quarter to execute on that plan and so if you start to think about what that might look like over the course of the year. i hope that informs some of the thinking there but we're not targeting anything specifically to inform at. we are kind of taking it on a quarter-by-quarter basis, again with a view toward how we see that liquidity is going to be needed in the upcoming quarters.
bobby griffin -- raymond james -- analyst
absolutely, that's very helpful. i appreciate all the details and best of luck here and for 2q and the rest of the year.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
great, thanks, bobby.

operator
good morning, my name is lashana and i will be your conference coordinator. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the aaron's company second quarter 2021 earnings conference call.
[operator instructions]
i will now turn the call over to mr. michael dickerson, vice president of corporate communications and investor relations for aaron's. you may begin your conference.
michael p. dickerson -- vice president, corporate communications & investor relations
thank you and good morning everyone. welcome to the aaron's company second quarter 2021 earnings conference call.
joining me this morning are douglas lindsay, aaron's chief executive officer; steve olsen, aaron's president; and kelly wall, aaron's chief financial officer. after our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. many of you have already seen a copy of our earnings release issued this morning. for those of you that have not, it is available on the investor relations section of our website at investor.aarons.com.
during this call, certain statements we make will be forward looking, including our financial performance outlook for 2021. i want to call your attention to our safe harbor provision for forward-looking statements that can be found at the end of our earnings release. the safe harbor provision identifies risks that may cause actual results to differ materially from the content of our forward-looking statements. also, please see our form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020, and other periodic filings with the sec for a description of the risks related to our business that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements.
on today's call, we will be referring to certain non-gaap financial measures, including ebitda and adjusted ebitda, non-gaap net earnings and non-gaap eps, which have been adjusted for certain items which may affect the comparability of our performance with other companies. these non-gaap measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings release.
with that, i will now turn the call over to our ceo, douglas lindsay.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
thanks, mike, and thank you for joining us today. once again, i'm pleased to report another quarter of strong operating performance and continued positive momentum at the aaron's company.
in the second quarter, we exceeded our expectations for total revenues, same-store revenues and adjusted ebitda. we also returned significant capital to our shareholders.
total revenues increased 8.5% year-over-year in our second full quarter as a stand-alone public company, primarily due to the strong underlying business trends and the execution of our strategic priorities. same-store revenues grew 11.2% in the second quarter of 2021, compared to the prior year; the fifth sequential quarter of positive growth and the eighth positive quarter over the last 10 quarters. the improvement was roughly two-thirds, driven by a larger lease portfolio size entering the second quarter, and the remaining one-third is primarily due to better customer payment activity in the prior year.
strong demand for our products, combined with the favorable impact of centralized decisioning, and continued but moderating government stimulus to our customers, led to an 8.7% increase in our quarter ending same-store leased portfolio size compared to the prior year.
our overall lease portfolio continues to perform well. as of the end of the second quarter, approximately 80% of our total lease portfolio is comprised of lease agreements that were originated through our centralized decisioning platforms. this decisioning technology allows us to better match the customers' lease payment with their financial position, with the goal of helping our customers achieve ownership. we believe the continued optimization of our decisioning technology, combined with improved operations, is a significant contributor to our strong lease portfolio performance, resulting in fewer lease merchandise returns and lower write-offs in both our store and e-commerce channels.
our e-commerce channel continues to grow at a healthy pace, representing 14% of total lease revenues in the quarter. the ongoing investments that we're making in our digital technologies, such as an enhanced online shopping experience, expanded product assortment, greater visibility into products available for express delivery and self-service account management, are driving growth in this important channel. the growth in our portfolio of leases generated online is driving improvements to our overall margin performance, as we leverage the fixed cost structure of our store and supply chain assets to serve the large lease-to-own market.
moving from revenues to earnings.
the company delivered a strong 16.3% adjusted ebitda growth in the second quarter. this resulted in an adjusted ebitda margin improvement of 100 basis points from the prior year's second quarter and the fifth straight quarter of year-over-year adjusted ebitda margin expansion. continued improvements in operating performance and strong execution by our team gives us the confidence to continue reinvesting into business, to support our multi-year strategy of promoting the aaron's value proposition, digitizing the customer experience and aligning our store footprint to the customer opportunity.
one of the key investments that i want to highlight is our gennext real estate strategy that is accelerating, with a growing store pipeline and performance that is exceeding our expectations. as of the end of june, we have 64 gennext stores and have generated result have generated result for their meeting or exceeding our targeted 25% internal rate of return in five-year payback period. at the end of the quarter, there were several gennext locations nearing completion, and we expect to open an additional eight stores by the end of july.
equally as encouraging, monthly lease originations in gennext stores, open for less than one year, grew at a rate of more than 20 percentage points higher than our average legacy store in the second quarter. as we previously communicated, we plan to open more than 60 gennext stores in 2021. while we're excited about both the early financial results and the infrastructure we are building to accelerate our progress, we continue to maintain a disciplined approach around our execution of this strategy.
before i turn the call over to kelly, let me reiterate how pleased i am with the strong performance of the company in the second quarter.
over the last several years, we have significantly transformed aaron's, with the goal of continuing to provide an exceptional customer and team member experience, while also driving greater productivity in our operating model. i remain confident that we have the right team, strategy and market opportunity, which when combined with our financial strength will enable us to deliver long-term growth for all of our stakeholders.
i'll now turn the call over to kelly to discuss our financial results.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
thank you, douglas.
for the second quarter of 2021, total revenues were $467.5 million, compared to $431 million for the second quarter of 2020, an increase of 8.5%. this increase was primarily due to the improved quality and increased size of our lease portfolio and continued strong customer payment activity during the quarter. the increase in total revenues was partially offset by the net reduction of 42 company-operated stores and 71 franchised stores for the 15-month period ended june 30, 2021.
on a same-store basis, revenues increased 11.2% in the second quarter, compared to the second quarter in the prior year. as douglas mentioned, this is our fifth consecutive positive quarter of same-store revenue growth. leases originating in both our in-store and e-commerce channels contributed to our revenue growth, which was primarily driven by a larger same-store lease portfolio size and continued strong customer payment activity.
similar to the last four quarters, we believe that customer payment activity has been positively influenced by centralized decisioning and other operational improvements, as well as the positive impact of government stimulus programs to our customers.
e-commerce revenues increased 15.8% versus the second quarter of 2020 and represented 14% of overall lease revenues compared to 12.8% in the second quarter of the prior year. we continue to believe that the strategy and initiatives we are undertaking to optimize our e-commerce offering will allow us to achieve our long-term growth goals in this important channel.
the company ended the second quarter of 2021 with a lease portfolio size for all company-operated stores of $132.8 million, an increase of 7.6%, compared to a lease portfolio size of $123.4 million on june 30 of last year. as a reminder, lease portfolio size represents the next month's total collectible lease payments from our aggregate outstanding customer lease agreements, and management believes this is one of the metrics that is important in understanding the drivers of lease revenue growth in any given period.
operating expenses, excluding restructuring expenses and spin-related transaction costs, were up $21 million in the quarter, as compared to the second quarter of last year. this increase is due to higher personnel costs and other operating expense, offset by lower provision for lease merchandise write-offs.
personnel costs increased $3 million in the second quarter of 2021, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher labor hours and performance-based compensation in our stores, higher stand-alone public company cost, and comping over the cost cutting measures we took in the second quarter of 2020, partially offset by lower performance-based bonus accruals this year.
the $13.3 million increase in other operating expenses in the quarter is primarily due to the launch of a new marketing campaign during the second quarter of 2021, lower vendor marketing contributions and a reduction in marketing initiatives during the second quarter of 2020 that resulted from cost-cutting measures the company implemented in response to the covid-19 pandemic.
in addition, we had higher occupancy, store maintenance, and shipping and handling costs in the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to the temporary closure of our showrooms in the second quarter of 2020. the provision for lease merchandise write-offs, as a percentage of lease revenue and fees, decreased to 2.9% for the three months ended june 30, 2021, compared to 3.7% for the comparable period in 2020. the improvement in write-offs was primarily due to the continued favorable impact of our in-store and online decisioning technologies, strong operational execution and the benefit to our customers from government stimulus.
adjusted ebitda was $65.3 million for the second quarter of 2021, compared with $56.2 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of $9.1 million, or 16.3%. as a percentage of total revenues, adjusted ebitda was 14% in the second quarter of 2021, compared to 13% from the same period last year, an improvement of 100 basis points. the increase in adjusted ebitda margin was primarily due to the item that drove the total revenue's increase and the 80-basis-point reduction in overall write-offs previously discussed.
on a non-gaap basis, diluted earnings per share were $1.05 in the second quarter of 2021, compared to non-gaap diluted earnings per share of $0.83 for the same quarter in 2020, an increase of $0.22, or 26.5%.
cash generated from operating activities was $40 million for the second quarter of 2021, a decline of $117.7 million compared to the second quarter of 2020. this decline was primarily due to higher purchases of lease merchandise to meet increased customer demand and to return the company to more normalized inventory levels.
during the second quarter, the company repurchased approximately 1,166,000 shares of aaron's common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $38.6 million, and through a 10b5-1 plan, continue to repurchase shares into the first month of the current quarter. for the full year-to-date period ended july 23, 2021, the company has repurchased 1.84 million shares for approximately $57.4 million. as of july 23, we had approximately $92.6 million remaining under the company's $150 million share repurchase program that was approved by our board in march of this year and ends december 31 of 2023.
to wrap up the material capital allocation activities from the second quarter, in may, the company's board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, which was paid on july 6. as of june 30, 2021, the company had a cash balance of $48 million, zero debt, and total available liquidity of $281.5 million, which includes $234 million available under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
turning to our outlook, we have raised our full-year revenue and earnings outlook for 2021.
for the full year, we have increased our outlook for total revenues to between $1.775 billion and $1.8 billion. we also increased our outlook for adjusted ebitda to between $215 million and $225 million.
for the full-year 2021, we increased our outlook for the effective tax rate modestly to 26%; did not change depreciation and amortization; and lowered the diluted weighted average share count for the full-year 2021 to 34 million shares. we have not assumed any additional share repurchases beyond what has been previously described.
we have also increased our full-year same-store revenue outlook from a range of 4% to 6% to a range of 6% to 8%. we have increased our expected capital expenditure range by $10 million to a range of $90 million to $100 million. this increase is primarily the result of a higher number of gennext stores added to the pipeline. we have held our free cash flow estimate for 2021 flat at $90 million to $100 million. the expected adjusted ebitda increase is offset by higher gennext pipeline investment and additional lease merchandise inventory purchases.
we believe that the benefit to our customer from government stimulus programs will moderate in the second half of 2021. at the same time, the favorable impact of centralized lease decisioning, our digital servicing platforms and other operational enhancements are contributing to a sustainable improvement in customer payment and write-off activity. more specifically, our outlook assumes customer lease payment activity remains elevated in the second half of 2021, when compared to pre-covid-19 pandemic levels, but lower than the second half of 2020. additionally, we expect write-offs will continue to be lower in the second half of 2021, when compared to the pre-covid-19 pandemic levels, but higher than the second half of 2020.
finally, our updated outlook assumes no significant deterioration in the current retail environment state of the u.s. economy or global supply chain as compared to their current conditions.
with that, i will now turn the call over to the operator, who will assist with your questions.

your first question comes from the line of kyle joseph with jefferies.
kyle joseph -- jefferies llc -- analyst
hey, good morning guys. congratulations on a great quarter and thanks for taking my questions.
kelly, appreciate the color you gave on, kind of, the outlook for credit normalization. i know it's early. but, can you give us a sense for how you expect the changes in the child tax credits to impact the business? obviously, we have stimulus in the rear view. but, checks from changes in child tax credits started dating this month.
but, just talk about kind of the impacts you see both on the credit as well as on, kind of, the sales and demand side of the business?
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
hey, good morning, kyle. appreciate the questions.
so, what i had indicated in the prepared remarks is that in the back half of this year, we do expect that between the child tax credit or having enrolled out centralized decisioning, just with the excellent level at where our team is performing right now. but, all these factors are contributing to customer payment activity; we often refer to that as customer renewal percentage. that's going to continue to be elevated or higher than what we saw come before or coming in a pandemic early last year.
at the same time, we don't expect that the liquidity at our customers is going to be as strong as it relates to bylaws provided by the government. so, what we've looked at and i think a lot of companies maybe looking at, is that the enhanced unemployment and other stimulus that our customers benefiting from at the back half of last year, it's just a greater number, it's a larger number. i mean, if you were to take any estimate of the child tax credit benefit and multiply, that accounts 48 [phonetic].
so, just the magnitude of liquidity of the customer have in support that, if any contribution of stimulus and enhanced unemployment, then we may have benefited from -- and our customers benefited from last year is just not going to be as high as this year. so, we've factored that into our view in outlook, which is different, right, to what we did in the prior two conversations we've had on this.
but, listen, i mean, it's our best estimate at this point in time. we did see a lift last week on the 15, as that liquidity started to come into the market. we're watching that daily, we're paying very close attention to what that's going to look like at the end of the month. that will continue to inform our views on the business for the rest of the year, but it's early. and there are a number of factors that could continue to impact how customer uses that liquidity.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
yes. and, kyle, this is douglas.
good morning, i just wanted to tick one other thing, if you may have noted in our comments, now 80% of our lease portfolio has been decisioned through our centralized decisioning algorithms and we believe that the second half of the year will reflect that in propping up our renewal rates and our write-offs as well. so, there is a stimulus going on, but there is also all the investments we've made in optimizing our decisioning, that are reflected in our outlook, and we're really happy with the results of that.
kyle joseph -- jefferies llc -- analyst
got it, very helpful.
one follow-up from me, in this day and age, we remain repeating that, the question about inflation. but, to be honest, it feels like we are actually recently talking about equation of consumer electronics prices not negatively impacting the business. so, can you talk about some of the puts and takes about inflation, in terms of really essentially demand for credit from the consumer for any number of products?
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
yes. this is douglas. i'll start and i'll let kelly and steve chime in.
but, we're experiencing the same economic impacts as everyone else is, in terms of inflation. we're seeing price increases in our products and the raw materials for our products and fuel, transportation, and to a lesser extent, wages. [indecipherable], our merchandising team has just done a phenomenal job of keeping pace with all of these cost increases and we are able to pass along a lot of this cost increase to our customers in terms of lease rates. and we're really careful about how we do that and making sure we're hitting the right price points for our consumer.
as inflation increases, we tend to see, historically, pressure on retail. and if you think about it, you've got an appliance cost of $1,000; if you've got a 15% inflation out there in the marketplace, that appliance goes from $1,000 to $1,150, which is all upfront cost for the consumer. in our lease-to-own world, where we're leading with the payment, we may be able to pass on only $10 in additional payment costs to that consumer and spread it over 24 months, which makes it a lot more manageable for the consumers. so, the carry-on effect of that is we see more demand falling into our segment and we get the benefit of an expanding lease-to-own marketplace.
so, i would say if there is any counter there on inflation, as cost of living increases for our customer, we see a bit of pressure on the collection side of the business and renewal side of the business. however, that's historically been in periods without stimulus. and as kelly mentioned, we will have ongoing stimulus for the foreseeable future.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yes. and, kyle, i would add just a few quick things, right.
we're clearly seeing inflation in our business without surprise, right; everybody in the retail world is. some of the places where it's showing up and we're tying this back to our outlook, right, we are expecting to spend more money on lease merchandise inventory this year. there are two factors driving that. one, we've written more agreements this year, right. so, we're growing our lease portfolio size, so we need to backfill that inventory that we're putting out into our customers' hands. that's a great thing, right. the other side of it is that we're seeing, across all our categories, right, 3% to 8% increases in costs; and those costs include transportation costs as well, both in terms of landing that inventory as well as the cost to complete that last mile delivery from our stores to our customers' homes.
so, those factors are baked into the outlook that we provided; i mean, again, it's our best estimates at this time. it's an interesting world we're all operating in right now. so, we're paying very close attention to all these inputs. the great thing is with centralized decisioning, the improvements in operations, just how dialed in our teams are right now. we feel like we're reacting pretty quickly at least at this point, hopefully, as our performance in the first half as we have demonstrated we've stayed ahead of these curves a little bit.
kyle joseph -- jefferies llc -- analyst
got it, that's it from me. thanks a lot for answering all my questions.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
thanks, kyle. we have a question from the line of anthony chukumba with loop capital markets.
anthony chukumba -- loop capital markets llc -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question. let me add my congratulations. i know this probably won't continue, but i could get used to these double-digit comp store sales increases.
so, i guess my -- just a couple really quick housekeeping questions. what was the ending company-operated and franchised store counts?
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yes, let me give that for you, anthony. the ending company-operated store count was 1,087 stores and the franchise was 247 stores, bringing us to 1,334 stores total.
anthony chukumba -- loop capital markets llc -- analyst
got it, thanks.
and so, my next question, i know it's probably hard to parse this out, but would just love to get even just sort of directionally. it sounds like when you think about lease merchandise write-offs and these much lower levels that we've seen, obviously, a lot of that is all the stimulus money, right, which is actually helpful from a customer payment activity perspective. but, it seems like part of it is the centralized decisioning, right; you're just making better credit decisions. and if you make better credit decisions, all else being equal, you can have lower merchandise write-offs.
so, how do you think about into back half of this year, right, you sort of like -- you've got enhanced unemployment benefits going away and you probably don't have much of an impact from that last round of stimulus. but then, you do have the expanded child tax credit and then you also have the, as you said, 80% of your lease portfolio generated through centralized decisioning. so, i'm almost thinking that could be a wash from a lease merchandise write-off perspective. but, how do you sort of think about that or parse that out?
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yes, it's a great question, anthony. this is kelly.
and what i'd say is that, as you kind of look through that, you can see there are a lot of things that are factored into that right now; we operate a fairly complex business in an environment right now, which is probably as complex as anybody in this market has ever seen it. so, appreciate that you're recognizing there are a lot of puts and takes that are kind of going into that.
i think we always say in general, it's kind of coming back to our longer-term view on write-offs, which is that we do continue to expect the business to operate in a 4% to 5% annual write-off percentage. as we think about the back half of this year, i think what we had indicated, again, in the outlook and tried to give you some guidance here in my prepared remarks is that, we do expect write-offs to be lower than kind of our pre-pandemic levels. and that's largely driven by centralized decisioning, the improvements in operations, all the things that you kind of hit on there, as well as the benefit of the child tax credits and liquidity in our customers' hands. at the same time, right, we would expect it to be higher than last year. i mean, just to put into context, right, q3 of 2020, our write-offs were 2.4%; that was an all-time historic low, as best as any of us can look back and see in this business. so, we're not anticipating that we would be at those levels.
and then, if you look at the back half of the year in total from a write-off perspective, we do expect to be slightly above what we did last year, but again below what we've seen from a historic, kind of, long-term perspective of the business.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
yes. just to reiterate the virtues of centralized decisioning with 80% of our portfolio, having gone through that. and we're effectively sizing the right payments for the customer to set them up for success and also to set ourselves for success, reduce servicing costs, etc. and take the friction out of the relationships. so, we have happier customers ultimately long term and returning customers. and what this all sort of results in is lower product return back to us and lower write-offs, which means we have a healthier portfolio, we have happier customers, and we see a revenue benefit from more on-time payments. and that's further benefited by all the technology we put in place for our customer payments, where they can pay on an app, pay on our my account online. we now have 77% of our customers paying outside of store.
and so, when we make it easier for the customer to pay us and we set them up for success, the centralized decisioning translates to both the top line and the bottom line, which is reflected in our outlook.
anthony chukumba -- loop capital markets llc -- analyst
got it, that's very helpful. keep up the good work, guys.

your next question comes from the line of bobby griffin with raymond james.
bobby griffin -- raymond james. -- analyst
good morning, buddy. appreciate you taking my questions and good job this quarter, and congrats on the ongoing strong performance.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
thank you.
bobby griffin -- raymond james. -- analyst
i guess the first one, i want to dig into, was the child tax credit. but, not really the impact this year, just based on, is really kind of next year. based on how i understand it, it lowers the refund partly for the receiver of those tax credits next year; i mean, spread the payment out over this year. so, typically you guys see earlier buyouts, when you get big refunds, i believe.
so, do you think this has the potential to maybe smooth that out a little bit in first half of next year or is the offset that your consumer won't have quite as much liquidity in the hand ahead, just trying to unpack how that might play out and understand it, and first time this has ever happened? so, we're still kind of working from estimates here.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
no, i appreciate that question, bobby, and also the kind of color there at the end. i mean, you're spot on working in an environment that no one has ever operated in. so, we're trying to making our best estimates based upon what we know today.
so, first off, i mean, in child tax credit, not only did the recent change in the law kind of accelerate the payment, right, expand the universe of the folks that are receiving it, it also increased kind of these overall size of the total credit with half of it being received over monthly payments in the back half of this year and the rest will be received as part of an individual's annual tax return later next year. so, we'll see how this plays out. but, it's -- roughly half of that will come to our consumers that receive the child tax credit this year in the form of those monthly payments and the other half next year.
so, your question about impact on epos, you're right. i mean, our business in that regard has remained consistent in terms of when our customer has more liquidity, they pay us better; and that includes typically an increase in early payouts. so, we would expect to see some of that in the back half of the early, certainly factor that in, as we've thought about portfolio size through the course of the year, the impact that has on revenues, and the rest of the business.
it's still too early for us to really understand what's going to happen on a monthly basis, through the course of this year. and it's still early to start to anticipate what's going to happen in february, march, april next year, in terms of how these dollars are used. but, i think it is important to know what's at the beginning, right. it's -- the absolute dollars provided to this tax credit are significantly higher than what they were kind of coming into this recent change. and so, our view right now is that, that element would have much of an impact as to how the liquidity had impacted early next year, [indecipherable] our customer tax returns.
hopefully, that's a little bit helpful color we've provided there.
bobby griffin -- raymond james. -- analyst
yes, that's helpful.
and then, i guess, perhaps i want you to unpack the second half ebitda margins a little bit. and your commentary just there might have helped answer some of it. but, the lease portfolio is performing very well, i think, high-single digits, you referenced, year-over-year.
and then, we look the second half implied ebitda margins are down notable from the first half and understanding some of that is merchandise write-offs. but, what's some of the other parts because it does seem like the business has a pretty strong momentum right now; good payment, a lot of things have been working on and it seems like there could be some upside to those second half ebitda margins. i just want to make sure if there is some other areas that we're not missing.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
great question, bobby.
i mean, two things are kind of going on in that regard, right. one, we are catching up on some of the underspend, if you will, that happened last year, right. we're certainly in q2 and trail that into q3 and q4, tighten our belts more probably in q4 in a few different areas; one is via marketing, right. and so, we have some catch-up that's going to go on there from an opex perspective.
the other is -- and we're taking this opportunity to invest in the growth of our business, right. i mean, we've often talked in the context of capital allocation around. first and foremost, investing into business as long as we're achieving the appropriate returns and we have that opportunity right now. so, there is an increase in opex around marketing, some personnel, some consulting, some other projects that are going on that we do expect to deliver not only value this year, but value into 2022 and beyond.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
bobby, this is douglas.
the last thing i would mention is, if you look at our renewal percentages of our lease portfolio in the first two quarters of this year, they're running in several 100 basis points ahead of where we've been. and we are going to see that normalize in the latter half of the year, that normalization to higher rates than we were pre-pandemic, but nonetheless lower than we were in the first and second quarter; that's kind of a 100% margin normalization. so, that brings our margins back in line with what the outlook is indicating there.
and as kelly mentioned, on top of that, we've got some additional investments in the third and fourth quarter that we believe will benefit to 2022.
bobby griffin -- raymond james. -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of brad thomas with keybanc capital markets.
bradley b. thomas -- keybanc capital markets, inc. -- analyst
hi, thanks, douglas and kelly, and congrats on a strong first half here.
i wanted to just follow-up on the last line of questioning around the second-half guidance and maybe talk a little bit more about the revenue side of things. it does feel like you really had some nice momentum in the size of the portfolio. and so, as i go back and look at the numbers, it does feel like your second half has revenues trending down year-over-year and down sequentially. so, just trying to understand how we should be thinking about the puts and takes as we think about revenues?
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yes. hey, brad, this is kelly. good question.
again, i would remind you, and i know you know this well, we have a seasonal business and typically, q3 is our low point, right, in a normal year as it relates to revenue. and last year was anything but normal, as we all know. this year, if we think about, there has been stimulus in the market in q1, q2, q3 and in q4. so, we should see a somewhat-normal distribution of revenue from quarter to quarter. so, you're right. we're expecting sequentially that from q2 to q3 revenue would be down and we would expect that in, kind of, any typical year.
from a year-over-year perspective, and douglas hit on this, as part of his description of same-store revenues. the biggest driver in q2 was the increase in our portfolio. and so, we are going to enjoy the benefit of that going into the back half of the year. at the same time, douglas just mentioned a second ago, the other component to our revenue is customer renewal activity, right; their payments.
and in q1, -- late q1 and all of q2, we were running at customer renewal percentages that were 300 to 400 basis points higher than our pre-pandemic levels. so, we expect to start to normalize, hang on to certainly the benefits that we've driven through centralized decisioning and other operational changes in investments. but, we don't expect to kind of continue to comp over those kinds of levels. so, when you chalk to, kind of, pull that down, revenue to be flat to slightly up from last year on a back-half basis, but not the type of year-over-year growth that you saw kind of 2019 going into 2020, if that helps.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
yes. the last thing i would say is, we're also comping over the third and fourth quarter of last year, where we saw strong payment activity as well. so, we've got -- it's really, brad, the story of great portfolio held, great portfolio size. but, the differences in the revenue is the renewal rates year-over-year.
bradley b. thomas -- keybanc capital markets, inc. -- analyst
got you. that's very helpful.
and to follow-up on bobby's question about the ebitda, if you try to bucket [phonetic] into the write-offs versus the cost inflation that you're seeing, versus some of the investments that you're making into business, could you hazard a guess as to how much, each of those is a headwind for you, based on where you're guiding right now?
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yes. i'd say that they're all kind of a year-over-year basis, contributing to kind of an increase, if you're looking at in terms of absolute dollar cost, but also as a percentage of revenue. so, they're not exactly equally rated, weighted, brad, but each of those are impacting it across the board there.
bradley b. thomas -- keybanc capital markets, inc. -- analyst

yes. as you may recall, we launched centralized decisioning to our entire store portfolio in april of 2020, as the pandemic hit. we'd had 200 stores or so. prior to that, that we've been testing for over a year and seeing great results. we rolled it out for the rest of the portfolio then. so, what you're seeing now is this 80%, is effectively we're approving everybody that comes into our store, almost everybody through centralized decisioning.
but, it has to bleed into the portfolio. we have leases that were manually decisioned, pre-roll out, that are rolling off and so. and we would expect to see kind of mid next year us getting to approximately 100% of the portfolio decisions through that. but, we're enjoying the benefit of that this year and we should sort of get that additional 20% over the next six to nine months.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
got it, thank you.
and then, also, just as i look at kind of year-over-year same lease growth, how much is impact of kind of product selection? that i would think that starting with the lock-down a year ago and for the first couple of quarters after that, it was heavily on home furniture and housing and stuff like that, as we were all going to stuck at home and needed new refrigerators and what have you.
has that changed materially, and is that affecting the numbers or are we still seeing pretty much the same product selection?
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
sure. i am going to let steve olsen here. let steve handle that.
steve olsen -- president
hey, bill, thanks for the question.
yes, you've nailed it. we're absolutely seeing very similar product selection and results that we saw throughout q2. so, seeing nice growth across our entire business, whether it's furniture, appliances or electronics.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
so, no real change in -- on it over the past six to nine months, even as we reopened?
steve olsen -- president
no real change as we reopened, as i said in prior calls. so, nice growth in the appliance business early, but that actually continued and we're seeing nice growth in furniture, whether it's upholstery, bedroom, or the associated accessories. so, nice consistent business that we've seen from the start through now.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
great, thanks so much.
steve olsen -- president
thanks, bill.

your next question comes from the line of vincent caintic with stephens.
vincent caintic -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey, thanks, good morning.
first question about the gennext store roll-out. so, seen some great success there. maybe, if you could talk about, now you're sort of six to nine months into this, any learnings you've had versus when you initially started? and then, i know you talked about the roll-out and trying to be disciplined about it. but, given the success you've had, just sort wondering when you're thinking about the build-out, if you could accelerate it or how you think about potentially expanding that?
thank you.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
sure. great question, vincent.
well, first of all, as you know, gennext is part of our larger market repositioning strategy that includes reinvesting in stores that we love that are keepers and renovating them; that also includes relocating stores maybe down the street to better center in the markets that we love, and consolidating stores, where we feel like we have multiple stores in a market that needs fewer stores and larger e-com, fewer larger stores. and so, we're doing all the above. we've created pro formas for each of those, that are unique to each of those scenarios. and i'm happy to say that as of today, we've opened 64 stores and we're on track to our expected returns, which as we said are 25% irr in five-year payback.
we typically look for a payback within the initial lease term of our of our real estate, which is typically five years. and so, we're really happy with that. but, we don't just look at these in terms of how we're doing to our pro forma, we really measure how these stores are doing versus our control group, which are our core stores in our portfolio. and so, we're really happy about this. we're up over 20 points and our recurring revenue written into the portfolio, which is our sales metric over our core portfolio, which is very promising, and our customer accounts are exceeding our expectations.
so, all that being said, we're very bullish. we are moving as fast as we can on this. as i think i've mentioned in prior quarters, we've intentionally been shortening our lease term over the last five years to be able to pivot our portfolio. and so, we're building a robust, analytically driven real estate team who's really hit the ground and they're producing a lot.
we have a lot more stores in our pipeline. the pipeline is building for next year, part of our capex guidance going up, is related to the pipeline of stores we have slated for 2022. and that's really a timing issue because we're going to spend money in advance of our of our openings. importantly, we can move fast, but we can only move as fast as the real estate market will allow us to move and that's based on sort of market conditions, what availability there is, permitting, landlords and construction timelines.
and so, we've built infrastructure in both our capital allocation and in our opex. part of the investments, kelly had mentioned before, in the second half of the year are investments to build squads that we have on the ground to launch these stores, to build more infrastructure in our operations team to make sure we have the people ready to run these stores, and to grand open our marketing functions and making sure we have field teams available to do that. and so, we're building all that into the latter half of the year in our outlook.
and trust me, i'm aligned with you. we want to move -- based on the results we're seeing, we want to move as fast as we can. but, we also want to be judicial and prudent about our site selection and making sure we're making the right decisions.
vincent caintic -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay. that's really helpful and it's exciting to hear that you're over 20 points [phonetic] versus the control group, so really appreciate that.
the next is probably just a quick question. but, on this kpi with lease portfolio size, i know you introduced it earlier this year. but maybe, kelly, if you could help us understand how to use that when we think about modeling the revenues going forward? thank you.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yes, vincent, a great question.
so, what that represents, right, is as we start every month, the size of the revenue that we collect across all of our leases, so if you think about where we ended the quarter, right, $132.8 million; if all of our customers paid 100% of their lease payment, then we would collect $132.8 million in the month of july, right. and so, it's that potential monthly collectible revenue. now, we don't collect 100%, right. and so, that factors into what we end up reporting in revenue. and then, within the month and then within the three months of a quarter, right, you would typically see growth or change in that portfolio size, which also would impact that revenue calculation for the quarter and for the year.
but, as douglas mentioned, the growth in that portfolio year-over-year of over 8% contributed to about two-thirds, right, of that 11.2% positive same-store revenue growth that we posted. so, we're trying to help you and others understand how impactful, right, the portfolio is on delivering kind of long-term sustainable growth to the top line of the business.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
yeah. and that last third is related to collecting at a higher rate. and we are renewing our customers' at higher rate than we did last year and so. and to the extent we renew at the same rate as last year, our same-store revenues would be closer to the portfolio size.
vincent caintic -- stephens inc. -- analyst
great, that's very helpful. thanks very much
operator
your next question comes from the line of jason haas with bank of america.
jason haas -- bank of america -- analyst
great. good morning, and thanks for taking my question.
have you had a chance to take a look at how collections have been in states that have pulled back the enhanced unemployment versus states that still have it?
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yes, jason. great question and i appreciate the question here.
what i'd say is, yes, we've looked at it. and we watch our business daily at the store level. so, it's something that we're very tuned into. and so, we watch the impact that has had across the portfolio and that certainly has weighed into how we think about the outlook for the back half of the year. we don't typically provide that level of detail, right, kind of down at the state level. so, i'm not going to comment specifically there.
but, what i will say is this, you've heard this from us before, right. in general, when our customer is more liquid, they pay better. and so, it's based on that -- it's a fair assumption to kind of carry that one step further. and i think that in those states that discontinued the enhanced unemployment, we saw a slightly different payment activity than we did in the other states.
jason haas -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, got it.
and then, as a follow-up, so you're definitely tracking well above where you had expected, based on the longer-term plan that you outlined during the spin-off, both in terms of top line and margin. so, i'm curious as we think longer term, both like as we get into next year, -- sort of like -- some of this has been driven by external strength. so, i'm curious to know how long that could last for? do you think there could be some benefit that flows all the way into next year from that?
and then, just in terms of what you're doing internally, it sounds like you're tracking above plan there. so, just kind of curious with what the big pieces are in terms of, relative to where you thought maybe at beginning the year, tracking above them [phonetic], do you think -- expect to continue?
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yes, jason. i appreciate that.
so, it's a bit too early for us to provide guidance as it relates to 2022, particularly in light of all the moving parts that we're continuing to see in the market, right. but, what i would say kind of bring it back to that five-year outlook that we did provide before, where we sit today, our lease portfolio size is larger than where we anticipated being halfway through 2021. so, that is clearly something that's going to help kind of carry into 2022 and beyond, in terms of, kind of, where we fall across that five-year execution strategy.
as it relates to the roll-out of our new store format, right, the consolidation in certain markets, we're kind of right on schedule with what we had penciled out. so, the big drivers, next year, right, as we think about kind of resetting relative to that initial five-year plan that we provided is, number one will be that lease portfolio size; number two, it's where are we collecting the [indecipherable] customer paying, kind of comping off any government stimulus and enhanced unemployment benefits they've provided in 2020 and 2021. but, we certainly are paying close attention to that and will guide you all as we have kind of better clarity into next year and beyond.
jason haas -- bank of america -- analyst
got it, really helpful. thank you.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer

your next question comes from the line of tim vierengel with northcoast research.
tim vierengel -- northcoast research -- analyst
good morning. thank you for taking my question.
this one is for either steve or douglas. we view, you guys, e-commerce capabilities as truly a key differentiator versus the rest of the market. can you highlight just the growth stats, again, you're seeing in that channel, and maybe outline what you guys see as the biggest hurdle for -- to see -- for accelerating growth through that channel? feel like, i think sequentially, it was about the same growth rates. just kind of curious what might be big hurdle to see continue accelerating growth in that channel?
thanks.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
tim, this is douglas. i'll start off and i'll let steve finish.
we're really happy with the performance of our e-com channel. we had 15% growth in the quarter year-over-year. and while that is a slowing of our overall rate, we are comping over the large increases in our e-com business that we experienced in q2 of last year when the pandemic hit. and so, we've got, which was up roughly 54%, i believe, during that quarter. and so, while we're comping 15% or 54%, we were happy with that. so, last year -- and i'm sorry that 54% was what we wrote into the portfolio. so, we're still comping at 15% up.
last year, we saw a surge in demand. i think as the year went on and the pandemic continued, we went through some inventory challenges and have since corrected themselves. and where we stand today, we're super happy with the demand and the optimization of our decisioning on our e-com platform and the technology advancements that we've made -- we're really proud of. and i think they're going to add a ton of value for us as we move forward.
i'll let steve just talk about those.
steve olsen -- president
tim, thanks for the question.
just to add to it, i would definitely say the focus of our technology investments is where the opportunity lies. first and foremost, i would call it out, or just [phonetic] our digital marketing in our pivot to putting more of our marketing dollars in that area to target engaged customers in a broader sense. but, as far as the technology investments, we just need to continue to improve that user experience that we have in our e-commerce platform through content, personalization and functionality. we need to continue to broaden our assortment, give that customer a broad selection of product in our core categories, as well as an expansion into new categories that we're not even in yet.
additional piece would be around the inventory visibility. doug has mentioned that we're pleased with our inventory position; in that, inventory that supports our e-commerce business. but, the more and more focus that we put on visibility of that inventory to our customers, so they can get that product faster in their homes.
and the last piece would just be a focus on turning the controls over to the customer and really create that self-service environment that allows them to access their account, manage their account through the mobile app or our online portal, with my account. so, i would change it more to where the opportunities lie and where we need to continue our focus to drive continued growth.
tim vierengel -- northcoast research -- analyst
that's really good color guys. thank you so much.

operator
good morning, my name is brika and i will be your conference coordinator. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the aaron's company third quarter 2021 earnings conference call.
[operator instructions] i will now turn the call over to mr. michael dickerson, vice president of corporate communications and investor relations for aaron's. you may begin your conference.
michael p. dickerson -- vice president, corporate communications & investor relations
thank you and good morning everyone. welcome to the aaron's company third quarter 2021 earnings conference call.
joining me this morning are douglas lindsay, aaron's chief executive officer; steve olsen, aaron's president; and kelly wall, aaron's chief financial officer. after our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. many of you have already seen a copy of our earnings release issued this morning. for those of you that have not, it is available on the investor relations section of our website at investor.aarons.com.
during this call, certain statements we make will be forward looking, including our financial performance outlook for 2021. i want to call your attention to our safe harbor provision for forward-looking statements that can be found at the end of our earnings release. the safe harbor provision identifies risks that may cause actual results to differ materially from the content of our forward-looking statements. also, please see our form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020, and other subsequent periodic filings with the sec for a description of the risks related to our business that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements.
on today's call, we will be referring to certain non-gaap financial measures, including ebitda and adjusted ebitda, non-gaap net earnings and non-gaap eps, which have been adjusted for certain items which may affect the comparability of our performance with other companies. these non-gaap measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables included in our earnings release.
with that, i will now turn the call over to our ceo, douglas lindsay.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
thanks, mike, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results. i'm pleased to report another quarter of strong operating performance and continued positive momentum at the aaron's company. in the nearly one year since our separation, we have significantly strengthened our leadership position in the direct-to-consumer lease end market and are tracking well ahead of our long-term strategic plan. continued investments in our best-in-class e-commerce channel, predictive lease decisioning engine and our high performing gennext stores are driving greater productivity and growth in our business. through the tremendous efforts of our team, we continue to transform aaron's go-to-market strategy by delivering customer friendly digital solutions, easy lease approvals and an enhanced shopping experience.
since 1955, aaron's has been committed to serving a customer base that has too often been overlooked or excluded from preferred retail experiences. today, we are leveraging our long and deep understanding of this customer segment to say yes when others say no; to provide our customers with access to great products on flexible and affordable terms and to deliver a seamless customer experience not only across our distributed store network but also digitally through our award winning e-commerce platform. whether our customers interact with us in one of our beautiful new gennext stores or via their mobile device, we continue to provide a growing assortment of products they want and need with low monthly payments that fit their budget and best-in-class customer service.
i'm pleased to announce that our third quarter 2021 results have again exceeded our expectations through continued growth in the size of our lease portfolio same-store revenues and e-commerce revenues. as a result, we returned another $37.5 million to shareholders in the quarter in the form of share repurchases. this brings us to a total of nearly $100 million of capital returned to shareholders thus far this year. the strong third quarter results, we are again raising our revenue and earnings outlook for the full year 2021. in the third quarter, same-store revenues grew 4.6% compared to the prior year, the sixth consecutive quarter of positive same-store revenue growth. the improvement was primarily driven by an 8.7% larger lease portfolio size entering the third quarter partially offset by a lower level of customer payment activity compared to the prior year.
our same-store lease portfolio size continues to grow at a healthy pace ending the third quarter up 6.1% compared to the prior year. we attribute this growth primarily to strong demand for our products, higher average ticket, the favorable impact of centralized lease decisioning and the residual impact of government stimulus on the portfolio. as discussed previously, our predictive lease decisioning engine is working very well and enables us to better match the customers' lease payment with their financial position with the goal of helping more customers achieve ownership and lowering our overall cost to serve. in addition, our lease decisioning algorithms allow us to be flexible in responding to changes in the macroeconomic environment and to optimize outcomes that drive profitability.
as of the end of the third quarter, more than 83% of our total lease portfolio is comprised of lease agreements that were originated through our centralized decisioning platforms. this compares to approximately 60% at the beginning of 2021. as i mentioned last quarter, lease payment activity in 2021 has exceeded historical levels due to the government stimulus provided to our customer leading to higher lease renewal rates and lower write-offs as we saw in the third quarter and expect to see over the next three to four quarters, customer payment activity continues to normalize. because of investments we've made in centralized decisioning and lease servicing technologies, we expect 2022 lease renewal rates to ultimately settle above pre-pandemic levels but below the level we expect for the full year 2021. we also expect lease merchandise write-offs in 2022 to settle below pre-pandemic levels but above the level we expect for full year 2021.
in addition to investments in our decisioning technology, we also continue to invest in our e-commerce channel and our gennext strategy. our e-commerce channel continues to grow at double-digit rates representing 14.3% of total lease revenues in the quarter. the growth in our portfolio of leases generated online is driving improvements to our overall margin performance as we leverage the fixed cost structure of our store and supply chain assets to serve customers that are seeking a virtual shopping experience, low monthly payments and free delivery. ongoing investments in digital marketing and our customers' online experience are driving growth in this important channel, specifically e-commerce investments are leading to an enhanced shopping experience driven by personalization and richer product content improved customer visibility into products that are available for same or next day delivery and a broader assortment that includes new product categories. today we have more than 3,000 products on aaron's.com, which is double from a year ago. and our express delivery program accounts for approximately 30% of e-commerce volume. because of this, we're generating a higher customer conversion rate, lowering our effective acquisition costs and delivering higher customer satisfaction.
i could not be happier with the efforts of our team and the growing marketplace we're creating on aaron's.com. as we discussed last quarter, our gennext stores continue to perform at a high level. during the third quarter, we increased the size of our gennext store set by 22 to end the quarter with 86 locations. and we believe we remain on track to have more than 100 gennext stores by the end of the year. to date, our portfolio of gennext stores is generating results that are exceeding our targeted 25% internal rate of return and 5-year payback period. equally as encouraging, monthly lease originations in gennext stores open for less than one year again grew at a rate of more than 20 percentage points higher than our average legacy stores. as we accelerate the rollout of new gennext
stores, we continue to maintain a disciplined approach around our execution of the strategy.
before i turn the call over to kelly, let me reiterate how pleased i am with the company's strong performance in the third quarter. our merchandising and supply chain teams have performed exceptionally well by getting ahead of market disruptions, by procuring inventory and expanding output from our woodhaven manufacturing facilities. as a result, we are entering the holiday season with strong inventory levels in both our stores and distribution centers and we have been increasing prices to respond to inflationary pressures and maintain product margins. i remain encouraged by the underlying performance of both our store and e-commerce channels as we're tracking well ahead of our 5-year plan on revenue and earnings.
i'll now turn the call over to kelly to discuss our financial results.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
thank you, douglas. for the third quarter of 2021, total revenues were $452.2 million compared with $441 million for the third quarter of 2020, an increase of 2.5%. the increase in revenues was primarily due to the increased size of our lease portfolio, partially offset by the expected lower customer payment activity during the quarter and the reduction of 79 franchise stores during the 15-month period ended september 30, 2021. lease revenues in the third quarter of this year also benefited by an increase in ticket size or monthly rent for agreement, that is offsetting the inflation we are experiencing in the cost of lease merchandise.
on a same-store basis, lease and retail revenues increased 4.6% in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter. as douglas mentioned, this is our sixth consecutive positive quarter of same-store revenue growth. leases originated in both our e-commerce and in-store channels contributed to our revenue growth, which was primarily driven by a larger same-store lease portfolio size, partially offset by the expected lower customer payment activity in the quarter. more specifically, in the third quarter of this year, our customer lease renewal rate was 89.7%, which was approximately 230 basis points higher than the 3-year third quarter pre-pandemic average but was approximately 130 basis points lower than the third quarter of last year. for any period, the customer lease renewal rate is calculated by dividing the amount of customer payments recorded on an accrual basis as of the end of such period by the amount of total customer lease payments due for renewal during that period.
as discussed on our last earnings call, the benefits to our customer from government stimulus programs declined in the third quarter and as expected, resulted in lower customer payment activity as compared to the prior year. we expect customer payment activity to continue to decline year-over-year for the next three or four quarters. and i will point out that a 100 basis point change up or down in customer lease renewal rates or write-offs on a $1.6 billion annual portfolio of total collectible customer lease payments results in a $16 million change in ebitda.
additionally, we continue to expect that customer payment activity will benefit from our investments in centralized decisioning. we estimate that this technology has improved lease renewal rates by over 100 basis points compared to the pre-pandemic levels, while also materially improving the customer experience and simplifying the day-to-day activities at our stores. e-commerce revenues increased 13.3% versus the third quarter of 2020 and represented 14.3% of overall lease revenues compared to 13.1% in the third quarter of the prior year. we continue to make investments in this important channel that we believe will continue to drive long-term growth for the company. the company ended the third quarter of 2021 with a lease portfolio size for all company-operated stores of $132.2 million, an increase of 5.8% compared to a lease portfolio size of $125 million on september 30 of last year. as a reminder, lease portfolio size represents the next month's total collectible lease payments from our aggregate outstanding customer lease agreements. management believes this is one of the metrics that is important in understanding the drivers of future lease revenue.
total operating expenses, excluding restructuring expenses and spin-related costs were up $15.7 million in the quarter as compared to the third quarter of last year. this increase is due primarily to higher personnel costs and a higher provision for lease merchandise write-offs. personnel costs increased $5.1 million in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher wages in our stores, additional personnel to support our key strategic initiatives and higher stand-alone public company costs. additionally, personnel costs were lower-than-anticipated during the third quarter this year as staffing levels in our stores remain below our operational targets due to the current challenges in the us labor market for retail-based hourly employees. other operating expenses were relatively flat to the prior year period due to higher occupancy, shipping and handling costs, professional services and bank and credit card-related fees. these increases were partially offset by lower advertising costs in the third quarter of 2021 versus the prior year period.
the provision for lease merchandise write-offs as a percentage of lease revenues and fees was 4.9% for the three months ended september 30, 2021, compared to an all-time low of 2.4% in the comparable period in 2020. the increase in write-offs in the third quarter of this year compared to last year was primarily due to lower customer payment activity following several quarters where our customers received financial assistance in the form of government stimulus payments and supplemental federal unemployment benefits. this normalization in write-offs was partially offset by the continued favorable impact of our technology investments, which include decisioning algorithms and customer payment platforms as well as our team's strong operational execution. as we discussed on prior earnings calls, we continue to expect that annual write-offs will be between 4% to 5% of lease revenues and fees.
adjusted ebitda for the company was $53.6 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared with $64.3 million for the same period in 2020, a decrease of $10.7 million or 16.6%. as a percentage of revenues, adjusted ebitda margin was 11.9% in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 14.6% for the same period in 2020. this expected decline in adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin was due to lower customer payment activity, higher lease merchandise write-offs and higher personnel costs compared to the prior year levels.
on a non-gaap basis, diluted earnings per share were $0.83 in the third quarter of 2021 compared with non-gaap diluted earnings per share of $1.10 for the same quarter in 2020. cash generated from operating activities was $30.2 million for the third quarter of 2021, a decline of $92.6 million compared to the third quarter of 2020. this decline was primarily due to incremental purchases of lease merchandise to meet increased customer demand and to mitigate the impact of anticipated supply chain challenges ahead of the upcoming holiday season. in addition, the cost of our lease merchandise was adversely impacted by inflationary pressure.
during the third quarter, the company purchased approximately 1,333,000 shares of aaron's common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $37.5 million and through a 10b5-1 plan continue to repurchase shares into the first month of the current quarter. for the year-to-date period ended october 22, 2021, the company has repurchased 3,034,000 shares for approximately $90.4 million. as of october 22, we had approximately $60 million remaining under the company's $150 million share repurchase program that was approved by our board in march of this year and ends december 31, 2023.
additionally, the company's board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend in august of $0.10 per share, which was paid on october 5. as of september 30, 2021, the company had a cash balance of $15 million, no outstanding debt and total available liquidity of $248 million, which includes $233 million available under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
as douglas highlighted in his remarks, we have again raised our full year revenue and adjusted ebitda outlook for 2021. for the full year, we have increased our outlook for total revenues to between $1.82 billion and $1.83 billion. we also increased our outlook for adjusted ebitda to between $225 million and $230 million.
for the full year 2021, we have maintained our outlook for an effective tax rate of 26%; we expect depreciation and amortization of approximately $70 million, and we expect the diluted weighted average share count for full year 2021 to be 34 million shares. we have not assumed any additional shares repurchased beyond what has been discussed earlier on the call.
we have also increased our full year same-store revenues outlook from a range of 6% to 8% to a range of 7.5% to 8.5%. this increase is primarily a result of the continued year-over-year growth in our lease portfolio size. we have maintained our expected capital expenditure range of $90 million to $100 million. we have reduced our free cash flow outlook for 2021 to $30 million to $40 million, primarily to reflect the significant investment in lease merchandise inventory the company has made to mitigate the impact of global supply chain challenges and the related inflationary pressures. based on our current inventory levels, we do not anticipate any material challenges in meeting our customers' product demand as we end 2021 and head into 2022.
as i have previously described, benefits to our customer from government stimulus programs have moderated in the third quarter. our revised outlook continues to assume customer lease payment activity remains higher in the fourth quarter of 2021 when compared to pre covid-19 pandemic levels, but lower than the fourth quarter of 2020. at the same time, we believe the favorable impact of centralized lease decisioning, our digital servicing platforms and other operational enhancements are contributing to a sustainable improvement in customer payment and write-off activity. additionally, we expect write-offs will continue to be lower in the fourth quarter of 2021 when compared to pre covid-19 pandemic levels but higher than the fourth quarter of 2020.
finally, our updated outlook assumes no significant deterioration in the current retail environment, state of the us economy or global supply chain as compared to their current conditions.
with that, i will now turn the call over to the operator, who will assist with your questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we have the first question on the phone lines from kyle joseph of jefferies. so kyle, please go ahead.
kyle joseph -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, good morning guys. thanks for having me on. congratulations on a good quarter. i just wanted to talk about your outlook for payment levels. i think -- i'm sorry, i missed it but i think you gave the write-off levels for the quarter. and then you talked about kind of the long-term outlook and just remind us about where that long-term outlook is versus kind of the historical range kind of before centralized underwriting.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yes. kyle, it's kelly. it's a great question. as we talked about, write-offs were up in the quarter as we expected, customer payment activity in the quarter, soft and not as strong as what we saw in the back half of last year and the first half of this year. again, we covered that on our earlier call. as it relates to kind of what we expect going forward, we did include some language in the earnings release, and we've also covered this in prior discussions and on the call last quarter.
as we move forward, and the customer is no longer benefiting from the customer stimulus that they've enjoyed for the last four quarters. they're going to be less liquid. and as we've talked about in the past, where our customer is less liquid, our customer payment activity is lower. so we do expect over the next three to four quarters that the customer payment activity will be lower than what we've seen in the last four quarters, but higher than what we experienced pre pandemic. and the real driver there is centralized decisioning and the other operational changes that we've made.
the centralized decisioning we estimate has added 100 basis points or better to our customer payment activity. and as a reminder, i mentioned this in my prepared remarks, right, 100 basis point improvement is worth about $16 million on a $1.6 million annual lease portfolio size. so as we move forward coming out of this, we'd expect to see just that, right, customer payment activity lower, and that reflected in lower lease renewal rates as well as higher write-offs. but we're encouraged, again, by the impact of centralized lease decisioning and the other operational changes we've made, which are having long-term positive benefits on the business.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
kyle, it's douglas. i will just add one thing to that. and just this metric that we've provided this quarter renewal rates at 89.7%, as we look at that historically, those rates have been pre pandemic in kind of the 87%, 88% range. and so we renewed about that many of our customers. the remaining balance up to 100% of what we could collect would be a product that we return and charge-offs, and then that's working with the customer and ultimately sort of get them the ownership, and that's kind of what we do every month when we get to work.
when the pandemic hit and stimulus began to roll out after the pandemic, we saw those renewal rates increase roughly 200 to 300 basis points in the second half of 2020. that elevated even further in the first half of 2021. and now what we're seeing in the third quarter, what kelly just described, is a normalizing of our renewal rates, albeit to a higher level we believe ultimately, because of centralized decisioning, once we return to normalized levels over the next 3 to 4 months. so i just want to give you the time line of kind of how that played out and what we're seeing as we move forward to support kelly's comments.
kyle joseph -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. i appreciate the color. and then a follow-up on that. how you see demand for new leases trending as we kind of -- with stimulus in the rearview, obviously an inflationary environment on consumer goods and broadly a normalizing credit environment out there as well?
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
sure. i mean, in the quarter, we've seen strong demand both in our stores and our e-commerce channel. our e-comm channel, in particular, because of our inventory position, has returned to normal. we comped up in e-comm at 13%, and that was comping over prior year almost 44%. so we're really happy with that on the revenue side of things. in terms of demand, obviously, there's been strong demand over the last few quarters as people are investing in their homes. we continue to see steady demand going into the fourth quarter. and while we don't have a crystal ball, we're optimistic about our inventory position and where we stand entering the fourth quarter. but in terms of forecasting demand, we'll wait and see in the fourth quarter.
kyle joseph -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. and one last one from me. it sounds like the gennext stores are doing very well. has the performance there kind of shifted the outlook for the overall store count you guys provided when -- at the initial spin time?
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
it's interesting. the stores are doing really well. as i said, we're exceeding our pro forma as we compare to control groups, our sales or what we deliver into our portfolio are up 20 points above our control group with a larger population of stores, now 86 stores in gennext. so that's really, really encouraging. we've got a full pipeline. we're going to do roughly 100 stores this year. i would expect we do roughly the same next year. i think what's changed is maybe our outlook on store closures, the pace of store closures or what we've merged into other stores has slowed a bit as we continue to watch the normalizing environment out there. i suspect as the environment -- the renewals environment continues to normalize, we'll go back to our same pace of store closures. ultimately, we think we can serve our 700 markets with fewer stores, bigger e-comm and a more efficient cost structure. and so that's still our long term objective, but we're very encouraged about the demand trends and the overall progress against our strategic plan.
kyle joseph -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. thanks very much for answering my questions and congrats on this quarter.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
thanks, kyle.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from vincent caintic from stephens. so, vincent, please go ahead. i've opened your line.
vincent caintic -- stephens inc. -- analyst
thank you. good morning. thanks for taking my questions. so first, two questions. so first kind of a broad question and then second on the fourth quarter expectations. so first, maybe if you could talk about and touch again on the inflationary pressures and how that's -- how you think that might affect your business and how you're handling it going forward? it's nice to see that you've placed those orders and built your inventory ahead of the holiday sales season. but just sort of how you're thinking about it broadly in terms of how we should think about gross profit margins and then also labor costs and anything of that nature? thank you.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
sure. vince, i'll kick off then we will pass it to steve olson to talk about specific product and supply chain issues. but we're experiencing the same economic impact as everyone else. we're seeing price increases in our products, components, fuel, transportation, wages. our merchandising group has done a phenomenal job of getting ahead of it, keeping pace with cost increases through price increases and our lease rates and so in the effort to preserve margin, and we've done a great job with that. as we commented, we're also -- our fulfillment centers are full, and our stores are full of inventory going into the holiday season. so we've overcome a lot of that disruption activity, which i'll let steve talk about.
as inflation rolls through the economy in the home sector, the number of customers, we believe, who are looking for payment plans will increase because of a retail product like a washer dryer or sofa will go up. and because of that, that upfront cost, particularly for our customers is sometimes unachievable or undoable and so they look for a lease option instead. and we can start having in a $1,000 product, an increase of $150 of retail. we can pass a $10 increase to that customer that they can manage within their budgets over a 24-month period. so we think based on our experience, credit tightening and inflation expands our market as our customers seek an offering other than a cash offering upfront. so we think it's a net-net positive as we move forward, and we feel like we've begun to see some of that in the demand trend. so i'll kick it to steve just on what he's seeing on the product side of things.
steve olsen -- president
great. thanks, douglas. good morning, vincent. first on the supply chain side. so we've been very proactive as douglas referenced in his prepared remarks. we transitioned early away from direct import as we saw those container and ocean freight costs going up and really transitioned to more domestic supplies with our existing suppliers and then went out and found these suppliers. so the merchant team has done a great job on that. we have woodhaven, which gives us a great view into raw material costs from a furniture standpoint, but allows us to pivot quickly and move to products that you may need to fill our core merchandise.
secondly, i'll talk on, call it, the pricing side. the team has done a nice job. we're very proactive with our suppliers. we have ongoing daily, weekly conversations with them about what they're seeing and what are trends around raw material costs and we're taking that information. and as we see price increases as douglas said, like everyone has, we quickly look at our lease rates not only in the products that may have received the cost increases, but across the entire assortment and we balance those prices across the entire price ladder to ensure we're maintaining our margins. so we continue to work through it, but i'm pleased so far with how the merchandising teams, supply chain teams are handling these inflationary environment.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yes. and lastly, vincent, on the labor question you had, we're seeing hourly wage rates increase. it's a very competitive market. but the wage rates that we've experienced thus far are consistent with inflationary trends that we're seeing in the overall economy. so nothing in excess.
vincent caintic -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay. perfect. okay. that's very detailed and very helpful. thank you. just a quick follow-up. so when i think about the fourth quarter, so normally a busy holiday sales season, some competitors, normal times would be doing, i guess, some sales, like friday sales up and things. so -- but still not being a normal season and i know, of course, last year, we were in normal season, but anything that -- how you're thinking about the competitive landscape or how basically retail is going to look for the fourth quarter? thank you.
steve olsen -- president
vincent, this is steve again. no, we're not going to comment on other retailers. but i will say, as douglas mentioned in his prepared remarks, and i mentioned a few minutes ago, we're in a great inventory position. we're pleased with the demand across our categories, whether it's furniture, appliances or electronics. we've put together a great marketing plan to really drive our visits in the fourth quarter, which really includes a further investment in digital marketing. those investments really go out and find new customers, engage with them and then drive them to our websites to experience that great user experience over our website as well as drive them into our stores. so we're ready for the fourth quarter, and we think we've put the necessary plans in place to make that happen.
vincent caintic -- stephens inc. -- analyst
perfect. very helpful. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. we now have the next question from anthony chukumba from loop capital markets. so anthony, please go ahead when you are ready.
anthony chukumba -- loop capital markets -- analyst
thank you so much for taking my question. congrats on the strong quarter as well. so couple questions. first one, very nitpicky, but i have in my notes, at one point, you said lease portfolio was up 6.1% year-over-year ending the fourth quarter then somewhere else i have it up 5.8%. i'm trying to reconcile the two. maybe i just misheard what you said.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yes. hey, anthony, it's kelly. i'll clarify that for you. so the 5.8%, that's the total lease portfolio size, right? well, the 6.1% that is on the same-store set.
anthony chukumba -- loop capital markets -- analyst
got it. okay. that's helpful. and then just in terms of -- i was wondering if you were seeing any -- in terms of lease originations, any sort of significant variation between your different major product categories? in other words, like there is appliance is really strong, consumer electronics, furniture. just wondering is the strength kind of broad based? are you seeing any particular outperformance or underperformance from a product category perspective?
steve olsen -- president
hi anthony, this is steve again. i'll be glad to answer that. so we did see strong results across all three major categories. but to give you a little more specifics, in furniture, upholstery had a really nice q3. appliances, laundry, laundry continues to be a strong category with great demand, it has been that way throughout the last year. and then on the electronics side, saw some rebound in tvs and continued performance in gaming.
anthony chukumba -- loop capital markets -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then if i can just sneak one last one in. i know in the past, you've talked about some of the new product categories that you've been testing in your stores and rolling out of your stores. just wondering if we could get a quick update on that.
steve olsen -- president
sure, anthony. it's steve again. we continue to expand our product assortment. as douglas mentioned in his prepared remarks, our e-commerce business in this growing marketplace is over 3,000 items, but specifically about what new categories. those new categories include exercise equipment, small appliances, power tools, home office and electric bikes. but with that, i'll say, we're constantly testing new categories, new items, and you'll see us going forward continue to expand out our assortment and into new categories that even we are not in today. so we're pleased with the results in these two categories, but we're really focused on the long-term in this growing marketplace position.
anthony chukumba -- loop capital markets -- analyst
that's helpful. good luck with the holiday selling season and keep up the good work.
steve olsen -- president
thanks, anthony.
operator
we now have a question from brad thomas of keybanc capital markets. sir, please go ahead when you are ready.
bradley b. thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi, good morning everybody and congrats on a good quarter. i wanted to ask a few follow-up questions here. maybe first, just starting with the inventory. i apologize if i missed it, but just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on maybe in percentage terms, how much inventory will be up here as you head into the fourth quarter into the holiday season? and how you're thinking about that sort of at a per-store level, how you're thinking about at the unit level, given that we have seen some inflation? just more color on that investment in inventory would be great.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yes. so brad, it's kelly. so as we mentioned, we did buy ahead, right? so we're running at higher than normal inventory levels at both our fcs and in our stores. i'd say that on a percentage basis, we're probably running about 15% higher than our target levels, and we really manage it across both our fcs and our stores because as we talked about in the past, our stores serve as many distribution hubs across the us. and so right now, we're pretty full. and we anticipated, as we mentioned, there be some challenges in the fourth quarter. we've had some opportunities to buy inventory kind of ahead of our typical cycle. that combined with the inflationary comments we talked about before, has put us in this higher position. and we expect that will normalize over time.
but we're in a really good position from a balance sheet perspective and a liquidity position. so we've taken advantage of that here. we were able to flex up and we were able to buy. we're going to kind of err[phonetic] on the side of being a bit heavy going into the end of the fourth quarter. and as we see our customer payment activity and the world hopefully start to normalize a little bit more, then we'll look at optimizing those levels going forward.
steve olsen -- president
hey, brad, this is steve. just to add a little more color. that strong inventory position is across our key categories. so we feel good about where we stand in appliances, where we stand in electronics and where we stand in upholstery -- excuse me, furniture. so we're ready for the fourth quarter. and as we look into the end of the fourth quarter and into q1, we'll see how we -- what our inventory position will look like as we get into the holiday season. but seems very proactive. and as kelly said, we're pleased with our inventory position.
bradley b. thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. and just to follow-up on all that is connecting the dots. and i think your implied guidance for the fourth quarter would have revenues flat to slightly down year-over-year, down about 2%, if my math is right and inventory is now up a lot. you just mentioned its core categories, they shouldn't have a lot of markdown risk. but just to connect these dots, was this more catch up on inventory, just strategic investments because of how tough the world is to get things for an investor that might ask, are we concerned that we may have risk of discounting in the future? how would you address those questions?
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yes. so brad, it's kelly again. it's really the normalization of our customer payment activity, right? so as we go from -- return back to kind of the 87% to 80% range plus the benefit of the centralized decisioning that we're enjoying, it's going to be the decline from what we've seen over the last four quarters. so that's really the driving impact of this, as you think about the impact on the top line as we continue to kind of manage the cost of goods and the flow-through there.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
yes. and brad, just to say another way, is we're not expecting a significant decline in the overall size of our portfolio. it's the rate at which we're renewing that portfolio each month, where the pressure will be on the top line.
bradley b. thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
if i could ask one more question just around expenses. obviously, 2021 has been a year where you're growing against a year where expenses were really lean. and kelly, can you help us get a better sense of what opex should grow at as we look out to next year in kind of a more normal environment?
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yes. so from the opex perspective, right, the key driver there is going to be labor, right? we continue to run pretty tight, right? and that -- not too kind of our optimal levels. i think a lot of folks in the retail environment are facing these types of challenges. so as we look forward, right now, brad, it's difficult to estimate kind of into next year specifically, what that's going to look like through a combination of getting our stores back to normal staffing levels combined with, we expect to continue to see some wage pressure, right? but that's going to be a big driver next year as we think about guidance that we'll provide here at the next call.
steve olsen -- president
yes, one additional comment on labor. if you leave the personnel increase we've experienced in this quarter versus prior year quarters, most of that is wage rate, not hours in our stores. really proud of what we've been able to do over the last few years of making investments to streamline our store labor costs, centralized decisioning has taken a lot of the burden off of our team members in our stores and a lot of the hours that we would spend sort of manually validating. we've also put in servicing platforms. we're now taking over 77% of our payments outside of the store. and so that's really saved on labor. and then we've had other operational efficiencies through self-service and our e-comm site that are allowing us to be more efficient and more productive in the way we go about business. so while we expect to see more hours in our store, particularly next year, as payments normalize, customer payments normalize, there's more effort put into that. we do not believe we'll return to historical levels of store staffing.
bradley b. thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thanks. very helpful. thank you so much.
operator
we have another question in the phone lines from jason haas of bank of america. hey, jason, please go ahead. awaiting your line.
jason haas -- bofa securities -- analyst
great. thanks. good morning and thanks for taking my question. so the first one i wanted to ask about is just on the cadence that you saw through the quarter, both in terms of originations and write-offs. i'm curious to know what you saw as it relates to the child tax credit continuing to go out? and then also as the extra unemployment insurance was stopped at the beginning of september?
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yes. hey, jason, it's kelly. so i'd say we did expect to see kind of a slowdown in the customer payment activity through the course of the quarter tied to, as you mentioned, the end of the unemployment stimulus that was provided. and that was offset to some degree by the child tax credit. but as you play through the quarter, as we look at our lease renewal rates, it appears that there was a benefit, clearly at the beginning of the quarter, but that benefit continued to tail, alright, as we moved through q3.
as we somewhat expected because, again, you've got our customer as we're coming out of a very heavy stimulus hitting environment, right? it wasn't just the checks that they were receiving from the state and federal government, it's also where they haven't paid in other forms of assistance then received through that period of time. so as their life is returning back to somewhat normal from a financial perspective they are seeing other challenges as well and we continue to see our customer payment activity normalize.
jason haas -- bofa securities -- analyst
great. thanks. and then as a follow-up question. i'm curious, it sounds like you're in a pretty good position in terms of inventory, all things considered. so i'm curious if you're thinking about maybe potentially picking up some share, maybe some other retailers are less in stock. you see like there's some opportunity there in fourth quarter and maybe even beyond?
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
yes. this is douglas, jason. we definitely think it's opportunity, like anytime you can have products in your stores, particularly our customers who wants or needs that that product that day, there's an advantage. so i'm really happy with the fact that we've got a lot of product to offer, particularly during our peak season in the fourth quarter. but i'm equally as optimistic about is the inventory levels that we have in our fulfillment centers, which serve our e-comm business. i think we're up, last year's supply chain was very challenging this time, we're up over 80% in our fulfillment centers in terms of inventory levels over last year, and we are ready for the holidays with plenty on our e-com site, 3,000 skus and full warehouses. so that bodes well for the demand side of the business.
jason haas -- bofa securities -- analyst
good to hear. thank you.
operator
we now have the next question from bobby griffin from raymond james. so, i've opened your line. please go ahead when you are ready.
bobby griffin -- raymond james -- analyst
thank you and good morning everybody. hope everybody is doing well. regarding -- kelly, i just kind of want to talk maybe high level and a little bit more long term, but you guys called out at few different times that you're tracking well ahead of the long-term strategy that our plan that we laid out. and when you think about, for instance, merchandise loss ratios normalizing in the next year, are they normalizing better than you would have expected when you kind of spun out when we originally talked?
and i guess what i'm getting at is, is the long-term ebitda guidance or target out there now maybe more conservative as we sit here and look at the business today with some of the progress you've made.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yes. hey, bobby, it's kelly. what i'd say is that from that write-off perspective, we continue to expect on the same levels of write-offs this 4% to 5% that we've talked about pretty consistently since just kind of the pre-spin roadshow, right? so there's no changes there. i'd say where we're really ahead is we've grown the business pretty significantly. so our lease portfolio size as we go into 2022 is well ahead of where we had anticipated in that longer-term outlook we provided before. we'll also continue to see really good results out of gennext, right? and so the performance in those stores are -- as douglas has mentioned on a few different occasions, that we're exceeding our expectations, repeating our performance. and as that continues, that gives us even more confidence, right, in that longer-term strategy and plan that we laid out.
so those are really the kind of key drivers as we think about getting ahead of the plan from a financial performance perspective. yes. i'd say that from a margin standpoint, we're still kind of -- i believe that longer term, we're in this 11.5% to 12.5% range. so there's no change there, but it's really kind of accelerating the growth and the overall kind of revenue and ebitda we're going to achieve in the earlier[phonetic] years here.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
and bobby, one other thing i'd say is our centralized decisioning platform has been a huge asset for us, and we continue to sort of optimize outcomes in that area. and so while the 4.5%, kelly is exactly right, 4.5% to 5%, we think is the normalized state of our charge offs, we continue to be able to find opportunities to optimize our customer and react to market conditions, which has been a huge, huge asset for us over the last 12 months.
bobby griffin -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and kelly, just to make sure i kind of understand, the size of the portfolio is getting to your target level quicker than you originally anticipated? or is the reason the margin is not potentially a little bit higher, just that the labor cost or somewhere else in the p&l has increased a little bit faster given our current environment. i mean i don't think any of us would predict labor the way it was is today 18 months ago or 12 months ago.
c. kelly wall -- chief financial officer
yes, bobby, great question. so i'd say it's really more of the growth in the business, not the increase in our cost of labor. as douglas mentioned, right, through centralized decisioning and other investments we've made from a technology perspective, we're seeing that we can operate the stores with less hours than what we have done kind of pre rolling out of rco[phonetic]. so while wage pressure will continue to impact the business going forward and right now, we're not seeing -- expecting it to have any material impact relative to what we were thinking kind of pre spin. so it's the growth in the business. it's not changes in margins at this point.
bobby griffin -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. very helpful. and then, i guess, lastly, as i understand you guys will price and then the advantage of your businesses, it's low monthly payment, so it doesn't hit the consumer as much. you can spread it out. has that started to show up in the comps yet? or is that more going to be a 4q, 1q 2022 type benefit the comps where more products are going to be getting repriced a little bit higher monthly payments.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
bobby, this is douglas. so we hear you, do see in our revenue line and what we're writing into the portfolio, higher ticket this year versus last, we're probably up 3% to 4% in ticket year-over-year. and so that translates. but remember, what we write into our portfolio is only a fraction of what's in our portfolio. so the revenue we recognize is the overall portfolio's ticket versus what we're experiencing now. so you'll begin to see more and more of that sort of translating through to revenue and the same-store revenues as we move forward.
bobby griffin -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. very helpful. i appreciate the detail on the 3% to 4%, doug. best of luck here in 4q and on into 2022.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
alright. thanks, bobby.
operator
thank you. we have no further questions. so i hand it back to douglas lindsay to close.
douglas a. lindsay -- chief executive officer
