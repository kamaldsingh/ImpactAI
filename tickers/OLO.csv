noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
hi, everyone. thank you for spending this time with us today. i'm noah glass, the founder and ceo of olo. i'm thrilled to be with you on this call and to share my thoughts on our company, our opportunity, and our q1 performance.
given that this is our first earnings call, i thought i'd take a moment to introduce you to olo and what we do. olo is a leading cloud-based on-demand commerce platform for multilocation restaurant brands, now serving over 400 restaurant brands and approximately 69,000 individual restaurant locations, and enabling them to let consumers order ahead, pay ahead, and get their food faster for takeout, delivery, and more. our mission is to help our restaurant customers thrive by best meeting the needs of the on-demand consumer. i founded olo over 15 years ago out of my desire to get a cup of coffee faster by ordering ahead and skipping the line, instead of waiting in line at a busy coffee shop.
since then, we've experienced an incredible journey, and i want to take a few moments to share some of the building blocks of the strategy that took us from an idea in june 2005 to a public company that is today the restaurant industry's mission-critical software platform and with a mission to touch, add value to, and derive revenue from every restaurant industry transaction. importantly, olo is a b2b software platform, not a b2c marketplace or aggregator. as a result, many of you have likely used olo without knowing it when you place orders at your favorite restaurant brands. olo is a platform, primarily enabling enterprise restaurant brands to create their direct-to-consumer applications to enable on-demand commerce.
olo is not a consumer brand. rather, our interests are aligned with our customers' interests to help them drive direct digital traffic first and foremost. that takes the form of enabling ordering ahead, whether that's counter pickup, curbside pickup, delivery, or these days, even tableside delivery. if you had to describe a restaurant, you'd likely describe the traditional table service model.
arriving at the restaurant and being seated, reviewing a menu, placing an order with a server after a brief conversation, and then sometime later having a meal delivered to your table, and eating the meal before paying and leaving. well, that kind of experience is simply no longer representative of the majority of transactions in the restaurant industry. and that fact has been true even before the covid-19 era. in fact, if you look at 2019 and you gauge the percentage of transactions represented by what the industry calls off-premise, that it is food consumed outside the four walls of the restaurant.
off-premise represented 63% of all restaurant industry transactions in the u.s. in that context, you can understand why it's so valuable for restaurants to enable a more efficient model for ordering and paying for a meal that will be consumed off-premise, both for the benefit of the consumer and for the operational efficiency of the restaurant. by enabling the consumer to order ahead, pay ahead, and get their food at the restaurant without having to wait for it, the restaurant can both enrich that consumer experience and improve their operational and financial performance at the same time. this is the core capability that olo enabled and is popularized in the restaurant industry over the past 15-plus years of our operating history.
the restaurant industry's shift to digital ordering has resulted in a steady and exponential growth curve of restaurant adoption of digital ordering capabilities and consumer adoption of choosing to order through digital ordering versus ordering in more traditional methods like in-person or calling over the phone. the covid-19 era pulled digital ordering adoption into the future as many restaurants had limited on-premise dining service. they have shifted their attention and consumers have shifted their use of restaurants to off-premise dining occasions. this shift and the broader interest in safety through contactless order collection has meant that digital ordering has become even more essential and has indeed become mission-critical to olo customers and the restaurant industry as a whole.
years ago, when i would speak to team olo about my long-term vision for our company, i would reference a milestone moment in which we achieved 51% of the sales of one of our customers. i said that moment would represent olo becoming the majority order channel for that customer and others would soon follow. the dawn of digital ordering primacy. we're now seeing olo restaurant customers who are processing 100% of their transaction volume through the olo platform.
this includes takeout orders, delivery orders, marketplace orders, and even tableside orders that are typically initiated when the guest sits at a table and scanned the unique qr code to identify the table where a server or runner can deliver the food. olo's ambition has now grown from digital primacy to digital entirety, from 51% digital to 100% digital. we believe that olo's destiny is to touch every transaction, add value to every transaction, and derive revenue from every transaction in the restaurant industry. olo's march ipo was the manifestation of our desire to make a strong statement to our stakeholders.
olo is and always will be an independent open software as a service, or saas, platform, providing a stable and extensible foundation for the restaurant industry and ecosystem to build upon for the long term. olo believes in a level playing field that promotes healthy competition, which is best for the restaurant industry. olo is committed to serving as a neutral and open platform for the long term. to that end, we're excited to reaffirm our partnerships with doordash and uber eats and celebrate over a dozen marketplace partners engaging with olo's exclusive restaurant network through olo rails, and a similar number of delivery service providers engaging through olo dispatch.
we continue to focus on scaling our open saas platform and bringing on the best partners to add to our rich partner ecosystem of over 100 technology partners, all for the benefit of our restaurant customers. it bears repeating that our transactional saas business model means that more transaction volume processed through olo leads to higher revenue for olo, similar to other consumption-based models in saas. in december 2020, we celebrated the milestone of achieving olo order number 1 billion on a cumulative basis since our founding in june 2005. it's worth noting that we process more than half of those total orders.
in other words, over 500 million orders in 2020 alone. while we believe that the impact of covid-19 has served as a tailwind for the 2020 transaction volume growth on the olo platform, remember that the larger digital transformation of the restaurant industry has been playing out atop the olo platform throughout our 15-plus year journey. more restaurants, more digital ordering capabilities, and more consumers adopting this new digital ordering behavior means higher transaction volume year over year and continued 120%-plus net revenue retention. in q1, we were proud to help bloomin' brands, parent to outback steakhouse and carrabba's italian grill, replatform from their long-standing homegrown digital ordering program to olo.
this is another anchor for our conviction that olo's enterprise-grade saas platform will be a compelling alternative to the capex and opex of building in-house. olo's enterprise-grade open saas platform offers lower upfront costs, faster time to market, lower ongoing costs of ownership, built-in best practices from a decade and a half of experience, ongoing innovation, a broader partner ecosystem, and benchmarking against 400-plus other customers. in short, saas wins over homegrown software. as we discussed at length in our s-1 and throughout our ipo roadshow, we're incredibly excited about the opportunity presented by the quick service restaurant, or qsr, drive-thru industry, engaging with on-demand commerce.
the qsr segment represents both the largest number of addressable restaurant locations and the largest number of transactions per location, and therefore, represents the largest pool of transactions in the restaurant industry, and an exciting segment for olo given our transactional saas business model. in general, qsr brands have grown over the years through franchising, leading to disparate technology systems across franchisee operator groups and manifesting in the kind of nonhomogeneous environments for which olo was purpose-built. we further penetrated the qsr drive-thru segment in q1 with new deployments at culver's and crystal, as these brands embraced on-demand commerce as a new way of providing the most convenient experiences for consumers. we celebrated other notable deployments with nando's u.s., growing our relationship with nando's that began in canada, and an expansion of our relationship with fine dining standard-bearer, union square hospitality group, whose ceo, danny meyer, is a member of our board of directors.
our expanded ushg relationship includes the deployment of its flagship, union square cafe, as well as gramercy tavern, blue smoke, and marta, further demonstrating that on-demand commerce can play an important role for every restaurant type, even fine dining, going forward. and we're also excited about the growth of virtual brands. brands that don't have their own physical locations and instead use host kitchens or ghost kitchens to produce their food for digital-only ordering and a delivery-only service model. these virtual brands demonstrate that olo's total addressable market is not bounded by the current number of restaurant locations.
rather, it is tied to total restaurant industry transactions. and this number is not fixed but expanding with population growth and greater consumer preference for prepared food, off-premise consumption, and digital ordering. this quarter, we launched two additional celebrity-powered virtual brands, including goop kitchen and guy fieri's flavortown kitchen. these digital-only, delivery-only virtual brands are inherently 100% digital, and therefore, speed olo's path to realize our now grander ambition to touch, add value to, and derive revenue from every restaurant industry transaction.
finally, i would be remiss if i did not mention team olo and our olo for good initiative. during q1, our team continued to work from home due to covid-19 restrictions. olo's workforce was built to support remote working well before covid-19. so this has been a relatively natural transition for our team.
although we look forward to being able to gather in person again in the near future, i'm proud that our team has managed to execute on behalf of olo and our restaurant customers from a fully remote environment. also during q1, we joined pledge 1% to donate 1% of our time, equity, and product, and launched olo for good. our olo for good efforts are focused on advancing racial, ethnic, and gender diversity, equity, and inclusion, providing relief and support for the restaurant industry and its frontline workers, and ending childhood hunger. improving our community and our world is in olo's dna.
we're excited to use our new status as a public company for doing even more good for our community and our industry. while we're incredibly proud to have processed over 500 million orders in 2020, we're reminded that the restaurant industry processes approximately 60 billion transactions each year. on our recent board call, one of olo's directors asked me what inning we were in for the olo journey? given that we're yet to achieve 1% of restaurant industry transactions, my response was we're just getting out of the dugout. as i constantly remind team olo, we have miles to go before we sleep.
we'll continue to invest in our team, our customers, our community, and our partners as we feel that this is in the best long-term interests of our shareowners and in line with the tenets of olo board member danny meyer's philosophy of enlightened hospitality. here at olo, we invest in solutions that both increase our opportunity to reach new restaurants with our on-demand commerce platform and help us to generate more value for those customers and more revenue from our platform in the form of additional average revenue per unit or arpu. we're thrilled to be a public company and one committed for the long term to the success of our customers and partners by adding value to their businesses, generating revenue for our business, and delivering returns for our shareowners. i've never felt more excited, more optimistic, or more purpose-driven than i do today.
and i'm excited for peter benevides, olo's cfo, to provide a quantitative reflection of the way i feel. peter, over to you.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
thanks, noah. today, i'll review our first-quarter fiscal 2021 results in detail and provide guidance for the second-quarter and full-year fiscal 2021. given this is our first earnings call, i'd like to start by briefly reviewing our financial model. we define our business model as a transactional saas model as it includes both subscription and transaction-based revenue streams that increase as transaction volumes grow.
our platform allows our restaurant customers the ability to provide great experiences to their consumers and increase revenue. as our restaurant brands increase revenue, our transactional saas model allows us to share in their success. the subscription element of our transactional saas model includes both a fixed fee component, as well as a usage-based component that increases as transaction volumes grow. we also charge per-transaction fees for certain ordering and delivery enablement products.
combined subscription and transaction fees charged on a per-location basis is defined as arpu or average revenue per unit. our ability to grow revenue is a function of adding more restaurant locations to the platform, as well as increasing the revenue we earn on a per-location basis or arpu. we believe our transactional saas model provides the best of both worlds, visibility and predictability aided by the subscription component and revenue upside due to transaction volume growth. with that background, let's take a closer look at our first-quarter results.
total revenue for the first quarter was $36.1 million, up 125% year over year. platform revenue in the first quarter was $34.9 million, up 136% year over year, primarily due to an increase in active locations coming onto the platform, as well as increased arpu, driven by higher transaction volume growth and continued multiproduct adoption. while we are proud of our q1 results which show the value that olo provides its restaurant customers, our first-quarter results benefited from covid-19 in two ways. first, continued strong order volume growth.
and second, a relatively easy compare since q1 2020 was the last quarter prior to the onset of covid-19. i will get into this a bit more in a few moments when i talked for our q2 and 2021 full-year guidance. in terms of key metrics, we saw continued positive performance for the first quarter across all three key metrics: active locations, arpu, and net revenue retention. let's spend a moment discussing each in a bit more detail.
an active location is defined as a unique restaurant location live on the platform with at least one product module. so for example, if an individual restaurant location subscribes to three modules such as ordering, dispatch, and rails, we would count that location once as a unique active location. that said, we ended the first quarter with approximately 69,000 active locations on the platform, a 42% increase year over year, and a 7% increase sequentially. this included some locations that we had originally expected to deploy in the second quarter which helped to increase platform revenue.
additionally, the average revenue per unit, or arpu, which represents the average quarterly platform revenue we earn on a per-location basis, continue to trend well. as a reminder, arpu takes into account all modules subscribed to by a unique location, as well as both subscription and transaction-based revenue stream. that said, for the first quarter, we generated an arpu of approximately $525, a 61% increase year over year, and an 11% increase sequentially. growth in arpu is the result of continued growth in multiproduct adoption, as well as increased transaction volumes which helped increase both subscription and transaction-based revenue stream.
lastly, net revenue retention, which measures the period-over-period change in total platform revenue for brands in the current quarter that had at least one live location in the same quarter a year prior, remains strong. for the first quarter, we continue to maintain net revenue retention in excess of 120%, a result of continuing to satisfy and retain our customers, increased multiproduct adoption, growth in transaction volumes, and further expansion of our partnership ecosystem. for the remainder of the financial metrics disclosed, unless otherwise noted, i will be referencing non-gaap financial measures. gross profit for the first quarter was $30 million, representing a gross margin of 83%.
this compares to a gross margin of 74% a year ago. year-over-year improvements in gross margin was largely a result of increased leverage in platform revenue streams where gross margin was 86%. this compares to a platform gross margin of 78% a year ago. sales and marketing expense for the first quarter was $3.4 million or 10% of revenue.
this compares to $2.2 million and 14% a year ago. on a dollar basis, increases in sales and marketing spend were driven by our proactive investment in customer acquisition and expanding our sales organization and brand marketing, partially offset by reduced spending on travel and trade conferences as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. while we have a highly efficient one-to-many sales model in which we sell at the enterprise restaurant brand level and secure all locations within that brand to long-term exclusive contracts, we anticipate investment in sales and marketing to increase on a dollar basis and as a percent of revenue in the short term as we continue to invest in our ability to sell new products and increase the visibility of our brand to new and existing customers. research and development expense for the first quarter was $11 million or 30% of total revenue.
this compares to $7 million and 43% a year ago. investing in our platform in developing new platform features and enhancements that will increase the value we can deliver to our customers is a primary strategic focus for olo. we have made incremental investments in recent quarters to maintain a strong platform performance and the uptime necessary to help our customers as they manage the sharp increase in their digital order volumes. we anticipate investments in this area to increase on a dollar basis and as a percent of revenue in the short term as we continue to invest in innovative solutions to support our customers' rapidly evolving needs.
general and administrative expense for the first quarter was $9.5 million or 26% of total revenue. this compares to $4.3 million and 27% a year ago. on a dollar basis, the increase was primarily tied to our efforts to support becoming and operating as a public company. we expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to grow on a dollar basis while decline as a percentage of revenue as we continue to scale our operations over time.
operating income for the first quarter was $6 million, compared to a loss of $1.6 million a year ago. we believe this improvement in profitability illustrates our ability to meet increased demand cost effectively, as well as the benefits associated with our high leverage success-based pricing model. as we continue to grow and scale the business, we believe we have a great opportunity to continue to invest in capturing more of our total addressable market while meeting the needs of our existing customer base. net income for the first quarter was $6 million, or $0.03 per share based on $185.5 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
turning our attention to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance was $586.6 million as of march 31, 2021. this reflects $485.5 million of net proceeds from our successful initial public offering in march. regarding cash flows, operating cash flow was $4.2 million, compared to $3.7 million a year ago.
free cash flow was $4 million, compared to $3.6 million a year ago. before i turn to guidance, i would like to spend a moment discussing the recently announced multiyear agreement with doordash. this new three-year agreement reinforces the long-term commercial partnership between olo and doordash and will enable us to continue to work together on products and features that will unlock value for both companies, as well as our shared customer base. from a financial perspective, this new agreement is in line with our expectations and we are really excited for the path ahead.
i'll wrap up by providing our guidance for the second-quarter and full-year 2021. for the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $33.9 million to $34.4 million and non-gaap operating income in the range of $2.3 million to $2.7 million. for the fiscal-year 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $140.4 million to $141.9 million and non-gaap operating income in the range of $13.3 million to $14.5 million. i would like to highlight a few things to keep in mind about our outlook.
we are incredibly excited by the underlying trends in our business and the market opportunity ahead of us. as noah mentioned, we are still in the very early stages of the shift to digital ordering and expect to continue to deliver strong revenue growth rates. at the same time, we expect the extraordinary growth in order volume that we experienced during covid-19 will begin to moderate to a more normalized level. while we expect good overall transaction volume growth in 2021 given the number of new locations that we expect to deploy on our platform, coupled with expected further increased penetration of dispatch and rails, and anticipated continued growth in our partnership ecosystem, there is also uncertainty in the near term pertaining to per location transaction volumes given some of the evolving dynamics at play.
specifically, as vaccination levels and in-person dining continue to increase, we anticipate digital order volumes in the second and third quarter to be impacted, and then normalized by the end of the year. additionally, this past quarter, the fiscal stimulus pertaining to the recently enacted american jobs act helped fuel transaction volume growth. with similar stimulus programs uncertain as we move forward, we remain thoughtful as to how we think about order volume growth. with that said, we will continue to take a prudent approach to forecasting given the uncertainty related to order volume trends due to the covid-19 pandemic.
to summarize, we delivered another exceptional quarter of operational and financial performance. we are delivering on our mission and believe olo's position at the center of the digital restaurant experience will continue to drive an attractive combination of strong revenue growth and profitability. i'd now like to turn it over to the operator to begin the q&a session. operator?

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we have your first question from chris merwin with goldman sachs. your line is open.
chris merwin -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey. thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great first quarter. you're out of the gate. i just wanted to ask with more restaurant reopenings with indoor dining and the like, can you talk a bit about what you're seeing with online gmv? and maybe as another way, what percentage of your restaurants are in categories with the high mix of in-person dining versus delivery and versus restaurants where 100% of their order volume could easily be online? i'm just trying to get a sense for what that restaurant mix looks like and generally what the trends you're seeing are as it relates to online ordering gmv.
thanks.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yeah. thank you, chris. peter here. so, look, from a trend perspective, what we've seen this past quarter has largely remained in line with what we've seen in recent quarters in terms of trends and transaction volumes.
we obviously started to comp a bit against the initial impact of covid at the end of the quarter. so our expectation has been that, you know, order volumes would start to see some near-term impact from increased vaccine -- vaccinations and pent-up demand for in-person dining, which, you know, from our perspective is likely to play out a bit more in q2 and q3. and while early, we have started to see some signs of that in april. again, in line with our expectations.
but i think from a high level, i think, you know, we're really excited about the underlying trends of the business. they continue to be strong i think as evidenced by our q1 performance, and as well as our guide for the next quarter with a 40% year-over-year target at the midpoint of the range. so really excited about the trends ahead.
chris merwin -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok, perfect. and maybe just one quick follow-up. i just wanted to ask about olo pay. anything you can share there about timing around, you know, when you might be targeting its general availability or any kind of initial -- i think it might be in beta, but any sort of customer feedback to date? thanks.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
hey, chris, noah here. so on olo pay, still very early. same as when we spoke about olo pay in analyst day and along the roadshow. we're continuing to work with a handful of brands that are in beta.
i think that's the appropriate way of thinking about '21. this is the time when we're going to learn. during 2022, we're going to work with some additional brands and really try to make sure that we get it right and have some great reference accounts there, with the expectation that in 2023, we'll be in a position to step on the gas from a go-to-market perspective. so i have hold two thoughts on that.
one, early in the process of deploying this, we're learning a lot. we're applying our growth mindset to it as we go about olo pay. but we think of this as a big opportunity and we want to make sure that we get it right.
chris merwin -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok, great. thank you.
operator
we have your next question from sterling auty with j.p. morgan. your line is open.
sterling auty -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah, thanks. hi, guys. so wondering, in terms of the visibility on the number of locations that you roll out this year, how much control or how much of that is locked in? and what i'm wondering is this. in an individual franchise location, let's say we have a big rush to, you know, to in-store dining, can they turn around and say, hey, we were originally scheduled to go live on olo in the first week of september but we wanted to lay that to 2022?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes, sterling, so thank you for the question. peter here. so i guess let's just talk about q1 performance for a moment in terms of new location adds, and then i'll address the second part of your question on the in-person dining -- in-person dining dynamic and how that may impact deployments in the coming quarters. so, you know, in terms of this past quarter, obviously, deployments exceeded our expectations, which i think is in part what you're seeing play out in the revenue outperformance.
and this was in large part really a function of timing. so on a full-year tar -- our full-year target basis, it remains unchanged. we've been targeting the low double-digit tens of thousands of location adds in 2021 and we're tracking well to that level. so while we -- you know, we don't think what occurred in q1 is a normalized rate of growth going forward, we're really excited to see, you know, the momentum that we've built up in q1 as we enter into q2.
in terms of reopenings and the impact that could have on deployments, we're not seeing any indication of that at this time. we're seeing a lot of momentum in brands wanting to have their digital ordering, you know, their digital ordering systems up and running as really an opportunity to increase revenue and address consumer demand given that, you know, consumers have come to appreciate and enjoy the benefits associated with digital ordering. so at this point, we're not seeing brands having to make a binary decision between reopening and deploying digital ordering. we're seeing a lot of momentum on that front.
sterling auty -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
makes sense. thank you.
operator
we have your next question from brad reback with stifel. your line is open.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thanks very much. maybe if we can flip sterling's question a little bit and look at it from this perspective where restaurants are clearly having a hard time hiring enough people to meet demand. are you seeing organizations begin to use a little more aggressively in-store to help meet that shortfall? thanks a lot.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
brad, this is noah. thanks for the question. i think this is something that we've seen over our history is brand thinking about how they can best deploy labor to provide the greatest hospitality to their guests. and i think one of the things that's always been true about olo is there isn't a lot of hospitality in the experience of taking somebody's order and ringing them up for the transaction.
and those are the things that our platform has always automated. so what that means is that, historically, brands have been able to use their labor, use those resources to providing a more hospitable experience in actions like handing the order over to the consumer and having a conversation with them there. so we're really excited about that. and then we also are seeing, as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, the use of qr codes on the table for what we think of as table service 2.0 of the consumer scanning a qr code that then tags that order with the table number so that a server or a runner can run the order out to them.
and i think that these are things that are going to help brands do more with less from a labor standpoint and be efficient. we're not saying that brand should have less labor than they'd have traditionally had. we believe there's going to be a lot of in-person dining and sustained high levels of off-premise dining continuing to grow as we've seen. we think that digital and olo have a big role to play in both, have a big role to play in off-premise and a big role to play in on-premise, and that is why our new ambition is not just about the 63% of transactions in the industry that are off-premise, but all 100% of the transactions in the industry.
and we're excited about that new ambition.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great. thanks very much.
operator
we have your next question from bhavan suri with william blair. your line is open.
bhavan suri -- william blair -- analyst
hey, noah, peter, congrats. nice job there. i guess i want to touch on a couple of things. maybe i'll start off with arpu.
you have really nice uptick in arpu and i was just wondering, sort of could you give us an updated number of locations using all three modules? as you think about that arpu of growth, how should we think about going forward between module uptake versus, you know, in for a client transactional. i know you've dampened the in for client transactional and just to be conservative, but help us how we think about that through the year?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yeah. so just -- thank you for that question, bhavan. so in terms of multiproduct adoption, we made a lot of progress this past quarter in terms of deploying dispatch and rails. and that is, again, in part what's driving the outperformance in q1 and the increases in arpu that you've seen.
you know, looking forward, there are still brands in the deployment pipeline that will deploy in later quarters across dispatch and rails, and that is what is reflected in the numbers that we've shared. that said, we also continue to see growth in brands subscribing to one -- sorry, more than one olo module from the onset of the relationship which could have an impact on net revenue retention long term because we're starting at a higher base. but it's great to see arpu in that case starting at a higher point. in addition to dispatch and rails upsells that have been positive, today, we're also seeing a lot of momentum in olo network and virtual brands, which noah covered in his remarks.
both of those have been gaining more traction as growth vectors for the company, which is exciting to see. so, you know, in short, a lot of opportunity for growth ahead across a number of different modules and you'll start to see that play out in arpu over time.
bhavan suri -- william blair -- analyst
yeah. no, that's helpful. i guess i want to touch on exactly that the virtual brands, those kitchens, right, you highlighted goop kitchen and flavortown but not this year or next year when these are still kind of a novel concept. but you take the question that was previously asked about this labor issue, this idea that i'm going to have great hospitality, i don't need you to come and get it because i'm just going to have a kitchen and deliver what i do, which is make really good food as a chef.
what do you think that looks like from the actual ghost kitchen in the marketplace in say three to five years? and then, obviously, that plays into olo. and so what do you think that looks like as just part of your business in three to five years?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
thanks, bhavan. i'll take that. this is noah. look, we're really excited about the trend of these virtual brands.
we think that they're great opportunities both for existing restaurants that want to add on to what they're able to do out of their existing fleet of restaurant kitchens. we see restaurant brands launching additional virtual brand concepts, but cooking out of their existing fleet. and then for entrepreneurs, as you mentioned, we mentioned the two new celebrity-inspired virtual brands with goop kitchen and guy fieri's flavortown kitchen in the prepared remarks. we think there's going to be more of this going forward.
that this is really democratizing access to launching restaurants. and it's not just launching in a single geography. we have examples in mrbeast burger late in 2020 of a concept that was launched simultaneously in 200 kitchens across the country overnight, and that was something that used to take decades and decades for restaurant operators, restaurant entrepreneurs to achieve that kind of physical availability. so we're excited about that.
and of course, from the olo perspective, the fact that, as you mentioned, these are inherently 100% digital. and so it really speeds our path to getting to that ultimate destiny of touching every transaction, adding value to every transaction, and deriving revenue from every transaction. and i think that restaurants and restaurant operators are proving that they can manage these virtual brands in a way that is highly profitable and perhaps more profitable than the commission-heavy order volume that they're getting through marketplace channels. i think that'll be an interesting trend to see over time is our restaurants doing virtual brands more and accepting orders through restaurant delivery marketplaces less.
do both of those trends right at the same time. we're excited about all of that adding to the digital ordering market and olo's opportunity.

we have your next question from terry tillman with truist. your line is open.
terry tillman -- truist securities -- analyst
yeah, thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on this initial quarter as a public company. i guess maybe the first question is, you know, as we get through -- we got through '20. i assume some of these large qsr brands and just large brands, in general, across the food industry just got by with something they had in place. you mentioned bloomin' brands with something like a great replatforming.
what i'd i love to hear, noah, is kind of what you're seeing over the last quarter or two in terms of propensity to say, hey, we got through the pandemic, not in great shape, but now let's go do a real replatforming? so what is the pipeline like for these larger kind of replatforming opportunities?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
hi, terry, it's a great question and it's something that we're excited about. i mean, when we think about the different segments of the industry, it's not the same story in each segment. there are qsr opportunities that are largely greenfield opportunities. and then there are these other opportunities typically in casual dining or in fast-casual that are replatforming opportunities.
we have a great track record of taking brands that have built in-house, whether that's brinker with chili's and maggiano's or if we look at papa murphy's, both of which we talked about at length during our roadshow, or this new example of bloomin' brands with outback and carrabba's, and we think that long-term saas wins and that there's a great opportunity for brands that have built in-house to see, ok, there is some strong capital in the initial capex, but it's really the opex, that ongoing cost of doing this in-house, that i could save money on and have better innovation, better benchmarking against other brands, a broader partner ecosystem by moving to a mature enterprise-grade saas provider. and we believe that's the role that we're playing. and also that there are parts and pieces of what we do that can add value to a brand that maybe isn't ready to replatform their entire stack over to olo but might say, you know, i could use olo to add direct channel delivery with the dispatch platform or i could use olo to take orders from marketplaces through the rails platform. and we can begin to develop our relationship with those brands through components of our full product stack, and then ultimately prove ourselves and win the full stack over time.
so we're excited about the opportunity with those kind of replatforming kind of brands and we think that this is a moment where it's been proven that on-demand commerce is mission-critical. it's not ok just to have a program for on-demand commerce, you need the best program for on-demand commerce and we believe that's what we've set up olo to be.
terry tillman -- truist securities -- analyst
that's great to hear. and i guess, peter, just a follow-up question. any thoughts or anything you'd call out in terms of timing of cash payments between 2q and 4q? i'm just trying to think about free cash flow. i know that sometimes the dsps can have some volatility on -- and lumpiness around those cash payments, but just how we think about free cash flow either in 2q or the rest of the year? thank you.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yeah, thanks, terry. so in -- you know, obviously, we're not guiding to free cash flow. but what i can say is, you know, this past quarter, you saw a relatively tight coupling between non-gaap op income in free cash flow, and that is in part because of the cash conversion cycle associated with our dispatch platform, was tightly coupled to our ar collections, which is good to see. you know, as we mentioned before, there will be periods in which the timing in which we collect from our brands relative to when we pay our dsps can fluctuate quarter to quarter.
but typically, on a full-year basis, you'll see that the two numbers, non-gaap op income and free cash flow, are tend to be in line.
terry tillman -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks and congrats.

we have your next question from matt hedberg with rbc capital markets. your line is open.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions. noah, i had a question on international opportunities. i know -- you know, it seems like it's maybe a little ways out here, but you have a lot of big brands that have international locations.
now, i guess i'm sort of curious, you know, what might make you move faster to address and really help a lot of your, you know, your kind of your global brands really, you know, kind of embark on a global digital transformation? i guess what's the alternative if you're not helping them today?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
matt, thanks for the question. we believe that the domestic opportunity is just a massive opportunity. we've taken the baby step of expanding from the u.s. into canada, and you see an example this quarter of how that served us well, starting a relationship with a multinational brand in nando's in canada, and then helping them as well in the united states.
so we do think that what we're doing is setting the table for those larger international opportunities over time. but when we think about where our focus lies, it's really in serving the enterprise restaurants in the u.s. and canada markets because we think there's just a great opportunity for us there and it is the fastest path for us to become a billion dollar revenue company and the fastest and most efficient path for us to do so. so i believe that we're developing the relationship with those large multinational restaurant brands, most of which are domiciled here in the u.s.
and we're proving out how vital olo is to their success as a mission-critical platform so that when they're ready and we're ready to expand into international markets, we're the platform of choice for them to do so. i guess to answer your question directly, in order for us to kind of change our mind on this to say let's go chase international growth over expanding as we have been in the domestic opportunity, i mean, it would take something giving us the conviction that that was a better path for us to scale the business and serve our customers. we haven't seen that yet. we believe that the best area for us to remain focused is enterprise-grade restaurants or the enterprise segment of the industry in the u.s.
and canada and enriching the offerings for that cohort.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. yeah, i know that makes a lot of -- the success in canada is certainly notable and i think it's a great -- at least, you know, i think -- when we think about going beyond canada, i think there's certainly an opportunity there. and then i guess, secondarily, you know, when we talk to your customers, i think one of the things that you guys do best is just take pain points out of the whole digital experience. and i know you're handling a lot and you've got a lot of growth initiatives.
but one of the things that we kind of kept hearing was, you know, this whole loyalty system, right, which you integrate with well with a number of loyalty players. but i guess the question is how do you think about that as maybe a longer-term opportunity or just taking more of the friction out of the system that you're already helping to improve?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
yeah, i think that there are a lot of great capabilities that are beyond the scope of what we offer today but represented by a thriving partner ecosystem that we enjoy at olo. and we do, to your point, have a lot of great loyalty providers, crm providers who help restaurants to really understand for the first time using the data that's generated through olo and other technologies, who their customer is and how they can best develop a direct relationship with that consumer. it's not something that we offer directly. it is something that we're excited to have a thriving network of partners helping to do under the heading of how do you help restaurant brands really meet the needs of that on-demand consumer.
and i think about -- something that i remember from back in 2014 when danny meyer joined our board and became an investor, and he was talking and reflecting upon the open table platform and initial feelings about the open table platform and coming to understand that beyond just taking reservations, open table was really a crm platform that enabled greater levels of hospitality in the fine-dining segment. and he made a comment then that, you know, i view what olo is doing in the segment of the industry we were really exclusively playing in then in fast casual as enabling hospitality at fast food or fast casual speed and scale. and i think that's a great thing for our customers to do as they seek to build out their direct relationship with consumers and build out a thriving direct ordering channel. and we're thrilled to have a great partner ecosystem integrated tightly into olo to help them to do that.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks, noah. congrats again on the results and the success.

we have your next question from brent bracelin with piper sandler. your line is open.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi, guys, thank you. hey, noah, i was hoping you could address the customer engagement in light of several states reopening this year and broader vaccinations. how's the dialogue changing with prospects in restaurant brands, at least in april and may so far? are there different triggers why brand would engage with olo [technical difficulty].
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
let's see. brent, you broke up a little bit for me there but i think i got the gist of your question and i'd, of course, welcome you to ask a follow up if i missed the target here. but what we've seen is that there is strong interest in digital ordering and delivery capabilities that restaurant brands in every segment and every service model of the industry have come to see this as mission-critical for meeting the needs of the on-demand consumer. and as i mentioned in the prepared remarks, this was certainly pulled into the future through the year we've just lived through.
but it was also something that was growing and growing, the consumer need for that on-demand experience at restaurants long before covid. and we are thrilled about what our restaurants have been able to do in meeting the needs of the on-demand consumer before covid hit and throughout the covid period. so we think this is really something that has woken up a lot of the digital laggards that were out there in the industry and maybe the late-adopting segments of the qsr brands that are out there that have now realized the drive-thru, which used to be the fastest and most convenient way of serving the guests, is no longer the pinnacle of convenience. now, i must have the ability for on-demand ordering.
the food is ready when they arrive, or even, better delivered to them. but we think other restaurants have just come to experience the services that olo provides, an on-demand commerce, in general, as the mission-critical platform, the mission-critical system for their overall operation.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
helpful. then i guess, peter, just as you think about kind of the revenue guide here, it does imply a slight sequential decline. i assume most of that's transactional, but love to get any sort of color of what you're seeing on the transactional side volumes in april and may so far. and then is it right to assume the bulk cost of the client will be transactional or be any reason why subscription revenue [audio gap] sequentially? thanks.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yeah, thanks, brent. so a couple of things to keep in mind when thinking through the guidance. so you know, 1q, you know, came in well ahead of our expectations. i think specifically in terms of more active locations came on to the platform in q1 than expected, as well as higher upsell deployments than anticipated.
so that both benefits q1, but then leaves less incremental revenue coming online than originally expected to then offset any potential headwinds in near-term order volumes. we also benefited to some extent from the positive impact stimulus payments had on consumer spending. that's a dynamic that largely played out in q1 and not carrying over into q2. and we've always expected, again, some near-term impact on transaction volumes due to the reopening starting this quarter.
and although it is early, we have begun to see some signs of that. but i think it's important to note that, you know, again, that the underlying trends of the business in terms of sales and deployment pipeline continue to be strong, and i think that's evidenced by a 40% guide at the midpoint that we're really excited about.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you.

noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
hi, everyone. thank you for spending this time with us today. i'm noah glass, the founder and ceo of olo. i'm thrilled to be with you on this call and to share my thoughts on our company, our opportunity, and our q1 performance.
given that this is our first earnings call, i thought i'd take a moment to introduce you to olo and what we do. olo is a leading cloud-based on-demand commerce platform for multilocation restaurant brands, now serving over 400 restaurant brands and approximately 69,000 individual restaurant locations, and enabling them to let consumers order ahead, pay ahead, and get their food faster for takeout, delivery, and more. our mission is to help our restaurant customers thrive by best meeting the needs of the on-demand consumer. i founded olo over 15 years ago out of my desire to get a cup of coffee faster by ordering ahead and skipping the line, instead of waiting in line at a busy coffee shop.
since then, we've experienced an incredible journey, and i want to take a few moments to share some of the building blocks of the strategy that took us from an idea in june 2005 to a public company that is today the restaurant industry's mission-critical software platform and with a mission to touch, add value to, and derive revenue from every restaurant industry transaction. importantly, olo is a b2b software platform, not a b2c marketplace or aggregator. as a result, many of you have likely used olo without knowing it when you place orders at your favorite restaurant brands. olo is a platform, primarily enabling enterprise restaurant brands to create their direct-to-consumer applications to enable on-demand commerce.
olo is not a consumer brand. rather, our interests are aligned with our customers' interests to help them drive direct digital traffic first and foremost. that takes the form of enabling ordering ahead, whether that's counter pickup, curbside pickup, delivery, or these days, even tableside delivery. if you had to describe a restaurant, you'd likely describe the traditional table service model.
arriving at the restaurant and being seated, reviewing a menu, placing an order with a server after a brief conversation, and then sometime later having a meal delivered to your table, and eating the meal before paying and leaving. well, that kind of experience is simply no longer representative of the majority of transactions in the restaurant industry. and that fact has been true even before the covid-19 era. in fact, if you look at 2019 and you gauge the percentage of transactions represented by what the industry calls off-premise, that it is food consumed outside the four walls of the restaurant.
off-premise represented 63% of all restaurant industry transactions in the u.s. in that context, you can understand why it's so valuable for restaurants to enable a more efficient model for ordering and paying for a meal that will be consumed off-premise, both for the benefit of the consumer and for the operational efficiency of the restaurant. by enabling the consumer to order ahead, pay ahead, and get their food at the restaurant without having to wait for it, the restaurant can both enrich that consumer experience and improve their operational and financial performance at the same time. this is the core capability that olo enabled and is popularized in the restaurant industry over the past 15-plus years of our operating history.
the restaurant industry's shift to digital ordering has resulted in a steady and exponential growth curve of restaurant adoption of digital ordering capabilities and consumer adoption of choosing to order through digital ordering versus ordering in more traditional methods like in-person or calling over the phone. the covid-19 era pulled digital ordering adoption into the future as many restaurants had limited on-premise dining service. they have shifted their attention and consumers have shifted their use of restaurants to off-premise dining occasions. this shift and the broader interest in safety through contactless order collection has meant that digital ordering has become even more essential and has indeed become mission-critical to olo customers and the restaurant industry as a whole.
years ago, when i would speak to team olo about my long-term vision for our company, i would reference a milestone moment in which we achieved 51% of the sales of one of our customers. i said that moment would represent olo becoming the majority order channel for that customer and others would soon follow. the dawn of digital ordering primacy. we're now seeing olo restaurant customers who are processing 100% of their transaction volume through the olo platform.
this includes takeout orders, delivery orders, marketplace orders, and even tableside orders that are typically initiated when the guest sits at a table and scanned the unique qr code to identify the table where a server or runner can deliver the food. olo's ambition has now grown from digital primacy to digital entirety, from 51% digital to 100% digital. we believe that olo's destiny is to touch every transaction, add value to every transaction, and derive revenue from every transaction in the restaurant industry. olo's march ipo was the manifestation of our desire to make a strong statement to our stakeholders.
olo is and always will be an independent open software as a service, or saas, platform, providing a stable and extensible foundation for the restaurant industry and ecosystem to build upon for the long term. olo believes in a level playing field that promotes healthy competition, which is best for the restaurant industry. olo is committed to serving as a neutral and open platform for the long term. to that end, we're excited to reaffirm our partnerships with doordash and uber eats and celebrate over a dozen marketplace partners engaging with olo's exclusive restaurant network through olo rails, and a similar number of delivery service providers engaging through olo dispatch.
we continue to focus on scaling our open saas platform and bringing on the best partners to add to our rich partner ecosystem of over 100 technology partners, all for the benefit of our restaurant customers. it bears repeating that our transactional saas business model means that more transaction volume processed through olo leads to higher revenue for olo, similar to other consumption-based models in saas. in december 2020, we celebrated the milestone of achieving olo order number 1 billion on a cumulative basis since our founding in june 2005. it's worth noting that we process more than half of those total orders.
in other words, over 500 million orders in 2020 alone. while we believe that the impact of covid-19 has served as a tailwind for the 2020 transaction volume growth on the olo platform, remember that the larger digital transformation of the restaurant industry has been playing out atop the olo platform throughout our 15-plus year journey. more restaurants, more digital ordering capabilities, and more consumers adopting this new digital ordering behavior means higher transaction volume year over year and continued 120%-plus net revenue retention. in q1, we were proud to help bloomin' brands, parent to outback steakhouse and carrabba's italian grill, replatform from their long-standing homegrown digital ordering program to olo.
this is another anchor for our conviction that olo's enterprise-grade saas platform will be a compelling alternative to the capex and opex of building in-house. olo's enterprise-grade open saas platform offers lower upfront costs, faster time to market, lower ongoing costs of ownership, built-in best practices from a decade and a half of experience, ongoing innovation, a broader partner ecosystem, and benchmarking against 400-plus other customers. in short, saas wins over homegrown software. as we discussed at length in our s-1 and throughout our ipo roadshow, we're incredibly excited about the opportunity presented by the quick service restaurant, or qsr, drive-thru industry, engaging with on-demand commerce.
the qsr segment represents both the largest number of addressable restaurant locations and the largest number of transactions per location, and therefore, represents the largest pool of transactions in the restaurant industry, and an exciting segment for olo given our transactional saas business model. in general, qsr brands have grown over the years through franchising, leading to disparate technology systems across franchisee operator groups and manifesting in the kind of nonhomogeneous environments for which olo was purpose-built. we further penetrated the qsr drive-thru segment in q1 with new deployments at culver's and crystal, as these brands embraced on-demand commerce as a new way of providing the most convenient experiences for consumers. we celebrated other notable deployments with nando's u.s., growing our relationship with nando's that began in canada, and an expansion of our relationship with fine dining standard-bearer, union square hospitality group, whose ceo, danny meyer, is a member of our board of directors.
our expanded ushg relationship includes the deployment of its flagship, union square cafe, as well as gramercy tavern, blue smoke, and marta, further demonstrating that on-demand commerce can play an important role for every restaurant type, even fine dining, going forward. and we're also excited about the growth of virtual brands. brands that don't have their own physical locations and instead use host kitchens or ghost kitchens to produce their food for digital-only ordering and a delivery-only service model. these virtual brands demonstrate that olo's total addressable market is not bounded by the current number of restaurant locations.
rather, it is tied to total restaurant industry transactions. and this number is not fixed but expanding with population growth and greater consumer preference for prepared food, off-premise consumption, and digital ordering. this quarter, we launched two additional celebrity-powered virtual brands, including goop kitchen and guy fieri's flavortown kitchen. these digital-only, delivery-only virtual brands are inherently 100% digital, and therefore, speed olo's path to realize our now grander ambition to touch, add value to, and derive revenue from every restaurant industry transaction.
finally, i would be remiss if i did not mention team olo and our olo for good initiative. during q1, our team continued to work from home due to covid-19 restrictions. olo's workforce was built to support remote working well before covid-19. so this has been a relatively natural transition for our team.
although we look forward to being able to gather in person again in the near future, i'm proud that our team has managed to execute on behalf of olo and our restaurant customers from a fully remote environment. also during q1, we joined pledge 1% to donate 1% of our time, equity, and product, and launched olo for good. our olo for good efforts are focused on advancing racial, ethnic, and gender diversity, equity, and inclusion, providing relief and support for the restaurant industry and its frontline workers, and ending childhood hunger. improving our community and our world is in olo's dna.
we're excited to use our new status as a public company for doing even more good for our community and our industry. while we're incredibly proud to have processed over 500 million orders in 2020, we're reminded that the restaurant industry processes approximately 60 billion transactions each year. on our recent board call, one of olo's directors asked me what inning we were in for the olo journey? given that we're yet to achieve 1% of restaurant industry transactions, my response was we're just getting out of the dugout. as i constantly remind team olo, we have miles to go before we sleep.
we'll continue to invest in our team, our customers, our community, and our partners as we feel that this is in the best long-term interests of our shareowners and in line with the tenets of olo board member danny meyer's philosophy of enlightened hospitality. here at olo, we invest in solutions that both increase our opportunity to reach new restaurants with our on-demand commerce platform and help us to generate more value for those customers and more revenue from our platform in the form of additional average revenue per unit or arpu. we're thrilled to be a public company and one committed for the long term to the success of our customers and partners by adding value to their businesses, generating revenue for our business, and delivering returns for our shareowners. i've never felt more excited, more optimistic, or more purpose-driven than i do today.
and i'm excited for peter benevides, olo's cfo, to provide a quantitative reflection of the way i feel. peter, over to you.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
thanks, noah. today, i'll review our first-quarter fiscal 2021 results in detail and provide guidance for the second-quarter and full-year fiscal 2021. given this is our first earnings call, i'd like to start by briefly reviewing our financial model. we define our business model as a transactional saas model as it includes both subscription and transaction-based revenue streams that increase as transaction volumes grow.
our platform allows our restaurant customers the ability to provide great experiences to their consumers and increase revenue. as our restaurant brands increase revenue, our transactional saas model allows us to share in their success. the subscription element of our transactional saas model includes both a fixed fee component, as well as a usage-based component that increases as transaction volumes grow. we also charge per-transaction fees for certain ordering and delivery enablement products.
combined subscription and transaction fees charged on a per-location basis is defined as arpu or average revenue per unit. our ability to grow revenue is a function of adding more restaurant locations to the platform, as well as increasing the revenue we earn on a per-location basis or arpu. we believe our transactional saas model provides the best of both worlds, visibility and predictability aided by the subscription component and revenue upside due to transaction volume growth. with that background, let's take a closer look at our first-quarter results.
total revenue for the first quarter was $36.1 million, up 125% year over year. platform revenue in the first quarter was $34.9 million, up 136% year over year, primarily due to an increase in active locations coming onto the platform, as well as increased arpu, driven by higher transaction volume growth and continued multiproduct adoption. while we are proud of our q1 results which show the value that olo provides its restaurant customers, our first-quarter results benefited from covid-19 in two ways. first, continued strong order volume growth.
and second, a relatively easy compare since q1 2020 was the last quarter prior to the onset of covid-19. i will get into this a bit more in a few moments when i talked for our q2 and 2021 full-year guidance. in terms of key metrics, we saw continued positive performance for the first quarter across all three key metrics: active locations, arpu, and net revenue retention. let's spend a moment discussing each in a bit more detail.
an active location is defined as a unique restaurant location live on the platform with at least one product module. so for example, if an individual restaurant location subscribes to three modules such as ordering, dispatch, and rails, we would count that location once as a unique active location. that said, we ended the first quarter with approximately 69,000 active locations on the platform, a 42% increase year over year, and a 7% increase sequentially. this included some locations that we had originally expected to deploy in the second quarter which helped to increase platform revenue.
additionally, the average revenue per unit, or arpu, which represents the average quarterly platform revenue we earn on a per-location basis, continue to trend well. as a reminder, arpu takes into account all modules subscribed to by a unique location, as well as both subscription and transaction-based revenue stream. that said, for the first quarter, we generated an arpu of approximately $525, a 61% increase year over year, and an 11% increase sequentially. growth in arpu is the result of continued growth in multiproduct adoption, as well as increased transaction volumes which helped increase both subscription and transaction-based revenue stream.
lastly, net revenue retention, which measures the period-over-period change in total platform revenue for brands in the current quarter that had at least one live location in the same quarter a year prior, remains strong. for the first quarter, we continue to maintain net revenue retention in excess of 120%, a result of continuing to satisfy and retain our customers, increased multiproduct adoption, growth in transaction volumes, and further expansion of our partnership ecosystem. for the remainder of the financial metrics disclosed, unless otherwise noted, i will be referencing non-gaap financial measures. gross profit for the first quarter was $30 million, representing a gross margin of 83%.
this compares to a gross margin of 74% a year ago. year-over-year improvements in gross margin was largely a result of increased leverage in platform revenue streams where gross margin was 86%. this compares to a platform gross margin of 78% a year ago. sales and marketing expense for the first quarter was $3.4 million or 10% of revenue.
this compares to $2.2 million and 14% a year ago. on a dollar basis, increases in sales and marketing spend were driven by our proactive investment in customer acquisition and expanding our sales organization and brand marketing, partially offset by reduced spending on travel and trade conferences as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. while we have a highly efficient one-to-many sales model in which we sell at the enterprise restaurant brand level and secure all locations within that brand to long-term exclusive contracts, we anticipate investment in sales and marketing to increase on a dollar basis and as a percent of revenue in the short term as we continue to invest in our ability to sell new products and increase the visibility of our brand to new and existing customers. research and development expense for the first quarter was $11 million or 30% of total revenue.
this compares to $7 million and 43% a year ago. investing in our platform in developing new platform features and enhancements that will increase the value we can deliver to our customers is a primary strategic focus for olo. we have made incremental investments in recent quarters to maintain a strong platform performance and the uptime necessary to help our customers as they manage the sharp increase in their digital order volumes. we anticipate investments in this area to increase on a dollar basis and as a percent of revenue in the short term as we continue to invest in innovative solutions to support our customers' rapidly evolving needs.
general and administrative expense for the first quarter was $9.5 million or 26% of total revenue. this compares to $4.3 million and 27% a year ago. on a dollar basis, the increase was primarily tied to our efforts to support becoming and operating as a public company. we expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to grow on a dollar basis while decline as a percentage of revenue as we continue to scale our operations over time.
operating income for the first quarter was $6 million, compared to a loss of $1.6 million a year ago. we believe this improvement in profitability illustrates our ability to meet increased demand cost effectively, as well as the benefits associated with our high leverage success-based pricing model. as we continue to grow and scale the business, we believe we have a great opportunity to continue to invest in capturing more of our total addressable market while meeting the needs of our existing customer base. net income for the first quarter was $6 million, or $0.03 per share based on $185.5 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
turning our attention to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance was $586.6 million as of march 31, 2021. this reflects $485.5 million of net proceeds from our successful initial public offering in march. regarding cash flows, operating cash flow was $4.2 million, compared to $3.7 million a year ago.
free cash flow was $4 million, compared to $3.6 million a year ago. before i turn to guidance, i would like to spend a moment discussing the recently announced multiyear agreement with doordash. this new three-year agreement reinforces the long-term commercial partnership between olo and doordash and will enable us to continue to work together on products and features that will unlock value for both companies, as well as our shared customer base. from a financial perspective, this new agreement is in line with our expectations and we are really excited for the path ahead.
i'll wrap up by providing our guidance for the second-quarter and full-year 2021. for the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $33.9 million to $34.4 million and non-gaap operating income in the range of $2.3 million to $2.7 million. for the fiscal-year 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $140.4 million to $141.9 million and non-gaap operating income in the range of $13.3 million to $14.5 million. i would like to highlight a few things to keep in mind about our outlook.
we are incredibly excited by the underlying trends in our business and the market opportunity ahead of us. as noah mentioned, we are still in the very early stages of the shift to digital ordering and expect to continue to deliver strong revenue growth rates. at the same time, we expect the extraordinary growth in order volume that we experienced during covid-19 will begin to moderate to a more normalized level. while we expect good overall transaction volume growth in 2021 given the number of new locations that we expect to deploy on our platform, coupled with expected further increased penetration of dispatch and rails, and anticipated continued growth in our partnership ecosystem, there is also uncertainty in the near term pertaining to per location transaction volumes given some of the evolving dynamics at play.
specifically, as vaccination levels and in-person dining continue to increase, we anticipate digital order volumes in the second and third quarter to be impacted, and then normalized by the end of the year. additionally, this past quarter, the fiscal stimulus pertaining to the recently enacted american jobs act helped fuel transaction volume growth. with similar stimulus programs uncertain as we move forward, we remain thoughtful as to how we think about order volume growth. with that said, we will continue to take a prudent approach to forecasting given the uncertainty related to order volume trends due to the covid-19 pandemic.
to summarize, we delivered another exceptional quarter of operational and financial performance. we are delivering on our mission and believe olo's position at the center of the digital restaurant experience will continue to drive an attractive combination of strong revenue growth and profitability. i'd now like to turn it over to the operator to begin the q&a session. operator?

thank you. [operator instructions] we have your first question from chris merwin with goldman sachs. your line is open.
chris merwin -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey. thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great first quarter. you're out of the gate. i just wanted to ask with more restaurant reopenings with indoor dining and the like, can you talk a bit about what you're seeing with online gmv? and maybe as another way, what percentage of your restaurants are in categories with the high mix of in-person dining versus delivery and versus restaurants where 100% of their order volume could easily be online? i'm just trying to get a sense for what that restaurant mix looks like and generally what the trends you're seeing are as it relates to online ordering gmv.
thanks.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yeah. thank you, chris. peter here. so, look, from a trend perspective, what we've seen this past quarter has largely remained in line with what we've seen in recent quarters in terms of trends and transaction volumes.
we obviously started to comp a bit against the initial impact of covid at the end of the quarter. so our expectation has been that, you know, order volumes would start to see some near-term impact from increased vaccine -- vaccinations and pent-up demand for in-person dining, which, you know, from our perspective is likely to play out a bit more in q2 and q3. and while early, we have started to see some signs of that in april. again, in line with our expectations.
but i think from a high level, i think, you know, we're really excited about the underlying trends of the business. they continue to be strong i think as evidenced by our q1 performance, and as well as our guide for the next quarter with a 40% year-over-year target at the midpoint of the range. so really excited about the trends ahead.
chris merwin -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok, perfect. and maybe just one quick follow-up. i just wanted to ask about olo pay. anything you can share there about timing around, you know, when you might be targeting its general availability or any kind of initial -- i think it might be in beta, but any sort of customer feedback to date? thanks.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
hey, chris, noah here. so on olo pay, still very early. same as when we spoke about olo pay in analyst day and along the roadshow. we're continuing to work with a handful of brands that are in beta.
i think that's the appropriate way of thinking about '21. this is the time when we're going to learn. during 2022, we're going to work with some additional brands and really try to make sure that we get it right and have some great reference accounts there, with the expectation that in 2023, we'll be in a position to step on the gas from a go-to-market perspective. so i have hold two thoughts on that.
one, early in the process of deploying this, we're learning a lot. we're applying our growth mindset to it as we go about olo pay. but we think of this as a big opportunity and we want to make sure that we get it right.
chris merwin -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok, great. thank you.

we have your next question from sterling auty with j.p. morgan. your line is open.
sterling auty -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah, thanks. hi, guys. so wondering, in terms of the visibility on the number of locations that you roll out this year, how much control or how much of that is locked in? and what i'm wondering is this. in an individual franchise location, let's say we have a big rush to, you know, to in-store dining, can they turn around and say, hey, we were originally scheduled to go live on olo in the first week of september but we wanted to lay that to 2022?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes, sterling, so thank you for the question. peter here. so i guess let's just talk about q1 performance for a moment in terms of new location adds, and then i'll address the second part of your question on the in-person dining -- in-person dining dynamic and how that may impact deployments in the coming quarters. so, you know, in terms of this past quarter, obviously, deployments exceeded our expectations, which i think is in part what you're seeing play out in the revenue outperformance.
and this was in large part really a function of timing. so on a full-year tar -- our full-year target basis, it remains unchanged. we've been targeting the low double-digit tens of thousands of location adds in 2021 and we're tracking well to that level. so while we -- you know, we don't think what occurred in q1 is a normalized rate of growth going forward, we're really excited to see, you know, the momentum that we've built up in q1 as we enter into q2.
in terms of reopenings and the impact that could have on deployments, we're not seeing any indication of that at this time. we're seeing a lot of momentum in brands wanting to have their digital ordering, you know, their digital ordering systems up and running as really an opportunity to increase revenue and address consumer demand given that, you know, consumers have come to appreciate and enjoy the benefits associated with digital ordering. so at this point, we're not seeing brands having to make a binary decision between reopening and deploying digital ordering. we're seeing a lot of momentum on that front.
sterling auty -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
makes sense. thank you.
operator
we have your next question from brad reback with stifel. your line is open.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thanks very much. maybe if we can flip sterling's question a little bit and look at it from this perspective where restaurants are clearly having a hard time hiring enough people to meet demand. are you seeing organizations begin to use a little more aggressively in-store to help meet that shortfall? thanks a lot.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
brad, this is noah. thanks for the question. i think this is something that we've seen over our history is brand thinking about how they can best deploy labor to provide the greatest hospitality to their guests. and i think one of the things that's always been true about olo is there isn't a lot of hospitality in the experience of taking somebody's order and ringing them up for the transaction.
and those are the things that our platform has always automated. so what that means is that, historically, brands have been able to use their labor, use those resources to providing a more hospitable experience in actions like handing the order over to the consumer and having a conversation with them there. so we're really excited about that. and then we also are seeing, as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, the use of qr codes on the table for what we think of as table service 2.0 of the consumer scanning a qr code that then tags that order with the table number so that a server or a runner can run the order out to them.
and i think that these are things that are going to help brands do more with less from a labor standpoint and be efficient. we're not saying that brand should have less labor than they'd have traditionally had. we believe there's going to be a lot of in-person dining and sustained high levels of off-premise dining continuing to grow as we've seen. we think that digital and olo have a big role to play in both, have a big role to play in off-premise and a big role to play in on-premise, and that is why our new ambition is not just about the 63% of transactions in the industry that are off-premise, but all 100% of the transactions in the industry.
and we're excited about that new ambition.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great. thanks very much.
operator
we have your next question from bhavan suri with william blair. your line is open.
bhavan suri -- william blair -- analyst
hey, noah, peter, congrats. nice job there. i guess i want to touch on a couple of things. maybe i'll start off with arpu.
you have really nice uptick in arpu and i was just wondering, sort of could you give us an updated number of locations using all three modules? as you think about that arpu of growth, how should we think about going forward between module uptake versus, you know, in for a client transactional. i know you've dampened the in for client transactional and just to be conservative, but help us how we think about that through the year?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yeah. so just -- thank you for that question, bhavan. so in terms of multiproduct adoption, we made a lot of progress this past quarter in terms of deploying dispatch and rails. and that is, again, in part what's driving the outperformance in q1 and the increases in arpu that you've seen.
you know, looking forward, there are still brands in the deployment pipeline that will deploy in later quarters across dispatch and rails, and that is what is reflected in the numbers that we've shared. that said, we also continue to see growth in brands subscribing to one -- sorry, more than one olo module from the onset of the relationship which could have an impact on net revenue retention long term because we're starting at a higher base. but it's great to see arpu in that case starting at a higher point. in addition to dispatch and rails upsells that have been positive, today, we're also seeing a lot of momentum in olo network and virtual brands, which noah covered in his remarks.
both of those have been gaining more traction as growth vectors for the company, which is exciting to see. so, you know, in short, a lot of opportunity for growth ahead across a number of different modules and you'll start to see that play out in arpu over time.
bhavan suri -- william blair -- analyst
yeah. no, that's helpful. i guess i want to touch on exactly that the virtual brands, those kitchens, right, you highlighted goop kitchen and flavortown but not this year or next year when these are still kind of a novel concept. but you take the question that was previously asked about this labor issue, this idea that i'm going to have great hospitality, i don't need you to come and get it because i'm just going to have a kitchen and deliver what i do, which is make really good food as a chef.
what do you think that looks like from the actual ghost kitchen in the marketplace in say three to five years? and then, obviously, that plays into olo. and so what do you think that looks like as just part of your business in three to five years?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
thanks, bhavan. i'll take that. this is noah. look, we're really excited about the trend of these virtual brands.
we think that they're great opportunities both for existing restaurants that want to add on to what they're able to do out of their existing fleet of restaurant kitchens. we see restaurant brands launching additional virtual brand concepts, but cooking out of their existing fleet. and then for entrepreneurs, as you mentioned, we mentioned the two new celebrity-inspired virtual brands with goop kitchen and guy fieri's flavortown kitchen in the prepared remarks. we think there's going to be more of this going forward.
that this is really democratizing access to launching restaurants. and it's not just launching in a single geography. we have examples in mrbeast burger late in 2020 of a concept that was launched simultaneously in 200 kitchens across the country overnight, and that was something that used to take decades and decades for restaurant operators, restaurant entrepreneurs to achieve that kind of physical availability. so we're excited about that.
and of course, from the olo perspective, the fact that, as you mentioned, these are inherently 100% digital. and so it really speeds our path to getting to that ultimate destiny of touching every transaction, adding value to every transaction, and deriving revenue from every transaction. and i think that restaurants and restaurant operators are proving that they can manage these virtual brands in a way that is highly profitable and perhaps more profitable than the commission-heavy order volume that they're getting through marketplace channels. i think that'll be an interesting trend to see over time is our restaurants doing virtual brands more and accepting orders through restaurant delivery marketplaces less.
do both of those trends right at the same time. we're excited about all of that adding to the digital ordering market and olo's opportunity.
bhavan suri -- william blair -- analyst
super, super really helpful. thank you, guys. i appreciate you taking the time.

we have your next question from terry tillman with truist. your line is open.
terry tillman -- truist securities -- analyst
yeah, thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on this initial quarter as a public company. i guess maybe the first question is, you know, as we get through -- we got through '20. i assume some of these large qsr brands and just large brands, in general, across the food industry just got by with something they had in place. you mentioned bloomin' brands with something like a great replatforming.
what i'd i love to hear, noah, is kind of what you're seeing over the last quarter or two in terms of propensity to say, hey, we got through the pandemic, not in great shape, but now let's go do a real replatforming? so what is the pipeline like for these larger kind of replatforming opportunities?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
hi, terry, it's a great question and it's something that we're excited about. i mean, when we think about the different segments of the industry, it's not the same story in each segment. there are qsr opportunities that are largely greenfield opportunities. and then there are these other opportunities typically in casual dining or in fast-casual that are replatforming opportunities.
we have a great track record of taking brands that have built in-house, whether that's brinker with chili's and maggiano's or if we look at papa murphy's, both of which we talked about at length during our roadshow, or this new example of bloomin' brands with outback and carrabba's, and we think that long-term saas wins and that there's a great opportunity for brands that have built in-house to see, ok, there is some strong capital in the initial capex, but it's really the opex, that ongoing cost of doing this in-house, that i could save money on and have better innovation, better benchmarking against other brands, a broader partner ecosystem by moving to a mature enterprise-grade saas provider. and we believe that's the role that we're playing. and also that there are parts and pieces of what we do that can add value to a brand that maybe isn't ready to replatform their entire stack over to olo but might say, you know, i could use olo to add direct channel delivery with the dispatch platform or i could use olo to take orders from marketplaces through the rails platform. and we can begin to develop our relationship with those brands through components of our full product stack, and then ultimately prove ourselves and win the full stack over time.
so we're excited about the opportunity with those kind of replatforming kind of brands and we think that this is a moment where it's been proven that on-demand commerce is mission-critical. it's not ok just to have a program for on-demand commerce, you need the best program for on-demand commerce and we believe that's what we've set up olo to be.
terry tillman -- truist securities -- analyst
that's great to hear. and i guess, peter, just a follow-up question. any thoughts or anything you'd call out in terms of timing of cash payments between 2q and 4q? i'm just trying to think about free cash flow. i know that sometimes the dsps can have some volatility on -- and lumpiness around those cash payments, but just how we think about free cash flow either in 2q or the rest of the year? thank you.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yeah, thanks, terry. so in -- you know, obviously, we're not guiding to free cash flow. but what i can say is, you know, this past quarter, you saw a relatively tight coupling between non-gaap op income in free cash flow, and that is in part because of the cash conversion cycle associated with our dispatch platform, was tightly coupled to our ar collections, which is good to see. you know, as we mentioned before, there will be periods in which the timing in which we collect from our brands relative to when we pay our dsps can fluctuate quarter to quarter.
but typically, on a full-year basis, you'll see that the two numbers, non-gaap op income and free cash flow, are tend to be in line.
terry tillman -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks and congrats.

we have your next question from matt hedberg with rbc capital markets. your line is open.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions. noah, i had a question on international opportunities. i know -- you know, it seems like it's maybe a little ways out here, but you have a lot of big brands that have international locations.
now, i guess i'm sort of curious, you know, what might make you move faster to address and really help a lot of your, you know, your kind of your global brands really, you know, kind of embark on a global digital transformation? i guess what's the alternative if you're not helping them today?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
matt, thanks for the question. we believe that the domestic opportunity is just a massive opportunity. we've taken the baby step of expanding from the u.s. into canada, and you see an example this quarter of how that served us well, starting a relationship with a multinational brand in nando's in canada, and then helping them as well in the united states.
so we do think that what we're doing is setting the table for those larger international opportunities over time. but when we think about where our focus lies, it's really in serving the enterprise restaurants in the u.s. and canada markets because we think there's just a great opportunity for us there and it is the fastest path for us to become a billion dollar revenue company and the fastest and most efficient path for us to do so. so i believe that we're developing the relationship with those large multinational restaurant brands, most of which are domiciled here in the u.s.
and we're proving out how vital olo is to their success as a mission-critical platform so that when they're ready and we're ready to expand into international markets, we're the platform of choice for them to do so. i guess to answer your question directly, in order for us to kind of change our mind on this to say let's go chase international growth over expanding as we have been in the domestic opportunity, i mean, it would take something giving us the conviction that that was a better path for us to scale the business and serve our customers. we haven't seen that yet. we believe that the best area for us to remain focused is enterprise-grade restaurants or the enterprise segment of the industry in the u.s.
and canada and enriching the offerings for that cohort.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. yeah, i know that makes a lot of -- the success in canada is certainly notable and i think it's a great -- at least, you know, i think -- when we think about going beyond canada, i think there's certainly an opportunity there. and then i guess, secondarily, you know, when we talk to your customers, i think one of the things that you guys do best is just take pain points out of the whole digital experience. and i know you're handling a lot and you've got a lot of growth initiatives.
but one of the things that we kind of kept hearing was, you know, this whole loyalty system, right, which you integrate with well with a number of loyalty players. but i guess the question is how do you think about that as maybe a longer-term opportunity or just taking more of the friction out of the system that you're already helping to improve?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
yeah, i think that there are a lot of great capabilities that are beyond the scope of what we offer today but represented by a thriving partner ecosystem that we enjoy at olo. and we do, to your point, have a lot of great loyalty providers, crm providers who help restaurants to really understand for the first time using the data that's generated through olo and other technologies, who their customer is and how they can best develop a direct relationship with that consumer. it's not something that we offer directly. it is something that we're excited to have a thriving network of partners helping to do under the heading of how do you help restaurant brands really meet the needs of that on-demand consumer.
and i think about -- something that i remember from back in 2014 when danny meyer joined our board and became an investor, and he was talking and reflecting upon the open table platform and initial feelings about the open table platform and coming to understand that beyond just taking reservations, open table was really a crm platform that enabled greater levels of hospitality in the fine-dining segment. and he made a comment then that, you know, i view what olo is doing in the segment of the industry we were really exclusively playing in then in fast casual as enabling hospitality at fast food or fast casual speed and scale. and i think that's a great thing for our customers to do as they seek to build out their direct relationship with consumers and build out a thriving direct ordering channel. and we're thrilled to have a great partner ecosystem integrated tightly into olo to help them to do that.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks, noah. congrats again on the results and the success.

we have your next question from brent bracelin with piper sandler. your line is open.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi, guys, thank you. hey, noah, i was hoping you could address the customer engagement in light of several states reopening this year and broader vaccinations. how's the dialogue changing with prospects in restaurant brands, at least in april and may so far? are there different triggers why brand would engage with olo [technical difficulty].
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
let's see. brent, you broke up a little bit for me there but i think i got the gist of your question and i'd, of course, welcome you to ask a follow up if i missed the target here. but what we've seen is that there is strong interest in digital ordering and delivery capabilities that restaurant brands in every segment and every service model of the industry have come to see this as mission-critical for meeting the needs of the on-demand consumer. and as i mentioned in the prepared remarks, this was certainly pulled into the future through the year we've just lived through.
but it was also something that was growing and growing, the consumer need for that on-demand experience at restaurants long before covid. and we are thrilled about what our restaurants have been able to do in meeting the needs of the on-demand consumer before covid hit and throughout the covid period. so we think this is really something that has woken up a lot of the digital laggards that were out there in the industry and maybe the late-adopting segments of the qsr brands that are out there that have now realized the drive-thru, which used to be the fastest and most convenient way of serving the guests, is no longer the pinnacle of convenience. now, i must have the ability for on-demand ordering.
the food is ready when they arrive, or even, better delivered to them. but we think other restaurants have just come to experience the services that olo provides, an on-demand commerce, in general, as the mission-critical platform, the mission-critical system for their overall operation.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
helpful. then i guess, peter, just as you think about kind of the revenue guide here, it does imply a slight sequential decline. i assume most of that's transactional, but love to get any sort of color of what you're seeing on the transactional side volumes in april and may so far. and then is it right to assume the bulk cost of the client will be transactional or be any reason why subscription revenue [audio gap] sequentially? thanks.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yeah, thanks, brent. so a couple of things to keep in mind when thinking through the guidance. so you know, 1q, you know, came in well ahead of our expectations. i think specifically in terms of more active locations came on to the platform in q1 than expected, as well as higher upsell deployments than anticipated.
so that both benefits q1, but then leaves less incremental revenue coming online than originally expected to then offset any potential headwinds in near-term order volumes. we also benefited to some extent from the positive impact stimulus payments had on consumer spending. that's a dynamic that largely played out in q1 and not carrying over into q2. and we've always expected, again, some near-term impact on transaction volumes due to the reopening starting this quarter.
and although it is early, we have begun to see some signs of that. but i think it's important to note that, you know, again, that the underlying trends of the business in terms of sales and deployment pipeline continue to be strong, and i think that's evidenced by a 40% guide at the midpoint that we're really excited about.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you.

noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
thank you, stephanie, and officially and on the record, welcome to team olo. q2 was another strong quarter of profitable growth for olo, helping even more restaurant customers continue to drive digital sales while many restaurant dining rooms are reopened around the nation. on our last earnings call, i discussed olo's transactional saas business model, and our new ambition to reach digital entirety as the restaurant industry transforms to digital, touching, adding value to, and deriving revenue from every restaurant transaction. as the u.s.
economy and restaurant dining rooms began to reopen in q2, restaurant digital sales proved durable, demonstrating that the restaurant industry's digital transformation is not just about delivery, but all ordering modes and across all service models: delivery, drive-through, table service, and takeout. in fact, according to data from npd group, there are more nondelivery digital orders than delivery digital orders. olo's platform is enabling restaurant brands to digitize every transaction, not just delivery transactions. during q2, we celebrated more restaurant brands replatforming to olo, and we're proud to welcome potbelly sandwich works to the olo platform.
potbelly migrated from a legacy tech stack and like papa murphy's, chili's, maggiano's little italy, outback steakhouse, carrabba's italian grill, bonefish grill, and many others before it, potbelly replatforming to olo again demonstrated that leading restaurant brands can no longer simply check the box and have just any digital ordering solution. rather, they need to best meet the needs of the on-demand consumer by utilizing what we believe is the industry's most sophisticated on-demand commerce platform, benefiting from a broad and deep set of capabilities and an open partner ecosystem of over 100 best-of-breed restaurant technology partners. our launch with potbelly furthers olo's conviction that open saas wins over homegrown and closed proprietary software. we also deployed new virtual brands, including wingstop's launch of their virtual brand, thighstop, a creative and successful solution for the chicken wing shortage that led to price inflation.
the launch of thighstop demonstrates the flexibility that the olo platform provides to its customers, allowing restaurant brands to operate more nimbly. in this case, helping to solve business challenges and bringing wingstop closer to realizing its long-term strategy. another critical business challenge olo is helping to solve is the problem of driver availability for delivery service. driver shortages are widespread and have led to reduced driver availability and delivery delays for restaurants and consumers.
although dispatch, our delivery as a service solution provides a nationwide network of more than two dozen delivery service providers, or dsps, covering 97% of our customers' u.s. store locations. dispatch's ability to provide redundancy and increased driver availability is highly differentiated and create substantial value for our customers. a great example of customers realizing dispatch's value was the q2 launch of jack in the box as a dispatch-only deployment, which will enhance their existing digital ordering for takeout program.
this deployment with jack in the box further demonstrates olo's ability to land major enterprise brands with one product module to initiate the customer relationship. just as subway launched with olo rails, jack in the box is another major enterprise brand launching with olo dispatch and gaining familiarity with olo's broader capabilities and overall platform security, stability, and extensibility. jack in the box is also an exciting example of our success in the quick-service restaurant, or qsr, category. as the largest component of the restaurant industry by both locations and transactions, qsr brands represent the greenfield industry segment that we love for its high average location count, industry transaction share, and cornerstone commitments to convenience.
we've experienced early success in qsr with checkers and rallies, culver's, dairy queen, crystal, and now jack in the box, and this segment continues to represent a promising growth opportunity for olo. as i mentioned in our q1 earnings call, many qsr brands have grown through franchising, resulting in disparate technologies used throughout their fleet and the kind of heterogeneous environments that olo has made a specialty, integrating into multiple restaurant technologies to create a unified consumer experience. we remain committed to helping the qsr segment go digital to better meet the needs of the on-demand consumer. as we discussed at length in our q1 earnings call, the other side of olo's two-sided network is our partner ecosystem of over 100 restaurant technology partners.
this two-sided network creates a flywheel, in which adding a new customer to our restaurant network benefits all olo partners, and adding a new technology partner to our partner network benefits all olo customers. this quarter, we continue to expand our ecosystem and are proud to have added grubhub to our growing list of olo rails partners. olo rails enables restaurants to syndicate menu, prices, and content to digital ordering aggregators and allow such aggregators to send orders into the restaurant kitchen without requiring manual intervention of transposing an order from a tablet to a point-of-sale terminal. brands such as smoothie king have touted the benefits of the partnership in ensuring accurate menu information and reductions in order errors.
olo's deployments of the grubhub integration will continue in the coming quarters. this new partnership with grubhub means that although customers can now utilize olo rails to operationalize and manage all major national digital ordering aggregators, caviar, doordash, grubhub, postmates, seamless, and uber eats in addition to the regional and local aggregators that are meaningful to operators in specific geographies. olo is fulfilling its promise to serve as a common carrier, ensuring a level playing field for all aggregator partners. we believe that olo serving as a common carrier is in the best interest of our customers and the restaurant industry.
just as we continue to expand our network of olo rails partners, we're simultaneously investing in tools for restaurant operators to manage transactions across the growing number of integrated third-party channels. in q2, we deployed the olo rails performance tool to help restaurants better assess, track and analyze digital performance and revenue across channels, ultimately helping corporate teams and operators to maximize digital sales revenues. additionally, we completed development of the mobile app version of serve, our white label branded ordering experience. brands are now able to offer feature parity with the serve web experience, which has boosted conversion rates through an improved user experience and faster order completion by five seconds on average.
the new serve mobile app allows brands to offer an app version of their digital storefront without the need for large custom mobile app budgets. as i mentioned last quarter, team olo continued to work from home in q2 due to covid-19 restrictions. in the second quarter, we provided our employees the flexibility to continue working from home and reopened our new york city headquarters office on a voluntary basis. we are proud to have adopted an inclusive work policy that recognizes that our employees need and deserve flexibility.
additionally, as a continuation of our focus on esg, as well as diversity, equity, and inclusion, i'm also excited to share that we've published our diversity demographics on olo.com as well as our dei strategy and goals. olo is committed to building a diverse and inclusive culture that promotes growth and equity for underrepresented groups as reflected by our transparency and continued work on this front. i'm personally honored to be deeply involved in these efforts along with my executive team as dei is hugely important to our success as a company and as a pillar in the community. as the restaurant industry deals with record-setting consumer demand amid limited labor supply, olo is a force multiplier for restaurant operations, enabling restaurants to provide greater hospitality by automating low hospitality manual tasks by keying in orders, tendering payments, managing tablets, and correcting outdated menus.
and at the brand level, olo is also a force multiplier when it comes to restaurant brand digital transformation. as one executive of a major restaurant enterprise prospect recently articulated, our brand's digital ambitions are 10x our digital budget. if olo can help accelerate our digital efforts, we're all in. the restaurant industry is rebounding from a difficult year in 2020, and olo is eager to continue playing our part in helping olo customers not just survive but thrive as they disproportionately benefit from the restaurant industry's digital transformation.
and now i'd like to turn things over to peter benevides, olo's cfo, to share more details on olo's q2 performance. peter?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
thanks, noah. today, i'll review our second-quarter fiscal 2021 results in detail and provide guidance for the third quarter and full-year fiscal 2021. before i start, for those of you new to the call today, welcome, and please take a moment to review last quarter's earnings call while i briefly review our financial model. with that, let's take a look at our second-quarter results.
total revenue for the second quarter was 35.9 million, up 48% year over year. platform revenue in the second quarter was 34.5 million, up 53% year over year, primarily due to an increase in active locations coming on to the platform as well as increased transaction volumes helping drive growth in average revenue per unit or arpu. growth in active locations and transaction volumes reflect the continued digital transformation occurring within the restaurant industry. increases in multiproduct adoption and evolving use cases of the olo platform such as tableside ordering, virtual brands, and kiosks, further highlight olo's opportunity and ability to digitize all industry transactions.
that said, i would remind everyone that this time last year, many locations were emerging from temporary closures in march and began reopening in april as shelter-in-place restrictions ease. therefore, this quarter's performance slightly benefited from lower ordering activity in the earlier part of the second quarter of last year. in terms of key metrics, we ended the quarter with approximately 74,000 active locations on the platform, a 30% increase year over year and a 7% increase sequentially. as noah mentioned, this quarter's notable deployments included potbelly sandwich works and jack in the box.
average revenue per unit, or arpu, was approximately $486 for the second quarter. this reflects a 13% increase year over year and a 7% decline sequentially. fluctuations in arpu from quarter to quarter can be expected due to the number of modules a brand initially deploys with as well as changes in transaction volumes. for example, this quarter, we observed a greater number of single module deployments such as jack in the box utilizing our dispatch module, and a continuation of subway utilizing our rails module.
single module deployments inherently generate less arpu than multimodule deployments but present a great opportunity to land and expand within a customer with additional products and services, a historically successful go-to-market motion for olo. additionally, as anticipated, average orders per location per day as compared to the prior quarter decreased slightly due to seasonality, increased vaccinations in the return to in-person dining, and the absence of ongoing fiscal stimulus. that said, on a full-year basis, we anticipate continued momentum in arpu as seasonality is normalized and growth in multiproduct adoption and multi-partner usage continues. lastly, net revenue retention remained strong, in excess of 120% for the quarter, a result of continuing to satisfy and retain our customers, growth in transaction volumes, and continued expansion of our partnership ecosystem.
for the remainder of the financial metrics disclosed, unless otherwise noted, i will be referencing non-gaap financial measures. gross profit for the second quarter was 29.5 million, representing a gross margin of 82%, in line with gross margins a year ago. platform gross margin for the second quarter was 85%. this compares to platform gross margin of 87% a year ago.
the year-over-year decline in platform gross margin was driven by an increase in headcount and associated compensation cost to support the rapid growth in active locations added to the platform. sales and marketing expense for the second quarter was 3.2 million or 9% of total revenue. this compares to 1.7 million and 7% a year ago. on a dollar basis, increases in sales and marketing spend were driven by continued expansion of our sales organization, including compensation costs, and technology spend.
as stated on last quarter's call, while we have a highly efficient one-to-many sales model in which we sell at the enterprise restaurant brand level and secure all locations within that brand to long-term exclusive contracts, we anticipate investments in sales and marketing to increase on a dollar basis and as a percent of revenue in the short term as we continue to invest in our ability to sell new products and increase the visibility of our brand to new and existing customers. research and development expense for the second quarter was 11.4 million or 32% of total revenue. this compares to 7.3 million and 30% a year ago. we continue to invest in initiatives that align with the core tenets of enterprise customer needs: innovation, scalability, extensibility, and security.
this primary strategic focus for olo ensures we are providing our customers with a flexible and differentiated offering. we anticipate investments in this area to increase on a dollar basis and as a percent of revenue in the short term as we continue to invest in innovative solutions and platform capabilities that address the evolving needs of our customers and align with olo's open saas framework. general and administrative expense for the second quarter was 9.1 million or 25% of total revenue. this compares to 4.2 million and 17% a year ago.
on a dollar basis, the increase was the result of additional headcount and costs associated with operating as a public company. we expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to grow on a dollar basis, while decline as a percentage of revenue as we continue to scale our operations over time. operating income for the second quarter was 5.9 million, compared to 7 million a year ago. we believe our continued ability to deliver strong profitability reflects the power associated with our high leverage success-based pricing model.
that said, we remain committed to investing in growth to address the massive market opportunity ahead of us. and while we anticipate remaining profitable as we grow, we do expect some near-term decreases in profitability as we scale to further address our market opportunity. net income for the second quarter was 5.8 million or $0.03 per share based on approximately 183.6 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. turning our attention to the balance sheet and cash flow statement.
our cash and cash equivalents balance was 575.2 million as of june 30th, 2021. regarding cash flows, operating cash flow for the second quarter was 11.3 million, compared to negative 4.4 million a year ago. free cash flow was 10.8 million, compared to negative 4.7 million a year ago. i'll wrap up by providing our guidance for the third quarter and full-year 2021.
for the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of 36 million to 36.5 million and non-gaap operating income in the range of 3.4 million to 3.8 million. for the fiscal-year 2021, we expect revenue in the range of 144.7 million to 145.7 million and non-gaap operating income in the range of 18.8 million to 19.6 million. i would highlight a few things to keep in mind about our outlook. we remain incredibly excited about the continued momentum and underlying trends of our business.
we believe that olo is very well-positioned to execute on our vision to touch, add value to, and derive revenue from every restaurant transaction. and we're encouraged by the innovative ways customers are utilizing our platform and how that aligns with this vision. at the same time, we're continuing to remain prudent in our approach to forecasting given the environment in which we're in, whereby uncertainty exists with respect to the covid-19 pandemic and the impact that may have on digital ordering. to summarize, we are extremely proud of our financial performance this quarter, which we believe reflects our continued ability to execute on our vision and the opportunity ahead.
with that, i'll turn things back over to the operator to begin q&a.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of sterling auty from j.p. morgan. your line is open.
sterling auty -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah, thanks. hi, guys. so i wanted to start with the question around the deal with grub. i know you don't want to usually talk about specific customers, but is there any way for investors to kind of think about the opportunity there vis-a-vis the relationship that you have with dash?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
sterling, this is noah. i'll take that one. so i think, historically, what we've seen as we've had restaurant brands that are using one aggregator partner and then add a second and a third is that it drives incremental traffic to those restaurant locations. and so we're excited for the restaurant brands that we're working with through olo rails to now see grubhub as an additional aggregator partner.
and to the extent that they're interested in engaging with grubhub to initiate and manage that relationship through the olo rails platform. and we think that there's an opportunity for restaurants to drive more transactions through grubhub in addition to what they're already doing through direct channels and through indirect channels. and this relationship really came together because of our restaurant customers, our common restaurant customers saying to both grubhub and olo, we're excited about working with both companies in an integrated fashion. and that's what we've brought to market with this announcement today.
we already have a customer in smoothie king that has been in the pilot test of the engagement between grubhub and olo through olo rails. and they're noting, as you heard in the prepared remarks, both have a reduction in errors in orders flowing into the restaurants and an ease of use in syndicating their menu content and pricing content out to grubhub as they do with other aggregator partners already utilizing olo rails.
sterling auty -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
that makes sense. and then one follow-up would be, during the ipo roadshow, there's plenty of investor questions around your eventual ambitions to move downmarket in addition to what you do with the enterprise brands already. does this signify the first move in that strategy? and if so, what would be the next major step?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
i wouldn't necessarily read this as a signal of our intent to change our strategy. there are plenty of restaurant brands that are in our defined universe of what we currently think of as our addressable market. enterprise restaurant brands and what we define as emerging enterprise restaurant brands that also want to engage with grubhub. so again, as a reminder, emerging enterprise brands, we think of as the restaurant brands that are between five and 100 restaurant locations, many of them, the great enterprise brands of tomorrow.
those are the kinds of restaurant brands that we want to start working with early in their life cycle. those are the brands that have the ambition of scale, and they're looking to put olo in place early in their life cycle as a way of preparing for that growth. we don't, as you know, sterling, focus on the true mom-and-pop independent restaurants that are out there. that is not our sweet spot.
we do want to find those restaurant brands that have an ambition of scale. and i think there are plenty of those and plenty of enterprise that work with both olo and have a desire to, if they don't already work with, grubhub.
sterling auty -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
make sense. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of brent bracelin from piper sandler. your line is open.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you and good afternoon. noah, i was -- [technical difficulty]
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
operator, i'm sorry. i think that we've lost brent or at least i have.
operator
your next question comes from the line of matt hedberg from rbc capital markets. your line is open.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hey, guys. good afternoon from me as well and congrats on the results. noah, i wanted to start with you. the number of locations you've had now through the first half of the year was effectively what we thought you'd have for the full year, effectively kind of 10,000 or low double digits in terms of 10,000s.
i guess a couple of point question. one, i know in q1, you talked about some early go-lives. was there any early go-lives for q2? and second, how should we think about active location growth? i know you don't guide to it, but is there a way that we should sort of think through what seems like an accelerated trend here of location adds?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
hey, matt. you have peter here. i can take that one. so a couple of dynamics to point out through our first half of the year performance with respect to active locations.
so on a full-year basis, as we enter the year, our internal plans were to target the mid-teen thousands in terms of net new additions to the platform. we've obviously paced ahead of that and now have our sights set on the mid-teen thousands for net additions on the year. and what has happened is the deployments that we had originally planned for the second half of the year, some of those have now accelerated into the first half of the year. and strength in bookings is now replacing those units in the back half of the year.
the other interesting dynamic, and we called this out in our prepared remarks, is the trend in single module deployments. and we called out jack in the box as the example there. i think what's exciting is we view that as an opportunity or a way in which we can service the qsr segment, which is a great growth opportunity for olo. but also what that presents is an opportunity for additional upsells.
and as history has shown, we've done a great job of landing a brand with an initial product and then expanding that relationship over time through additional product modules and use cases. so we're really excited about the trend that's developing.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
that's really good to hear. i guess, a second question. obviously, this was really the first post-covid comp. but now with the rise of the delta variant, and obviously, new york has had -- has been in the news on that.
you see a lot of real-time data. are you seeing anything now that would suggest that that might be better for, say, your delivery or pickups than it would have otherwise been? just sort of curious on kind of how data seems real-time from that perspective.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes. so i can take that one, matt. this is peter again. yes, i mean what we're learning, and we mentioned this earlier, is that digital ordering has proved durable, and you saw that play out in our outperformance on the quarter.
that said, we're seeing information in real-time here. there continues to be a meaningful level of uncertainty given the varying levels of vaccination rates around the country and the impact of existing and potential variants. so it's something that we continued to monitor. it's something that we take into consideration when thinking about our forecast and setting guidance.
but again, this is something that's happening in real-time that we're keeping an eye on.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks a lot, guys.
operator
the next question comes from the line of brent bracelin from piper sandler. your line is open.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you and good afternoon. can you hear me this time?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
loud and clear, brent. thank you.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
yeah. great. hey, listen thanks for this. just a couple of questions from me, noah.
relative to just broader restaurant digitization trends, i started to encounter myself online ordering inside of the restaurant, not just online ordering remotely. do you see an opportunity for olo to extend its digital reach inside of the restaurant? does the serve app address external and internal needs? love to just hear your kind of industry thoughts on online ordering inside the restaurant and how that opportunity could play out for olo as well.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
thanks, brent. so when we look at the industry data and the data source that we look at most is npd and their results for q2, we're fascinated by the trends that we see across different service models. and i think one of the things that the media likes to talk about is delivery and the scale of delivery and how delivery is growing. and delivery is growing quickly.
but delivery is just 8% of the overall transactions in the industry or was at least in q2, meaning that 92% is nondelivery. and when we look at digital, what you see is that of the total, digital delivery is just 6%, whereas digital overall is 17%. so the other 11% is coming from non-delivery digital. and the breakdown of that is 10% of total is takeout.
and now, for the first time, we're seeing 1% on-premise. and that's a big move in an industry that does 60 billion transactions in a typical year to see 1% moving to digital on-premise. we've seen that within olo in kiosk ordering, that's something that we've seen for a number of years of a consumer ordering from a kiosk or running on top of the olo platform inside the four walls of the restaurant. and then as i mentioned on the q1 call, qr code ordering at brands like bluestone lane cafe, where a consumer can scan a qr code on the table, utilize the same front-end experience of the web app or mobile app to place the order tagged to the table where they're sitting and having a runner or a server run the order out to them.
this all factors into what we have described as our new ambition of getting to digital entirety where olo has the ability to touch every transaction, add value to every transaction, and derive revenue from every transaction. and we're seeing those behaviors by consumers and also, of course, by operators offering those new modes of ordering coming out of 2020, but remaining offerings that are made available in 2021. and that's part of what gives us the conviction that digital is durable across industry segments.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
super you're able to frame there. i guess my last question here for peter. it looks like ending locations had a nice help in increase here sequentially, but platform revenue was still down. was that, well, entirely tied to just lower volumes on the ordering side? or are there other factors, i.e., pricing that also contributed to a sequential decline there in the platform revenue this quarter? did you get that question? [technical difficulty] did you get that question?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
brent, i think we may have lost peter. sorry, peter is dialing back in. maybe, operator, if you wouldn't mind if we can move on and come back to that question, that would be great.
operator
ok, sir. your next question comes from the line of brad reback from stifel. your line is open. you may ask your question.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. noah, in the last couple of quarters, you've obviously talked more about replatforming. has it gotten easier in the sales cycle since the ipo?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
well, i think that our ambition of the ipo was really to make a statement to our customers and to the industry that olo is going to be around for the long term as an open platform for on-demand commerce. and i think seeing olo make that statement and then have a successful event in the ipo and come out on the other side with more resources has certainly given restaurant brands conviction that they don't have to worry in the way that they do about companies that are private and venture-backed that may get acquired, that might run out of funding, but they know that olo is going to be around for the long term. and certainly, that has helped us in engaging with our customers and talking about long-term road maps and it's helped us with prospects. and i think it's given some prospects and some restaurant brands that have built in-house, but are constantly evaluating, does it make sense to continue to operate their on-demand commerce in-house.
additional confidence that they can move over to the olo platform, they can replatform to olo, receive all of the benefits of working with a scaled enterprise-grade saas platform and do so at a lower cost of ownership overall. so i think on the sales cycle side, it's certainly been something that has been noted by the industry, and it's enabled us to have conversations with major restaurant enterprises, groups like jack in the box that we mentioned, having confidence that olo is going to be a great platform and a service that they can then offer up to their end consumers knowing that we'll be around for the long term.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great. thanks very much.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of terry tillman from truist. your line is open.
terry tillman -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you. congratulations from me as well. i don't know if we have peter back, i was going to hit him with a financial question, but i can abstain and ask you one, noah, first, depending on if peter's back. maybe, noah, what i'll ask is on the go-to-market side, you are talking about increasing investments.
what i'm curious about is where are some of those incremental investments? i mean, you probably already have a good enterprise sales team, they know where to hunt. but is it more in that area? is it adjacent markets that kind of have a feel like restaurants? or maybe anything on the partnership side? just would love to know a little bit about where you're going to put some of these incremental go-to-market investments. and then i did have a follow-up.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
sure. terry, i can start out there, unless -- peter, is that you back on? ok. terry, i'll start out. so i think one big area of investment for us is in r&d.
and so we focus on some of the new product capabilities that we've talked about being early, things like our olo pay platform, that's an area of investment for the company as we go through beta and piloting with a handful of brands this year. and then other additional product capabilities like catering is something that we are excited about for future quarters and something that we're investing in to bring to life additional catering capabilities. prepandemic, this is something that our customers were very excited about. and they remain very excited about it as they think about reopening.
this represented 8 to 10% of industry sales quarter to quarter. and so that's an area that we are interested in and developing capabilities in. we've also invested in our sales force on the emerging enterprise component of the market to sell more into those enterprises, as i define them that have five to 100 locations and represent the great enterprises of tomorrow. and we're excited about multiproduct adoption in that segment, and high utilization by consumers of those restaurants, leading to a greater arpu opportunity for us in that segment.
and so we're investing behind that.
terry tillman -- truist securities -- analyst
that's great to hear on olo pay as well as catering, particularly catering as we have more reopenings post this now new variant. but maybe the follow-up then, i'll just focus on you, noah, is it's good to see the -- just kind of iterating existing technology. so i guess, the new mobile serve technology. what i'm curious about is because there is a lot of technical debt, a lot of investments these big brands have made in their mobile app ordering.
is this potentially a way you can get in the door initially as a wedge to just start with rebuilding their app as opposed to just their website? just anything more you can help us on kind of the implications of this -- the new innovation on the mobile side. thank you.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
i think really the idea for the serve app is to bring future parity into the mobile app, the white-label mobile app experience that we have through mobile web and that we have through web. i wouldn't characterize it as a wedge where we would only do a brand's mobile app and not the web. but the idea is to make onboarding even easier for brands to kind of build once on top of the olo platform and then have it across all these different ordering modes, mobile app, mobile web, and web. and of course, as we add, as we typically do, incremental features and capabilities, having that feature parity across ordering modes through a brand's direct ordering channel.
so this, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, is an experience already on the mobile web, we've seen reduce the transaction time by five seconds. and we count seconds, we count clicks at olo. if we can improve the ordering experience for the end user, that results in better basket conversion, more transactions. that benefits the consumer, obviously.
it benefits the operator, but it also benefits olo with our transactional saas model.
terry tillman -- truist securities -- analyst
that's great. thank you for taking my question.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
sorry, i believe that we have peter back on now as well, terry. so if you do have a question for him. and if we can return back to brent's question, i think peter is back.
terry tillman -- truist securities -- analyst
well. thank you. that's a bonus. i feel bad.
i guess i'm getting three and hopefully bringing it back in. but yeah, yes. i was just going to ask peter and then an answer to another question. did i hear it right that mid-teens thousands would be the potential new incremental active sites in the back half of the year? thank you.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes. not incremental. that is the full-year target. so again, roughly 9,000 to date through the first half of the year and now targeting the mid-teen thousands on a full-year basis.

got it. thanks.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
and brent, can we invite you to reask the question that you asked before?
operator
sorry, sir, but i can see the line of mr. brent got disconnected.
stephanie daukus -- vice president, investor relations
hi. it's stephanie daukus with olo investor relations. so just to recap brent's question. he was asking about how ending locations showed a healthy increase, but revenue remained pretty steady quarter over quarter.
so, peter, if you could just talk to that dynamic and explain if that was related to multi-location ads or a possible change in rates or anything like that? thank you.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes, absolutely. so the platform revenue decline quarter over quarter was in line with our expectations. and really, it was the combination of a few factors, the net impact of reopening. so increased vaccination rates and the impact that had on in-person dining as well as the wind down of stimulus benefits that occurred in the first quarter of the year weren't a dynamic.
that was a factor in the second quarter. and then some seasonality impacts, which we typically experience in the second and third quarters of the year. and as i mentioned earlier, the deployments that had come on this quarter, half of those deployments were single module deployments where arpu and the revenue impact from those deployments are inherently lower than multi-module deployments but present a great opportunity for future upsell and monetization. and of the remaining deployments that did come on in the quarter, half of those were deployments that occurred in the back half of the quarter.
so we didn't realize the full benefit of revenue from those deployments in the second quarter, but we'll do so in the coming quarters.
operator
[operator instructions] our last question comes from the line of stephen sheldon from william blair. your line is open.
stephen sheldon -- william blair & company -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my question. wanted to follow up on the mobile app rollout and wanted to ask how this will drive incremental monetization opportunities for olo. will that help mainly from the perspective of driving more transaction volumes? or is there also a separate add-on subscription beyond the core ordering module? i would appreciate just any detail there on monetization.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
hey, stephen. this is noah. so no, there's no additional charge specifically for the mobile app work. this is an additional front end that is part of the olo platform.
although there may be a savings to the brand versus what they would pay to build a mobile app on top of the olo api if they were to do that in-house or they do that through a third-party mobile app developer. where we see it as an opportunity for olo and incremental revenue is in improving the consumer experience of placing the order, cutting down on the time to place the order, such that basket rate conversion increases, the transaction volume increases. and as i mentioned earlier, that's good for the consumer, good for the brand, but also good for olo with our transactional saas model in the form of additional transactions and transactional revenue.
stephen sheldon -- william blair & company -- analyst
got it. makes sense. and then it sounds like you're seeing a lot more traction with concepts and it sounds like specifically qsrs that are signing up for a single module like jack in the box. i think, peter, you might have hit on it a little bit.
just how much opportunity do you see to upsell qsr customers like this to all of your modules down the road, even if they signed up just for the immediate benefit of a specific module? do you have many qsr customers that are using all three modules? any detail there?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes. so in terms of specific qsr customers that are using multiple modules, i think we mentioned on the last call, bloomin' brands that have cut over from a legacy platform or replatformed onto the olo platform. and they've actually subscribed to more than one module as part of that program. i guess, from a high level, we absolutely think that over time, we can sell through additional product modules to single module brands.
and as history has shown, we've done that very successfully, selling both dispatch and rails to customers that we had initially had our initial entry being ordering and then shortly following up with dispatch and rails. so we certainly see that as an opportunity ahead. and it's great to plant that initial flag with whether it's dispatch-only or rails or ordering, and then use that as an opportunity to build that relationship and ultimately sell through additional products.
stephen sheldon -- william blair & company -- analyst
great. thank you. congrats on the results.

noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
thank you, stephanie. hi, everyone. thank you for spending time with us today. 2021 was a great year for olo.
we grew annual revenues by more than 50%, expanded arpu by 16% to more than $2,000 per year, surpassed more than $20 billion in gross merchandise value for the year, successfully completed our ipo, and closed our first strategic acquisition. we ended the year with our platform connecting approximately 79,000 active restaurant locations and more than 500 restaurant brands to more than 200 technology partners and more than 85 million consumers, who have ordered over the platform this past year. last year, our flexible open saas platform helped restaurants manage through the uncertainties of the lasting covid-19 pandemic, including location closings and reopenings, staffing shortages, and the transition to increased reliance on digital transactions by enabling digital ordering, delivery, contactless handoff, qr codes, and virtual brands. in short, our technology-enabled restaurants to adapt to do more with less.
in the fourth quarter, lyft joined olo's dispatch network as a local white label delivery partner. olo dispatch is a national fulfillment network enabling restaurants to offer, manage and expand direct delivery through olo's network of multiple delivery providers while optimizing price, timing, and service quality. the addition of drivers from the lyft network to olo's dispatch network not only expands delivery coverage for our restaurant brands but also drives competitive pricing for the benefit of consumers and brands alike. this, along with expanding our relationships with uber eats and waitr, adding grubhub, and reaffirming our relationship with doordash in 2021, further bolstered the olo dispatch and rails offerings, benefiting restaurant brands by broadening channel management and increasing driver supply, leading to increased operational efficiency for brands and a better consumer experience.
the unique capabilities of our two-sided networks and olo's comprehensive relationships with marketplaces and delivery service providers helped drive module expansion and expanded platform usage within our customer base. one example of our ability to expand relationships within brands is papa murphy's. papa murphy's is the largest take-and-big pizza company began their relationship with olo through the olo ordering module. this quarter, the brand expanded their relationship to include the olo dispatch module, enabling pizza delivery via their own website and app.
papa murphy's take-and-bake pizzas are made at the store and baked at home, and traditionally have required an individual to go to the store to pick up their pizza. enabling delivery via dispatch allows papa murphy's to increase digital sales and compete directly with traditional pizza delivery companies. in the fourth quarter, restaurant brands also adopted our virtual brand module as virtual brands continued to flourish. examples include applebee's cosmic wings and virtual dining concepts adding mario's tortas and pauly d's italian subs, allowing restaurants to reach new customers and maximize their revenue per square foot.
additionally, in the fourth quarter, several brands added the olo network module to their technology stack. notable brands included bj's, fuzzy's taco shop, hacienda colorado, jack stack barbecue, miller's ale house, tijuana flats, and uncle julio's. olo network provides brands the ability to grow their direct digital business through affiliate partners, such as google food ordering, while owning and maintaining direct consumer relationships. restaurant brands recognize the importance of owning commission-free direct ordering channels, and the consumer relationship is imperative to avoid being disintermediated.
our acquisition of wisely provides brands the tools to improve their digital engagement with consumers which will enable them to measure and grow customer lifetime value or clv and drive more orders onto the olo platform. in the few months since acquiring wisely, we successfully integrated on a go-to-market basis their suite of solutions, including the host module, which streamlines reservations and table management, as well as the marketing, sentiment, and customer data platform or cdp modules, which strengthens consumer engagement. digital-first engagement is increasingly critical for restaurant brands as the industry continues to shift toward digital. in 2021, almost 9 billion restaurant orders, or 15.1% of total industry orders took place digitally according to the npd group.
the olo platform is at the center of this digital transformation, processing more than $20 billion in total gross merchandise value, or gmv, representing an increase in digital orders completed on the olo platform of more than 35% year over year. throughout 2021, it became clear to us that a restaurant business should not be bifurcated between digital or nondigital or on-premise versus off-premise. it's one business and it should operate with one thing in mind, the consumer. every order, every transaction, and every interaction should be customer-centric.
our emboldened ambition is to help restaurant brands more effectively satisfy the consumer by connecting the consumers' on and off-premise transactions through digital orders and data in order to empower a known consumer experience. we seek to touch, add value to and drive revenue from every order, striving to move from 15% of the industry's orders being digital to 100% of the industry's 55 billion orders being digital, a concept i call digital entirety. this will empower restaurant brands to best meet the needs of the on-demand consumer. as we enter 2022, we've never been more confident in our position and more excited about our opportunity ahead.
we believe that we have a 100 times growth opportunity in u.s. enterprise restaurants, representing a tam of more than $15 billion within the u.s. enterprise segment. currently, the olo platform offers brands the following differentiated and mission-critical solutions: ordering, network, switchboard, kiosk, and virtual brand modules, which provide on-demand digital commerce and channel optimization solutions; dispatch and rails modules, which provide delivery enablement; optimized front-of-house operations needs through our host module, which streamlines reservations and table management; and customer engagement through our marketing automation, sentiment and customer data platform or cdp modules.
and today, we announced general availability of olo pay, which will create uniform brand experiences, improving the restaurant operator and consumer experience. just as restaurants have fragmented point-of-sale systems, they also have fragmented payment processors. and these payment processors are horizontal solutions that are not purpose-built for restaurants nor built for digital transactions. historically, olo has served as the gateway into existing payment processors.
and these processors have led to suboptimal experiences for the consumer, manifesting in an elevated level of fraud, chargebacks, and a lack of tools for brands to fight those chargebacks. olo pay's fully integrated vertical payment solution goes beyond core credit card processing functionality and will benefit both the operator and the consumer by offering advance fraud prevention that results in improved authorization rates for valid transactions by supporting and allowing credit cards on file to be used at any of the brands' participating locations for the consumer, enabling apple pay and google pay, and through simplifying the ordering interface for a faster checkout. all of these features will grow and protect restaurant brands' digital business through increased basket conversion. our vision for olo pay extends beyond the existing capabilities.
our ambition is to bring a much better user experience and optimized basket conversion of a seamless payment solution to the restaurant industry through our olo pay solution in borderless form which we plan to make available later this year. one example of this experience is shop pay, which is an accelerated checkout that lets customers save their payments and delivery information. this can save customers time when they check out, especially if they've already opted into shop pay elsewhere, providing security for all merchants offering shop pay and enabling them to offer improved user experience, manifested in a dramatically higher basket conversion rate of 1.72 times according to shopify studies. we believe that removing the friction typically associated with online ordering account creation, login and checkout is beneficial for users and for restaurants, leading to higher basket conversion and more orders.
with a network of 79,000 restaurants and 85 million consumers, olo has achieved the critical mass to unlock shop pay-like capabilities in the form of our borderless olo pay offering. we have conviction that this two-sided payment network is a win for consumers, a win for restaurants, and a win for olo. our historical success in bringing to market platform-level innovations like dispatch and rails by creating two-sided networks gives us both the experience and the confidence that we can do the same with the launch of borderless olo pay. restaurant brands are telling us they want to operate as one digital business.
they are pulling us into payments and on-premise opportunities. and in order to accelerate the restaurant's ability to operate as one business, we must unlock on-premise solutions. that is why i'm excited to announce that olo has signed a definitive agreement to acquire omnivore. omnivore powers restaurants to connect to apps and technologies that streamline operations, improve efficiency, enhance consumer experiences and increase profitability by allowing restaurant technology partners to inject and extract data from multiple point of sales through one integration, unlocking the potential of restaurants' point-of-sale systems through these technologies.
omnivore enables restaurant technology partners to focus on their core products rather than pos integrations. olo plus omnivore will allow our restaurant brands to: one, insert and extract back-of-house data through faster, easier two-way connections with technology partners via their developer-friendly pos api, further unifying disparate data and simplifying data review; two, increase data extraction from the pos, enabling new and enhanced olo capabilities such as increased visibility into on-premise orders and improved olo powered capacity and throttling management; three, access to features and capabilities to increase monetization of on-premise digital orders and on-premise digital card-present transactions; and four, access to enhanced developer tools and increased access to key partners not already part of olo's robust ecosystem. ultimately, olo plus omnivore will allow our restaurant brands to immediately gain access to new on-premise capabilities, as well as an expanded technology partner network outside of core ordering, broadening olo's platform capabilities. in addition, olo's existing pos integrations will be updated with expanded functionality and be backed by a large, combined team of top specialists in the industry.
omnivore is expected to increase our technology partnerships more than 50% to more than 300 partners, increasing our ability to unify and enhance the utility of disparate technologies across the restaurant industry and reaffirming our commitment to an open ecosystem of partners. i believe olo to be the platform that restaurants will need in the future. our all-encompassing platform will enable leading brands to better understand and serve every customer that transacts with them, leveraging the new currency for 2022, customer intelligence-enhanced, digital-first interactions. i'm extremely proud of our work in 2021, and i'm excited about the significant opportunity that lies ahead for olo as our leading open saas platform supports restaurants and empowers the restaurant industry's digital transformation.
our emboldened ambition seeks to increase olo's opportunity by 100 times through the following three growth opportunities. first, through focusing on the enterprise restaurant segment, we have a 4x opportunity to capture all 300,000 enterprise restaurant locations. second, by striving to move from 15% of orders being digital to 100% of restaurant orders being digital, we have an opportunity to capture and process 6.25x more orders on our platform as our technology will simplify restaurant capture of orders into one common digital channel, allowing brands to better understand and engage their consumers, increasing customer lifetime value. third, the launch of olo pay enables olo to generate 4x more revenue per order than we capture today by acting as a payment processor for our restaurants.
through higher conversion rates, improved authorization rates, and streamlined reporting, olo pay creates roi-positive transactions for brands, reducing overhead and g&a costs. altogether, 4x times 6.25x times 4x leads to a 100x opportunity, and a tam within these three core growth vectors of $16 billion. while this opportunity is large for olo, more importantly, the efficiencies our platform will provide for leading brands are greater, and that is why i believe that leading brands will use one technology platform to understand and serve every consumer that transacts with them. restaurants will need an open platform to own consumer relationships and leverage consumer data, to prioritize channels that maximize profitability and access to the data that allows them to do one-to-one marketing, to manage orders through the front of house, and to use technology to be operationally efficient and informed every facet of their business with customer-centric data.
finally, as i typically do on earnings calls, i'll provide an update on our commitment to olo for good and pledge 1%. this quarter, we continued our commitment to the pledge 1% movement in which olo commits 1% of our time, product, and equity to olo for good initiatives. i'm excited to announce that this quarter, olo launched its first nonprofit partner, emma's torch, a woman's founded restaurant, which provides refugees, asylees, and survivors of human trafficking with culinary training, esl classes, and interview preparation. as part of our product pledge, olo is waiving fees for the fast-casual restaurant's use of the olo ordering and dispatch modules.
we expect to add other nonprofit restaurants to the platform in order to use olo as a platform for social impact and positive change for our communities. and now i'd like to turn things over to peter benevides, olo's cfo, to share more details on olo's fourth quarter performance. peter?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
thanks, noah. the fourth quarter was a great close to our first fiscal year as a public company. as order volumes grew and multiproduct adoption increased, olo continued to drive momentum and beat expectations in the fourth quarter, demonstrating the mission-critical nature of our solutions, which are enabling the digital transformation within the restaurant industry. total revenue in the fourth quarter was $40 million, an increase of 31% year over year.
platform revenue in the fourth quarter was $38.9 million, an increase of 33% year over year due to an increase in active locations coming on to the platform, further multiproduct and multipartner adoption, and the durability of digital ordering. in terms of key metrics, we ended the quarter with approximately 79,000 active locations on the platform, a 23% increase year over year and a 4% increase sequentially as we deployed new brands, such as insomnia cookies, ruby tuesday, sbarro, sizzler, and wetzel's pretzels. arpu for the fourth quarter was approximately $504, representing an increase of 7% year over year and an increase of 4% sequentially. this quarter's key drivers of arpu included continued strength in order volumes, as well as module expansion within our existing customers.
related to module expansion, this past quarter's customers continue to add modules such as network, virtual brands, dispatch and rails to their olo suite. specific to dispatch and rails, major partnership launches throughout 2021, such as grubhub, lyft, and uber eats, helped further increase adoption and transaction volumes from our delivery enablement solutions. for the year, arpu was more than $2,000, representing a 16% year-over-year increase. additionally, as of year-end, on average, brands utilized 2.7 modules per location.
and as noah outlined earlier, we see a lot of momentum ahead in arpu as customers continue to expand their adoption of multiple modules. lastly, net revenue retention remained strong, in excess of 120% for the quarter. for the remainder of the financial metrics disclosed unless otherwise noted, i will be referencing non-gaap financial measures. gross profit for the fourth quarter was $32.6 million, representing a gross margin of 82%.
this compares to gross margin of 84% a year ago. as expected, the year-over-year decrease in gross margin was driven by an increase in headcount and associated compensation costs to support the continued growth of active locations added to the platform. platform gross margin for the fourth quarter was 84%. this compares to platform gross margin of 87% a year ago.
sales and marketing expense for the fourth quarter was $4.6 million or 11% of total revenue. this compares to $2.3 million and 8% a year ago. as expected, increases in sales and marketing spend were driven by continued expansion of our sales, marketing, and business development teams in an effort to continue to add more locations to the platform, increase upsell and retention efforts, and expand our partnership ecosystem. research and development expense for the fourth quarter was $12.9 million or 32% of total revenue.
this compares to $9.6 million and 32% a year ago. general and administrative expense for the fourth quarter was $10.9 million or 27% of total revenue. this compares to $6.1 million and 20% a year ago. as expected, increases were primarily due to increased costs associated with operating as a public company.
operating income for the fourth quarter was $4.3 million as compared to $7.6 million a year ago. net income in the fourth quarter was $4.2 million or $0.02 per share, based on approximately 185.5 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. turning our attention to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance was $514.4 million as of december 31, 2021.
this total reflects the $75.2 million of net cash paid in conjunction with the acquisition of wisely, which closed on november 4. regarding our full year cash flows, operating cash flow was $16.3 million, compared to $20.8 million a year ago. free cash flow was $14.4 million, compared to $19.5 million a year ago. i'll wrap up by providing our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2022.
for the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $41.5 million to $42 million, and non-gaap operating income in the range of $600,000 to $1 million. for the fiscal year 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $194 million to $196 million, and non-gaap operating income in the range of $7.4 million to $9 million. in terms of our guidance for the year, we remain prudent in our approach to forecasting given evolving industry dynamics. specifically, anticipated factors that may impact our forecast include the residual impacts from covid-19 and transitory impacts due to continued industry labor challenges.
that said, we believe covid-19-related challenges will be lapped beginning in the second quarter of this year and that revenue growth rate and net revenue retention will begin to reaccelerate. throughout 2022, we believe the main drivers of revenue growth will be arpu expansion, as well as increasing the number of active locations on the platform. related to arpu, we expect year-over-year growth to be around 10% as order volumes continue to grow and brands adopt additional product modules. while we are making olo pay commercially available to all brands on the olo platform, we are still early in the sales and deployment process, and at this point, do not expect olo pay to be a material driver of growth for 2022.
as we previously noted, the use cases and adaptations of the olo platform throughout the past year has emboldened a broader vision for olo, one in which we can touch, add value to and derive revenue from all industry transactions on and off-premise and what we refer to as digital entirety. fulfilling this vision requires some near-term investments in the platform to capitalize on the opportunities our customers are pulling us into. and as we've seen first with dispatch, and subsequently with rails, customer-led opportunities have been great growth drivers for the company. much of this investment is expected to occur in the first half of the year, and as we progress throughout the year, we expect to return to more normalized levels of profitability.
more specifically, incremental investments in r&d in 2022 are threefold. first, our acquisition of omnivore, which will unlock a faster path to the development of solutions to address our on-premise opportunity, will decrease profitability by a couple of million dollars this year. secondly, we are increasing our investment in olo pay to more quickly bring borderless capabilities to market while also setting the stage for processing card-present transactions. and lastly, we're increasing our investment in customer engagement in front-of-house solutions to tie it all together, a suite of digital ordering solutions to address both off-premise and on-premise ordering, underpinned by a best-in-class customer engagement suite and a seamless payment experience.
we're confident that these investments will unlock future growth opportunities for olo in 2023 and beyond. to summarize, we delivered another strong quarter of operational and financial performance. we are delivering on our mission and believe olo's position at the center of the digital restaurant experience will continue to drive an attractive combination of strong revenue growth and profitability. i'd now like to turn it over to the operator to begin the q&a session.
operator?

operator
thank you. at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] one moment, please, while we poll for questions. and our first question comes from the line of brent bracelin with piper sandler.
please proceed with your question. 
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question here. impressive to see the seventh straight quarter of profitability, even with onboarding the acquisition of wisely. but i wanted to spend a little time on omnivore, if we could. noah, what's the difference between kind of the omnivore menu management system and olo dispatch, rails? outside looking in, it does look like similar functionality.
and then peter, i was hoping you could frame the revenue contribution you're factoring in from this acquisition in '22, or at a minimum, walk through the pricing model for omnivore. thanks.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
hey, brent, this is noah. thanks for the questions. so thinking about omnivore and the capabilities that we are pulling into the olo platform as a result of the acquisition, one of the things that really appeals to us about omnivore's integrations is the way in which there are two-way integrations and allow for what's called sort of an open check. so think about this as putting your card on file at the bar and the ability to keep that tab open.
you can keep adding to it. we think that kind of open-check, two-way interaction with the point-of-sale is really compelling for those on-premise occasions when you are placing multiple orders on the same check, and that's going to be key for the table service ordering experience. it's also just an incredible library of partners that are partners today with omnivore not yet partners with olo, adding to that partner ecosystem, taking us from over 200 partners to now over 300 partners, and really staying true to that philosophy of being an open platform and an open ecosystem in a way that benefits restaurant brands, our customers and the industry to create the most flexible stack that they choose from the best-in-class technology partners out there. 
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yeah. and brent, peter here. yes, specific to the revenue contribution. so the revenue contribution's immaterial.
as noah mentioned there, it's really about acquiring the capabilities to enhance olo's on-premise opportunity and ecosystem. and in conjunction with doing that, really adding a fantastic product and engineering team to the existing olo team. so we're really excited about bringing the omnivore team over to olo.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. and just as a quick follow-up, noah, if i go to the omnivore customer page, it lists customers like outback steakhouse, burger king, hmshost as customers. is this a technology that's broadly deployed across all of these locations? or is it oftentimes partially deployed? just trying to think through the existing footprint that omnivore has and that will be folded into the olo location footprint over time?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
yeah. i think the best way to understand how omnivore is used today as an independent entity is mainly by a partner ecosystem of other technology solutions. there are restaurant brands that are utilizing the omnivore stack for things like the menu management solution or what's shortened as acronym to mms. and those might be some of the restaurant brands that you're naming.
but i would moreover think about this as pos integration suite that enables technology partners to integrate into the in-store environment and the back-of-house environment without having to do all of the heavy lifting that we know very well from 10-plus years of doing pos integrations into legacy pos platforms used by the enterprise restaurant segment as a way of integrating into those restaurant technology environments. 
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
helpful. great to see the streak of profitable growth continues here [inaudible] and get back in the queue. thanks.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
thanks, brent.
operator
our next question comes from the line of stephen sheldon with william blair. please proceed with your question.
stephen sheldon -- william blair -- analyst
great. nice results here, and congrats on the olo pay launch. and so on that, i get that you're not including much financial contribution in 2022, but how are you thinking about the potential financial contribution as we think about the medium term or the next two to three years? what are you targeting? and what levels of interest have you seen in your existing enterprise customer base with this? 
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes. so i can take the first part, and noah, please pile on. so in terms of how we think about the revenue opportunity, we talked earlier as part of our prepared remarks the quantity of gmv that was processed over the platform this year, over $20 billion in gmv, up from $14.6 billion last year. so when we think about the revenue opportunity, it's really through that lens.
and it's through that lens, coupled with the continuation of more and more orders being digital in nature. and that's what gets us really excited about the revenue opportunity. and as we've shown in the past, initially with dispatch, subsequently with rails, we have a very effective upsell motion in which we sell into the brand and are adopted across all locations within that brand. so the combination of those trusted relationships and the magnitude of gmv processed over the platform gives us conviction that this is a really exciting opportunity. 
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
and stephen, maybe just to tack on to that. from a kind of long, long-term perspective, as we think about the tam for olo pay, if we look at this, if we were to peel it out as a discrete tam, it's a $9 billion or thereabouts tam that we're going after in olo pay. and that's really what makes it incredibly compelling. we look at it as a 4x multiplier in the amount of revenue that we can generate on a per-order basis.
and it's compelling from an olo investment perspective. it is something that we're being pulled into, frankly, by olo customers. olo restaurant brands saying, i need to have a more streamlined payment solution than i have today. there's tons of friction in the way that payments works in restaurant on-demand commerce today.
and if i can tap into a network of 85 million consumers that don't have to create a user name, don't have to create a password, don't have to remember that user name or password, and don't have to reenter their credit card each time but can have that magical one-tap experience that many have experienced with platforms like shop pay in the past, another two-sided payment network, that is a huge unlock. and it's something that enables the restaurants to make their direct digital ordering program more convenient than restaurant delivery marketplace experiences from an ordering and payment perspective. so we think it's a really big idea. we've heard that from our customers.
it's what gives us conviction that we've got a really exciting, massive two-sided payment network to build here between our 79,000 restaurants on one side and 85 million consumers on the other side. i know we can bring to life a solution that truly represents olo going from strength to strength in a two-sided network that benefits everybody who touches it. 
stephen sheldon -- william blair -- analyst
got it. that's really helpful. and it sounds like a fairly large opportunity. maybe shifting gears as a follow-up.
virtual brands seems like you're getting a lot of traction there. i guess, how important has that become to the overall -- olo's overall business? and if an existing olo customer expands to add the virtual brands module, how does the contract and monetization there work? does that create additional subscription revenue? or is it just monetized more so by more transaction volume through the platform? 
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes. so in terms of how that is monetized, stephen, it is monetized through a combination of incremental saas fees, in addition to per-transaction fees. and i guess going back to your earlier question around the level of importance, really, i would answer that through the lens of the customer, which is, our goal is to make sure that we're developing a platform that allows our brands to adapt to the environment, as well as maximize revenue per square foot. and virtual brands allow our customers to do that.
and in conjunction with that, we're fortunately monetizing that initiative, but it is certainly important to our customers and an area of focus for the company.
stephen sheldon -- william blair -- analyst
great. thank you, guys.
operator
our next question comes from the line of matt hedberg with rbc capital markets. please proceed with your question.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions, guys, and congrats on both the acquisition and olo pay, super exciting. peter, at the midpoint, if i'm doing the math right, it looks like your guidance is kind of low 30% revenue growth this year. obviously, you noted the really difficult compare with 1q and that acceleration from there.
when we think about the full year guide, it sounds like you're not including anything from omnivore. i'm wondering, when you acquired wisely, i think you said it might contribute mid-single-digit revenue this year -- or i should say, in 2021, and maybe about $10 million for 2022. is that kind of still the assumption that we should be using? 
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes, that's right. 
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. ok, ok. and then the -- obviously, there's -- you talked about having several growth drivers here. obviously, one of them that you -- i think in your guidance, peter, you talked about 10% growth in arpu as sort of the expectation for 2022.
i'm wondering on the location adds, i think you added about 15,000 this year, maybe 14,000 organic, excluding wisely. do you think you'll add sort of the same or maybe more locations in 2022? is that sort of what's embedded in sort of the initial revenue guide? 
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes. so our expectation for 2022 is to add a similar amount of net new locations to the platform, coupled with full year growth of arpu of around 10%. in terms of how we think about the active locations quarter to quarter, i would estimate a pretty even distribution quarter to quarter, although noting that there can be changes quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors. so we tend to think about things on a full year perspective.
and for 2022, again, we're targeting a similar number of net adds as we achieved in 2021.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. thanks a lot. congrats, guys.
operator
our next question comes from the line of brad reback with stifel. please proceed with your question.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thanks very much. noah, there was a lot of talk in 4q around restaurants needing to throttle digital orders because of headcount issues. what type of impact did you guys see from that? and has that continued here in 1q? 
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
brad, thanks for the question. i really feel like our platform is designed for exactly this sort of challenge for restaurants. and i think in the past, i have commented on helping restaurants to do more with less and being a force multiplier for them. and i think that's what restaurants are seeing about digital broadly and about olo specifically and all of the different solution suites.
we've broken it now into five different solution suites. i think we talk a lot about ordering and dispatch and rails. and we're more than just a three-trick pony. we have 12 different products now across five product suites and order management and delivery and customer engagement and front-of-house management and payments.
and all of these things in their own way are helping restaurant brands to do more with the labor that they have and to focus their hospitality really on delivering excellent consumer experiences informed by all the data that's being thrown off by these digital interactions with customers. so i think that is part of olo's mandate, something that we've historically done over our entire lifespan as a company. and that, especially in times of a labor crunch, a labor shortage is really being felt by restaurants and helping them to manage both their off-premise experiences and their on-premise experiences and ultimately deliver hospitality to the consumer. 
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
got it. and then switching gears a bit. the digital entirety strategy, it seems extremely forward-looking in clearly where the market is going. that being said, it's pretty broad.
so as you think about go-to-market and your current resources, your salespeople, etc., where do you think they are in that learning curve? and how long do you think it takes to get them fully up to speed on selling the vision? 
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
well, i think this is a great segue from your last question. i mean this is where we are being pulled into the on-premise opportunities from our customers saying to us, we want the same digitally enriched experience for our consumers on-premise that we have off-premise. it's now one business. we don't want to have two different systems to manage, off-premise customers versus on-premise customers.
we want it to be one system, one platform. we want that to be a digitally informed platform that has customer centricity at its core. so that's really the thing that's pulling us into the four walls of the restaurant. and i think that is something that we've talked about seeing glimpses of before in kiosk ordering, in qr code ordering.
but imagining how restaurants can guide consumers there and ultimately create higher hospitality experiences for consumers while also requiring less labor from the restaurant is, i think, where you see a win for the operator and a win for the consumer. and we think that olo is the best-positioned company to play that role of being the platform that ties together off-premise and on-premise and connects it all back to the 85 million consumers and then some that are utilizing the olo platform as their way of engaging with the restaurants that they love in our network.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
excellent. thanks very much.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
sure thing.

our next question comes from the line of sterling auty with j.p. morgan. please proceed with your question.
unknown speaker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, this is drew on for sterling. given that the 2022 outlook includes that $10 million of wisely contribution, what else might be softening in the business to get to the full year revenue guidance? 
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
i could take that one, drew. so i think from a high level, the underlying fundamentals of the business remain really strong. i think as we think about the year ahead, we just -- we remain prudent in the assumptions that we put forward in making sure that we're setting expectations that we feel comfortable with. and having communicated north of 30% as our target growth rate for the foreseeable future, we're excited about what we've set ahead for this year.
unknown speaker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok, got it. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of connor passarella with truist securities. please proceed with your question.
connor passarella -- truist securities -- analyst
it's connor here on for terry. i just want to start with one on the qsr segment. so we're really beginning to realize that it's definitely ripe for digital transformation. just curious how the pipeline and new activity has been in that segment.
and maybe do you see any notable new business demand shifts from various subsegments served in 2022? 
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
connor, you've got noah here. thanks for the question. yeah, we've noted on previous calls and continue to believe that qsr is a segment that is really ripe for digital. and i think all of the solutions that we have brought to market for different segments, the early adopting segments like fast casual and then casual dining and then family dining and coffee and snack are now available for qsr in a way that helps them to win back that edge in convenience that maybe, as others have gotten into on-demand commerce, qsr had lost a bit of that convenience.
and i think that is -- the legacy of the food business, is that the most convenient channels tend to gain the most transaction volume over time. and so when you have on-demand commerce and you have all of these other competitors now in these other segments, enabling consumers to have their food ready and waiting when they arrive or delivered to them, the drive-through experience doesn't look as fast or convenient anymore. so i think that has been one of the drivers of qsr restaurant brand jumping into digital ordering and really being able to benefit from all of the work that we have done on the platform over the years to get started and get up the learning curve quickly. we have certainly seen that throughout 2021.
we believe that will continue throughout 2022. there's been a lot of activity at restaurant brands in the qsr segment, thinking about how they can create an optimal pickup experience or handoff experience on the operator side of handing the order over to the consumer or over to a delivery courier picking up on behalf of the consumers. some have experimented with double-lane drive-throughs in order to do that. some of the experience with parking spots or slots where they can do curbside pickup, like the casual dining brands experimented with years ago.
so i think it's a time of great excitement from the qsr segment, urgency in the qsr segment to get into the world of on-demand commerce. and with it, to understand the consumer through those digital interactions that on-demand commerce enables, and we imagine we will continue to see growth in that segment. i have noted in the past, and will do so again, this is a segment that's super compelling to us, given that it represents a large number of restaurant locations broadly, and in the enterprise segment, specifically. and that it represents the largest number of transactions per location.
so it's really perfectly set up for our transactional saas model to be a big driver of growth going forward. 
connor passarella -- truist securities -- analyst
great. that's really helpful color. i appreciate that. just had one quick one on wisely.
so for customers on wisely, are there -- are you seeing any correlation there with maybe more successful customer engagement leading to a lift in gmv and arpu? thank you. 
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
well, i think one thing to comment on with wisely is being able to use a platform like wisely is truly about the brand understanding customer lifetime value. that is the really compelling capability that wisely's platform unlocks. and so a brand, for the first time, being able to identify who those top 20% of their customers are that tend to correlate with 60% of the order volume at their restaurant or the sales volume of the restaurant, that's incredibly compelling. i think that's something that wisely enables that helps brands to focus their marketing attention and expenditure on those high-value customers who really move the needle from a sales perspective.
and also these customers then inform every facet of the business. if you can understand who this cohort of high-value customers are, you can understand what correlates to that high-value customer cohort. you can understand the menu mix that they like. you can understand the servers that serve them that, therefore, you would imagine are the most skilled servers who deliver the best experiences.
you can imagine where other customers that fit the same profile live, work and play and where you should launch additional restaurant locations. that metric of customer lifetime value is really a true north metric that is helping restaurants make better decisions across every facet of the enterprise. and we think that is something that is oftentimes missed. this is not just a customer engagement tool.
this is really a new way of viewing the business in a customer-centric manner that improves every facet of the business. and certainly, if you were to talk to wisely customers and wisely customers who are also digital ordering customers of olo's, they would echo those sentiments.
operator

noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
thank you, stephanie. hi, everyone. thank you for spending time with us today. in the first quarter olo's revenue and profitability momentum continued.
we grew revenue 18% year over year, as our platform supported continued growth in active locations coming onto the platform and transaction volumes. our ending active location count increased 19% year over year to approximately 82,000 and we surpassed more than 600 restaurant brands utilizing our platform. this quarter we had success with the adoption of our customer engagements and front-of-house solutions, which expanded our platform offerings through the wisely acquisition. notably, bojangles and el pollo loco, both qsr, deployed our marketing automation and customer data platform or cdp modules in a matter of weeks.
both brands will leverage the marketing automation module to provide personalized campaigns in order to increase their return on investment for marketing campaigns, as well as leverage the cdp module, which creates unified guest profiles, enabling brands to power business decisions and growth. in addition to adding several new restaurant brands to the platform this quarter, we added a new type of customer to the platform, convenience stores or c stores. multi-unit c stores represent an emerging vertical for olo, expanding olo's total addressable location count by an estimated 55,000 locations. and this quarter, we deployed our ordering module at kwik trip, an enterprise c store, enabling the brand to help its guests order ready-to-eat meals.
also, in the first quarter, we took meaningful strides toward enabling digital hospitality, which we define as harnessing the power of first party data to enable personalized and memorable guest experiences. below board member and legendary restaurants are danny meyer coaches his team members to deliver enlightened hospitality to guests and ""always be connecting dots to do so."" with all those customer data platform purpose built for the restaurant industry, we're helping to connect the dots at enterprise speed and scale, enabling digital hospitality with the ultimate ambition to make every guest feel like a regular. first quarter product advancements include, first, we expanded product use cases using serve, our white label branded ordering experience to enable on premise ordering. nando's a fast casual restaurant began utilizing serve as its exclusive dining and ordering system increasing its on premise digital orders per store by more than 600% in one year's time.
and as i mentioned earlier, we showcase the extensibility of our platform by deploying our ordering module at kwik trip. both of these examples highlight our platform's ability to allow operators to focus on the guest experience. and from a technological standpoint, these two examples highlight our platform's ability to quickly append additional elements and features to our existing products to expand our market opportunity. second, we grew our technology partner network by more than 100 technology partners to more than 300 providers through our acquisition omnivore, which we closed on march 4th.
olo's open ecosystem which connects to apps and technologies that streamline operations, improve efficiency, enhance the guest experience and increased operator profitability now encompasses additional partners in on-premise ordering, kitchen display systems, labor management, and inventory management. third, we added a new premium feature to our offerings introducing sync, a simplified listing management product, which enables restaurants to provide up to date data that is automatically synced between olo and more than 50 digital publishers to ensure store information is consistent no matter where guests search. sync's ability to enable restaurants to be discoverable through local digital listings will drive increased direct orders and improve listing return on investment. fourth, we continue to invest in enhancing the olo platform, adding real-time career tracking abilities, as well as adding reminder tools for operators to reenable digital ordering.
these enhancements provide restaurant operators with the ability to better manage their digital programs, improving operations as well as the guest experience. all of these advancements in our products, platform, and network are for the benefit of our customers. olo will continue to innovate and invest in capabilities that provide our brands with the tools to provide digital hospitality to their guests. this is our north star and the thread that runs through olo's expanding product suite.
and since the first quarter ended, we had a great chance to share our digital hospitality vision with our customers. a few short weeks ago, we hosted beyond4, our annual customer conference, which returned in person this year. beyond4 is named to reflect olo's mission to serve our restaurant brands, not just within but beyond the four walls of the restaurant. at beyond4, all the way and olo customers explored our platform and technologies in order to maximize the restaurant footprint in the on-demand world and unlock digital hospitality.
at the conference, our customers were excited about the ways the expanded olo platform can solve even more of their operational challenges, expand their digital programs, increase efficiency, drive revenue, and ultimately, delight their guests. their enthusiasm during the conference further deepened my belief that digital leaders in the restaurant space will use one platform, the olo platform, to understand and serve every guest that transacts with them. at the conference and in less than three months since launching, general availability of our payments solution, we're heartened by our customers significant interest in olo pay. and data from existing and new customers demonstrates olo pay's benefits.
in a recently released testimonial, waba grill, a fast casual restaurant highlighted olo pay's ability to reduce friction for their business and guests alike, mainly through pci compliance, decreasing credit card fraud, and allowing operators to view daily orders chargebacks, failure of payment, and reconciliation, while also creating a seamless experience for their guests that enables credit card, apple pay, google pay, and more payment options. adam kinsinger, director of technology at waba grill franchise corp. stated the benefit of streamlining the digital stack is immense, allowing brands to focus on a guest and their experience. furthermore, during a standing room only beyond4 olo pay breakout session, one of the panelists stated that olo pay doesn't force its operators to choose between the guest experience or protecting their brand from fraud as traditional payment processors have.
olo pay's modern and industry-specific approach to fraud prevention is vital and enables an elegant guest experience. another panelist said that fees from vendors in order to fight chargebacks or fraudulent orders could be $35 an order, which can be double the check average for some orders. however, olo pay's fully integrated solution enables restaurants to fight chargebacks without additional vendor fees, while also increasing authorization rates and reducing friction for guests. and excitement for borderless olo pay capabilities was palpable.
as a reminder, borderless payments capabilities, which we plan to introduce later this year, will allow guests to securely speed through checkout at any participating restaurant within the olo pay network with a single tap quickly and seamlessly connecting 82,000 restaurant locations, 600 brands, and 85 million guests. unprompted, four panelists, who represented customers across various service models, all indicated their intent to deploy olo pay due to its unique ability to fight chargebacks, integrated advanced fraud prevention, and future borderless capabilities. we believe olo pay is a differentiated payment solution that can deliver significant financial and operational benefits for restaurants, as well as a seamless and easier to use solution for their guests. it's a win-win, the kind of innovation we love at olo.
borderless, as was the case with dispatch and subsequently with rails, is another example of the network effects, olo can leverage for continued product innovation on behalf of our customers. the common denominator across all networks, olo enabled is data and our unique positioning means we can harness this data to build and provide solutions to our customers that others frankly cannot. this is what gets us excited about the future and gives us confidence in our ability to provide our customers with a suite of solutions that enables digital hospitality at scale. in return, our customers are better equipped to interact with their guests in truly informed and differentiated ways.
the end result is our customers enjoying the benefits of higher customer lifetime value, the net effect of getting digital hospitality, right. that said we're committed to remaining true to our core tenets, while continuing to execute on our ambition to enable digital hospitality at scale. these cortez are open and integrated with more than 300 technology partners, vertical and purpose-built for restaurants, focused on enabling digital hospitality, innovative, and relentlessly focused on providing adaptive tools to enable restaurants to expand their digital programs, increase efficiency, drive revenue, and delight their guests. we observed in technology-dependent industries that platforms that are extensible, secure, and reliable are the platforms of choice and i believe now more than ever, that restaurants must have a full stack offering in order to thrive in our digital world.
and olo answers that call. and finally, as i typically do on earnings calls, i'd like to provide two corporate updates. first, i'm thrilled to welcome diego panama to the olo executive team as chief revenue officer. diego is a seasoned public company executive with a proven track record of successfully scaling saas companies bringing deep and relevant domain knowledge as well as go to market experience on a global scale.
he's worked at some of the most innovative tech companies including liveramp and previously microsoft on digital transformation for enterprise scale customers. importantly, diego has a great understanding of data applications, and how enterprise brands can use data as a strategic lever in their business, an integral part of our restaurant customer strategy as they look to increase digital hospitality for all of their guests by leveraging guests and operational data. diego will support olo's relationships with his restaurant brands, champion their success, drive our sales and marketing initiatives, and importantly, drive all those next chapter of execution and growth as we realize our 100x scale opportunity. diego will assume the role of chief revenue officer at the beginning of july as our current chief customer officer marty hahnfeld plans to retire.
marty has been a key leader in olo's efforts toward digital entirety and in our growth throughout the industry. on behalf of the entire leadership team. i'd like to congratulate marty on his retirement and thank him for his dedication and significant impact to olo and its customers throughout his tenure. and second, i'm pleased to share an update in connection with our olo for good initiative.
as a reminder, we launched a olo for good in 2021 and joined the pledge 1% movement committing to donate 1% of our time, equity and product to doing good. as part of that we committed to donating 1% of olo shares over 10 years to our independent donor advised fund managed by tides foundation. last year we were recommended tides foundation make grants to nine non-profit organizations. this quarter, in our second round of grant recommendations, we advise tides foundation to grant $2.1 million in total, from our donor advised fund to the following nine organizations, american forests, appalachian trail conservancy, emma's torch, giving kitchen, heart of dinner, the lee initiative or the let's empower employment initiative, the okra project, partnership with native americans, and world central kitchen.
grant recipients are non-profits focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion, ending childhood hunger and increasing access to food, supporting the restaurant industry's frontline workers, and protecting natural resources and reducing waste and emissions. we continue to be enthusiastic about our ability to use olo as a platform for social impact and positive change for our communities. we love to do well and do good in parallel. and now i'd like to turn things over to peter benevides, olo's cfo, to share more details on olo's first quarter performance, peter?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
thanks, noah. in the first quarter, revenue grew on continued location and transaction volume growth, demonstrating the mission-critical nature of our solutions, which are helping to enable digital hospitality within the restaurant industry. total revenue in the first quarter was $42.8 million, an increase of 18% year over year. platform revenue in the first quarter was $41.5 million, an increase of 19% year over year, driven by an increase in active locations coming on to the platform, further multi-product and multi-partner adoption and the durability of digital ordering.
in terms of key metrics, we ended the quarter with approximately 82,000 active locations on the platform, a 19% increase year over year and a 4% increase sequentially. as we deploy new brands such as kwik trip, tacotime, cokeworks among others. arpu for the first quarter was approximately $516, representing a 2% decrease year over year, which i'll speak to in more detail in a moment and a 2% increase sequentially. net revenue retention in the first quarter was approximately 107%, which as expected, was less than recent periods.
the year-over-year decline in arpu and net revenue retention was primarily due to two factors. first, this past quarter, we continue to lap the residual impacts of financial stimulus in the last pre-vaccination period of the covid 19 pandemic, during which time order volumes were elevated. and second, this past quarter, we lapped the final quarter operating under our prior doordash agreement. but the impact of these two dynamics behind us, we expect to see arpu and net revenue retention accelerate in the ensuing quarters, as customers continue to adopt additional product modules, such as olo pay in our front-of-house and customer engagement solutions.
for the remainder of the financial metrics disclosed unless otherwise noted, i will be referencing non-gaap financial measures. gross profit for the first quarter was $32.4 million, compared to $30 million in the prior year period, driven by the revenue growth previously mentioned, partially offset by higher platform and professional service and other compensation costs to support the growth and transactions and active locations coming onto the platform, as well as the near term impacts due to our recent wisely and omnivore acquisitions. sales and marketing expense for the first quarter was $6.1 million, or 14% of total revenue. this compares to $3.4 million and 10% a year ago.
year-over-year increases were driven by further expansion of relevant teams to continue to drive revenue growth by securing new and expanding existing relationships, as well as increasing our partnership ecosystem. research and development expense for the first quarter was $12.8 million, or 30% of total revenue. this compares to a $11 million and 30% a year ago. general and administrative expense for the first quarter was $11.8 million, or 28% of total revenue.
this compares to $9.5 million and 26% a year ago. as expected, increases were primarily due to increased costs associated with operating as a public company. going forward, as we lap the initial increase in costs associated with operating as a public company, we expect g&a to decrease as a percentage of total revenue. operating income for the first quarter was $1.7 million, compared to $6 million a year ago.
net income in the first quarter was $1.7 million, or $0.01 per share based on approximately $183.3 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. turning our attention to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance was $463.7 million as of march 31, 2022. regarding cash flows, net cash used in operating activities was $900,000, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $4.2 million a year ago.
free cash flow was negative $3.4 million, compared to $4 million a year ago. i'll wrap up by providing our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2022. for the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $45.5 million and $46 million and non-gaap operating income in the range of $600,000 to $1 million. for the fiscal year 2022, we now expect revenue in the range of $195 million and $197 million and non-gaap operating income in the range of $7.6 million and $9.2 million.
in terms of guidance for the year, there are a few things to highlight. first, we remain incredibly excited about the market opportunity ahead. now that we have lapped the residual impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, we anticipate a reacceleration of revenue growth as implied in our second quarter and full year guidance. additionally, while we're encouraged by the overall excitement from our customers regarding the commercial availability of olo pay, we have not factored any meaningful revenue contribution into our guidance.
next, the second quarter will be the first quarter in which we feel the full impact of the omnivore acquisition, which closed on march 4. also in the second quarter, as noah mentioned, in april, we hosted our beyond4 conference. expenses related to the conference were approximately $1 million. as a result, following the second quarter, we anticipate expanding operating profit and achieving the full year profitability outlined in our guidance.
to summarize. we continue to deliver revenue growth and profitability as we take meaningful strides toward enabling digital hospitality. our position is strong as we have a long runway for growth through adding more locations, cross-selling our robust and comprehensive product suite, and through expanded use cases of the platform. i'd now like to turn it over to the operator to begin the q&a session.

thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question comes from stephen sheldon of william blair. please go ahead.
stephen sheldon -- william blair -- analyst
hey. thanks for taking my questions. sounds like you've had some nice customer wins for wisely. so curious if you can share what kind of level of interest you've seen in your existing customer base to potentially add wisely modules? and, i guess, you've talked to think before about $10 million, potential $10 million of revenue contribution there.
i think you talked about for 2022, you talked about that last quarter, are you still given what you're seeing now? are you still on track to meet that are things going better than maybe you'd originally expected there?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
hey, steve. this is noah. i'll take the first part of that question and then hand it over to peter. so i want to pick up really on the piece that you wrote this morning about digital engagement.
i think that it sort of sets the table for where we are in terms of brands and their ambitions to drive toward 100% digital, and kind of where wisely fits into that as a way of taking the data that flows from those interactions with guests and using it to better engage with consumers and what we think of as unlocking digital hospitality. ultimately having every guest feel like a regular based on the brand's ability to use the data that they've gathered about that guest to better serve and personalize their experience. so amazing when we see brands that are already up, i think you noted in your piece wingstop now at 62.3% digital, sweetgreen at 66% digital, but these brands have the ambition of being 100% digital, and as part of that you're seeing a broad interest in how do we use tools to really get great at digital marketing, to learn from all of this information that we're gathering and drive customer lifetime value of our guests? and also go and acquire more guests that look like our best guests. and that's really what the wisely suite, what we now think of as our marketing automation and customer data platform components of that suite, represent and have seen a lot of interest from especially at our beyond for conference a few weeks ago.
and we just saw huge excitement from our customer base now over 600 brands, and really unlocking digital hospitality and understanding that is the banner under which all of those solutions live.
stephen sheldon -- william blair -- analyst
got it. yes. yes. go ahead.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes. sorry. sorry. yes.
just picking up from where noah left off there. that is correct. in terms of our revenue target for the year, we're still maintaining that million dollar goal. and we are obviously really encouraged and fused with the progress that we've made today, and some of the quick wins that we mentioned on the call.
but that is still in line with our four year targeted revenue.
stephen sheldon -- william blair -- analyst
great to hear. and then just wanted to ask, you guys have a lot of initiatives underway, i'm just wanted to ask them about your talent strategy, and what trends you've seen and being able to attract new talent retain existing talent in this environment. if you think about this year, and maybe over the next couple, are you well staffed at this point to push forward the initiatives you have in place?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
hey, stephen. this is noah again. i'll jump in there. yes, i mean, we're feeling really good about our talent, currently on a team and our talent pipeline, and our ability to fill the roles and needs that we have as an organization with a lot of ambition and a lot of different capabilities that are all driving forward.
one of the things that i'm particularly excited about is the talent that we have brought into the company in the different roles as general managers of various business units. and so we have four general managers who are operating our payments, and that's responsible for olo pay, the wisely team customer engagements in front of house as another business units that we have gms are focused on rails and network and syndication partnerships and then also our direct ordering business. and all of those things are areas where, as we talked about new initiatives and things that we're excited about, on the product fronts, we mentioned an initiative from each of those groups. and it's exciting that we have great leaders, almost like many ceos who are leading those initiatives and have incredible product design and engineering teams underneath them and a unified go to market to really meet the needs of our customers, broadly speaking.
stephen sheldon -- william blair -- analyst
great to hear and nice results.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from terry tillman of truist. please go ahead.
terry tillman -- truist securities -- analyst
yes. thanks for taking my questions. hey, noah, peter and stephanie. first question i had is, i was actually impressed with just where we've moved, i think just over the course of a quarter from 500 brands to 600 brands, hopefully, i've got that right.
but if indeed, you've seen that kind of incremental brands being added to the platform, i'd love to kind of double click into, the typical new customers you're seeing or brands coming onto the platform. is their buying behavior changing because of, kind of the inflationary environment we're in? are they are they buying multiple products or starting with one? it's just how this expansion and customer brands kind of manifests itself in revenue, either this year or next year? so that ended up being like four parts that i could repeat if i have to. isn't that a follow up for peter?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
all right. terry, well, thank you for the multi part question. i'll see if i can touch all those areas. this is noah.
yes. so i think we were over 500 brands, as we discussed our customer base last quarter. we're now over 600 brands, we talked a little bit last quarter about expanding some of our focus on what we define as the emerging enterprise segment of the market. those are into our definition brands that have between five and 99 locations and then we classify enterprise as 100 or more locations.
so a lot of expansion of new restaurant brands that are starting their relationship with olo from that emerging enterprise segment. i think broadly speaking, what has become clear, certainly through covid i would argue before covid and certainly now is that a digital ordering platform, digital commerce, and digital marketing tools, marketing automations edp, these are not nice to have these are must have capabilities for every brand out there. and so we're seeing brands really engaging with olo to stand up their digital platform, forging those direct relationships with guests. and then seeing that olo itself is growing and changing, we now have 12 different software modules.
and we can really help a brand go from zero to 100%, digital, utilizing all the capabilities that we have to offer. so i think peter can get into how brands have over time started their relationship with more of our software modules, we ourselves have grown the total number of software modules dramatically, both organically and through acquisition. but it's exciting for us to see all of the new brands and all have the opportunity for those brands to really go further faster in their digital transformation by utilizing more of the platform.
terry tillman -- truist securities -- analyst
yep, yep. got it. thank you. that was a solid response to my multi part question.
so i'll give you -- thank you noah. peter, just the follow up question is on gross margin. i mean, it sounds like there's, you've added a couple of technology stacks from the acquisition. so maybe there's just duplicative costs? or how do we think about gross margins the rest of the year? would they be more at this level? or could you see them actually starting to improve a bit? thank you.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes. thanks, terry. great question. so i guess from a high level, the trends that you're seeing are in line with our expectations, i think what you're seeing is some increased investment in the core business, to better align with the growth that we've experienced over the past 12 to 18 months in terms of number of locations coming onto the platform and growth and transaction volumes.
and as you mentioned, we're you're also seeing the impact of a full quarter of the wisely acquisition and a one month period of the omnivore acquisition both of those with lower gross margin profiles than then although, i think longer term, holding aside ola pay, we do expect to see some improvement in gross margins as we can continue to integrate the wisely and omnivore acquisitions and begin to leverage all those economies of scale.
terry tillman -- truist securities -- analyst
sounds good. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from matt hedberg of rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
unknown speaker -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hey. this is anusha for matt hedberg. thanks for taking my questions. you mentioned from three products during ipo, you have now reached four products across five products we've certainly come a long way.
could you expand on the momentum you're seeing with multi product adoption, and how products from wisely and eventually olo pay can help make your platform stickier? and then maybe if you could talk about the level of penetration in your customer base? thanks.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes. so i think i could -- this is peter here. so i think i could probably bundle those two questions into one answer. so we disclosed last quarter that, on average locations, subscribe to 2.7 modules per location.
and as you noted, there, we have upwards of a dozen products spread across five product suite. so when you think about the opportunity to expand within our customer base, there's clearly a lot of opportunity there. and obviously, future growth and digital order volumes will help to increase both revenue and arpu over time as well. in terms of attach rates, specifically, the core olo platform, in the wisely suite of business, it's still early in terms of seeing the full suite attach rate from the onset of the relationship, where we're seeing a lot of momentum and early success is through that upsell motion.
so leveraging those trusted relationships that we've developed with the brands over the years, and helping educate them on really the added value of having a marketing automation suite and cdp suite, in conjunction with their digital ordering platform. that's where we're seeing a lot of early success.
unknown speaker -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. and then on olo pay although it's still early, maybe can you talk about the adoption trends of olo pay in the quarter, and then when we might start to see more meaningful contribution to develop from olo pay?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes. it's peter here again, i can take that one. so in terms of adoption trends, still, still a little early. so we announced the commercial availability of olo pay last quarter and as noah mentioned in his prepared remarks, we had a great customer conference this past month where olo pay was a central focus of the narrative of that conference.
and coming out of the conference, we've seen a lot of momentum and a lot of excitement around olo pay and the pipeline is building. that said, i still think we're maybe a quarter early in terms of being able to go a level deeper on what we think the revenue opportunity will be this year in long-term, but we're really encouraged with how the pipeline is developing today.
unknown speaker -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
all right. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from brent bracelin of piper sandler. please go ahead.
clarke jeffries -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi. this is clarke jeffries on for brent. first question is, the feedback from on olo pay sounds very encouraging, especially because it seems that olo pay is not being judged as just an attractive integrated option for newer existing customers, but a payment solution judged by its own merits to be very attractive. i was wondering if you could share maybe some additional detail on how you're able to do some of those outcomes for customers reducing chargeback fees compared to the incumbents whether this is a an architectural advantage or a vertical focus advantage, if you could dive into that.
that'd be much appreciated.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
so clarke, this is noah. thanks for the question. so i think key to understanding olo pay's advantage over the incumbent payment solutions is understanding that olo pay is really have bundled into the commerce platform itself. and so that means that on the front end, the consumer experience olo pay is bundled into their checkout experience.
and we can implement that one-tap checkout for eliminating friction from the checkout experience, so the guest doesn't have to remember their email address and password that they've used. they don't have to reenter credit card details that makes for a better front-end experience that leads to a higher basket conversion rate. it also embeds within the commerce platform on the back end on the operator experience. and so today, if you think about the status quo for digital ordering, and payment within digital ordering, the digital ordering platform, olo is acting as a gateway into whatever credit card processor the brand is using for card present transactions at the restaurant.
and that means that the brand is or the operator is really managing the transaction in two places. and when there's a refund, or when there's a chargeback, they have to administer that in two different systems, their credit card platform, and that dashboard and the olo dashboard, that goes away with ola pay. with olo pay, they can manage refunds, they can manage chargebacks, they can manage all things payments within the olo dashboard. so it becomes a single platform to manage the digital ordering business.
and we think that has great advantages for helping operators simplify operations. and then also through the network effect of the olo platform and our partnership with stripe and the stripe radar product in particular, and olo shield, which is our own proprietary fraud prevention solution, we have the ability to fight fraud against across all of the restaurant transactions that we can see within olo and that stripe can see across their network. so that's part of the advantage of olo pay. i just -- i want to be clear that olo pay is not just credit card transactions, it is also apple pay, it is also google pay.
it is not there for in competition with apple pay, or in competition with google pay. and it also doesn't require that the brand has to completely rip and replace whatever processor or processors their operators are using inside of the restaurant. it's purely about the digital ordering experience and making that a seamless experience for the consumer, and also simplifying things on the operator side.
clarke jeffries -- piper sandler -- analyst
appreciate it. it sounds like it's building on the integration benefits of even something like the marketing automation platform, helping the operators to have a simpler stack. a follow-up question about the expansion into convenience stores, seems like a meaningful expansion in terms of 55,000 potential locations, wondering if you could just maybe dig into how the friction points are different for those businesses compared to normal enterprise restaurant brand. how they operate? are they owned and operated by similar franchisees, partners? and are they sort of the businesses that could adopt all of the modules available from olo?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
so i think with c-stores, the only module i can think that does not make sense for c-stores that we offer is probably our reservations platform. it may make sense at some point, but i don't really see that. i think everything else that we offer from digital ordering, delivery, marketing, automation, etc. these have resonance for anyone who is doing takeout and delivery of made to order food.
and that's specifically how we're working with c-store operators is on that prepared food. to the extent that a restaurant and a c-store look similar, it's that they're taking orders, they're preparing those orders custom made fresh just in time, and then handing off that order to a guest who's coming in or to a courier who's coming in to collect the order on the guest's behalf. from a go-to-market perspective, very similar go-to-market motion, where we're selling into the brand. and just like with enterprise restaurants, we always sell to the brand.
and then we're adopted across the entire location base, whether those are corporate-owned or franchise-owned. i guess, some different point-of-sale integrations in the c-store point-of-sale space. we're no stranger to that. we've done well over two dozen, perhaps well over three dozen point-of-sale integrations.
and we do have many point-of-sales that are instead of olo integrating to them now integrating into olo. so i think with that exception, a very familiar setting for us just a new opportunity of we estimate to be 55,000 additional locations in our tam, looking at the u.s. enterprise c-store segment.
clarke jeffries -- piper sandler -- analyst
appreciate you very much. thank you very much.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from brad reback of stifel. please go ahead.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thanks very much. can we go back to the gross margin question that terry had brought up? if i look at revenue grew $2.8 million sequentially. but gross profit dollars actually went down $200,000.
so there was a negative incremental gross margin, what exactly happened in the quarter?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
hey, brad. so peter here. so really two things happen this past quarter. we had the full sort of quarter impact of the wisely acquisition, as well as one month impact from omnivore and then the ability to catch up on some investments in the core business to support active location growth and transaction volume growth that that's occurred over the past 12 to 18 months with respect to the core business.
one thing that i do want to call out is we had investments earmarked for later on in the year in terms of net headcount ads. but through the omnivore acquisition, we were able to take some of those folks that we acquired through the activate acquisition, and have them take some of the roles that we had earmarked forward the back half of the year. so, part of what you're seeing there is really an acceleration of some of those expenses that we have already had planned in the year. we just were able to capture those earlier in the year.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. thanks very much.

noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
thank you, stephanie. hi, everyone. thank you for spending time with us today. olo delivered solid second quarter results.
we generated $45.6 million in total revenue, a 27% increase year over year, as our platform supported continued growth in new brands, increased module adoption within our existing customer base and increased transaction volume. we increased average revenue per unit, or arpu, to $544, 12% year over year and 5% sequentially as existing customers adopted additional modules, including early adoption of olo pay. we deployed roughly 3,000 new locations to the platform with ending active locations increasing 11% year over year, flat sequentially to approximately 82,000. more on that in a moment.
we're excited to have welcomed a number of leading brands to the olo platform this quarter. these brands span various hospitality service models from quick service to fine dining and virtual brands to convenience stores or c-stores. most notably, freddy's frozen custard & steakburgers, a fast casual restaurant with hundreds of locations, deployed olo's full stack of digital ordering solutions this quarter, including ordering, dispatch, rails, network and olo pay. freddy's represents one of our newest and largest customers to adopt olo pay.
in addition to welcoming new brands to the platform this quarter, we expanded relationships within our existing customer base, increasing adoption of products across several olo product suites, brands such as california fish grill, cicis pizza and duck donuts expanded their usage of ordering solutions. twin peaks and whataburger expanded their usage of delivery enablement solutions. o'charley's restaurant + bar and sprinkles adopted guest engagement solutions. and on the border and smokey bones adopted front-of-house solutions.
as olo continues to innovate in order to help restaurants embrace their digital opportunity by offering more mission-critical solutions, such as olo pay and guest engagement, we expect an increase in share of our revenues to be driven by upsells. in the same way that customer expansion is an important growth driver for the company, we continue to be excited by the momentum of our on-premise digital ordering solutions, which are supercharging our restaurants in their pursuit to be 100% digital. for example, last quarter, i spoke of nando's, a fast casual restaurant utilizing serve as its exclusive dine-in ordering system as well as the benefits associated with this offering, specifically increasing basket size, higher staff tips and operational efficiencies. given these benefits, this quarter, the brand signed on to adopt our olo pay solution, combining our best-in-class solutions for both on-premise digital ordering and payments.
these examples of adding new brands to the platform, expanding within our existing customer base, including enabling on-premise digital ordering and increasing revenue per order are reflective of olo executing toward our 100x opportunity. and while encouraged by the underlying trends in support of our 100x opportunity, we remain highly focused on helping our brands navigate through several macroeconomic challenges. currently, the industry is facing major challenges brought on by the residual impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, including structural labor challenges, margin pressure due to inflationary economic conditions as well as supply chain challenges and resulting concerns related to a recessionary environment. these industry dynamics have impacted our customers and prospects in two ways.
at the brand level, these challenges have resulted in elongated sales cycles as fewer brand resources have lengthened the decision-making process. and at the operator level, these challenges have resulted in elongated deployment time lines as many operators are unable to deploy in a timely manner. while we continue to actively work to help alleviate these issues at the brand and operator levels through product enhancements, expanding our network of implementation partners and directly managing more of the deployment process, we anticipate both of these dynamics to continue through the balance of the year and, therefore, have factored in lower expectations for net new deployments and revenue in the second half of the year. that said, it's our belief that over time, restaurants will increasingly rely on technology to alleviate macroeconomic pressures, improve profitability, ease operational burdens and enable digital hospitality to drive or repeat business and increase revenues.
as this trend continues, olo is well positioned to help brands achieve their digital ambitions through our modular suite of order management, delivery enablement, guest engagement, front-of-house and payment solutions. olo can be a force multiplier in helping brands address macroeconomic challenges while realizing their digital goals in a cost-effective and operationally lean manner. regarding recessionary dynamics, i'd like to remind investors that unlike other retail categories, food is nondiscretionary. consumers tend to eat 20 to 25 times every week.
and in times like these, consumers don't typically begin to cook. instead, they trade down. this is a phenomenon that olo witnessed firsthand in 2008 and 2009 when consumers purchase food from lower ticket size restaurants with greater prevalence. in fact, the on-demand food dollar, which we define as total spend on food to be eaten away from home, has consistently shifted two restaurants versus grocery even through recessions, accounting for $1.17 trillion in 2021 or 55% of total food expenditures.
olo's customer base, consisting of enterprise brands primarily within the limited service, quick service and fast casual segments leaves olo in a favorable position as these types of restaurants have fared well during economic slowdowns. as we look at the opportunity ahead, i'm excited to have new sales leadership to help olo realize this opportunity. since our last call, we've welcomed diego panama as our chief revenue officer. as a reminder, diego is a seasoned public company executive with a proven track record of successfully scaling saas companies, bringing deep and relevant domain knowledge as well as go-to-market experience on a global scale.
we look forward to diego amping up our go-to-market and deployment strategies that will drive long-term durable growth. as i mentioned earlier, this quarter, we deployed roughly 3,000 new locations to the platform with ending active locations increasing 11% year over year, flat sequentially to approximately 82,000. this quarter, our active location count was impacted by a change in our relationship with subway. in february of 2020, we announced a relationship with subway in which approximately 15,000 locations would utilize the rails module to integrate and manage third-party marketplace orders.
certain subway locations began directly integrating with marketplaces, impacting our ending active location count by roughly 2,500 locations in the second quarter. we expect subway's direct marketplace integration to continue with the balance of their locations being removed from our total active location count in the fourth quarter of this year or the first quarter of 2023. this is not a trend we expect to experience broadly as subway's global proprietary point-of-sale platform is an unusual circumstance in the industry and not representative of the broader long-term opportunity with our current or prospective customers. as brands continue to navigate through macro uncertainties, this quarter, we continue to implement product enhancements to better serve our customers, including launching several innovations in our first-ever summer release event.
second quarter product advancements include: first, we launched borderless olo pay in pilot with three brands on july 5. as a reminder, borderless capabilities allow guests to securely speed through an accelerated checkout at any participating restaurant within the olo pay network, whether through app, website or on-premise. this is possible as borderless olo pay stores payment credentials at the platform and brand level, allowing seamless checkout regardless of the restaurant a consumer transacts with. borderless will enable brands to capture data for guests without requiring guests to create a new account for every brand.
early results are compelling, with 76% of guests saving their credit card information for future purchases, roughly 2.5 times the average number of guests saving their cards on file. we've also observed a meaningful increase in basket conversion rates, leading to increased revenues and transactions for restaurants and olo. and we're on track to expand borderless capabilities to more restaurant brands before the end of the year. second, we furthered our commitment to being an open platform by growing our diverse technology partner network in two ways: one, by completing our first ordering integration with qsr automations, a market leader in kitchen display systems or kds.
kds integrations enable olo customers to see and optimize all orders, whether on or off-premise providing a 360-degree view of all orders in production. this information will allow olo to provide brands with operational decision-making abilities by including capacity management features that quote and throttle orders based on the real-time kitchen activity levels, ultimately creating a more integrated technology solution for restaurants and expanding our vertical offerings throughout the restaurant value chain. two, through strategically partnering with two leading geo-fencing platforms, flybuy from radius networks and radar. these partnerships ensure guests receive food as fresh as possible, minimizing pickup and drive-through wait times through the use of location-aware technology, augmenting qsr digital ordering programs.
olo's growing open ecosystem of more than 300 integrated technology and service partners that span the full digital tech stack from enterprise-ready solutions to emerging technologies is essential to delivering a best-in-class experience powered by the olo platform. our partnerships also create a flywheel in which adding a new customer to our restaurant network benefits all olo partners and adding a new technology partner to our partner network benefits all olo customers. third, we continue to invest in enhancing the olo platform by introducing new features that help our customers provide digital hospitality. for example, we added a party seated webhook, which emits an event when a wait list or reservation party is seated from the olo host app.
this unlocks the ability to fire a queued order to the kitchen when a guest arrives to be seated, unlocking a win-win for guests and restaurant with faster service and increased table turns. i'm proud that olo continues to implement product enhancements to better serve our customers, and i'm glad the industry recognizes it. recently, we earned best feature set and best relationship from the trustradius best of summer awards. we are honored to support our restaurant brands and look forward to delivering on the high expectations they set for us, and we'll continue to make advancements in our partner network, platform and products for the benefit of our customers and to rev up the engine of hospitality.
and finally, as i typically do on earnings calls, i'd like to provide a corporate update. olo is committed to building a diverse and inclusive culture that promotes growth and equity for underrepresented groups, while supporting and celebrating all voices and perspectives. in the spirit of transparency and commitment to this effort, we've updated our dei website with gender and ethnicity metrics as of june 30, and we remain on track to have our team be comprised of 42% women and 18% underrepresented ethnicities by 2024. we also furthered our commitment to equity by adopting a new equitable access to healthcare policy, signing the human rights watch business statement on anti-lgbtq legislation to support our lgbtq+ employee population and signing the don't ban equality statement in response to the u.s.
supreme court's dob's decision. i am personally honored to be deeply involved in these efforts, along with my executive team as dei is hugely important to our success as a company and as a pillar in the community. to close, we believe now more than ever that olo is a mission-critical solution that will enable brands to be successful in spite of the current macro environment. to do more with less, relieving labor challenges, increasing operational efficiencies and enabling every guest to feel like a regular.
we're encouraged by the underlying trends in our business in support of olo's 100x revenue opportunity as we remain highly focused on helping our brands to thrive and gain share through the industry's digital transformation. and with that, i'd like to hand it over to peter to discuss more detailed results. peter?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
thanks, noah. in the second quarter, we grew revenues as we added new brands to the platform, continue to increase module adoption within our existing customer base and increased transaction volume on the platform. total revenue in the second quarter was $45.6 million, an increase of 27% year over year. platform revenue in the second quarter was $44.5 million, an increase of 29% year over year.
in terms of key metrics, we ended the quarter with approximately 82,000 active locations on the platform, an 11% increase year over year and flat sequentially. while we added roughly 3,000 new locations to the platform this quarter, net new locations were impacted by a portion of subway locations coming off of the platform. as mentioned earlier, we anticipate this trend to continue through the balance of the year, which i'll address in more detail in a moment. arpu for the second quarter was approximately $544, representing a 12% increase year over year and a 5% increase sequentially.
continued growth in arpu was driven by further expansion within our existing customer base and to a lesser extent, fewer subway locations on the platform, whereby their relative arpu is less than other olo customers. and lastly, net revenue retention in the second quarter was approximately 106%. it would have been 500 basis points higher, excluding the impact of subway. for the remainder of the financial metrics disclosed unless otherwise noted, i will be referencing non-gaap financial measures.
gross profit for the second quarter was $34 million. this compares to $29.5 million a year ago. the year-over-year increase in gross profit was driven by continued growth in revenue partially offset by incremental costs associated with our current wisely and omnivore acquisitions, increased compensation costs to support new locations coming on to the platform and to a lesser extent, processing costs associated with olo pay. sales and marketing expense for the second quarter was $7.2 million or 16% of total revenue.
this compares to $3.2 million and 9% a year ago. as a reminder, this past quarter, we held our first in-person user conference in two years, beyond four, which increased sales and marketing expenses for the period by approximately $1 million. research and development expense for the second quarter was $13.8 million or 30% of total revenue compared to $11.1 million a year ago or 31% of total revenue. general and administrative expense for the second quarter was $11.1 million or 24% of total revenue.
this compares to $8.8 million and 25% a year ago. operating income for the second quarter was $2 million compared to $6.5 million a year ago. net income in the second quarter was $2.2 million, or $0.01 per share based on approximately 181.9 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. turning our attention to the balance sheet and cash flow statement.
our cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term investments totaled $464.7 million as of june 30, 2022. regarding cash flows, net cash provided by operating activities was flat in the quarter as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $11.3 million a year ago. free cash flow was negative $3 million, as compared to positive $10.8 million a year ago. we believe our strong balance sheet puts us in a good position to proactively capitalize on our 100x opportunity while continuing to be prudent capital allocators with rigorous operating discipline as we have in the past.
i'll wrap up by providing our guidance for the third quarter and full year 2022. for the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $46.5 million and $47 million and non-gaap operating income in the range of $1.8 million and $2.2 million. for the fiscal year 2022, we now expect revenue in the range of $183 million and $184 million and non-gaap operating income in the range of $7.6 million and $8.4 million. in terms of guidance for the year, there are a few things to highlight.
first, as previously mentioned, macroeconomic challenges at the brand and operator level have resulted in elongated deployment in sales cycles, impacting revenue in the back half of the year. while the pipeline remains robust and we continue to actively work to help alleviate these issues, we anticipate both of these dynamics to continue through the balance of the year and therefore, have factored in lower expectations for new deployments in the back half of the year. second, we're encouraged by the continued enthusiasm, early adoption and performance metrics of olo pay. given this momentum, we have now factored a few million dollars of revenue into our assumptions for the year.
third, consumer demand for digital ordering continues to prove durable. data from npd demonstrated that roughly 15% of restaurant transactions in the second quarter were digital, levels consistent with the past three quarters. this data supports the fact that the increase in digital transactions in recent years is a secular trend. while we expect the digital transactions to continue to grow over the long term, we remain prudent in our approach to forecasting digital transaction volumes in the near term.
fourth, as mentioned earlier, we expect the balance of subway locations to directly integrate with marketplaces in the fourth quarter. while this will likely impact our ending active location counts in the fourth quarter of this year or the first quarter of 2023, it did not impact the third quarter or full year guide. said another way, based on our understanding of subway's longer-term business plans, we believe the relationship could evolve sometime this year with a wide range of outcomes and took a conservative approach to our relationship with subway in our prior guidance. and lastly, we continue to focus on capitalizing on the large opportunity ahead of us while maintaining profitability, which is reflected in our updated guidance.
strong discipline in capital efficiency are intrinsic to olo. over our history, we have demonstrated our ability to generate profits while meeting increased demand and providing new and innovative products to our customers cost effectively. we expect that this year will be no exception. and with that, i'd like to now turn it back over to the operator to begin q&a.

[operator instructions] our first question is from terry tillman with truist securities. please proceed with your question.
terry tillman -- truist securities -- analyst
yeah, good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. i have two questions. the first one is a two-parter, though.
i guess, noah, in terms of the elongated sales cycles, is this sporadic? or is it across the emerging and large brands as well? and what are they saying? are they going to wait a couple of quarters because this could have implications into next year? so just a little bit more on that. and then peter had mentioned something at the end of his prepared remarks about subway. i was kind of confused. this midpoint reduction that doesn't include any subway? i just need to understand that better.
and then i had a follow-up on olo pay.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
sure, terry. this is noah. i'll jump in on elongated sales and deployment cycles. i think this is a temporary matter, something that restaurants are dealing with at the brand level and at the operator level.
at the brand level, it's really reflected in elongated sales cycles of selling into different constituents within the restaurant, headquarters, someone in operations, someone in technology, someone in marketing for the different product suites, having a lot of things on their plate at the moment in the environment you're operating in where you have very high inflation in wholesale food prices labor concerns, et cetera. so i think that is something that is transitory from the brand level. at the operator level, that's really manifesting in the elongated deployment cycles where it just takes longer for us to have the restaurant operators doing what they need to do to get live and up and running on the platform. so as we mentioned, we're taking a number of steps on that.
we're doing things to the platform to make it easier for operators to do deployments on their own. we're also working with more third-party resources around deployment, implementation with firms, doing more -- taking on more ourselves to speed up deployment cycles. but that's how it's manifesting in sales and deployments.
terry tillman -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. and then -- yes, go ahead. sorry, peter.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes. the second part of your question there in terms of subway and implications on the guide. so when we entered the year, there was indication that subway may plan to directly integrate with marketplaces. but at that point in time, the time line was unclear.
so like all data points and assumptions that feed the model, we took that information, we factored in the possibility that subway may integrate directly by doing two things: one, reducing their transaction volumes throughout the year and in turn, reducing a portion of their revenue contribution throughout the year. so as that has begun to happen, the guidance for both the third quarter and the full year are aligned.
terry tillman -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. just a final question and i'll turn it over is, i mean, on the glass-half full side here, olo pay sounds like an exciting opportunity. borderless came out with summer release, and that's great. what are you seeing in terms of the aspirational goal of four x kind of arpu lift? and how do you see this attach rate kind of playing out in that $2 million or so building into next year?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
yes, terry. this is noah. i'll take that one. so yes, borderless, we were excited to talk about borderless for the first time in february, and we sort of thought that it would happen at some point this year.
it was great to be able to get it out in pilot, with three pilots on july 5 and have now over a month of -- we're really encouraged by what we're seeing primarily around how many of the guests using borderless are creating accounts and are saving cards on file. i mentioned in the prepared remarks, that number is 76% of guests who are ordering through borderless or saving account file and saving a credit card on that account. and that is 2.5 times with a typical checkout looks like in a non-borderless scenario with statistically significant numbers. i mean this is a material number of accounts that have been created.
so that's very exciting. there is nothing that is required for us to see that four x lift in revenue per transaction. that's just the very nature of olo serving as both the order processor and the payment processor when we're the payment processor in the form of olo pay. so that's playing out exactly as we knew that it would.
and it's really exciting to see brands adopting olo pay and adopt borderless and seeing the wins for the guest experience and for more transactions actually manifesting through higher basket conversion rates and customers saving accounts on file and cards on file to speed through checkout the next time around. so highly encouraged by what we're seeing from those three pilots, borderless, olo pay brands, and excited to have more brands come on to the borderless form of pay through the end of the year.
terry tillman -- truist securities -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from matt hedberg with rbc capital markets. please proceed with your question.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great guys. thanks for taking my question. so follow-up on subway. so it sounds like, just to be clear, when you started the year, you assumed less subway contributions, and it seems like that is playing out.
and so i just maybe wanted to confirm that. but then i guess, the two follow-ups to that are -- can you help us think about -- i know you said a subway carries lower arpu than your corporate average. but just sort of any sort of rough idea of how much lower it is than your base? and second, how do you weigh the possibility of subway leaving? i know you said you don't think that's maybe likely, if i think i heard you say that correctly, but maybe just understand sort of the risks and the opportunities with subway?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes. so this is peter. i can take the first couple of questions there, matt. so in terms of how we factored subway into the year as we enter the year in sort of the relative arpu contribution.
so on a full year basis, subway contributed about a few million dollars of revenue on a full year basis. and what we had done during the year is really start to tail that off in the second quarter through the balance of the year, really as a hedge to some of the indications that we had heard as we entered the year. now in terms of their arpu contribution, it is -- i would say it's about one-thirds of kind of the platform average on a quarterly basis. and the reason why it is lower than the platform average is because they are a single module customer.
they subscribe only to the rails module. and as we disclosed at the end of last year, on average, customers subscribe to 2.7 modules per location. so the arpu tends to be much higher on multi-module locations, but that's sort of the thinking that went into planning the year and what that means from an arpu contribution.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
and matt, i'll jump in on the second part. so what i said in the prepared remarks was not that i didn't think that subway would taper off as peter just described, but rather that we didn't think that this was representative of a large -- so we continue to have a really great respect for the subway team and vice versa and to help with the subway team and really every restaurant brand that is representative of top 20 enterprise restaurant brands. this is a moment in time in these macroeconomic conditions where every dollar in the restaurants budget is being scrutinized and the wisdom of a saas platform that can enable a brand to repurpose its spend to have a higher purpose to really differentiated capabilities and use olo as a saas platform underneath is making a lot of sense to restaurant brands. we're hearing them say that we can do more of what we have in our digital position with the same digital budget by utilizing components of the olo platform, that's a great thing for us.
so i think that's why we feel there's a great opportunity for us with the top 20 restaurant brands that are out there. we feel like those are conversations that we'll continue to have, and we'll continue beating the drum about why we believe and why we think commonly across people are waking up to the philosophy that saas is superior to homegrown software.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. thanks a lot. super helpful. thanks.
operator
our next question comes from brent bracelin with piper sandler. please proceed with your question.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. and good afternoon. i had one for noah and a couple of follow-ups for peter. noah, obviously, the loss of subway here relative to the qsr space, it feels like a little bit of a step back.
and i was hoping if you could just weigh on the qsr opportunity. give us a kind of current state of affairs. what's the next largest qsr brand that you have beyond subway? and how are you generally looking at that market opportunity kind of going forward? love to get a current viewpoint on qsr.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
so brent, it's a great question. subway, i think if they're a qsr fast food shift or in some ways, sort of a fast casual concept. they don't typically have drive-through operations that tends to be kind of the hallmark of qsr brands. they do this wall and build sandwich and then pay at the end of the transaction.
so a little bit different than the way that most qsr brands work. but i think that your point more broadly is thinking about these large enterprise restaurant brands and what needs are and how our solutions kind of map to those needs. so i think we look at -- well, first, the answer that i just gave around why we believe that saas is superior to homegrown software and that all restaurant brands, no matter the size, can benefit from the platform that we've built and also from the platform innovations that we've built with 82,000 restaurants on the platform, which is more than any individual restaurant has in their portfolio. but also to the drive-thru operation, which is so important for qsr, these product innovations that i mentioned around geo-fencing and are plug in with flybuy by radius networks and radar to really speed up that handoff at drive-thru.
i think that's a really compelling new benefit of our solution for the qsr operators. if i look across our portfolio, i mean, we have a lot of qsr brands that we've welcomed just since our ipo. if you look at carl's jr. and hardee's, cke.
if you look at culver's, if you look at whataburger, i mean these are traditional qsr operators, and i think that's a big area of opportunity for us and is a really ripe area for us to go and penetrate in the coming quarters.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
helpful color there. and then just as a follow-up, peter, for you. i think you talked about 3,000 net adds in the quarter, 2,500 subway locations that obviously suggests there might be other restaurants here. so just trying to understand, did you see other restaurants churn beyond subway in the quarter? or is that just kind of rounding?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
that's just rounding. yes.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then i know you talked about subway being a few million dollars. i just wanted to dive into the guidance.
second half reduction is about $12 million -- a little over $12 million for the second half. and how much of that is -- would you attribute to kind of derisking subway here versus other macro factors, longing sales cycles? just trying to better understand a few million dollar contribution some subway and a $12 million guide down?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes. so sorry if i was a little confusing on that. so in terms of subway, nothing attributed to the evolving relationship with subway. again, that was something we had an indication of as we entered the year, factored that into the model and as subway has started to roll off the platform that is aligned with the underlying conservatism that we baked into the year as we set guidance back in february.
in terms of the two dynamics that are impacting the full year guide, it really is a healthy mix of both between elongating sales cycles and deployments taking longer than we anticipated when we walked into the year. in terms of sales cycles, there's really two underlying dynamics driving our year-to-date performance. so first, for deals that we've signed, many of the large deals happened really late into the second quarter, which means based on our standard deployment time line, revenue won't be recognized on those deals until sometime in 2023. and then for deals that did not close in the quarter, those conversations are ongoing and have been ongoing longer than our typical sales cycle.
so those two are pushing into 2023. as for deployments, now we walked into the year with a sufficient pipeline of activity to deploy, but the time to deploy projects really across all modules have elongated for the primary reasons that we talked about on our prepared remarks, constraints at the brand and operator level. and just to go a level deeper there, we have several brands, which in total represent several thousands of locations that are partially deployed. so they're at some stage of the deployment process.
and it is our practice that we don't announce brand deployments until we've reached a critical mass, until we've nearly deployed the entire franchisee network. that's when we typically announce the deployment. we have a number of brands again that are in the deployment process and making progress, but the progress has been much slower than we anticipated and much slower than we've historically done, which is what's creating some of that impact in the back half of the year.
operator
our next question comes from stephen sheldon with william blair. please proceed with your question.
patrick mcilwee -- william blair and company -- analyst
hey, this is patrick mcilwee on for stephen this evening. so aside from the moving pieces with subway, it seems like nrr took a nice step up this quarter. can you just talk a bit more about the dynamics at play there and how we might expect that to trend for the remainder of the year?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes. so this is consistent with what i believe we talked about on the last call, which is we anticipated nrr to improve throughout the year as multi-module adoption increased and transaction volumes increase throughout the year. and that's really what is sort of underlying that improvement in nrr. i think we'll continue to see some modest improvement as we go throughout the year and i think into 2023, presumably as olo pay becomes a larger portion of the mix that will help to grow nrr over time.
but again, what you're seeing there is consistent with what we anticipated as we entered the quarter.
patrick mcilwee -- william blair and company -- analyst
got it. ok. and then can you just give us an update on how the cross-sell of wisely has been since you've plugged that in and what the reception has been like there?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
yes. this is noah. so this has been a really successful cross-sell motion. we're excited about how brands are seeing the next logical step in getting great addition -- being around guest engagement and specifically having a first-rate guest data platform where they can really measure guest lifetime value of all of their guests.
so we announced a couple of the new brands to come on to the guest -- suite. we also announced olo -- the brands that are coming on to the host suite, which is managing table wait and wait list and reservation. i think across the board, we're really pleased with the fit that we're seeing between, but wisely brought to our solution set and what our restaurant customers are looking for as they're seeking to really engage with their guests in a direct manner and increase the hospitality they can offer and so doing increased guest lifetime value?
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from brad reback with stifel. please proceed with your question.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thanks very much. peter, can you give us some sense on active locations or active vending locations for 3q and the year just to try to level set, so we're all on the same page?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes. so what's implied in the guide, brad, is adding an incremental 2,000 locations per quarter between now and the balance of the year. as we noted on the call, we anticipate subway to fully roll off in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of next year. now the nuance there is with respect to subway or in general, we count a location active in the quarter if they've had an order in the quarter.
so to the extent subway starts to roll off in q4, but generates an order at some point in the quarter will count those active locations. and then in the first quarter is where you'll see the full impact of subway rolling off the platform.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. so that's 2,000 net, not growth, right?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
that is 2,000 net. that's correct.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. that's great. switching gears, i don't know for you or for noah. given that subway's sort of been an ongoing thing for you guys for a couple of quarters here, are there any other large brands out there that are having similar discussions or where you feel there's the risk that they may terminate? thanks.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
hey, brad. this is noah. so no, we truly believe that subway is -- and we believe that because subway has this global proprietary point-of-sale and digital ordering platform, all built in-house. it's consistent around the globe.
and they were only using olo for the rails module. so they're in a unique position to have leverage with marketplaces to have that direct integration conversation with them. that puts them in a very place in any brand. typically, we have restaurant brand customers at the end of last year on 2.7 product modules of olo's and the more product modules that they're on, the more mission critical, we believe, with that are and the more value that we're generating.
so i think you should think of subway as an anomaly in this case and not just in our restaurant customer population really in the restaurant industry itself.
operator
[operator instructions] there are no further questions at this time. i would like to turn the floor back over to noah glass for any closing comments.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer

with that, let me turn the call over to noah. 
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
thank you, stephanie. hi, everyone. thank you for spending time with us today. we're proud of our third quarter results.
we generated $47.3 million in total revenue, a 26% increase year over year, as our platform supported increased module adoption within our existing customer base, increased transaction volumes, and continued growth in new locations. we increased average revenue per unit, or arpu, to $558, up 15% year over year and 3% sequentially, and deployed roughly 2,000 new locations to the platform, with ending active locations increasing 11% year over year and 2% sequentially to approximately 84,000. the olo platform is purpose-built to help our customers do more with less and create a differentiated and memorable guest experience. and as restaurant executives and operator conversations increasingly focus on sales and margin maintenance due to challenges related to increased inflation, supply chain constraints, and labor dynamics, we believe that olo's platform is best positioned to meet restaurants' needs.
in particular, this quarter's customer deployment, partnership announcements, and product enhancements are representative of this belief, that technology is instrumental in enabling restaurants to be more operationally efficient while enhancing the guest experience. we're honored to play this role in the $1 trillion and growing restaurant industry. olo's ability to address this massive market opportunity is a function of increasing arpu through further multi-module adoption and continued growth in transaction volume, as well as adding more locations to the platform. and we're happy to report continued momentum across all of these key drivers.
specific to our ability to expand arpu, we broadened our relationship with jack in the box, a top 25 quick-service restaurant, or qsr, brand with more than 2,200 locations. we initially supported jack in the box with our dispatch module, enabling direct delivery at scale. more recently, we deployed our ordering module, replacing their homegrown solution. we're excited about this expanded partnership as it reflects our ability to expand within our existing customer base, even when ordering is not the lead module.
importantly, this expanded partnership also reflects our ability to support the industry's largest brands and largest segment, qsr. other examples of expanded relationships within brands this quarter include bj's restaurants and brewhouse, as well as wetzel's pretzels, adding dispatch and olo pay, in addition to our ordering, rails, and network modules. a number of existing brands, such as ihop and krystal, adding virtual restaurants to their existing ordering, dispatch, and rails modules; and brands such as another broken egg cafe and capriotti's adopting our guest engagement and our front-of-house solutions in addition to their existing ordering, dispatch, and/or rail modules. our existing customer base presents a sizable opportunity to expand arpu by providing additional solutions to improve our customers' operations and delight guests, as brands on average utilize 2.7 out of 12 modules on a per-location basis at the end of 2021.
at the same time, on-premise solutions unlock additional arpu expansion opportunities. momentum in this area continues, with more than 50 brands in over 1,000 locations processing on-premise digital orders through olo. we believe this is the beginning of a larger trend whereby restaurants will process 100% of their orders digitally through the olo platform. furthermore, when restaurants pair on-premise solutions with olo pay, they're able to realize the incremental value of utilizing one single digital platform, driving a better experience for their guests and staff.
as we've already seen at brands like nando's, with their adoption of qr-code ordering and olo pay. we believe, if restaurants utilize olo pay and the olo platform to process 100% of their orders, that arpu has the potential to increase by 25x. another exciting trend that continued this quarter relates to enterprise brands, replacing legacy technology partners and implementing olo solutions. this quarter, we welcomed smashburger, a rapidly growing, fast-casual concept with more than 200 locations; ruby tuesday, a casual dining concept with more than 200 locations; and zaxby's, a fast casual concept with more than 900 locations to the platform.
all three enterprise brands selected olo to replace their legacy technology providers through the adoption of our ordering, dispatch, and rails modules. the implementation of olo as their consolidated digital commerce solution allows each brand to provide a highly customized and personalized digital program to their guests while increasing operational efficiencies. over the last two years, we've proven through many instances that investing in an enterprise-grade saas platform is a compelling alternative to building in-house. that means a fundamentally superior platform, lower cost, faster time to market, tapping into platform best practices, leveraging a large partner and customer ecosystem, and harnessing platform-level innovation.
names such as papa murphy's, potbelly, and now jack in the box, ruby tuesday, and smashburger, and zaxby's, further affirm our long-held conviction that saas is a better alternative to homegrown solutions. we've also continued to successfully deploy our solutions within the emerging enterprise segment. this quarter, we welcomed names such as grimaldi's and jinya ramen bar to the platform, as they adopted the full stack of olo solutions, which included order management, delivery enablement, guest engagement, front-of-house, and olo pay. throughout the year, we've seen an increasing number of emerging enterprise new logos adopt multiple modules from the onset of our relationship, inclusive of olo pay.
we believe this trend will continue and further drive arpu. also, this quarter, we deployed our ordering, dispatch, and rails modules at convenience stores or c-stores. two examples include maverik adventure's first stop, an intermountain west operator with nearly 400 stores across 12 states; and second, an east coast operator with more than 200 locations. with olo solutions, guests of these c-stores are now able to order fresh food for pickup or through delivery.
as i've mentioned in the past, c-stores are an exciting emerging vertical for olo, given their 55,000 location opportunity representing c-stores with fresh food programs. we also continue to grow our partner network this quarter, which enables our customers to leverage our platform to tap into best-in-class applications and services that are fully integrated into olo. our open platform provides restaurants with access to more than 300 technology providers, significantly more integrations than many other platforms. this quarter, we added technology partners in both autonomous and piloted delivery, as well as voice artificial intelligence, or ai.
we're excited to offer these cutting-edge technologies to our customers. more specifically, olo dispatch network now offers autonomous and piloted delivery robots through partnerships with certified delivery providers, coco delivery, refraction ai, and serve robotics. last-mile delivery is oftentimes the most complicated and costly aspect of the delivery experience, on average, accounting for 40% of the total cost of delivery. through these partnerships, we enable brands, such as modern market and newk's eatery, to empower automated last-mile delivery in specific markets, lowering transportation costs through automation while decreasing pollution.
we've also introduced partnerships with voice ai ordering solution providers, conversenow, sync 3 and valyant ai. these partners provide premier ordering automation technology, facilitating the seamless placement of guest orders at the drive-thru and enhancing the guest experience through shorter drive through lines. for operators, these partners increase average ticket size and alleviate labor shortages by allowing staff resources to focus on food prep, order fulfillment, and guest services. panda express, a top 25 brand with more than 2,400 locations, leverages voice ai technology partners to transform the drive-thru, leading to an enhanced digital experience while paving the path to 100% digital.
we believe unique solutions like voice ordering will enable olo to expand further into the qsr segment, as well as increase our penetration of digital orders in the space. notably, the conversion of drive-thru to digital doesn't require consumer behavior change. operators make the decision to enable digital in drive-thru, converting all orders from analog to digital through voice ai. this represents an exciting leap in the digital transformation of the drive-thru service model that represents the plurality of restaurant industry transactions, over four times larger than delivery.
we also continue to implement product enhancements to better serve our customers, many of which we showcased in our quarterly public release event held last month. in particular, at the end of october, we announced commercial availability of borderless, olo's password-less and platform-level sign-on offering. with borderless, guests can save and access their own file payment information, along with contact information and delivery addresses across all participating restaurant brands, securely speeding through checkout. by eliminating the need for guests to create an account, remember a password, or manually enter payment details at every purchase, borderless strives to help restaurants meaningfully increase basket conversion, retention, and visit frequency, driving increased revenue and profitability.
borderless also aims to enable brands to capture valuable guest data on more orders that were previously anonymous, adding new guests and ordered data to their guest data platform, in the industry's race to de-anonymize every order and uncover guest lifetime value. as our latest platform-level innovation, we believe borderless is the next step to improving the on-demand commerce experience, empowering brands to capture valuable guest data while delivering superior hospitality through added convenience. and we're excited by the opportunity for borderless functionality to transform the sign-on and checkout experience for guests, unlocking additional revenue opportunities for restaurants and olo. additionally, this past quarter, we introduced new capacity management capabilities across our order management solutions.
as off-premise volumes increased dramatically during the pandemic, and as labor challenges persist, it's imperative that operators effectively manage kitchen order flow in order to ensure smooth operations in the kitchen, accurate order, handoff or delivery service providers, and properly set guest expectations. this became a key problem for our customers that we believe olo is best positioned to solve. through our acquisition of omnivore earlier this year and by integrating with kitchen display systems, or kds, data, our platform can now capture crucial on-premise information. now, restaurants are able to provide more accurate quote times to guests and delivery service provider partners for when orders will be ready for handoff.
noodles & company, a fast casual brand with more than 400 locations, is one customer enrolled to pilot this feature. by providing more accurate quote information, olo enables brands to be as productive as possible and as profitable as possible, all while elevating the guest experience. this is a win-win-win scenario for our partners, our customers, and their guests, as well as a win for olo, as our platform becomes an essential integrated layer in our customer's everyday operations. these product features play an important part in improving the guest experience and empowering restaurant teams to provide hospitality through optimized operations and personalization.
i'm proud of the tools we provide our restaurant customers and the continuous hard work the olo team does in order to help our customers do more with less. and i'm honored that the industry recognizes our hard work. recently, we earned vendor of the year award by fast casual brands, cousin subs, as well as noodles & company. over the last two years, we've dramatically expanded our core value proposition.
olo's platform now provides a modular end-to-end restaurant technology offering that encompasses all guest touchpoints: on-premise, off-premise, guest engagement, and payments. we're laser-focused on providing and delivering these solutions to enterprise and emerging enterprise brands, and we're working to ensure that we're aligned from a go-to-market perspective to fully capitalize on our broader opportunity. as we think about our future potential, we continue to believe that arpu expansion will be the most meaningful driver of growth and the best measure of our success. we expect product adoption to increase across brands as we become an essential layer that aligns customers with olo's vision of enabling hospitality at scale and empowering restaurants to operate as one business.
and finally, as i typically do on earnings calls, i'd like to provide a corporate update. we recently debuted our updated corporate website at olo.com, which showcases the platform's modular end-to-end restaurant technology offering that encompasses all guest touchpoints. we also published a refreshed page for our partner program, olo connect, which includes a tiered partner directory of our expansive technology partners. additionally, we published our first environmental, social, and governance, or esg, site.
this site takes a big step toward our esg disclosure efforts by publishing our environmental and social initiatives and aspirations. we believe the future of hospitality is sustainable. we hold ourselves accountable to managing the impacts that our material topics impose on our company, stakeholders, and planet. our ongoing esg strategy development will harness opportunities to enrich our social impacts and lessen our environmental impacts, while centering on strong corporate governance and ethics.
to close, i'm excited about our future. the olo platform provides restaurants with mission-critical tools that drive value, allowing brands to do more with less while elevating the guests experience. we believe that olo's platform is best positioned to meet restaurants needs and drive growth. we're focused on executing to create positive outcomes for our customers, partners, and shareholders.
and with that, i'll hand it over to peter to discuss more detailed results. peter?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
thanks, noah. today, i'll review our third quarter results in detail, as well as provide guidance for the remainder of the year. in the third quarter, total revenue was $47.3 million, an increase of 26% year over year. platform revenue in the third quarter was $46.4 million, an increase of 28% year over year.
in terms of key metrics, arpu for the third quarter was approximately $558, representing a 15% increase year over year and a 3% increase sequentially. continued growth in arpu was driven by further expansion within our existing customer base, including continued adoption of olo pay. year over year, the impact from subway locations transitioning from the platform positively impacted arpu by approximately $25. as a reminder, subway is a single-module customer with significantly lower arpu than the average.
so, as locations transition from the platform, this will have a positive impact on arpu. as noah mentioned earlier, we expect arpu to continue to expand and be a meaningful driver of growth as we further increase multi-product adoption and transaction volumes on the platform. we believe we have a 25x opportunity to expand our booth from its current levels in the early momentum we are seeing with olo pay and guest engagement adoption, as well as on-premise ordering trends, gives us conviction in being able to significantly expand arpu over time. in terms of active locations, we ended the quarter with approximately 84,000 active locations on the platform, an 11% increase year over year and a 2% increase sequentially.
this number was in line with expectations, as subway locations held constant over the quarter and as we continue to actively work to alleviate elongated deployment timelines, which we discussed last quarter. and lastly, net revenue retention was approximately 107%, up 100 basis points sequentially. for the remainder of the financial metrics disclosed, unless otherwise noted, i'll be referencing non-gaap financial measures. gross profit for the third quarter was $34.7 million.
this compares to $30.2 million a year ago. the year-over-year increase in gross profit was driven by continued growth in revenue, partially offset by incremental costs associated with our wisely and omnivore acquisitions, increased compensation costs to support new locations coming onto the platform and, to a lesser extent, processing costs associated with olo pay. sales and marketing expense for the third quarter was $6.1 million or 13% of total revenue. this compares to $4.2 million and 11% a year ago.
over the past year, we have significantly increased our product portfolio and, in the near term, plan to continue to invest in our go-to-market team to fully capitalize on the growth opportunities we have within new and existing customers. research and development expense for the third quarter was $15.4 million or 33% of total revenue, compared to $11.9 million or 32% of total revenue a year ago. general and administrative expense for the third quarter was $10.3 million or 22% of total revenue. this compared to $9 million and 24% a year ago.
the year-over-year percentage decline was due to continued optimization of expenses within g&a as initial cost to support olo as a public company continue to scale. operating income for the third quarter was $3 million compared to $5.1 million a year ago. net income in the third quarter was $4.3 million, or $0.02 per share, based on approximately 181.9 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. turning our attention to the balance sheet and cash flow statement.
our cash, cash equivalents, and short- and long-term investments totaled $469.2 million as of september 30, 2022. this quarter, there were no impacts from the $100 million stock buyback program we announced in september, as we did not initiate share repurchase activity before the quarter ended. regarding cash flows, net cash provided by operating activities was $3.3 million in the quarter as compared to $10.7 million a year ago. free cash flow was $1.4 million compared to $10.2 million a year ago.
i'll wrap up by providing our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $48.2 million and $48.7 million and non-gaap operating income in the range of $2.6 million and $3 million. for the fiscal year 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $183.8 million and $184.3 million and non-gaap operating income in the range of $9.3 million and $9.7 million. in terms of guidance, our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year is consistent with the assumptions we discussed last quarter.
elongated sales cycles and deployment timelines have continued. and while we have a robust pipeline and are actively working to speed up deployment, we anticipate these dynamics to continue in the near term. secondly, we remain committed to driving profitable growth. inclusive of this past quarter's operating income outperformance, we are targeting slightly higher profitability in the second half of 2022 as compared to last quarter's guidance.
as we've exhibited all throughout all of this history, we are a financially disciplined organization and plan to continue to maintain this operating principle going forward. and lastly, in the fourth quarter, we entered into a sublease for our headquarters at one world trade center. as we continue to embrace a hybrid work environment, we plan to reinvest some related savings into an exciting and more fitting new york-based headquarters, as well as initiate other remote employee engagement activities. to summarize, we continue to deliver an attractive combination of strong revenue growth and profitability as we take meaningful strides toward becoming the engine of hospitality.
we believe we have a long runway for growth through cross-selling our robust and comprehensive product suite, expanding the use cases of the platform, and continuing to add locations to the platform. with that, i'd now like to turn it over to the operator to begin the q&a session. operator?

[operator instructions] my first question comes from gabriella borges with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
gabriela borges -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. thanks for taking the question. maybe to start, i'd love to get an update on some of the catalyst points or trigger points for relationships like jack in the box, where you're seeing really nice product module expansion.
you know, the issues that you talked about, the supply chain, the labor shortages, they've persisted for a handful of quarters now. so, we'd love to get an update. what are you seeing in terms of commonalities of trigger points that are leading to expansion within the olo platform?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
well, gabriela, thank you for the question, and welcome to the group. i'd say, you know, with jack in the box, and maybe extrapolating beyond jack in the box specifically, you know, we've seen great engagement from these large restaurant brands in the enterprise segment, from qsr brands specifically. and it's really about how they want to engage with guests. i think the digital transformation of the industry is something that is permeating every segment of the industry.
so, it has become a guest expectation and it's operator table stakes. it's about, as you heard from our prepared remarks, better productivity, better profitability, and up-leveling the guest experience. so, we see a lot of these brands, jack in the box among them, saying, you know, ""we had a homegrown solution, but we see that there are benefits in engaging with this saas platform, like olo."" and not so much a buy versus build. but more of a buy and build, to buy into the platform and then to build on top of it, and in the case of jack in the box with a third-party agency doing some of the esthetic on top of the olo engine.
so, i think that's sort of a natural progression. in the past we have landed with a single module in some of these relationships, proven ourselves out, shown the benefits of platform-level innovation, and all that olo can do. and then introduce brands to the other modules. there are 12 in total now.
and so, going from dispatch into dispatch and also ordering is a very natural progression and growth of the relationship. and we're excited to have the ability to land with one module and then expand into a larger suite of capabilities for all restaurant brands.
gabriela borges -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's helpful. and as a follow up for peter, i wanted to pick up on your comments on profitability and balancing the investments that you're making in the opportunity that lies ahead. when do you think we might see a more pronounced inflection in profitability in the model as we think about internal planning assumptions for 2023 and beyond?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yeah. thank you for the question, gabriel. so, in terms of profitability trends, i think at this point, you know, what we've shared is that we remain committed to maintaining profitability while delivering strong growth. and we believe we can do that because, one, just the core dna of olo and the discipline we have in terms of financial management.
i think we've shown that over our history, burning less than $6 million in total investment to reach $100 million of arr. that discipline, coupled with our highly efficient go-to-market in support motion, enables us to drive profitability and growth at the same time. you know, as we look ahead for 2023 and beyond, we believe that we can continue to do that in terms of driving profitable growth and attractive growth for the long term.
gabriela borges -- goldman sachs -- analyst
and so, just to put a finer point on that, do you think 2023 will be a year of margin expansion?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think look, i think there's, you know, a lot that's happening in real time as it relates to both the top line and the bottom line. what i will say is that, you know, where we stand today, we are, you know, highly focused on making sure that we are allocating capital to the parts of the business that we believe will drive the greatest long term-value for our shareholders and long-term growth and, in doing that, maintaining profitability.
gabriela borges -- goldman sachs -- analyst

our next question comes from terry tillman with truist. please go ahead.
terry tillman -- truist securities -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, noah, peter, and stephanie. first, i just want zaxby's. they're all throughout atlanta, so that's nice to see. i'll be sure to find out how those -- that experience is firsthand.
maybe the first question for you, noah, is just -- you know, when we talked to investors in the past, it's like, how big is this tam? is there a low ceiling and high ceiling, etc., because it's just online ordering? we're now hearing you talk about digital entirety and on-premise over a number of quarters. i think you said 50 brands, 1,000 locations. so, i'm kind of curious, where do you see like revenue now? where does that stand in terms of on-premise dynamic?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
[audio gap] the transactional saas model are built. just back to your tam comment for a moment, and then i'll pass it over to peter to see if he wants to add on to that. we really think that no matter how you look at it, we are in the very, very early innings of penetrating our tam. we are well below 2% of the addressable tam that's out there in the segment that we serve.
and i think we look at these drivers of growth, arpu being the biggest one, and of course, moving on premise is part of capturing more transactions. olo pay is another part of making each one of those transactions a higher revenue event for olo. and we think that that's the largest part of the tam expansion or the revenue expansion into that tam. there's location growth as well.
and i'm proud also that, you know, we have in dairy queen and in jimmy john's and in panda express and jack in the box some great top 25 brands and are showing our expanded opportunity to work with those brands as well and to really add value regardless of the scale of the restaurant enterprise. and then, peter, i'll pass it over to you in case you want to double down on some of the economics of on premise.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yeah. so terry, just to answer your question on where the on-premise transaction volumes will appear within the financials. it has the potential to appear both in subscription and transaction. so, in terms of subscription, by having more orders processed over the platform, that will then graduate customers into higher-priced subscription packages.
so, that will help to drive subscription revenue. and to the extent that customer is utilizing olo pay, that will help to drive transaction revenue because of the associated processing fees with olo pay.
terry tillman -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. that's wonderful. thank you both for the answer there. i guess, peter, just a quick follow up in terms of anything you can share at all about how visibility is into 2023 compared to how visibility was going into '22? i know, obviously, we have the macro.
but the way i'd like to kind of add to that big picture question i just asked, which is probably a hard question is, are you seeing the revenue come in as you expected for olo pay? i think you said up to a couple million now. and i think customer engagement was going to do about 10 million. so, maybe you could talk about how they're performing and just any comments about visibility going into '23? thank you.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, we've been pleased with the progress across both olo pay and guest engagement. so, specific to olo pay, this past quarter, we generated just under $2 million of revenue associated with olo pay. and for the year, we're now estimating $5 million of revenue contribution.
so, great momentum there. i think part of the momentum that you're seeing with respect to olo pay is, you know, brands and operators prioritizing deployment of products that are a relatively light lift to deploy and also provide very fast time to value. and that is the case with olo pay. it's a light-touch deployment, and the time to value is immediate.
and i think part of that prioritization by brands and operators is due to that continued labor -- you know, dynamic labor challenges that we've discussed prior calls. in terms of 2023, so, you know, obviously, it's still a little early. there's a lot that's happening in real time. i think where we stand today, we are planning as though the sales and deployment dynamics continue into 2023.
but that said, i think despite, you know, the macro challenges, i think there's a lot of reasons to remain excited about the go-forward. so, i think, first off, our sales pipeline for both new business and upsells remains robust. and we anticipate that's going to continue as brands continue to look to do more with less and leverage digital to increase sales and improve margins. secondly, food away from home and digital ordering in general has remained durable.
and that is in part because food is not discretionary. everyone must eat. and you're seeing that across a variety of data points within the industry. and then, lastly, i think our enterprise focus in the market share we have within the limited service segment, i think, provides some additional resiliency as we head into 2023.
so, certainly still a lot going on at the moment, but, you know, a lot of positives to remain excited about the go-forward.
terry tillman -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from stephen sheldon with william blair. please go ahead.
stephen sheldon -- william blair -- analyst
hey. thank you. first one i'd ask about just the longer sales cycles. i know that's happening for a lot of enterprise saas companies, and you still had plenty of wins this quarter.
but what do you think is specifically driving the delay in decision-making here? or are a lot of the enterprise restaurant concepts that, you know, you're kind of going after, they're just distracted with a variety of other issues? and what do you think it could take for those cycles to more or less normalize?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
hey, stephen. this is noah. thanks for the question. i think, you know, we are being prudent as we look at this quarter and think about the near term.
we are sort of staying consistent with what we guided to last quarter. at the same time, i think there is some light at the end of the tunnel. there are some of those dynamics that are causing restaurant brands or that were causing restaurant brands to be a little bit slower to make decisions or to implement those decisions that are normalizing. so, there are things like wholesale food prices that are starting to come in.
there are things like the labor environment starting to tick back up, not quite yet at pre-pandemic levels but getting closer to it. and so, you know, i think we're being prudent. we're being financially responsible in the way that we're modeling and the way that we're planning. but i think that, you know, what is abundantly clear, as we look at all those business, as we think about the current macro as something that is kind of a temporary crosswind, and i think -- you know, we've seen moments in time like this in our history, 2008, 2009.
i would contrast that with the digital transformation of this $1 trillion restaurant industry. that is a mighty and persistent tailwind that's been at our back for 17 years and will be at our back for many, many years to come, especially as restaurant brands are looking to lean into digital transformation for the very reasons that peter just mentioned, getting more productive, getting more profitable, and at the same time, upleveling the guest experience.
stephen sheldon -- william blair -- analyst
got it. that's really helpful. and then, as a follow-up, just as we model active locations for the fourth quarter, can you just help us frame the moving pieces on locations, especially with subway continuing to roll off. i think you'd talked before about that being progressive in the fourth quarter and potentially in the early 2023.
is that still the right expectation for those remaining locations, just given the visibility you have right now?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yeah, that's right. so, consistent with what we shared last quarter, we are targeting 2,000 net new locations in the fourth quarter. specific to subway, the way in which we count an active location for rails is a location having had at least one order in the period. so, even as remaining locations begin to off-board this quarter into early q1 of next year, they'll show up in the active location count, having generated at least one order in the period.
so, we'll be -- we'll just make sure to be very clear on how that is evolving throughout the quarter and into early next year.
stephen sheldon -- william blair -- analyst
sounds good. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from matthew hedberg with rbc. please go ahead.
matthew hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great, thanks guys. following up on the question on sales cycles, noah, i know last quarter you talked about a little bit different implementation headwinds, tailwinds between corporate-owned and franchisee-owned restaurants. i'm wondering if there's anything that changed in the dynamic of those two restaurant styles, i guess. and then maybe as a follow-up, diego's been on now for a few months as cro.
you know, i guess from that perspective, are there things that you guys are doing specific that could counter -- that could cut through macros and maybe it's something he's implemented thus far?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
hey, matt. thanks for the two questions. i would say, nothing pronounced as a difference between corporate-owned brands. those are pretty rare.
those brands that have all corporate locations. most of the industry, whether we're talking about enterprise or emerging enterprise, are a smattering of corporate stores but primarily franchisee locations. and last quarter, we mentioned some of the efforts that we were taking, making things easier on the restaurant brands to do the implementation themselves, to do the deployment themselves, also using third parties to do deployments, you know, as an augmentation for the restaurant brand. and then -- although taking on more of the work.
and i think, when i talk about these deployments that we're celebrating this quarter, take one, take jack in the box of rolling out to 2,200 locations, that is deploying to 2,200 locations in a highly franchised environment. i think it's showing how those efforts that we're making are helping to get brands that have been sold and are showing up in bookings actually deployed and live on the platform for their operators' benefit and for the guest benefit and, obviously, for olo's benefit. when i think about diego and some of the things that he's focused on in the role of chief revenue officer, it really aligns with our commentary around the growth drivers of the business. so, we are very focused on arpu as a huge driver of growth.
and that is about selling additional modules into existing restaurant customers who are asking us to play a larger role because we're a mission-critical platform, and we've become something of a digital transformation area [inaudible] to these brands. so, they're asking us to do more with them. and we now have a lot more to offer because of our great product r&d and the m&a activities that have added new modules into our platform. so, we're focused on that.
we're focused on selling in olo pay, selling in guest engagement, and, of course, we're still focused, very focused on landing additional restaurant brands from the enterprise segment and the emerging enterprise segments. i'd say, you know, we are rightsizing our investments to go after all of those opportunities and believe that we have so much room to grow and a huge tam to grow into under diego's leadership.
matthew hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks, noah. i really appreciate the color.
operator
our next question comes from brent bracelin with piper sandler. please go ahead.
clarke jeffries -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi. this is clarke jeffries on for brent. first question is around arpu growth. you know, 3% sequential growth in arpu certainly looks healthy.
just wondering maybe peter, what kind of arpu growth do you think you can achieve either based on the olo pay rollout or multiple software module rollout? do you think it could be sustainable at these kinds of levels for sequential arpu growth? and then, you know, maybe second on that, you know, reaching a point where there are now 12 modules to sell. from a philosophy perspective, from a growing efficiently perspective, do you think you might change to preference more overall arr or total contract value added at a lower gross edition level, as in more multi-module lands and that growth additions could take a backseat to the growth model over the, you know, next 12 months to 18 months?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yeah, so in terms of the arpu sequential growth trend, i think, if you go back in time, i think the growth has been from a trend-line perspective lumpy at times. and part of that is because of how products are deployed, as well as the number of products that are subscribed to from the onset of the relationship. so, depending on, even if a customer subscribes to say three products at the onset of the relationship, they may roll out one at one time and then the second and third at a subsequent time, which would make the trend line a bit smoother versus some customers deploying all three modules right from the onset. the way i would think about the long-term kind of growth rate or growth potential for arpu is really through that 25x opportunity lens.
and that is really by driving more transactions on the platform, as well as increasing the adoption of olo pay. so, looking at the arpu from where it stands today on a quarterly basis, having a 25x opportunity to expand that number over time. and then, if i'm -- in terms of your second question, if i'm understanding that right, i think the question is around the ability to expand arpu over time if more and more customers are landing with more products at the onset of the relationship. i would say we're -- we've seen more of that in the emerging segment of the business, which we noted on the call, where, oftentimes, that segment of the market is coming to us.
and they're wanting us to solve a number of pain points from the onset of the relationship. so, they're typically taking order management, delivery enablement, and now, more recently, olo pay. i think that, obviously, you know, presents some challenges to further expand arpu when you're taking everything upfront. but i think we would, obviously, enjoy that problem in being able to have a higher arpu from the onset of the relationship.
clarke jeffries -- piper sandler -- analyst
makes sense. and i think i had a follow-up related to it. seems like a lot of the enterprise lens you've noted this quarter were relationships that took more of the modules upfront instead of just ordering. but, noah, i wanted to ask about how do you view the industry changing around proprietary versus legacy replacement? maybe you can help us frame the sort of portion of engagements where you're going in and replacing proprietary versus a legacy solution.
it seems like the jack in the box deal was very much based on your competency in integrating with the proprietary. so, i'd love to just get your thoughts on how that's evolved over the history of the company and where you sit today.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
well, clarke, thank you. i think that's usually up for an important point, which is that the trend has certainly been that brands are migrating from homegrown to olo. and if i just think about the time, really, over the last 18 months since our ipo, there are 10 sizable brands that have made that transition. carl's junior, carrabba's italian grill, hardee's, jack in the box, outback, potbelly, ruby tuesday, smashburger, tgi friday's, and, now, zaxby's.
and i think this is exactly what we were hoping to see by becoming a public story, by brands seeing the strength of olo's business, the strength of olo's balance sheet, hearing our philosophical commitment to being an independent and open platform, and then seeing some of the platform-level innovation that we've been able to bring to life. first in dispatch, that in rails, most recently in borderless. i want to come back to that in a moment. these are things that brands can't build themselves.
they are things that you can build once you've built a two-sided network of many brands on one side and many partners on the other. if i think about borderless as the extreme example of this point, this is a two-sided network that we've created that connects the 84,000 restaurants on our platform. and for those of you who don't know the industry super well, 84,000 restaurants is very large. take every mcdonald's in the united states.
it is six times every mcdonald's in the united states, the number of locations. and it connects those to 85 million restaurant guests that order through olo. that's more than the entire population of germany. olo is then serving as the conduit between those restaurants and those restaurant guests and creating a win-win, a better experience for those restaurant operators and for those restaurant guests who no longer have to create an account, remember a password, reenter payment details.
they have a better, faster experience. and it leads to those restaurant brands getting more of that guest data into their guest data platform, which is really the holy grail. this is what restaurants are looking for, ways in which they can get guest data into their guest data platform, de-anonymize transactions, and tie every transaction back to a guest account so they can unlock and uncover the guest lifetime value. and i think that's something that olo is uniquely able to do and really where the industry is headed.
and so, i think when you compare that to just the tactical building of functionality for on-demand commerce, it just -- there's no comparison to what we're able to build as a platform serving the industry as a whole.
clarke jeffries -- piper sandler -- analyst
really appreciate the color. thank you very much.

noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
thank you, stephanie. hi, everyone. thank you for spending time with us today. we're proud of our third quarter results.
we generated $47.3 million in total revenue, a 26% increase year over year, as our platform supported increased module adoption within our existing customer base, increased transaction volumes, and continued growth in new locations. we increased average revenue per unit, or arpu, to $558, up 15% year over year and 3% sequentially, and deployed roughly 2,000 new locations to the platform, with ending active locations increasing 11% year over year and 2% sequentially to approximately 84,000. the olo platform is purpose-built to help our customers do more with less and create a differentiated and memorable guest experience. and as restaurant executives and operator conversations increasingly focus on sales and margin maintenance due to challenges related to increased inflation, supply chain constraints, and labor dynamics, we believe that olo's platform is best positioned to meet restaurants' needs.
in particular, this quarter's customer deployment, partnership announcements, and product enhancements are representative of this belief, that technology is instrumental in enabling restaurants to be more operationally efficient while enhancing the guest experience. we're honored to play this role in the $1 trillion and growing restaurant industry. olo's ability to address this massive market opportunity is a function of increasing arpu through further multi-module adoption and continued growth in transaction volume, as well as adding more locations to the platform. and we're happy to report continued momentum across all of these key drivers.
specific to our ability to expand arpu, we broadened our relationship with jack in the box, a top 25 quick-service restaurant, or qsr, brand with more than 2,200 locations. we initially supported jack in the box with our dispatch module, enabling direct delivery at scale. more recently, we deployed our ordering module, replacing their homegrown solution. we're excited about this expanded partnership as it reflects our ability to expand within our existing customer base, even when ordering is not the lead module.
importantly, this expanded partnership also reflects our ability to support the industry's largest brands and largest segment, qsr. other examples of expanded relationships within brands this quarter include bj's restaurants and brewhouse, as well as wetzel's pretzels, adding dispatch and olo pay, in addition to our ordering, rails, and network modules. a number of existing brands, such as ihop and krystal, adding virtual restaurants to their existing ordering, dispatch, and rails modules; and brands such as another broken egg cafe and capriotti's adopting our guest engagement and our front-of-house solutions in addition to their existing ordering, dispatch, and/or rail modules. our existing customer base presents a sizable opportunity to expand arpu by providing additional solutions to improve our customers' operations and delight guests, as brands on average utilize 2.7 out of 12 modules on a per-location basis at the end of 2021.
at the same time, on-premise solutions unlock additional arpu expansion opportunities. momentum in this area continues, with more than 50 brands in over 1,000 locations processing on-premise digital orders through olo. we believe this is the beginning of a larger trend whereby restaurants will process 100% of their orders digitally through the olo platform. furthermore, when restaurants pair on-premise solutions with olo pay, they're able to realize the incremental value of utilizing one single digital platform, driving a better experience for their guests and staff.
as we've already seen at brands like nando's, with their adoption of qr-code ordering and olo pay. we believe, if restaurants utilize olo pay and the olo platform to process 100% of their orders, that arpu has the potential to increase by 25x. another exciting trend that continued this quarter relates to enterprise brands, replacing legacy technology partners and implementing olo solutions. this quarter, we welcomed smashburger, a rapidly growing, fast-casual concept with more than 200 locations; ruby tuesday, a casual dining concept with more than 200 locations; and zaxby's, a fast casual concept with more than 900 locations to the platform.
all three enterprise brands selected olo to replace their legacy technology providers through the adoption of our ordering, dispatch, and rails modules. the implementation of olo as their consolidated digital commerce solution allows each brand to provide a highly customized and personalized digital program to their guests while increasing operational efficiencies. over the last two years, we've proven through many instances that investing in an enterprise-grade saas platform is a compelling alternative to building in-house. that means a fundamentally superior platform, lower cost, faster time to market, tapping into platform best practices, leveraging a large partner and customer ecosystem, and harnessing platform-level innovation.
names such as papa murphy's, potbelly, and now jack in the box, ruby tuesday, and smashburger, and zaxby's, further affirm our long-held conviction that saas is a better alternative to homegrown solutions. we've also continued to successfully deploy our solutions within the emerging enterprise segment. this quarter, we welcomed names such as grimaldi's and jinya ramen bar to the platform, as they adopted the full stack of olo solutions, which included order management, delivery enablement, guest engagement, front-of-house, and olo pay. throughout the year, we've seen an increasing number of emerging enterprise new logos adopt multiple modules from the onset of our relationship, inclusive of olo pay.
we believe this trend will continue and further drive arpu. also, this quarter, we deployed our ordering, dispatch, and rails modules at convenience stores or c-stores. two examples include maverik adventure's first stop, an intermountain west operator with nearly 400 stores across 12 states; and second, an east coast operator with more than 200 locations. with olo solutions, guests of these c-stores are now able to order fresh food for pickup or through delivery.
as i've mentioned in the past, c-stores are an exciting emerging vertical for olo, given their 55,000 location opportunity representing c-stores with fresh food programs. we also continue to grow our partner network this quarter, which enables our customers to leverage our platform to tap into best-in-class applications and services that are fully integrated into olo. our open platform provides restaurants with access to more than 300 technology providers, significantly more integrations than many other platforms. this quarter, we added technology partners in both autonomous and piloted delivery, as well as voice artificial intelligence, or ai.
we're excited to offer these cutting-edge technologies to our customers. more specifically, olo dispatch network now offers autonomous and piloted delivery robots through partnerships with certified delivery providers, coco delivery, refraction ai, and serve robotics. last-mile delivery is oftentimes the most complicated and costly aspect of the delivery experience, on average, accounting for 40% of the total cost of delivery. through these partnerships, we enable brands, such as modern market and newk's eatery, to empower automated last-mile delivery in specific markets, lowering transportation costs through automation while decreasing pollution.
we've also introduced partnerships with voice ai ordering solution providers, conversenow, sync 3 and valyant ai. these partners provide premier ordering automation technology, facilitating the seamless placement of guest orders at the drive-thru and enhancing the guest experience through shorter drive through lines. for operators, these partners increase average ticket size and alleviate labor shortages by allowing staff resources to focus on food prep, order fulfillment, and guest services. panda express, a top 25 brand with more than 2,400 locations, leverages voice ai technology partners to transform the drive-thru, leading to an enhanced digital experience while paving the path to 100% digital.
we believe unique solutions like voice ordering will enable olo to expand further into the qsr segment, as well as increase our penetration of digital orders in the space. notably, the conversion of drive-thru to digital doesn't require consumer behavior change. operators make the decision to enable digital in drive-thru, converting all orders from analog to digital through voice ai. this represents an exciting leap in the digital transformation of the drive-thru service model that represents the plurality of restaurant industry transactions, over four times larger than delivery.
we also continue to implement product enhancements to better serve our customers, many of which we showcased in our quarterly public release event held last month. in particular, at the end of october, we announced commercial availability of borderless, olo's password-less and platform-level sign-on offering. with borderless, guests can save and access their own file payment information, along with contact information and delivery addresses across all participating restaurant brands, securely speeding through checkout. by eliminating the need for guests to create an account, remember a password, or manually enter payment details at every purchase, borderless strives to help restaurants meaningfully increase basket conversion, retention, and visit frequency, driving increased revenue and profitability.
borderless also aims to enable brands to capture valuable guest data on more orders that were previously anonymous, adding new guests and ordered data to their guest data platform, in the industry's race to de-anonymize every order and uncover guest lifetime value. as our latest platform-level innovation, we believe borderless is the next step to improving the on-demand commerce experience, empowering brands to capture valuable guest data while delivering superior hospitality through added convenience. and we're excited by the opportunity for borderless functionality to transform the sign-on and checkout experience for guests, unlocking additional revenue opportunities for restaurants and olo. additionally, this past quarter, we introduced new capacity management capabilities across our order management solutions.
as off-premise volumes increased dramatically during the pandemic, and as labor challenges persist, it's imperative that operators effectively manage kitchen order flow in order to ensure smooth operations in the kitchen, accurate order, handoff or delivery service providers, and properly set guest expectations. this became a key problem for our customers that we believe olo is best positioned to solve. through our acquisition of omnivore earlier this year and by integrating with kitchen display systems, or kds, data, our platform can now capture crucial on-premise information. now, restaurants are able to provide more accurate quote times to guests and delivery service provider partners for when orders will be ready for handoff.
noodles & company, a fast casual brand with more than 400 locations, is one customer enrolled to pilot this feature. by providing more accurate quote information, olo enables brands to be as productive as possible and as profitable as possible, all while elevating the guest experience. this is a win-win-win scenario for our partners, our customers, and their guests, as well as a win for olo, as our platform becomes an essential integrated layer in our customer's everyday operations. these product features play an important part in improving the guest experience and empowering restaurant teams to provide hospitality through optimized operations and personalization.
i'm proud of the tools we provide our restaurant customers and the continuous hard work the olo team does in order to help our customers do more with less. and i'm honored that the industry recognizes our hard work. recently, we earned vendor of the year award by fast casual brands, cousin subs, as well as noodles & company. over the last two years, we've dramatically expanded our core value proposition.
olo's platform now provides a modular end-to-end restaurant technology offering that encompasses all guest touchpoints: on-premise, off-premise, guest engagement, and payments. we're laser-focused on providing and delivering these solutions to enterprise and emerging enterprise brands, and we're working to ensure that we're aligned from a go-to-market perspective to fully capitalize on our broader opportunity. as we think about our future potential, we continue to believe that arpu expansion will be the most meaningful driver of growth and the best measure of our success. we expect product adoption to increase across brands as we become an essential layer that aligns customers with olo's vision of enabling hospitality at scale and empowering restaurants to operate as one business.
and finally, as i typically do on earnings calls, i'd like to provide a corporate update. we recently debuted our updated corporate website at olo.com, which showcases the platform's modular end-to-end restaurant technology offering that encompasses all guest touchpoints. we also published a refreshed page for our partner program, olo connect, which includes a tiered partner directory of our expansive technology partners. additionally, we published our first environmental, social, and governance, or esg, site.
this site takes a big step toward our esg disclosure efforts by publishing our environmental and social initiatives and aspirations. we believe the future of hospitality is sustainable. we hold ourselves accountable to managing the impacts that our material topics impose on our company, stakeholders, and planet. our ongoing esg strategy development will harness opportunities to enrich our social impacts and lessen our environmental impacts, while centering on strong corporate governance and ethics.
to close, i'm excited about our future. the olo platform provides restaurants with mission-critical tools that drive value, allowing brands to do more with less while elevating the guests experience. we believe that olo's platform is best positioned to meet restaurants needs and drive growth. we're focused on executing to create positive outcomes for our customers, partners, and shareholders.
and with that, i'll hand it over to peter to discuss more detailed results. peter?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
thanks, noah. today, i'll review our third quarter results in detail, as well as provide guidance for the remainder of the year. in the third quarter, total revenue was $47.3 million, an increase of 26% year over year. platform revenue in the third quarter was $46.4 million, an increase of 28% year over year.
in terms of key metrics, arpu for the third quarter was approximately $558, representing a 15% increase year over year and a 3% increase sequentially. continued growth in arpu was driven by further expansion within our existing customer base, including continued adoption of olo pay. year over year, the impact from subway locations transitioning from the platform positively impacted arpu by approximately $25. as a reminder, subway is a single-module customer with significantly lower arpu than the average.
so, as locations transition from the platform, this will have a positive impact on arpu. as noah mentioned earlier, we expect arpu to continue to expand and be a meaningful driver of growth as we further increase multi-product adoption and transaction volumes on the platform. we believe we have a 25x opportunity to expand our booth from its current levels in the early momentum we are seeing with olo pay and guest engagement adoption, as well as on-premise ordering trends, gives us conviction in being able to significantly expand arpu over time. in terms of active locations, we ended the quarter with approximately 84,000 active locations on the platform, an 11% increase year over year and a 2% increase sequentially.
this number was in line with expectations, as subway locations held constant over the quarter and as we continue to actively work to alleviate elongated deployment timelines, which we discussed last quarter. and lastly, net revenue retention was approximately 107%, up 100 basis points sequentially. for the remainder of the financial metrics disclosed, unless otherwise noted, i'll be referencing non-gaap financial measures. gross profit for the third quarter was $34.7 million.
this compares to $30.2 million a year ago. the year-over-year increase in gross profit was driven by continued growth in revenue, partially offset by incremental costs associated with our wisely and omnivore acquisitions, increased compensation costs to support new locations coming onto the platform and, to a lesser extent, processing costs associated with olo pay. sales and marketing expense for the third quarter was $6.1 million or 13% of total revenue. this compares to $4.2 million and 11% a year ago.
over the past year, we have significantly increased our product portfolio and, in the near term, plan to continue to invest in our go-to-market team to fully capitalize on the growth opportunities we have within new and existing customers. research and development expense for the third quarter was $15.4 million or 33% of total revenue, compared to $11.9 million or 32% of total revenue a year ago. general and administrative expense for the third quarter was $10.3 million or 22% of total revenue. this compared to $9 million and 24% a year ago.
the year-over-year percentage decline was due to continued optimization of expenses within g&a as initial cost to support olo as a public company continue to scale. operating income for the third quarter was $3 million compared to $5.1 million a year ago. net income in the third quarter was $4.3 million, or $0.02 per share, based on approximately 181.9 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. turning our attention to the balance sheet and cash flow statement.
our cash, cash equivalents, and short- and long-term investments totaled $469.2 million as of september 30, 2022. this quarter, there were no impacts from the $100 million stock buyback program we announced in september, as we did not initiate share repurchase activity before the quarter ended. regarding cash flows, net cash provided by operating activities was $3.3 million in the quarter as compared to $10.7 million a year ago. free cash flow was $1.4 million compared to $10.2 million a year ago.
i'll wrap up by providing our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $48.2 million and $48.7 million and non-gaap operating income in the range of $2.6 million and $3 million. for the fiscal year 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $183.8 million and $184.3 million and non-gaap operating income in the range of $9.3 million and $9.7 million. in terms of guidance, our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year is consistent with the assumptions we discussed last quarter.
elongated sales cycles and deployment timelines have continued. and while we have a robust pipeline and are actively working to speed up deployment, we anticipate these dynamics to continue in the near term. secondly, we remain committed to driving profitable growth. inclusive of this past quarter's operating income outperformance, we are targeting slightly higher profitability in the second half of 2022 as compared to last quarter's guidance.
as we've exhibited all throughout all of this history, we are a financially disciplined organization and plan to continue to maintain this operating principle going forward. and lastly, in the fourth quarter, we entered into a sublease for our headquarters at one world trade center. as we continue to embrace a hybrid work environment, we plan to reinvest some related savings into an exciting and more fitting new york-based headquarters, as well as initiate other remote employee engagement activities. to summarize, we continue to deliver an attractive combination of strong revenue growth and profitability as we take meaningful strides toward becoming the engine of hospitality.
we believe we have a long runway for growth through cross-selling our robust and comprehensive product suite, expanding the use cases of the platform, and continuing to add locations to the platform. with that, i'd now like to turn it over to the operator to begin the q&a session. operator?

[operator instructions] my first question comes from gabriella borges with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
gabriela borges -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. thanks for taking the question. maybe to start, i'd love to get an update on some of the catalyst points or trigger points for relationships like jack in the box, where you're seeing really nice product module expansion.
you know, the issues that you talked about, the supply chain, the labor shortages, they've persisted for a handful of quarters now. so, we'd love to get an update. what are you seeing in terms of commonalities of trigger points that are leading to expansion within the olo platform?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
well, gabriela, thank you for the question, and welcome to the group. i'd say, you know, with jack in the box, and maybe extrapolating beyond jack in the box specifically, you know, we've seen great engagement from these large restaurant brands in the enterprise segment, from qsr brands specifically. and it's really about how they want to engage with guests. i think the digital transformation of the industry is something that is permeating every segment of the industry.
so, it has become a guest expectation and it's operator table stakes. it's about, as you heard from our prepared remarks, better productivity, better profitability, and up-leveling the guest experience. so, we see a lot of these brands, jack in the box among them, saying, you know, ""we had a homegrown solution, but we see that there are benefits in engaging with this saas platform, like olo."" and not so much a buy versus build. but more of a buy and build, to buy into the platform and then to build on top of it, and in the case of jack in the box with a third-party agency doing some of the esthetic on top of the olo engine.
so, i think that's sort of a natural progression. in the past we have landed with a single module in some of these relationships, proven ourselves out, shown the benefits of platform-level innovation, and all that olo can do. and then introduce brands to the other modules. there are 12 in total now.
and so, going from dispatch into dispatch and also ordering is a very natural progression and growth of the relationship. and we're excited to have the ability to land with one module and then expand into a larger suite of capabilities for all restaurant brands.
gabriela borges -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's helpful. and as a follow up for peter, i wanted to pick up on your comments on profitability and balancing the investments that you're making in the opportunity that lies ahead. when do you think we might see a more pronounced inflection in profitability in the model as we think about internal planning assumptions for 2023 and beyond?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yeah. thank you for the question, gabriel. so, in terms of profitability trends, i think at this point, you know, what we've shared is that we remain committed to maintaining profitability while delivering strong growth. and we believe we can do that because, one, just the core dna of olo and the discipline we have in terms of financial management.
i think we've shown that over our history, burning less than $6 million in total investment to reach $100 million of arr. that discipline, coupled with our highly efficient go-to-market in support motion, enables us to drive profitability and growth at the same time. you know, as we look ahead for 2023 and beyond, we believe that we can continue to do that in terms of driving profitable growth and attractive growth for the long term.
gabriela borges -- goldman sachs -- analyst
and so, just to put a finer point on that, do you think 2023 will be a year of margin expansion?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think look, i think there's, you know, a lot that's happening in real time as it relates to both the top line and the bottom line. what i will say is that, you know, where we stand today, we are, you know, highly focused on making sure that we are allocating capital to the parts of the business that we believe will drive the greatest long term-value for our shareholders and long-term growth and, in doing that, maintaining profitability.
gabriela borges -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks for the color.
operator
our next question comes from terry tillman with truist. please go ahead.
terry tillman -- truist securities -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, noah, peter, and stephanie. first, i just want zaxby's. they're all throughout atlanta, so that's nice to see. i'll be sure to find out how those -- that experience is firsthand.
maybe the first question for you, noah, is just -- you know, when we talked to investors in the past, it's like, how big is this tam? is there a low ceiling and high ceiling, etc., because it's just online ordering? we're now hearing you talk about digital entirety and on-premise over a number of quarters. i think you said 50 brands, 1,000 locations. so, i'm kind of curious, where do you see like revenue now? where does that stand in terms of on-premise dynamic?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
[audio gap] the transactional saas model are built. just back to your tam comment for a moment, and then i'll pass it over to peter to see if he wants to add on to that. we really think that no matter how you look at it, we are in the very, very early innings of penetrating our tam. we are well below 2% of the addressable tam that's out there in the segment that we serve.
and i think we look at these drivers of growth, arpu being the biggest one, and of course, moving on premise is part of capturing more transactions. olo pay is another part of making each one of those transactions a higher revenue event for olo. and we think that that's the largest part of the tam expansion or the revenue expansion into that tam. there's location growth as well.
and i'm proud also that, you know, we have in dairy queen and in jimmy john's and in panda express and jack in the box some great top 25 brands and are showing our expanded opportunity to work with those brands as well and to really add value regardless of the scale of the restaurant enterprise. and then, peter, i'll pass it over to you in case you want to double down on some of the economics of on premise.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yeah. so terry, just to answer your question on where the on-premise transaction volumes will appear within the financials. it has the potential to appear both in subscription and transaction. so, in terms of subscription, by having more orders processed over the platform, that will then graduate customers into higher-priced subscription packages.
so, that will help to drive subscription revenue. and to the extent that customer is utilizing olo pay, that will help to drive transaction revenue because of the associated processing fees with olo pay.
terry tillman -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. that's wonderful. thank you both for the answer there. i guess, peter, just a quick follow up in terms of anything you can share at all about how visibility is into 2023 compared to how visibility was going into '22? i know, obviously, we have the macro.
but the way i'd like to kind of add to that big picture question i just asked, which is probably a hard question is, are you seeing the revenue come in as you expected for olo pay? i think you said up to a couple million now. and i think customer engagement was going to do about 10 million. so, maybe you could talk about how they're performing and just any comments about visibility going into '23? thank you.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, we've been pleased with the progress across both olo pay and guest engagement. so, specific to olo pay, this past quarter, we generated just under $2 million of revenue associated with olo pay. and for the year, we're now estimating $5 million of revenue contribution.
so, great momentum there. i think part of the momentum that you're seeing with respect to olo pay is, you know, brands and operators prioritizing deployment of products that are a relatively light lift to deploy and also provide very fast time to value. and that is the case with olo pay. it's a light-touch deployment, and the time to value is immediate.
and i think part of that prioritization by brands and operators is due to that continued labor -- you know, dynamic labor challenges that we've discussed prior calls. in terms of 2023, so, you know, obviously, it's still a little early. there's a lot that's happening in real time. i think where we stand today, we are planning as though the sales and deployment dynamics continue into 2023.
but that said, i think despite, you know, the macro challenges, i think there's a lot of reasons to remain excited about the go-forward. so, i think, first off, our sales pipeline for both new business and upsells remains robust. and we anticipate that's going to continue as brands continue to look to do more with less and leverage digital to increase sales and improve margins. secondly, food away from home and digital ordering in general has remained durable.
and that is in part because food is not discretionary. everyone must eat. and you're seeing that across a variety of data points within the industry. and then, lastly, i think our enterprise focus in the market share we have within the limited service segment, i think, provides some additional resiliency as we head into 2023.
so, certainly still a lot going on at the moment, but, you know, a lot of positives to remain excited about the go-forward.
terry tillman -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from stephen sheldon with william blair. please go ahead.
stephen sheldon -- william blair -- analyst
hey. thank you. first one i'd ask about just the longer sales cycles. i know that's happening for a lot of enterprise saas companies, and you still had plenty of wins this quarter.
but what do you think is specifically driving the delay in decision-making here? or are a lot of the enterprise restaurant concepts that, you know, you're kind of going after, they're just distracted with a variety of other issues? and what do you think it could take for those cycles to more or less normalize?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
hey, stephen. this is noah. thanks for the question. i think, you know, we are being prudent as we look at this quarter and think about the near term.
we are sort of staying consistent with what we guided to last quarter. at the same time, i think there is some light at the end of the tunnel. there are some of those dynamics that are causing restaurant brands or that were causing restaurant brands to be a little bit slower to make decisions or to implement those decisions that are normalizing. so, there are things like wholesale food prices that are starting to come in.
there are things like the labor environment starting to tick back up, not quite yet at pre-pandemic levels but getting closer to it. and so, you know, i think we're being prudent. we're being financially responsible in the way that we're modeling and the way that we're planning. but i think that, you know, what is abundantly clear, as we look at all those business, as we think about the current macro as something that is kind of a temporary crosswind, and i think -- you know, we've seen moments in time like this in our history, 2008, 2009.
i would contrast that with the digital transformation of this $1 trillion restaurant industry. that is a mighty and persistent tailwind that's been at our back for 17 years and will be at our back for many, many years to come, especially as restaurant brands are looking to lean into digital transformation for the very reasons that peter just mentioned, getting more productive, getting more profitable, and at the same time, upleveling the guest experience.
stephen sheldon -- william blair -- analyst
got it. that's really helpful. and then, as a follow-up, just as we model active locations for the fourth quarter, can you just help us frame the moving pieces on locations, especially with subway continuing to roll off. i think you'd talked before about that being progressive in the fourth quarter and potentially in the early 2023.
is that still the right expectation for those remaining locations, just given the visibility you have right now?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yeah, that's right. so, consistent with what we shared last quarter, we are targeting 2,000 net new locations in the fourth quarter. specific to subway, the way in which we count an active location for rails is a location having had at least one order in the period. so, even as remaining locations begin to off-board this quarter into early q1 of next year, they'll show up in the active location count, having generated at least one order in the period.
so, we'll be -- we'll just make sure to be very clear on how that is evolving throughout the quarter and into early next year.
stephen sheldon -- william blair -- analyst
sounds good. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from matthew hedberg with rbc. please go ahead.
matthew hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great, thanks guys. following up on the question on sales cycles, noah, i know last quarter you talked about a little bit different implementation headwinds, tailwinds between corporate-owned and franchisee-owned restaurants. i'm wondering if there's anything that changed in the dynamic of those two restaurant styles, i guess. and then maybe as a follow-up, diego's been on now for a few months as cro.
you know, i guess from that perspective, are there things that you guys are doing specific that could counter -- that could cut through macros and maybe it's something he's implemented thus far?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
hey, matt. thanks for the two questions. i would say, nothing pronounced as a difference between corporate-owned brands. those are pretty rare.
those brands that have all corporate locations. most of the industry, whether we're talking about enterprise or emerging enterprise, are a smattering of corporate stores but primarily franchisee locations. and last quarter, we mentioned some of the efforts that we were taking, making things easier on the restaurant brands to do the implementation themselves, to do the deployment themselves, also using third parties to do deployments, you know, as an augmentation for the restaurant brand. and then -- although taking on more of the work.
and i think, when i talk about these deployments that we're celebrating this quarter, take one, take jack in the box of rolling out to 2,200 locations, that is deploying to 2,200 locations in a highly franchised environment. i think it's showing how those efforts that we're making are helping to get brands that have been sold and are showing up in bookings actually deployed and live on the platform for their operators' benefit and for the guest benefit and, obviously, for olo's benefit. when i think about diego and some of the things that he's focused on in the role of chief revenue officer, it really aligns with our commentary around the growth drivers of the business. so, we are very focused on arpu as a huge driver of growth.
and that is about selling additional modules into existing restaurant customers who are asking us to play a larger role because we're a mission-critical platform, and we've become something of a digital transformation area [inaudible] to these brands. so, they're asking us to do more with them. and we now have a lot more to offer because of our great product r&d and the m&a activities that have added new modules into our platform. so, we're focused on that.
we're focused on selling in olo pay, selling in guest engagement, and, of course, we're still focused, very focused on landing additional restaurant brands from the enterprise segment and the emerging enterprise segments. i'd say, you know, we are rightsizing our investments to go after all of those opportunities and believe that we have so much room to grow and a huge tam to grow into under diego's leadership.

thanks, noah. i really appreciate the color.

our next question comes from brent bracelin with piper sandler. please go ahead.
clarke jeffries -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi. this is clarke jeffries on for brent. first question is around arpu growth. you know, 3% sequential growth in arpu certainly looks healthy.
just wondering maybe peter, what kind of arpu growth do you think you can achieve either based on the olo pay rollout or multiple software module rollout? do you think it could be sustainable at these kinds of levels for sequential arpu growth? and then, you know, maybe second on that, you know, reaching a point where there are now 12 modules to sell. from a philosophy perspective, from a growing efficiently perspective, do you think you might change to preference more overall arr or total contract value added at a lower gross edition level, as in more multi-module lands and that growth additions could take a backseat to the growth model over the, you know, next 12 months to 18 months?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yeah, so in terms of the arpu sequential growth trend, i think, if you go back in time, i think the growth has been from a trend-line perspective lumpy at times. and part of that is because of how products are deployed, as well as the number of products that are subscribed to from the onset of the relationship. so, depending on, even if a customer subscribes to say three products at the onset of the relationship, they may roll out one at one time and then the second and third at a subsequent time, which would make the trend line a bit smoother versus some customers deploying all three modules right from the onset. the way i would think about the long-term kind of growth rate or growth potential for arpu is really through that 25x opportunity lens.
and that is really by driving more transactions on the platform, as well as increasing the adoption of olo pay. so, looking at the arpu from where it stands today on a quarterly basis, having a 25x opportunity to expand that number over time. and then, if i'm -- in terms of your second question, if i'm understanding that right, i think the question is around the ability to expand arpu over time if more and more customers are landing with more products at the onset of the relationship. i would say we're -- we've seen more of that in the emerging segment of the business, which we noted on the call, where, oftentimes, that segment of the market is coming to us.
and they're wanting us to solve a number of pain points from the onset of the relationship. so, they're typically taking order management, delivery enablement, and now, more recently, olo pay. i think that, obviously, you know, presents some challenges to further expand arpu when you're taking everything upfront. but i think we would, obviously, enjoy that problem in being able to have a higher arpu from the onset of the relationship.
clarke jeffries -- piper sandler -- analyst
makes sense. and i think i had a follow-up related to it. seems like a lot of the enterprise lens you've noted this quarter were relationships that took more of the modules upfront instead of just ordering. but, noah, i wanted to ask about how do you view the industry changing around proprietary versus legacy replacement? maybe you can help us frame the sort of portion of engagements where you're going in and replacing proprietary versus a legacy solution.
it seems like the jack in the box deal was very much based on your competency in integrating with the proprietary. so, i'd love to just get your thoughts on how that's evolved over the history of the company and where you sit today.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
well, clarke, thank you. i think that's usually up for an important point, which is that the trend has certainly been that brands are migrating from homegrown to olo. and if i just think about the time, really, over the last 18 months since our ipo, there are 10 sizable brands that have made that transition. carl's junior, carrabba's italian grill, hardee's, jack in the box, outback, potbelly, ruby tuesday, smashburger, tgi friday's, and, now, zaxby's.
and i think this is exactly what we were hoping to see by becoming a public story, by brands seeing the strength of olo's business, the strength of olo's balance sheet, hearing our philosophical commitment to being an independent and open platform, and then seeing some of the platform-level innovation that we've been able to bring to life. first in dispatch, that in rails, most recently in borderless. i want to come back to that in a moment. these are things that brands can't build themselves.
they are things that you can build once you've built a two-sided network of many brands on one side and many partners on the other. if i think about borderless as the extreme example of this point, this is a two-sided network that we've created that connects the 84,000 restaurants on our platform. and for those of you who don't know the industry super well, 84,000 restaurants is very large. take every mcdonald's in the united states.
it is six times every mcdonald's in the united states, the number of locations. and it connects those to 85 million restaurant guests that order through olo. that's more than the entire population of germany. olo is then serving as the conduit between those restaurants and those restaurant guests and creating a win-win, a better experience for those restaurant operators and for those restaurant guests who no longer have to create an account, remember a password, reenter payment details.
they have a better, faster experience. and it leads to those restaurant brands getting more of that guest data into their guest data platform, which is really the holy grail. this is what restaurants are looking for, ways in which they can get guest data into their guest data platform, de-anonymize transactions, and tie every transaction back to a guest account so they can unlock and uncover the guest lifetime value. and i think that's something that olo is uniquely able to do and really where the industry is headed.
and so, i think when you compare that to just the tactical building of functionality for on-demand commerce, it just -- there's no comparison to what we're able to build as a platform serving the industry as a whole.
clarke jeffries -- piper sandler -- analyst
really appreciate the color. thank you very much.

noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
thank you, stephanie. hi everyone. thank you for spending time with us today. in 2022, olo increasingly became the platform that restaurant brands rely on to make their digital priorities a reality, with the olo platform supporting approximately 87,000 restaurants and more than 600 brands, connecting them to more than 300 technology partners and more than 85 million guests, who transacted over the olo platform and processing on average more than 2 million orders per day.
in 2022, we grew annual revenues by 24%, expanded arpu by 8% to just under $2,200 per year, surpassed $23 billion in gross merchandise volume for the year, and processed more than $250 million in gross payment volume in olo pay's first year of general availability on the platform. olo continued our post-ipo transformation in 2022. olo pay had a marquee inaugural year. we broadened our platform's capabilities through the omnivore acquisition.
we brought on chief revenue officer, diego panama, to elevate our world-class go-to-market team. and we introduced our refreshed mission to serve as the engine of hospitality. consistent with this mission, olo is committed to helping restaurants use technology to provide personalized guest experiences across all touch points, while improving operational efficiency. this will enable brands to elevate the guest experience, drive incremental and repeatable sales and improve profitability.
we believe the future of the restaurant industry is guest-centric, empowered by digital solutions, and that olo is best positioned to realize this vision on behalf of our customers and their guests. now, more than ever, restaurants recognize the need to invest in technology as a means to better serve their guests and operate their businesses more effectively. our hard work in 2022, our network of brands, partners, and guests, and our comprehensive product suite, all enable olo to meet the needs of our customers, and we believe we've set the table for great things to come in 2023 and beyond. in the fourth quarter, olo continued to see success with both new and existing customers across all three product suites that enable restaurants to increase the number of digital orders, better engage their guests by providing best-in-class experiences, and tap into digital native pay solution, tailored toward the need of restaurant operators.
this quarter, we continued to expand our relationship with existing customers. bravo brio restaurant group, buca di beppo, eggs up grill, lucille's smokehouse bar-b-que, tgi fridays, and virtual dining concepts deployed olo pay, and toojay's gourmet deli deployed olo pay as well as our engaged solution. virtual dining concepts, the parents of mrbeast burger and other virtual brands, adopted olo pay at all of its brands, which include more than 3,000 virtual restaurants operating in more than 2,000 restaurant kitchens. this also included lankybox kitchen, a family focused virtual brand launched by virtual dining concepts, which adopted our ordering, dispatch, rails, and olo pay modules.
as part of the deployment, olo also completed the pos integration project with chuck e. cheese. this integration allows chuck e. cheese to make lankybox available at more than 450 locations, more efficiently leverage its operations, as well as increase revenue per square foot.
and for those of us with young children, yes, the virtual concept is a tie-in with lankybox, a youtube channel with millions of subscribers focused on entertaining children. tgi fridays, a casual dining restaurant with more than 300 locations in the us, continued to invest in its digital presence. since launching olo pay, tgi fridays has seen positive growth in authorization rates by more than 5% and our data suggests an overall drop in fraud rates of more than 1%. in 2023, tgi fridays is focused on bolstering its tech stack, improving its custom app, and launching a new loyalty structure to enhance its current guest experience, with olo driving ordering and payments across these properties.
all of these customers have added olo pay to their existing solutions. and this quarter, we also welcomed captain d's, a fast casual seafood restaurant with more than 550 locations. captain d's deployed our ordering, dispatch, rails, network, and olo pay modules. this deployment represents our largest olo pay customer to-date by locations and continued success in multi-module deployments to new customers.
it also reflects our ability to deploy within highly franchised enterprise environments. olo pay continues to perform across all key metrics. fraud prevention and authorization rates are higher than we initially expected and higher than traditional methods. from an adoption perspective, olo pay has been broadly deployed across both enterprise and emerging enterprise, across new and existing customers, and across service models from names in casual dining to quick service to virtual brands.
and as our fastest of 14 modules to get to $1 million of monthly recurring revenue, olopay is becoming ubiquitous, and we're very excited about the product's future. this quarter we also welcomed new customers such as kroger and tender shack. more on kroger in a moment. tender shack, a bloomin' brands' virtual brand with more than 800 locations launched our rail solution this quarter.
previously, tender shack integrated directly with only one of the top three marketplaces. by adopting our rail solution, the virtual brand can now integrate with all major marketplaces, and easily synchronize menus, pricing, location data, and item availability in order to streamline operations through a single integration. as i typically provide an update on product enhancements on this call, i'm excited to announce that we've expanded borderless identity availability to all olo pay customers, including those with custom ordering websites and apps, enabling more brands access to increase revenue potential and actionable guest data. borderless capabilities simplify the checkout process for guests by eliminating the need to create or remember a password or manually enter credit card information at every purchase.
in addition to helping restaurants meaningfully increase basket conversion, guest retention, and visit frequency. borderless enhances the guest experience and deanonymizes transactions by linking them to guest profiles, enhanced qr code ordering, furthering our on-premise dining offerings, and integrated geolocation partner notifications, which automate arrival notification for brands utilizing our expo interface, eliminating the need for multiple tablets and ensuring food is prepared and handed off efficiently and on-time, resulting in fresh food for guests. while we typically broadcast our product release events, this quarter we have decided to present these enhancements live at beyond4, our annual customer conference which will be held in napa, california next week. for those not in attendance, you can view demos and further details of our winter product release events at olo.com/quarterly release.
olo is constantly innovating and enhancing our platform, ensuring all restaurant locations are always able to use the latest technology to their advantage. we continually release updates to products and enable new use cases that didn't exist before. and our customers look forward to our quarterly product updates, where we demonstrate these improvements, as well as the extensibility of the olo platform. in prior quarters, i've discussed how we leveraged our ordering module to enable virtual brands for restaurants.
and more recently, our products have moved into new verticals, such as convenience stores. in the fourth quarter, we were able to develop a new product use case with expo, our tablet-based software solution that's part of the ordering module, focused on enhancing the preparation and hand-off workflow, this time for the grocery industry. kroger deployed approximately 1,600 locations, bringing sushi and floral delivery to guests nationwide. this is just one example of how the company is deploying it's accelerating with digital strategy to position kroger for long-term sustainable growth.
for olo, enabling guests to purchase prepared foods and flowers from multi-unit grocery stores represents an emerging vertical, expanding olo's total addressable location count by almost 30,000 locations, representing more than $37 billion in annual foodservice sales. before i speak about our corporate strategy and our outlook for 2023, i'd like to recognize team olo. olo earned best customer data platform from digiday in recognition of our platform's ability to deliver personalized marketing messages, better guest experiences across channels in restaurants and digital, and better understand guest preferences. i believe this demonstrates that our strategic investments in guest data are already paying off.
as we look ahead to the new year, i'm energized to build on our strong foundation. we have a robust product portfolio. we are further empowering our go-to-market organization. we remain profitable on a non-gaap basis and are growing revenue at a strong rate.
as i mentioned earlier, we believe that the future of the restaurant industry is guest-centric. it's important for restaurants to build better relationships with their guests in order to increase guest lifetime value, retain existing guests, attract new guests more easily and drive revenue and profit. and part of the reason olo is well-positioned is that everything we do is tied back to a knowledge of the guests. a co-product of the secular shift from analog to digital is the de-anonymization of transactional data, enabling the olo platform to tie every transaction back to a guest profile.
this enables more personalized experiences going forward and gives the brand a fresh understanding of guests' lifetime value, the new north star metric for running a restaurant. this guest centricity is what olo is uniquely positioned to do and what traditional players are unable to do and have not done as a result. olo is more than a commerce platform. olo is a data platform, a two-sided network and conduit between 87,000 restaurants and 85 million guests.
and this year, we'll continue to be laser-focused on our mission and key investments, in order to drive long-term growth and value to restaurant brands and shareholders alike. these investments will be directed toward payments, on-premise experiences, guest engagement, and continuing to empower our go-to-market organization. historically, the olo platform has predominantly focused on pickup and delivery, categories that represent roughly 29% and 8% of overall restaurant transactions, respectively. over the past year, we've moved into drive-thru and on-premise, categories that represent roughly 38% and 24% of overall restaurant transactions, respectively, more than doubling our serviceable footprint.
currently nearly 100% of drive-thru and on-premise transactions are analog. and as olo moves into both on- and off-premise as a focus, we have a great opportunity for olo to unlock the path to digitize 100% of transactions, as restaurant look to better serve guests and do more with less. in order to capitalize on this opportunity, we expect to make additional investments in payments and on-premise experiences, which will enable us to drive operational efficiencies for our customers, increase guest satisfaction, as well as enable olo to capture more transactions and drive revenue growth. and as an extension of this, we expect to invest in our engagement solutions to enable hospitality that makes every guest feel like a regular.
we'll also invest in capacity and yield management to create a more integrated technology experience for our customers. i spoke about this briefly on the prior call. to remind you, expanding these offerings vertically throughout the restaurant value chain will capture and leverage crucial data from both on- and off-premise transactions, increasing the efficiency of the kitchen and improving the guest experience. this allows olo to be the brains of the restaurant operation, the orchestration layer of production, which further solidifies the mission criticality of the olo platform.
in short, our platform will provide a full-integrated technology experience with capacity and yield management capabilities that will enable restaurants to use one vendor for all of their needs, focused on enabling the restaurant kitchen to become as productive as possible and as profitable as possible. and as we build out these capabilities, we expect to further invest in and empower our sales and marketing organization, while maintaining sales efficiency. all of these investments will propel olo into the great opportunity ahead, one in which we are uniquely positioned to increase restaurants' digital penetration from 15% to 100%. leading restaurant brands know that digital capabilities will give them the ability to do more with less, intimately know and better serve their guests and operate as one unified business.
i am more confident than ever that we're on the right path, and i'll be delighted to share our successes along the way. and with that, i'll hand it over to peter to discuss more detailed results. peter?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
thanks, noah. today, i'll review our fourth quarter results as well as provide guidance for the first quarter and the full year 2023. in the fourth quarter, total revenue was $49.8 million, an increase of 25% year over year. platform revenue in the fourth quarter was $48.9 million, an increase of 26% year over year.
and olo pay continues to exceed our expectations, contributing just over $3 million in revenue for the quarter and surpassing $6 million in total revenue for the year. in terms of key metrics, arpu for the fourth quarter was approximately $571, representing a 13% increase year over year and a 2% increase sequentially. continued growth in arpu was driven by further expansion within our existing customer base, including continued adoption of our engage and pay suite. in terms of active locations, we ended the quarter with approximately 87,000 active locations on the platform, a 10% increase year over year and a 4% increase sequentially.
and lastly, net revenue retention was approximately 108%, up 100 basis points sequentially. for the remainder of the financial metrics disclosed, unless otherwise noted, i will be referencing non-gaap financial measures. gross profit in the fourth quarter was $37.3 million. this compares to $32.6 million a year ago.
the year-over-year increase in gross profit was driven by continued growth in revenue, partially offset by increased compensation cost to support new locations coming onto the platform and, to a lesser extent, processing costs associated with olo pay. sales and marketing expense for the fourth quarter was $6.9 million or 14% of total revenue. this compares to $4.6 million and 11% a year ago. over the past year, we have invested additional resources in our go-to-market team to fully capitalize on the growth opportunity from our significantly expanded product portfolio.
research and development expense for the fourth quarter was $15.8 million or 32% of total revenue, compared to $12.8 million or 32% of total revenue a year ago. on a dollar basis, we increased investments in r&d in order to unlock future growth opportunities related to olo pay, borderless capability, and on-premise ordering. general and administrative expense for the fourth quarter was $11.5 million or 23% of total revenue. this compares to $10 million and 25% a year ago.
the year-over-year percentage decrease represents continued optimization of expenses as our organization continues to scale. operating income in the fourth quarter was $3.1 million compared to $5.2 million a year ago. net income in the fourth quarter was $5.6 million or $0.03 per share based on approximately 180 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. turning our attention to the balance sheet and cash flow statement.
our cash, cash equivalent, and short- and long-term investments totaled $451.2 million as of december 31st, 2022. pursuant to the share repurchase program, which we announced in september 2022, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares for a total of approximately $20.1 million. regarding cash flows, net cash used in operating activities was roughly zero in the quarter as compared to $10 million used a year ago. free cash flow was negative $1.6 million, compared to negative $10.6 million a year ago.
i'll wrap up by providing our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2023. for the first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $50.5 million and $51 million, and non-gaap operating income in the range of $600,000 and $1 million. for the fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $213 million and $215 million, and non-gaap operating income in the range of $11.4 million and $13 million. when preparing our financial projections for 2023, we took a prudent approach.
while the restaurant industry has seen some recent improvements in cost pressure and labor and digital ordering has remained durable, our approach was to balance these favorable trends and desired long-term investments against the backdrop of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. from a revenue perspective, a few things to call out. first, our guidance assumes approximately two-thirds of incremental revenue growth will be driven by existing projects currently in deployment, with one-third of incremental revenue growth driven by in-year bookings and deployment. this mix has historically had a larger weighting to in-year bookings.
and by emphasizing a larger share of revenue contribution from existing projects and deployment, we believe this to be a more cautious approach to planning for the year ahead. secondly, given our visibility into projects currently in deployment and a healthy sales pipeline, we expect revenue growth to reaccelerate in the second half of 2023, driven primarily by arpu expansion. we ended 2023 with customers on average utilizing three modules per location, and therefore, have a great runway for growth to expand across our existing 14 product modules. and lastly, given olo pay's continued momentum, we are estimating revenue contribution in the mid to high teen millions for the year.
as it relates to location, as a reminder, and in line with what we've discussed in prior quarters, approximately 12,500 subway locations transitioned from the platform in late q4 2022 and will no longer be included in active location total in the first quarter of this year. for the full year 2023, excluding the impact from subway, we are modeling 6,000 location adds for the year. in terms of gross margin, we expect a 200 basis points decline year over year due to olo pay's growing mix of overall revenue. this is an expected part of our long-term plan and reflects the strong early adoption of olo pay and its strategic role within olo's mission-critical commerce platform.
we believe olo pay will be a fast-growing part of our business for years to come and will be accretive to our revenue growth and profitability. moving on to operating expenses. this year, we intend to continue our investments in sales and marketing to align with the rapid expansion of our product portfolio. 18 months ago, we had roughly a third of the product modules we have today, and we are rebalancing the size and skill set of our sales and marketing organization in order to effectively seize the opportunity ahead.
while further investment in sales and marketing is needed, we plan to retain our strong sales efficiency. additionally, as a reminder, our annual user conference, beyond4, will occur in q1 this year, which will result in higher marketing expenses of approximately $1.5 million in the first quarter. in terms of research and development, we anticipate increased leverage as the year progresses and on a full year basis. in terms of general and administrative expense, we anticipate increased leverage on a full year basis as we continue to scale the business.
all said, we expect our combined revenue and expense target to yield a modest improvement in operating margin for the year. philosophically, we have always been focused on balanced growth and efficient investment in the business. we believe that has served the business well over time and it is how we are approaching 2023. our investment plan this year takes into account the rising cost of capital and the macro environment, which is reflected in the opex leverage we expect to gain in 2023.
with that, i'd now like to turn it over to the operator to begin the q&a session. operator?

operator
thank you.[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of gabriela borges with goldman sachs. please proceed with your question.
gabriela borges -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. thank you. noah and peter, i wanted to better reconcile your macro comments with the guidance. the slowdown that you're forecasting in 1q '23, are you already seeing signs of a slowdown in your business in terms of customer willing to invest or deal closure, the deal delays? just want to understand the implied growth in 1q '23 relative to the quarter that you just reported.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes, gabriela. i can take that. this is peter. thanks for the question.
so one of the things we talked about in the second half of last year was a dynamic in which both sales cycles and deployment cycles were elongating. and part of the reason for that was that some of the things that the industry was working through in the form of labor constraints and increase in commodity costs, etc., that really caused them to turn their focus to dealing with those pressing issues. we have seen some improvement within the industry with respect to those dynamics, so unemployment improving, commodity costs improving, etc. but when we thought about our plan for the year ahead, we wanted to put forth a plan that we felt was more prudent despite maybe some of the positive signs we're seeing in the end market.
so for both arpu and active location counts for next year, that was the lens from which we built the plan. and what you're seeing in the first quarter is really the outcome of some of the elongated deployment and sales cycles that we talked about late last year, and then in the back half of the year, what you're seeing is a reacceleration of growth as the things that we did book begin to deploy.
gabriela borges -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. that makes sense. and then the follow-up would be on the guidance for margins relative to your comments on balancing growth and profitability. so with the forecast that you're giving for revenue, if you take a framework where you're looking at combined revenue growth and profitability of some kind of rule of 40 framework, it looks like the combined profile of growth and profitability is moving backwards.
in other words, based on your revenue forecast for this year, i would have expected to see more margin expansion. so maybe just a little more detail, how do you think about leverage this year given all the comments you just made on the forecast for revenue?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes. so i think we've done a good job in terms of expanding margins in the bottom line given the commentary that we shared from a gross margin perspective. so as olo pay becomes a larger portion of the revenue mix, that will have an impact on gross margins. and what we've done this year is to balance that dynamic by increasing leverage in r&d and g&a, and having some offset in sales and marketing knowing that that's an area that we want to invest in given the expansion of the product portfolio and the opportunity ahead.
so i think we've done a pretty good job in terms of being able to expand operating margins despite gross margins declining in the near term.
gabriela borges -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that makes sense. i'll ask one more if i may, which is, i think you've talked last time about the opportunity for more ai, automation in some of the ways that customers interact with their products. would love to get an update there on some of the things you're working on. thank you.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
thanks for the question, gabriela. i think that there is clearly a larger digital transformation that is happening in the industry and what we've been witnessing for 17.5 years now. and part of that, certainly in recent months, has been a focus around automation and ai specifically. i think our perspective is, all this digital transformation, inclusive of artificial intelligence within restaurants, is a great thing if it can make the operator experience better, it can make the operation more profitable, and at the same time, it can up-level the guest experience, it can make the guest feel greater hospitality, not less hospitality.
and so that's how we sort of think about areas where we can apply automation and digitization in our business. how can we do things like yield management and capacity management in the kitchen to make the kitchen more productive and to better set expectations of when orders will be ready based on ai and machine learning, so that the guest is coming in and getting their food fresh and ready or that a delivery driver is coming in and getting the food fresh and ready. we love the idea of using that automation, but not sort of throwing the baby out with the bathwater and losing some of the warmth and hospitality that guests love about restaurants. i think put together, we see the opportunity for all of this digital transformation to drive greater hospitality, not less.

our next question comes from the line of clarke jeffries with piper sandler. please proceed with your question.
clarke jeffries -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi. thank you for taking the questions. first on the grocery store opportunity, i wonder if you could give a little more detail on how that opportunity may be different in terms of sales cycles? i would imagine much more unified customers rather than disparate franchise customers. what opportunity do you see actively being available today in terms of how they are providing digital ordering? and then, what could be the future for maybe working with grocery delivery partners, say like an instacart or other kind of marketplace vendors in that space?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
clarke, thanks for the question. i think this is an exciting new vertical for us. it's something just reflecting back on the very early days, although we always thought restaurants are the first vertical, they are not the only vertical for what is fundamentally an on-demand commerce platform. so obviously, we've taken what we've built initially for restaurants.
we've expanded that in past quarters into the c-store space to the extent that you have convenience stores operating fresh food programs. as a reminder, there are about 55,000 of those around the country. now, we're seeing expansion into the grocery space, again, with fresh food programs, with food that is prepared made to order, but also importantly with flowers, with a floral department. i think that's a good representation of another product category that shares some of the same characteristics as prepared food.
it's highly perishable, made to order, just in time, and that's really what our platform was designed to do, unlike some other traditional e-commerce platforms. so with regard to sales cycles, i think your commentary is right, these are usually larger grocers, more consolidation in the grocery industry. we see opportunity when we're getting pulled into providing our platform to augment foodservice programs and other opportunities like this floral opportunity that we saw. in total, we see 30,000 locations within grocery that are addressable for olo.
and if we look at the technomic data and see how much prepared food spend in the areas of those 30,000 locations, that's something around $37 billion of prepared food spend. so that's a great opportunity for us as well. and i think we will always be restaurant-focused and restaurant-first, but if we see opportunities to expand our platform into these other adjacent categories, that makes lot of sense, and if we can serve as the engine of hospitality for them at the same time, that's wonderful. and to your question about delivery service provider partners, of course, we would love to work with as many delivery service provider partners in the b2b sense of delivery service providers and also marketplaces that want to use olo to access those grocery brands and that's part and parcel with olo being an open platform and expanding a large 300-plus member integrated technology partner network.
clarke jeffries -- piper sandler -- analyst
perfect. really appreciate the color. just a follow-up. on olo pay, certainly encouraging to hear the strength there.
it seems to be performing above your expectations. i think the word ubiquitous was even thrown around. is there a way you can help us think about how that is progressing in terms of attach rate on new customers, or if you're seeing a predominant amount of traction within the existing base? and just maybe help us frame, what are the holdouts thinking in terms of what are the frictions to not adopting olo pay within customers that you have approached and maybe did not adopt so far?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
we've really been thrilled with what has been broad adoption, as i mentioned. it's not just emerging enterprise, it's also enterprise customers, it's brands like captain d's and freddy's, and tgi fridays that are adopting olo pay. it's not just existing customers, it's also new customers. and of course, it's also not contained within one segment of the industry.
we have casual dining brands. we have quick-service restaurant brands. we have virtual brands that are adopting olo pay. so i think that's why we think about this as something that can be ubiquitous.
there are some restaurant brands that have long-term contracts that are in place with existing legacy payment processors, that say, i'm really excited about olo pay and all these things that you're able to share about how others are getting value from it. i can't move off of this contract until x date, and i think that's part of how payments works. for many, many others, we have seen an excitement to move over to olo pay and use that as a way of making a lower-friction guest experience and also have all the other benefits for the operator of a lower cost of ownership, higher authorization rates, lower fraud rates, etc., that olo pay has really proven at.
clarke jeffries -- piper sandler -- analyst
really appreciate it. thank you very much.

our next question comes from the line of terry tillman with truist securities. please proceed with your question.
connor passarella -- truist securities -- analyst
perfect. thanks, guys. this is connor passarella on for terry. appreciate you taking my questions.
just wanted to start first. so you touched on one of the areas of opportunity being the potential for voice ai to displace drive-thru. and i think last quarter, we talked about some important partnerships there. i just wanted to get an update if you're seeing any evidence of that so far? and maybe if you can remind us on the opportunity for drive-thru from a dollar perspective? any color there would be helpful.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
sure. yes. going back to last quarter, we spoke about three partners that were in the drive-thru voice artificial intelligence space doing basically a replacement of the old-fashioned rolling up to the speaker box and speaking to somebody who is inside on a headset instead of replacing that with voice ai. so conversenow is one of those, think3 is one of those, and then valyant ai was another.
and i think there's a broad interest from drive-thru operators, largely qsr brand drive-thru operators to think about how they can use digital in the drive-thru. just by the numbers, drive-thru is the largest segment gained share during covid and has held onto that share. it now is the plurality of all restaurant transactions, representing 38% of total industry transactions. so drive-thru by itself is as large by transaction count as both takeout and delivery combined.
so we think that's an excellent opportunity for us to engage with our partners for the ordering. and i'll remind the group that we also have been working at drive-thru for some time now with the drive-thru as a hand-off mode. in other words, a guest placing an order through the app, through the website, and saying, ""i want to collect this order, but i don't want to have to get out of my car. i want to be able to drive up to the window, pick up my order, and be on that way."" some restaurant brands have the ability to do that through a second window, which is typically called a fly thru window, others do it in the traditional drive-thru lane.
but that's another way in which digital and drive-thru are coming together.
connor passarella -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. that's really helpful. i appreciate that. just a quick follow-up on the borderless rollout.
so so far, what have you seen from borderless and the ability to drive demands, and kind of what data are you seeing around customer success in terms of maybe repeat orders or anything success-wise there? appreciate it.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
yes. i'd say that the biggest thing that we have highlighted and i'll again highlight on this call is the impact that borderless, which to remind the group, is around a password-less login that's instead single-factor authentication, so that a guest doesn't have to remember a password, just uses their phone to authenticate themselves. the biggest impact is the number of transactions that are authenticated where a guest is logged into an account and not placing that transaction anonymously. so we talk about the de-anonymization of transactional data and borderless is fantastic at doing that.
we've gone from where traditional log-in, you wind up with only 30% of guests that are saving a card on file and creating an account and known by the brand, to over double that when you're using the borderless authentication and checkout. so that's a win for the guest. it removes a lot of friction from them. it's not just about accessing payment details, it's also about getting into an account where they have order history saved, they might have delivery addresses saved, etc.
it's a win for the operator and the brand, because now that order is getting tied back to the guest account and that enriches the profile of that guest and ultimately it helps the brand understand guest lifetime value, which we believe is fast becoming the true north metric for operating a restaurant, and what we're bringing to life with innovations like borderless.
connor passarella -- truist securities -- analyst

our next question comes from the line of stephen sheldon with william blair. please proceed with your question.
pat mcilwee -- william blair and company -- analyst
hi, guys. this is pat mcilwee on for steven today. so encouraging update with kroger this quarter. and you mentioned some sizable throughput in that segment.
and i just wanted to ask, is there a realistic opportunity for payment processing with just some or with all of those 30,000 grocery stores, and then also with the 55,000 c-stores? and if so have you seen any traction with those customers, i guess, more so on the c-store side for payments yet?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
i think it's super early and we're not kind of beating our chest and saying, ""you know, we are full steam ahead into these additional segments."" we think these are exciting opportunities for us to pursue and learn from, that's sort of how i would read where we are. now, kroger, i think, in the grocery segment and those that we've talked about in the convenience store segments, i think are great calling card deals. they are not representative of olo pay lands where we're processing the transaction through olo pay. so i think too soon for us to comment there.
but we do believe that olo pay is something that is broadly desirable as we talked about the different restaurant segments that have been excited about ola pay. i think the same can be said about why it would be appealing to c-store and grocery customers. and we do think that as a component of a larger guest centricity and guest-centric approach that, that holds a lot of appeal to really any merchant to understand that guest and to be able to unlock hospitality in this shift over to digital, and olo pay is a big part of that. so i'd say early, but we do think that that's an opportunity for us going forward.
pat mcilwee -- william blair and company -- analyst
got it. ok. that's helpful. i'm just framing the opportunity there.
so my second one is, you mentioned that customers are now using three modules on average, which is up from 2.7 last year, i believe. and i just want to ask if there are any modules that you identified this year or are worth calling out as particular drivers of that upsell? and in particular, how traction has been with those newer wisely modules?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes. i can take that one. so in terms of what is driving the increase in module adoption, it is the combination of the engagement suite and the pay suite, and then to a lesser extent, things within the core commerce platform, whether that's virtual brands, dispatch rails, etc. in terms of the engagement suite, we've been really pleased with the traction we've made thus far.
we've hit our revenue goals for 2022, and as we look ahead for 2023, continue to look at that part of the business as overall growth accretive. so so far so good, and we'll keep pushing on the engage suite. so far so good.
pat mcilwee -- william blair and company -- analyst
awesome. thank you, guys, and nice quarter.

our next question comes from the line of douglas bruehl with j.p. morgan. please proceed with your question.
douglas bruehl -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hey. thanks for taking my question. maybe one for peter. wanted to dive a bit into stock-based comp.
so how are you sort of balancing the long-term management of that while looking toward eventual gaap profitability? thank you.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yep. thanks, doug. great question. so from a high level, stock-based comp as a percent of revenue, we anticipate that coming down in 2023 as compared to 2022.
i would say, one thing to keep in mind is you still have share issuances around time of the ipo where the valuation was higher than it is today, running its way through the model. so that will take some time to normalize before what you see in stock-based comp is more reflective of recent valuation and equity grants. that said, the way that we approach equity compensation is really through a holistic lens and making sure that the total offer for our employees, inclusive of comp-based bonus, equity, etc., remains as competitive as possible. while at the same time, making sure that we have the right incentives in place that align with the incentive of our shareholders.
so that's a little bit about trends in the near term and how we think about things philosophically.
douglas bruehl -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
great. that's all from me. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] and our next question comes from the line of brad reback with stifel. please proceed with your question.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thanks very much. peter, maybe we can dig into the fiscal '23 guide a little bit. because if i -- except the olo pay contribution for '23 and '22, it looks like you're guiding to high-single-digit core sub-revenue growth.
so i'm just trying to figure out what's going on there.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yep. that math is directionally right. i think what you're seeing for the '23 guide is a more cautious approach to the year in light of some of the dynamics we talk about in the second half of the year playing out into 2023. and the thing to point out specific to sales in deployment cycles is you have the initial sale, which then there can be a quarter or two in which that bookings converts to revenue.
so whatever bookings impact we had in the second half of last year plays out into the first half of this year. so really that's what you're seeing in the -- implied in the guide for '23.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great. and then one other. on olo pay, as you sort of approach this $15 million to $20 million run rate in '23, is that enough scale to be gross profit profitable? let's not talk about the margin. can you generate incremental gross profit dollars at that level?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
we can. so we can, and from an operating margin perspective, long-term. as i mentioned before, what really gets us excited about ola pay is the ability to be both revenue and profit accretive. and the reason for that is being able to maintain our sales efficiency and increased leverage in r&d and g&a to the extent we can increase our food driven by ola pay, our belief is a lot of that will drop to the bottom line and be very helpful from a profit dollar perspective.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great. thanks very much.

noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
thank you, stephanie. hi everyone. thank you for spending time with us today. in 2022, olo increasingly became the platform that restaurant brands rely on to make their digital priorities a reality, with the olo platform supporting approximately 87,000 restaurants and more than 600 brands, connecting them to more than 300 technology partners and more than 85 million guests, who transacted over the olo platform and processing on average more than 2 million orders per day.
in 2022, we grew annual revenues by 24%, expanded arpu by 8% to just under $2,200 per year, surpassed $23 billion in gross merchandise volume for the year, and processed more than $250 million in gross payment volume in olo pay's first year of general availability on the platform. olo continued our post-ipo transformation in 2022. olo pay had a marquee inaugural year. we broadened our platform's capabilities through the omnivore acquisition.
we brought on chief revenue officer, diego panama, to elevate our world-class go-to-market team. and we introduced our refreshed mission to serve as the engine of hospitality. consistent with this mission, olo is committed to helping restaurants use technology to provide personalized guest experiences across all touch points, while improving operational efficiency. this will enable brands to elevate the guest experience, drive incremental and repeatable sales and improve profitability.
we believe the future of the restaurant industry is guest-centric, empowered by digital solutions, and that olo is best positioned to realize this vision on behalf of our customers and their guests. now, more than ever, restaurants recognize the need to invest in technology as a means to better serve their guests and operate their businesses more effectively. our hard work in 2022, our network of brands, partners, and guests, and our comprehensive product suite, all enable olo to meet the needs of our customers, and we believe we've set the table for great things to come in 2023 and beyond. in the fourth quarter, olo continued to see success with both new and existing customers across all three product suites that enable restaurants to increase the number of digital orders, better engage their guests by providing best-in-class experiences, and tap into digital native pay solution, tailored toward the need of restaurant operators.
this quarter, we continued to expand our relationship with existing customers. bravo brio restaurant group, buca di beppo, eggs up grill, lucille's smokehouse bar-b-que, tgi fridays, and virtual dining concepts deployed olo pay, and toojay's gourmet deli deployed olo pay as well as our engaged solution. virtual dining concepts, the parents of mrbeast burger and other virtual brands, adopted olo pay at all of its brands, which include more than 3,000 virtual restaurants operating in more than 2,000 restaurant kitchens. this also included lankybox kitchen, a family focused virtual brand launched by virtual dining concepts, which adopted our ordering, dispatch, rails, and olo pay modules.
as part of the deployment, olo also completed the pos integration project with chuck e. cheese. this integration allows chuck e. cheese to make lankybox available at more than 450 locations, more efficiently leverage its operations, as well as increase revenue per square foot.
and for those of us with young children, yes, the virtual concept is a tie-in with lankybox, a youtube channel with millions of subscribers focused on entertaining children. tgi fridays, a casual dining restaurant with more than 300 locations in the us, continued to invest in its digital presence. since launching olo pay, tgi fridays has seen positive growth in authorization rates by more than 5% and our data suggests an overall drop in fraud rates of more than 1%. in 2023, tgi fridays is focused on bolstering its tech stack, improving its custom app, and launching a new loyalty structure to enhance its current guest experience, with olo driving ordering and payments across these properties.
all of these customers have added olo pay to their existing solutions. and this quarter, we also welcomed captain d's, a fast casual seafood restaurant with more than 550 locations. captain d's deployed our ordering, dispatch, rails, network, and olo pay modules. this deployment represents our largest olo pay customer to-date by locations and continued success in multi-module deployments to new customers.
it also reflects our ability to deploy within highly franchised enterprise environments. olo pay continues to perform across all key metrics. fraud prevention and authorization rates are higher than we initially expected and higher than traditional methods. from an adoption perspective, olo pay has been broadly deployed across both enterprise and emerging enterprise, across new and existing customers, and across service models from names in casual dining to quick service to virtual brands.
and as our fastest of 14 modules to get to $1 million of monthly recurring revenue, olopay is becoming ubiquitous, and we're very excited about the product's future. this quarter we also welcomed new customers such as kroger and tender shack. more on kroger in a moment. tender shack, a bloomin' brands' virtual brand with more than 800 locations launched our rail solution this quarter.
previously, tender shack integrated directly with only one of the top three marketplaces. by adopting our rail solution, the virtual brand can now integrate with all major marketplaces, and easily synchronize menus, pricing, location data, and item availability in order to streamline operations through a single integration. as i typically provide an update on product enhancements on this call, i'm excited to announce that we've expanded borderless identity availability to all olo pay customers, including those with custom ordering websites and apps, enabling more brands access to increase revenue potential and actionable guest data. borderless capabilities simplify the checkout process for guests by eliminating the need to create or remember a password or manually enter credit card information at every purchase.
in addition to helping restaurants meaningfully increase basket conversion, guest retention, and visit frequency. borderless enhances the guest experience and deanonymizes transactions by linking them to guest profiles, enhanced qr code ordering, furthering our on-premise dining offerings, and integrated geolocation partner notifications, which automate arrival notification for brands utilizing our expo interface, eliminating the need for multiple tablets and ensuring food is prepared and handed off efficiently and on-time, resulting in fresh food for guests. while we typically broadcast our product release events, this quarter we have decided to present these enhancements live at beyond4, our annual customer conference which will be held in napa, california next week. for those not in attendance, you can view demos and further details of our winter product release events at olo.com/quarterly release.
olo is constantly innovating and enhancing our platform, ensuring all restaurant locations are always able to use the latest technology to their advantage. we continually release updates to products and enable new use cases that didn't exist before. and our customers look forward to our quarterly product updates, where we demonstrate these improvements, as well as the extensibility of the olo platform. in prior quarters, i've discussed how we leveraged our ordering module to enable virtual brands for restaurants.
and more recently, our products have moved into new verticals, such as convenience stores. in the fourth quarter, we were able to develop a new product use case with expo, our tablet-based software solution that's part of the ordering module, focused on enhancing the preparation and hand-off workflow, this time for the grocery industry. kroger deployed approximately 1,600 locations, bringing sushi and floral delivery to guests nationwide. this is just one example of how the company is deploying it's accelerating with digital strategy to position kroger for long-term sustainable growth.
for olo, enabling guests to purchase prepared foods and flowers from multi-unit grocery stores represents an emerging vertical, expanding olo's total addressable location count by almost 30,000 locations, representing more than $37 billion in annual foodservice sales. before i speak about our corporate strategy and our outlook for 2023, i'd like to recognize team olo. olo earned best customer data platform from digiday in recognition of our platform's ability to deliver personalized marketing messages, better guest experiences across channels in restaurants and digital, and better understand guest preferences. i believe this demonstrates that our strategic investments in guest data are already paying off.
as we look ahead to the new year, i'm energized to build on our strong foundation. we have a robust product portfolio. we are further empowering our go-to-market organization. we remain profitable on a non-gaap basis and are growing revenue at a strong rate.
as i mentioned earlier, we believe that the future of the restaurant industry is guest-centric. it's important for restaurants to build better relationships with their guests in order to increase guest lifetime value, retain existing guests, attract new guests more easily and drive revenue and profit. and part of the reason olo is well-positioned is that everything we do is tied back to a knowledge of the guests. a co-product of the secular shift from analog to digital is the de-anonymization of transactional data, enabling the olo platform to tie every transaction back to a guest profile.
this enables more personalized experiences going forward and gives the brand a fresh understanding of guests' lifetime value, the new north star metric for running a restaurant. this guest centricity is what olo is uniquely positioned to do and what traditional players are unable to do and have not done as a result. olo is more than a commerce platform. olo is a data platform, a two-sided network and conduit between 87,000 restaurants and 85 million guests.
and this year, we'll continue to be laser-focused on our mission and key investments, in order to drive long-term growth and value to restaurant brands and shareholders alike. these investments will be directed toward payments, on-premise experiences, guest engagement, and continuing to empower our go-to-market organization. historically, the olo platform has predominantly focused on pickup and delivery, categories that represent roughly 29% and 8% of overall restaurant transactions, respectively. over the past year, we've moved into drive-thru and on-premise, categories that represent roughly 38% and 24% of overall restaurant transactions, respectively, more than doubling our serviceable footprint.
currently nearly 100% of drive-thru and on-premise transactions are analog. and as olo moves into both on- and off-premise as a focus, we have a great opportunity for olo to unlock the path to digitize 100% of transactions, as restaurant look to better serve guests and do more with less. in order to capitalize on this opportunity, we expect to make additional investments in payments and on-premise experiences, which will enable us to drive operational efficiencies for our customers, increase guest satisfaction, as well as enable olo to capture more transactions and drive revenue growth. and as an extension of this, we expect to invest in our engagement solutions to enable hospitality that makes every guest feel like a regular.
we'll also invest in capacity and yield management to create a more integrated technology experience for our customers. i spoke about this briefly on the prior call. to remind you, expanding these offerings vertically throughout the restaurant value chain will capture and leverage crucial data from both on- and off-premise transactions, increasing the efficiency of the kitchen and improving the guest experience. this allows olo to be the brains of the restaurant operation, the orchestration layer of production, which further solidifies the mission criticality of the olo platform.
in short, our platform will provide a full-integrated technology experience with capacity and yield management capabilities that will enable restaurants to use one vendor for all of their needs, focused on enabling the restaurant kitchen to become as productive as possible and as profitable as possible. and as we build out these capabilities, we expect to further invest in and empower our sales and marketing organization, while maintaining sales efficiency. all of these investments will propel olo into the great opportunity ahead, one in which we are uniquely positioned to increase restaurants' digital penetration from 15% to 100%. leading restaurant brands know that digital capabilities will give them the ability to do more with less, intimately know and better serve their guests and operate as one unified business.
i am more confident than ever that we're on the right path, and i'll be delighted to share our successes along the way. and with that, i'll hand it over to peter to discuss more detailed results. peter?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
thanks, noah. today, i'll review our fourth quarter results as well as provide guidance for the first quarter and the full year 2023. in the fourth quarter, total revenue was $49.8 million, an increase of 25% year over year. platform revenue in the fourth quarter was $48.9 million, an increase of 26% year over year.
and olo pay continues to exceed our expectations, contributing just over $3 million in revenue for the quarter and surpassing $6 million in total revenue for the year. in terms of key metrics, arpu for the fourth quarter was approximately $571, representing a 13% increase year over year and a 2% increase sequentially. continued growth in arpu was driven by further expansion within our existing customer base, including continued adoption of our engage and pay suite. in terms of active locations, we ended the quarter with approximately 87,000 active locations on the platform, a 10% increase year over year and a 4% increase sequentially.
and lastly, net revenue retention was approximately 108%, up 100 basis points sequentially. for the remainder of the financial metrics disclosed, unless otherwise noted, i will be referencing non-gaap financial measures. gross profit in the fourth quarter was $37.3 million. this compares to $32.6 million a year ago.
the year-over-year increase in gross profit was driven by continued growth in revenue, partially offset by increased compensation cost to support new locations coming onto the platform and, to a lesser extent, processing costs associated with olo pay. sales and marketing expense for the fourth quarter was $6.9 million or 14% of total revenue. this compares to $4.6 million and 11% a year ago. over the past year, we have invested additional resources in our go-to-market team to fully capitalize on the growth opportunity from our significantly expanded product portfolio.
research and development expense for the fourth quarter was $15.8 million or 32% of total revenue, compared to $12.8 million or 32% of total revenue a year ago. on a dollar basis, we increased investments in r&d in order to unlock future growth opportunities related to olo pay, borderless capability, and on-premise ordering. general and administrative expense for the fourth quarter was $11.5 million or 23% of total revenue. this compares to $10 million and 25% a year ago.
the year-over-year percentage decrease represents continued optimization of expenses as our organization continues to scale. operating income in the fourth quarter was $3.1 million compared to $5.2 million a year ago. net income in the fourth quarter was $5.6 million or $0.03 per share based on approximately 180 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. turning our attention to the balance sheet and cash flow statement.
our cash, cash equivalent, and short- and long-term investments totaled $451.2 million as of december 31st, 2022. pursuant to the share repurchase program, which we announced in september 2022, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares for a total of approximately $20.1 million. regarding cash flows, net cash used in operating activities was roughly zero in the quarter as compared to $10 million used a year ago. free cash flow was negative $1.6 million, compared to negative $10.6 million a year ago.
i'll wrap up by providing our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2023. for the first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $50.5 million and $51 million, and non-gaap operating income in the range of $600,000 and $1 million. for the fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $213 million and $215 million, and non-gaap operating income in the range of $11.4 million and $13 million. when preparing our financial projections for 2023, we took a prudent approach.
while the restaurant industry has seen some recent improvements in cost pressure and labor and digital ordering has remained durable, our approach was to balance these favorable trends and desired long-term investments against the backdrop of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. from a revenue perspective, a few things to call out. first, our guidance assumes approximately two-thirds of incremental revenue growth will be driven by existing projects currently in deployment, with one-third of incremental revenue growth driven by in-year bookings and deployment. this mix has historically had a larger weighting to in-year bookings.
and by emphasizing a larger share of revenue contribution from existing projects and deployment, we believe this to be a more cautious approach to planning for the year ahead. secondly, given our visibility into projects currently in deployment and a healthy sales pipeline, we expect revenue growth to reaccelerate in the second half of 2023, driven primarily by arpu expansion. we ended 2023 with customers on average utilizing three modules per location, and therefore, have a great runway for growth to expand across our existing 14 product modules. and lastly, given olo pay's continued momentum, we are estimating revenue contribution in the mid to high teen millions for the year.
as it relates to location, as a reminder, and in line with what we've discussed in prior quarters, approximately 12,500 subway locations transitioned from the platform in late q4 2022 and will no longer be included in active location total in the first quarter of this year. for the full year 2023, excluding the impact from subway, we are modeling 6,000 location adds for the year. in terms of gross margin, we expect a 200 basis points decline year over year due to olo pay's growing mix of overall revenue. this is an expected part of our long-term plan and reflects the strong early adoption of olo pay and its strategic role within olo's mission-critical commerce platform.
we believe olo pay will be a fast-growing part of our business for years to come and will be accretive to our revenue growth and profitability. moving on to operating expenses. this year, we intend to continue our investments in sales and marketing to align with the rapid expansion of our product portfolio. 18 months ago, we had roughly a third of the product modules we have today, and we are rebalancing the size and skill set of our sales and marketing organization in order to effectively seize the opportunity ahead.
while further investment in sales and marketing is needed, we plan to retain our strong sales efficiency. additionally, as a reminder, our annual user conference, beyond4, will occur in q1 this year, which will result in higher marketing expenses of approximately $1.5 million in the first quarter. in terms of research and development, we anticipate increased leverage as the year progresses and on a full year basis. in terms of general and administrative expense, we anticipate increased leverage on a full year basis as we continue to scale the business.
all said, we expect our combined revenue and expense target to yield a modest improvement in operating margin for the year. philosophically, we have always been focused on balanced growth and efficient investment in the business. we believe that has served the business well over time and it is how we are approaching 2023. our investment plan this year takes into account the rising cost of capital and the macro environment, which is reflected in the opex leverage we expect to gain in 2023.
with that, i'd now like to turn it over to the operator to begin the q&a session. operator?

thank you.[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of gabriela borges with goldman sachs. please proceed with your question.
gabriela borges -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. thank you. noah and peter, i wanted to better reconcile your macro comments with the guidance. the slowdown that you're forecasting in 1q '23, are you already seeing signs of a slowdown in your business in terms of customer willing to invest or deal closure, the deal delays? just want to understand the implied growth in 1q '23 relative to the quarter that you just reported.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes, gabriela. i can take that. this is peter. thanks for the question.
so one of the things we talked about in the second half of last year was a dynamic in which both sales cycles and deployment cycles were elongating. and part of the reason for that was that some of the things that the industry was working through in the form of labor constraints and increase in commodity costs, etc., that really caused them to turn their focus to dealing with those pressing issues. we have seen some improvement within the industry with respect to those dynamics, so unemployment improving, commodity costs improving, etc. but when we thought about our plan for the year ahead, we wanted to put forth a plan that we felt was more prudent despite maybe some of the positive signs we're seeing in the end market.
so for both arpu and active location counts for next year, that was the lens from which we built the plan. and what you're seeing in the first quarter is really the outcome of some of the elongated deployment and sales cycles that we talked about late last year, and then in the back half of the year, what you're seeing is a reacceleration of growth as the things that we did book begin to deploy.
gabriela borges -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. that makes sense. and then the follow-up would be on the guidance for margins relative to your comments on balancing growth and profitability. so with the forecast that you're giving for revenue, if you take a framework where you're looking at combined revenue growth and profitability of some kind of rule of 40 framework, it looks like the combined profile of growth and profitability is moving backwards.
in other words, based on your revenue forecast for this year, i would have expected to see more margin expansion. so maybe just a little more detail, how do you think about leverage this year given all the comments you just made on the forecast for revenue?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes. so i think we've done a good job in terms of expanding margins in the bottom line given the commentary that we shared from a gross margin perspective. so as olo pay becomes a larger portion of the revenue mix, that will have an impact on gross margins. and what we've done this year is to balance that dynamic by increasing leverage in r&d and g&a, and having some offset in sales and marketing knowing that that's an area that we want to invest in given the expansion of the product portfolio and the opportunity ahead.
so i think we've done a pretty good job in terms of being able to expand operating margins despite gross margins declining in the near term.
gabriela borges -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that makes sense. i'll ask one more if i may, which is, i think you've talked last time about the opportunity for more ai, automation in some of the ways that customers interact with their products. would love to get an update there on some of the things you're working on. thank you.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
thanks for the question, gabriela. i think that there is clearly a larger digital transformation that is happening in the industry and what we've been witnessing for 17.5 years now. and part of that, certainly in recent months, has been a focus around automation and ai specifically. i think our perspective is, all this digital transformation, inclusive of artificial intelligence within restaurants, is a great thing if it can make the operator experience better, it can make the operation more profitable, and at the same time, it can up-level the guest experience, it can make the guest feel greater hospitality, not less hospitality.
and so that's how we sort of think about areas where we can apply automation and digitization in our business. how can we do things like yield management and capacity management in the kitchen to make the kitchen more productive and to better set expectations of when orders will be ready based on ai and machine learning, so that the guest is coming in and getting their food fresh and ready or that a delivery driver is coming in and getting the food fresh and ready. we love the idea of using that automation, but not sort of throwing the baby out with the bathwater and losing some of the warmth and hospitality that guests love about restaurants. i think put together, we see the opportunity for all of this digital transformation to drive greater hospitality, not less.
gabriela borges -- goldman sachs -- analyst
i appreciate the detail. thank you.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer

our next question comes from the line of clarke jeffries with piper sandler. please proceed with your question.
clarke jeffries -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi. thank you for taking the questions. first on the grocery store opportunity, i wonder if you could give a little more detail on how that opportunity may be different in terms of sales cycles? i would imagine much more unified customers rather than disparate franchise customers. what opportunity do you see actively being available today in terms of how they are providing digital ordering? and then, what could be the future for maybe working with grocery delivery partners, say like an instacart or other kind of marketplace vendors in that space?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
clarke, thanks for the question. i think this is an exciting new vertical for us. it's something just reflecting back on the very early days, although we always thought restaurants are the first vertical, they are not the only vertical for what is fundamentally an on-demand commerce platform. so obviously, we've taken what we've built initially for restaurants.
we've expanded that in past quarters into the c-store space to the extent that you have convenience stores operating fresh food programs. as a reminder, there are about 55,000 of those around the country. now, we're seeing expansion into the grocery space, again, with fresh food programs, with food that is prepared made to order, but also importantly with flowers, with a floral department. i think that's a good representation of another product category that shares some of the same characteristics as prepared food.
it's highly perishable, made to order, just in time, and that's really what our platform was designed to do, unlike some other traditional e-commerce platforms. so with regard to sales cycles, i think your commentary is right, these are usually larger grocers, more consolidation in the grocery industry. we see opportunity when we're getting pulled into providing our platform to augment foodservice programs and other opportunities like this floral opportunity that we saw. in total, we see 30,000 locations within grocery that are addressable for olo.
and if we look at the technomic data and see how much prepared food spend in the areas of those 30,000 locations, that's something around $37 billion of prepared food spend. so that's a great opportunity for us as well. and i think we will always be restaurant-focused and restaurant-first, but if we see opportunities to expand our platform into these other adjacent categories, that makes lot of sense, and if we can serve as the engine of hospitality for them at the same time, that's wonderful. and to your question about delivery service provider partners, of course, we would love to work with as many delivery service provider partners in the b2b sense of delivery service providers and also marketplaces that want to use olo to access those grocery brands and that's part and parcel with olo being an open platform and expanding a large 300-plus member integrated technology partner network.
clarke jeffries -- piper sandler -- analyst
perfect. really appreciate the color. just a follow-up. on olo pay, certainly encouraging to hear the strength there.
it seems to be performing above your expectations. i think the word ubiquitous was even thrown around. is there a way you can help us think about how that is progressing in terms of attach rate on new customers, or if you're seeing a predominant amount of traction within the existing base? and just maybe help us frame, what are the holdouts thinking in terms of what are the frictions to not adopting olo pay within customers that you have approached and maybe did not adopt so far?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
we've really been thrilled with what has been broad adoption, as i mentioned. it's not just emerging enterprise, it's also enterprise customers, it's brands like captain d's and freddy's, and tgi fridays that are adopting olo pay. it's not just existing customers, it's also new customers. and of course, it's also not contained within one segment of the industry.
we have casual dining brands. we have quick-service restaurant brands. we have virtual brands that are adopting olo pay. so i think that's why we think about this as something that can be ubiquitous.
there are some restaurant brands that have long-term contracts that are in place with existing legacy payment processors, that say, i'm really excited about olo pay and all these things that you're able to share about how others are getting value from it. i can't move off of this contract until x date, and i think that's part of how payments works. for many, many others, we have seen an excitement to move over to olo pay and use that as a way of making a lower-friction guest experience and also have all the other benefits for the operator of a lower cost of ownership, higher authorization rates, lower fraud rates, etc., that olo pay has really proven at.
clarke jeffries -- piper sandler -- analyst
really appreciate it. thank you very much.

our next question comes from the line of terry tillman with truist securities. please proceed with your question.
connor passarella -- truist securities -- analyst
perfect. thanks, guys. this is connor passarella on for terry. appreciate you taking my questions.
just wanted to start first. so you touched on one of the areas of opportunity being the potential for voice ai to displace drive-thru. and i think last quarter, we talked about some important partnerships there. i just wanted to get an update if you're seeing any evidence of that so far? and maybe if you can remind us on the opportunity for drive-thru from a dollar perspective? any color there would be helpful.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
sure. yes. going back to last quarter, we spoke about three partners that were in the drive-thru voice artificial intelligence space doing basically a replacement of the old-fashioned rolling up to the speaker box and speaking to somebody who is inside on a headset instead of replacing that with voice ai. so conversenow is one of those, think3 is one of those, and then valyant ai was another.
and i think there's a broad interest from drive-thru operators, largely qsr brand drive-thru operators to think about how they can use digital in the drive-thru. just by the numbers, drive-thru is the largest segment gained share during covid and has held onto that share. it now is the plurality of all restaurant transactions, representing 38% of total industry transactions. so drive-thru by itself is as large by transaction count as both takeout and delivery combined.
so we think that's an excellent opportunity for us to engage with our partners for the ordering. and i'll remind the group that we also have been working at drive-thru for some time now with the drive-thru as a hand-off mode. in other words, a guest placing an order through the app, through the website, and saying, ""i want to collect this order, but i don't want to have to get out of my car. i want to be able to drive up to the window, pick up my order, and be on that way."" some restaurant brands have the ability to do that through a second window, which is typically called a fly thru window, others do it in the traditional drive-thru lane.
but that's another way in which digital and drive-thru are coming together.
connor passarella -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. that's really helpful. i appreciate that. just a quick follow-up on the borderless rollout.
so so far, what have you seen from borderless and the ability to drive demands, and kind of what data are you seeing around customer success in terms of maybe repeat orders or anything success-wise there? appreciate it.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
yes. i'd say that the biggest thing that we have highlighted and i'll again highlight on this call is the impact that borderless, which to remind the group, is around a password-less login that's instead single-factor authentication, so that a guest doesn't have to remember a password, just uses their phone to authenticate themselves. the biggest impact is the number of transactions that are authenticated where a guest is logged into an account and not placing that transaction anonymously. so we talk about the de-anonymization of transactional data and borderless is fantastic at doing that.
we've gone from where traditional log-in, you wind up with only 30% of guests that are saving a card on file and creating an account and known by the brand, to over double that when you're using the borderless authentication and checkout. so that's a win for the guest. it removes a lot of friction from them. it's not just about accessing payment details, it's also about getting into an account where they have order history saved, they might have delivery addresses saved, etc.
it's a win for the operator and the brand, because now that order is getting tied back to the guest account and that enriches the profile of that guest and ultimately it helps the brand understand guest lifetime value, which we believe is fast becoming the true north metric for operating a restaurant, and what we're bringing to life with innovations like borderless.
connor passarella -- truist securities -- analyst
appreciate the color. thank you.

our next question comes from the line of stephen sheldon with william blair. please proceed with your question.
pat mcilwee -- william blair and company -- analyst
hi, guys. this is pat mcilwee on for steven today. so encouraging update with kroger this quarter. and you mentioned some sizable throughput in that segment.
and i just wanted to ask, is there a realistic opportunity for payment processing with just some or with all of those 30,000 grocery stores, and then also with the 55,000 c-stores? and if so have you seen any traction with those customers, i guess, more so on the c-store side for payments yet?
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer
i think it's super early and we're not kind of beating our chest and saying, ""you know, we are full steam ahead into these additional segments."" we think these are exciting opportunities for us to pursue and learn from, that's sort of how i would read where we are. now, kroger, i think, in the grocery segment and those that we've talked about in the convenience store segments, i think are great calling card deals. they are not representative of olo pay lands where we're processing the transaction through olo pay. so i think too soon for us to comment there.
but we do believe that olo pay is something that is broadly desirable as we talked about the different restaurant segments that have been excited about ola pay. i think the same can be said about why it would be appealing to c-store and grocery customers. and we do think that as a component of a larger guest centricity and guest-centric approach that, that holds a lot of appeal to really any merchant to understand that guest and to be able to unlock hospitality in this shift over to digital, and olo pay is a big part of that. so i'd say early, but we do think that that's an opportunity for us going forward.
pat mcilwee -- william blair and company -- analyst
got it. ok. that's helpful. i'm just framing the opportunity there.
so my second one is, you mentioned that customers are now using three modules on average, which is up from 2.7 last year, i believe. and i just want to ask if there are any modules that you identified this year or are worth calling out as particular drivers of that upsell? and in particular, how traction has been with those newer wisely modules?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yes. i can take that one. so in terms of what is driving the increase in module adoption, it is the combination of the engagement suite and the pay suite, and then to a lesser extent, things within the core commerce platform, whether that's virtual brands, dispatch rails, etc. in terms of the engagement suite, we've been really pleased with the traction we've made thus far.
we've hit our revenue goals for 2022, and as we look ahead for 2023, continue to look at that part of the business as overall growth accretive. so so far so good, and we'll keep pushing on the engage suite. so far so good.
pat mcilwee -- william blair and company -- analyst
awesome. thank you, guys, and nice quarter.
noah glass -- founder and chief executive officer

our next question comes from the line of douglas bruehl with j.p. morgan. please proceed with your question.
douglas bruehl -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hey. thanks for taking my question. maybe one for peter. wanted to dive a bit into stock-based comp.
so how are you sort of balancing the long-term management of that while looking toward eventual gaap profitability? thank you.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yep. thanks, doug. great question. so from a high level, stock-based comp as a percent of revenue, we anticipate that coming down in 2023 as compared to 2022.
i would say, one thing to keep in mind is you still have share issuances around time of the ipo where the valuation was higher than it is today, running its way through the model. so that will take some time to normalize before what you see in stock-based comp is more reflective of recent valuation and equity grants. that said, the way that we approach equity compensation is really through a holistic lens and making sure that the total offer for our employees, inclusive of comp-based bonus, equity, etc., remains as competitive as possible. while at the same time, making sure that we have the right incentives in place that align with the incentive of our shareholders.
so that's a little bit about trends in the near term and how we think about things philosophically.
douglas bruehl -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
great. that's all from me. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] and our next question comes from the line of brad reback with stifel. please proceed with your question.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thanks very much. peter, maybe we can dig into the fiscal '23 guide a little bit. because if i -- except the olo pay contribution for '23 and '22, it looks like you're guiding to high-single-digit core sub-revenue growth.
so i'm just trying to figure out what's going on there.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
yep. that math is directionally right. i think what you're seeing for the '23 guide is a more cautious approach to the year in light of some of the dynamics we talk about in the second half of the year playing out into 2023. and the thing to point out specific to sales in deployment cycles is you have the initial sale, which then there can be a quarter or two in which that bookings converts to revenue.
so whatever bookings impact we had in the second half of last year plays out into the first half of this year. so really that's what you're seeing in the -- implied in the guide for '23.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great. and then one other. on olo pay, as you sort of approach this $15 million to $20 million run rate in '23, is that enough scale to be gross profit profitable? let's not talk about the margin. can you generate incremental gross profit dollars at that level?
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
we can. so we can, and from an operating margin perspective, long-term. as i mentioned before, what really gets us excited about ola pay is the ability to be both revenue and profit accretive. and the reason for that is being able to maintain our sales efficiency and increased leverage in r&d and g&a to the extent we can increase our food driven by ola pay, our belief is a lot of that will drop to the bottom line and be very helpful from a profit dollar perspective.
brad reback -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great. thanks very much.
peter benevides -- chief financial officer
