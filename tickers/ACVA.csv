[operator instructions]. our first question comes from the line of ali faghri from guggenheim. your line is now open.
ali faghri -- guggenheim -- analyst
hi, everyone. thanks for taking my questions. so can you help me better understand the assumptions embedded in your second half outlook? in particular, i'm wondering about what type of volume growth in gmv per unit you're assuming in 3q and 4q.
william zerella -- chief financial officer
yeah, hey ali, it's bill. so i guess a couple of thoughts first. just keep in mind first that full-year guidance reflects about 60% revenue growth and that's substantially up from our initial modeling of the year at 40%. so pretty big upward revision there. that said, similar to what other companies in the automotive space have signaled, we're seeing a contraction in conversion rates due to the pricing normalization that's happening as the market adjust and we've taken that into account in our guidance. so we're effectively leaning a bit more conservative on organic growth in the second half until we see the market reached equilibrium.
i guess with that in mind, also few other thoughts here. so, keep in mind also that the second half of the year is seasonally weaker than the first half and q2 is typically the strongest quarter, which of course was turbocharged as a result of the market dynamics in the quarter. that all said, we're going to continue to execute against the playbook we have in terms of adding sellers and buyers to the platform, expanding our footprint right on the go-to-market side, investing in tact with the thought that we're going to come out the other end of this market adjustment being that much stronger. so, we did assume obviously that the market adjusting and it's going to drive some of these metrics the other way in terms of conversion rates and arpu.
ali faghri -- guggenheim -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and so just digging in further, i mean is the expectation of volumes could still grow quarter-over-quarter in the back half?
william zerella -- chief financial officer
we don't really guide, ali, the unit growth. i mean, there is always puts and takes between units and arpu. so we try to focus everybody in terms of what the revenue output will be. so we don't get to that level of fidelity typically. and again, it's going to be very much driven by market conditions. at the end of the day, we keep gaining market share. i think q2 reflected that really strongly in terms of adding sellers to the platform and buyers. so at the end of day, we're going to keep doing the same thing and then, however this plays out, it's in part going to be dictated by how the market adjust this quarter.
ali faghri -- guggenheim -- analyst
great, great, that's helpful, bill. and then just one more quickly on your comments about conversion starting to normalize here as used car prices are also start to normalize, shouldn't that also drive just more trade in supply making its way to auction? so, one thing we had heard about is with new car supply constrained, a lot of dealers were just keeping a lot of these trade-ins to sell at retail versus potentially wholesaling them and so while used car prices moderating could have a negative impact on conversion rates, couldn't it help just the overall supply of cars that are being sent to wholesale auction?
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
hey ali, it's george. i hope you're well and thanks for the question. right now, we're being prudent and we're assuming that based on what we're hearing from dealers that inventory is going to stay very short for q3. we also -- as you heard in the call, we said, q3 and q4 could be that leveling out and i think going into 2022, this will all be noise, from our perspective and i think right now, what we're assuming is dealers are going to still be in the same predicament and in summer, even assuming right now in q3, it actually might be the toughest, i would say, phase of this lack of inventory.
so i think, ali, that's really at least how we're thinking about the forecast right now and the lack of inventory and to your point, does that mean dealers maybe keeping cars that they would have historically wholesale, i think, yes, i think that's already happening. we have to assume that for now. fast forward, as these new cars come back, as the factories start to correct with the issues of the chips or other constraints they have, our new car dealers will have more cars, so go back to selling the cars that their brand is really aims to be selling, and they're going back to be wholesaling the types of vehicles that historically they've wholesaled. is that helpful. just to give a little more that color?
ali faghri -- guggenheim -- analyst
it is very helpful. thank you, george, and thanks, bill, for taking my questions.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
[indecipherable] sure.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of nat schindler from bank of america. your line is now open.
nat schindler -- bank of america -- analyst
yes, hi guys. thank you for this. so one, is there any revenue associated in the second half with max digital?
william zerella -- chief financial officer
hey, nat, it's bill. so there is, but it's not material. so, we haven't broken it out. it's relatively small, but it's just not material enough for us to breakout.
nat schindler -- bank of america -- analyst
totally understand. so, and i guess your answer from last question about being conservative on the change to what's going on the market, on the pricing side. when that -- the problem in the market is a lack of supply, which is driving the price up because there was a demand as the equation for used cars. so wouldn't if the pricing starts to normalize, we get more supply, are you taking any indication that supply is going to come back, in which case, is that overly conservative?
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
hey, nat. thank you. overly conservative, i don't know, but we're -- when you look at the correction that's happening as the prices started to decline, really sort of two third into the quarter. we started to see used car values decline, that's one trend happening. so that's something we're being conservative or not, it's starting to happen, so therefore, gmv in other factors will also imply lower gmv. so that is a fact. the other fact is dealers are getting to historical lows right now in inventory. how quickly that's going to change, you're seeing a lot of folks in the automotive market predict.
we didn't want to predict really anything more than sort of [indecipherable] we can control. so, we're predicting to your point, as we're modeling, that our new car dealers, which is where the majority of our supply comes from are going to have a low amount of supply and therefore a low amount of trades. so that is sort of what we're predicting, that is sort of what we're hearing from our new car dealers. there are many factors going on but yes, so we are predicting both. is that helpful or are you looking for [speech overlap].
nat schindler -- bank of america -- analyst
no, i think that's very helpful [phonetic].
william zerella -- chief financial officer
yeah, hey nat. let me add one more piece of the puzzle here, just to be clear. so when prices are declining, there is basically lower conversion rates on the marketplace. because buyers are more hesitant to commit, so these prices with the exposure that, by time they sell the car, the price might be even lower. and it takes time for sellers to adjust to the new reality in terms of what their inventory is worth.
so what it does, it kind of has the opposite effect of what has happened in q2 when prices go up. because there is a lot of very high conversion because buyers know they're going to flip that car and probably sell for more than even thought because prices are going up, when prices are going down, you have the opposite effect. until you get to this normalization equilibrium where it's kind of a more of a normal marketplace. so while it's adjusting your conversion rates go down and i think that's consistent with what you would hear from other players in the industry.
nat schindler -- bank of america -- analyst
that makes perfect sense, but i was also wondering if on the other side, when the manheim index was approaching two are going north of two and pricing was going crazy, i would think the dealers would just simply not sell their car into the auction, because the longer they keep the car on the lot, the more valuable it was.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
yeah, nat, we had a great quarter, so that works. [speech overlap] we're gaining a lot of sellers. we also mentioned that we had more, net new sellers this year added -- this first half of the year than we did all of last year. so we're gaining interest in the platform. these other trends are important. i would say we're all looking at these quarter to quarter trends. we are just trying to, as you know our style, we're always prudent. here. we do believe there is going to be dealers are going to have a lack of inventory this quarter. and so how do we forecast is obviously what you see.
nat schindler -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, great. thank you.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
yeah, certainly,
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of john colantuoni from jefferies. your line is now open.
john colantuoni -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my questions. it's good to see the faster than expected progress in penetration rates for acv transportation and capital. talk about if there was any benefit to adoption from the unique inventory environment that we saw and if you consider the increased engagement to be sticky once the inventory cycle begins to normalize in the second half and i have a follow-up.
william zerella -- chief financial officer
okay. let me go through transportation first. i think one of the reasons why transportation adoption increased is the -- we are getting better. so when you think about pricing, you remains [phonetic], just to kind of give it one example, we're now to the point where 20% to 24% of the moves in transportation. we have a programmatic way [indecipherable] our acv transportation load board to have a price from a carrier and what does that mean? that means that, because we're starting to invest in technology, we're starting to invest in our network, we're able to really optimize our lane pricing for transport, allows us to have predictability and the more we invest both in our technology for transport and we invest in our network of carriers, it allows us to get stronger as the price [indecipherable] appropriately.
and ultimately, if we've got the right pricing, the right service for our dealer partners, they're going to choose acv transportation. so i would say we're very proud of what we've done with a acv transportation. in addition, i would say there is also just more density. so density and scale, obviously also helps in getting better pricing from our carriers. and acv capital, we did announce that we had some product mix additions recently. we are listening to our dealer partners. it's also the first time, we're starting [phonetic] and it's just now starting to market our product in our app.
so, think this was an early product we mentioned during the ipo. we mentioned words in the ipo process that it was nascent at the time. we're just starting to market the product, we're just starting to add additional staff, but really with both initiatives, we're investing in technology, investing a great people, we're absolutely excited about the progress and the progress is add [phonetic] or exceeding in both cases what we set out to do this year.
john colantuoni -- jefferies -- analyst
great, that's helpful. and now that you've developed capabilities behind consumer sourcing, which you mentioned in the prepared remarks, could you at some point start to leverage the connection, you've now made between dealerships and consumers to become an online marketplace or platform for dealerships to begin selling retail ready cars to consumers? thanks.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
thanks, john. as of right now, we're not yet planning or broadcasting to helping dealers sell cars to consumers beyond our tools. so for example, within the max digital products. we have the industry-leading way to merchandise car by car and some of the largest dealer groups in the country use this platform. and these are data tools. it helps really market this one specific ford 150 and exactly why this ford 150 should be priced at $35,000 and why ph] this value. so we've got these unbelievable tools that now help dealers enrich their data, enrich their experience. as of right now, on that, i would say as it relates to e-commerce, that's at least for today and all of our broadcasting and helping dealers.
where you are seeing us lean in and start to open up a little bit more on our strategy, is dealers buying cars from consumers and dealers taking in trades and competing in this digital world. you're going to [indecipherable] -- and we mentioned this in our ipo that this will be coming. we're starting to lean in there. we do think peer to peer will shrink over the coming years. we think dealers are very well positioned to buy these cars from consumers and we're here to help dealers compete in this digital world and helping them take more of these cars. whether they're going to take them as a trade or whether they're going to turnaround and wholesale it, we're here to help dealers.
john colantuoni -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you. appreciate the questions.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of ron josey from jmp securities. your line is now open.
ron josey -- jmp securities -- analyst
great, thanks for taking the question and lots to unpack here. another great quarter. but i wanted to maybe follow up on that colantuoni [phonetic] question just now and acv capital. and george, you mentioned capital is now available in the app and that drove awareness and probably getting to mid-single digit attach rates. can you talk a little bit more just about how you plan to ramp awareness besides just putting in the app. talk about the drivers here to ramp awareness and really where you think this can get to over time from that would what we say mid single-digit attach rates from low single digits prior. do you think this gets to mid-single digit? talk to us a little bit more about the strategy with capital and i have a quick follow-up.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
certainly. we are, tight now, currently doubling the size of the sales team, that's all in the model. we now felt comfortable and ready that it was time to increase that the specific sales teams and think about when acv starts to have these [indecipherable] product sales teams, the product sales teams leverage the leads and relationship from the other company managers. so we're already on the phone with thousands and thousands of dealers among and the specialized teams, whether it would be acv capital or max digital et cetera. these teams now are leveraging the fact that we have these relationships. we are doubling the size of acv dedicated product sales team. we're really excited about that. our expectations are in line with what we -- for your second question, our expectations are in line with what we outlined in our -- while we're on the road show. bill, you want to give a little bit more of our expectations were acv capital should be in the next handful of years.
william zerella -- chief financial officer
yeah. hey, ron. so, yeah, if you remember, on the road show, we talked about really getting to a 20% attach rate over five years. so i would say we're making really good progress this year. we'll most likely kind of update you and the investors on that kind of longer term path and whether or not we're getting there faster. we're certainly getting to our milestones a lot quicker on the transport side, but we're really happy with the progress that we're making on our capital and by the way, we're also not just investing in sales. we're investing on the tech side as well.
so we're dedicating more resources. so just continue to make our offering more compelling and competitive in the marketplace. so yeah, what i would just say at this point is we're making great progress. we're going to be looking at, most likely in the order of 4x prior year revenue from capital granted it was small last year, but over the next few years, it'll certainly become more meaningful. and will we get there faster than five years, i don't want to comment at this point. i would just say that we're making really great progress and obviously, as you and the other investors know, this is a very high margin business for us. so it will be accretive to margins over time.
ron josey -- jmp securities -- analyst
perfect, that's super helpful. and then one quick follow-up. i think, george, you mentioned you added more dealers on the network in the first half in all of last year. as we get to normalization in the market whenever that is maybe in the first half of next year or the first quarter. just talk about if you think that it will be easier to add sellers then or is the environment is going to be the same in terms of adding sellers and i think you also said vehicle inspectors are up 3x in the last three years. so you're seeing progress in feet on the street. so just talk to us about adding more sellers as things normalize and whether it might get easier or not. thank you.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
yeah, certainly. so it seems obviously between our brand increasing, our network increasing, territory managers getting out into the field, it could be also going public, in all these factors, the acv brand is out there. we're growing sellers in a very successful way. so we're very excited. maybe a way to answer your question instead of will it grow even faster next year, is our mix is also changing. so we think about selection of assets on the acv platform, you're noticing our gmv has gone up and really some part of that is, yes, vehicle costs right now are higher, but part of this is the mix of selection has increased.
so think we will get, we think a broader selection of vehicles as we grow. so that would be part of the trend we think can happen going into next year. our product mix is growing, so as we're adding on new dealers and we're successful from growing from one product to multiple products. you've heard me talk about in a prior call of hybrid marketplace as an example. we've been adding, just an example, about one dealer group a week coming on to private marketplace, which has been exciting. so think, yes, we'll keep adding more and more sellers. i don't want to predict that growing even faster at this point, but really excited about what's going on here.
and so far the momentum and the scale is helping and i believe the product mix is also helping. so when you look at this sort of broad strategy we've outlined to you a few months ago, is we're both a marketplace and data story, you're seeing that become true. we didn't say we're just a marketplace company. we had this vision. we're executing on this vision. and you can see it's very focused and executing on both sides, marketplace and data. and i think it's in that mix, we add tremendous value back to our dealer partners. when you add tremendous value back your dealer partners, it not only helps in retention, but also helps us grow more with [indecipherable] with acv. hopefully, that's helpful.
ron josey -- jmp securities -- analyst
it does. thank you, george. thank you, bill.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of bob ludvik from cjs securities. your line is now open.
stefanos crist -- cjs securities -- analyst
good afternoon, this is stefanos crist calling in for bob. congrats on the quarter.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
thanks, stefanos.
stefanos crist -- cjs securities -- analyst
so, you discussed your goal of expansion to 160 territories. can you discuss the tight labor market and how, if at all, it impacting your ability to fill those?
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
sure. first of all, in the territory manager side, we are slightly ahead of schedule. so we are on plan. we will come back over the next few quarters and i'm very confident to say, we'll have reach full coverage coast to coast, that we have the territory managers out there in the field to reach out to all the franchise dealers from a supply perspective and these other products. the other part of, i would say maybe also related to your labor question is writing vehicle condition inspectors. we are just looking at some data earlier on this and this is helpful [indecipherable] to share is right now, our average time from posting a vehicle sector teammate to -- and this is average, obviously some higher, some lower, but the average -- from posting a vci teammate to selecting one is 16 days, that's average. and it's about a month from start date, meaning when they start being trained to be an inspector teammate. so that's pretty strong. so when you think about that. there is a lot going on in this world right now and i don't want to underestimate or under signal. yes, i would say labor challenges are a challenge i think for all companies, to be safe, but [indecipherable] those two rolls out in the field right now, we're executing our goals and it's going well,
stefanos crist -- cjs securities -- analyst
that's great color. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of rajat gupta from jp morgan. your line is now open.
rajat gupta -- jp morgan -- analyst
all right. good afternoon, good evening. thanks for taking the questions. a lot of questions around the conversion, second half, but just has a bit of a longer-term question. did the second quarter market dynamics accelerate the value of your offering or did it allow you to penetrate into more customers than you would have previously thought maybe at the time of the ipo and if yes, that is the case, do you expect those customers to be sticky and would that then imply that versus march versus today, moving away from the near-term dynamics on the market. i'd say 2022, 2023, does that automatically imply more units just because we were able to accelerate your customer base in the second quarter, just any color around that would be helpful. not sure if my question was super clear, but i can go over again.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
sure, rajat. first, thank you for the questions and let me try to answer that. i think there is a few questions within that. so i would say we accomplished our goals for the first half. as you know, we've been at this now for a little over five years, we've got a model, we go out there executing our model and i would generally say bringing on sellers in the first half, we are very successful, i would say the part that's different is most sellers have less inventory than in prior, let's say, last year, let's say in 2019. so part of what's been going on, and this it's in the mix already. there might have been a dealer partner who had 220 cars they wholesale with us, they may only have 150, 160 whether they're keeping them or whether it's they just don't have enough, whether it's less overall retail, whatever those reasons, you really are seeing a signal, i would read into this less about, i would say, keeping, more about dealers have less cars. and we hear this every day. dealers will reinforce i'm giving you all my wholesale and more and more of them signaling that we're getting a lot of their vehicles. but it is going to be -- there are going to be some these dynamics that are short-term, right now, we all read about it every single day and that's really all we're really broadcasting there as it relates to the supply as we think dealers have less cars in their lot but which mean less retail and likely, less conversions to wholesale.
as relates to the stickiness, i don't have any data to really sort of give you on stickiness or retention. but i will say that we believe our strategy is working extremely well. we believe this idea of not only at being a great marketplace by having this end-to-end platform of services is going extremely well. we believe offering more and more capabilities, investing in these partnerships -- these dealer partners is going well, investing in our team is going well. so i would say really no change on our belief of how any of these market dynamics are going to change retention. i think the other part, the third part of your question, would be, could it accelerate our growth even more and i don't know how to answer that. bill, i don't know if you want to answer it, but i think at the end of the day, we're growing extremely well and all these dynamics could mean accelerating growth. but obviously, we can see you to that,
william zerella -- chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, what i would add is that look, we've been -- as george said, we've been really successful in adding a lot of sellers on the platform and obviously, they've had a chance to see how we perform as a marketplace. and the mix has changed as well. so we're more broad based at least right now. to the extent we come out the other end of this adjustment in the market and those sellers feel good about the value-add from acv,then we should benefit. whether it's more accelerated than would have been prior, it's kind of hard to say. all we can say is, we feel really good about our penetration and market share gains.
rajat gupta -- jp morgan -- analyst
got it. okay, great that's helpful color. i'll jump back in queue,
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
thanks, rajat.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of alex potter from piper sandler. your line is now open.
alex potter -- piper sandler -- analyst
great, thanks. thanks for the question. great quarter guys. so i wanted to go back to a question that was asked earlier about how -- i mean, obviously there is limited supply and prices are high, so all else equal, the dealers, if they can, should just sell the inventory they have to retail and not go to wholesale and your response was we just put up a great quarter, which is obviously i think indisputable at this point, but generally, marketwide that dynamic is accurate. there has been a disincentive to push vehicles to wholesale, which implies that you guys are basically just running away with the market and i don't think that's a secret anymore. so the question that i have is, do you experience a change in the competitive response of some of these other platforms when you're out talking to dealers, trying to pitch sell as a partner, do you find yourself pitching yourself against the digital platforms more often than you used to? that's my only question. thanks.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
yes, thanks, alex. yeah, we're, if you remember, we had, and i hate these names, but one of the large auction companies had a digital company right away. so when we started this journey, there is already digital competitor. so i would say this entire time, there has been digital competitors and has been physical competitors. if you look in fairness, when you look at the, let's call it, 8 million to 9 million cars that were sold at physical auction last year and we're very proud of the number of cars we sold, we look at it from a percentage basis, we're still small. we're growing, but i think the majority -- i think if you added up most of the other digital competitors collectively, i believe which still just be a fraction of our size.
so i think the majority of the competition of where these vehicles are going, it's still the physical auctions [indecipherable] really trying to [indecipherable]. and yes, there are other digital companies, but this whole category should grow and again, we believe we're the leader and will reign the leader in the category, but still the majority of the cars have been going through to the physical auction lanes and we've got some room to grow this category, i think the broadening of our services and you're seeing now with broader mix, different types of vehicles, we started the journey with just the lower priced vehicles, the typical $3,000 to $5,000 car with 120,000 miles on it that a dealer would never want to retail -- a franchiser would never want to retail. we're still getting a lot of those units, but we are seeing the type of inventory and acv grow, which is fantastic because we're really becoming a broader marketplace. sellers are becoming buyers, buyers are becoming sellers. it's in that mix and then offering other data services that we believe we can really, not only become too dominant marketplace in time, but add more value to our dealer partners
alex potter -- piper sandler -- analyst
very good, thanks. thanks a lot. nice quarter.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of nick bacchus from raymond james. your line is now open.
nick bacchus -- raymond james -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the great quarter. just on cohort behavior. maybe you could just talk about any learnings or changes in dealer behavior in your newer cohorts, newer territories and in terms of number of vehicles transacted per dealer or any other important metrics you look at versus past cohorts in the earlier stages.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
yeah. nick. we really aren't sharing any cohort data about this. so i can share something, but i'll share with you is, how we're going into these new markets has starting to broaden. we're looking at -- one of the themes we're looking at because right now, we're just getting into markets within the northwest and we're just opening up some of the markets on the west coast. how we're going in, we're looking at, for example, there is dealers for the first time ever being introduced acv through our private marketplace for their part of a dealer group, that will be different
we wouldn't have had that entry. we'd have to wait till we got that first seller, that first buyer, if that makes sense. so our broader product selection will be helpful. the first time you're sort of hearing about acv may not be the day we hire our territory manager, they go through training and we got into the market. so i would say that part will start to be different. that's a new theme, i would just say over the last 60 days or so. but that would be like the newest thing. i don' think there's something else that we can share from a cohort basis.
william zerella -- chief financial officer
not really.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
okay. hopefully that's helpful, nick.
nick bacchus -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. thanks very much. and then just real quick on the programmatic buying, just maybe just a little bit more about this new offering and the launch in the fourth quarter, do you view as a meaningful kind of incremental driver or is it more of a complementary type feature?
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
sure. so there's two parts of our programmatic buying product strategies. the first part is live and we've got some dealers who are already integrated with acv. the dealers who integrate with us for our buying api tend to be larger dealer type groups. they have a technology department and have let's call the internal technical resources to integrate with our api. so that product is live. and we're starting to integrate with additional dealer groups.
that product allows a large dealer who has the technical capacity will automatically putting bids on acv without any human intervention and not only picking the types of vehicles, but in addition to the types of vehicles. it's condition and other factors. so think basically what a human would do and picking inventory, we're ingesting our condition report into the buying process, so that their machines and our machines can help them at the end of the day buy the vehicle, so that live and we're very excited to get that live.
we are working on this part of our platform for a while and we're so happy to get some dealer partners now using it and the feedback has been tremendous. it's still early days, but we're actually seeing, for example arbitration rates being lower than our averages for dealers buying without having any human intervention, which is just awesome. that's product one, that's the buying api and i believe, i'm not sure, but i believe we're the first in the industry to do programmatic buying via an api, at least as far as i know.
the second is, we've started to build a buying matrix approach where dealers can, via interface, select the types of vehicles they would like to buy as well as condition, and so it's basically emulating what our api does, but it's an interface of the dealers that don't have the engineering team to integrate with us. so we're going to have both options, i think whether they have an engineering team and ability to integrate or if they are going to use our user experience. at the end of the day, they do the same thing.
that product is in beta. that one is not live. we only have a few dealers using it today. because i'm getting such positive feedback, i felt why not announce it. i usually wait for products that are fully live. but the feedback we're getting is tremendous so far, so we'll be looking to launch that. and really, what does it do to your second part of your question is, it adds a persistent demand into the platform for the vehicle segments that we have whether be one of our api buyers are one of our the preferences on the bio-matrix, we have this persistent demand and persistent demand is helpful and think about persistent demand plus the acv marketplace demand, the two together is extremely unique. because there some vehicle types, you really want an auction format and you really want that competitive bids and the api and our bio-matrix actually it's not just a separate thing. it actually delivers results into our 20 minute auction. so yeah, we're very excited about that i can't wait to roll it out even further.
nick bacchus -- raymond james -- analyst
sounds exciting. thanks for the time
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
yeah, thanks nick.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of daniel imbro from stephens, inc. your line is now open.
daniel imbro -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
yeah, good afternoon guys. thanks for taking our questions and i'll squeeze me near the end,
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
thank you, daniel
daniel imbro -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
[speech overlap] just on how the industry should change as supply demand normalizes. maybe first, so as conversion rates begin to tick down, and it takes longer to sell the vehicle, does the capability of having land help you or hurt you win share. i mean obviously dealers right now have plenty of excess capacity, but as lots begin to fill up, are you seeing more dealers asking you to start moving inventory off their lot and if so, bill, can you talk about your ability to flex your land capacity through their partnerships or buying land to service that demand?
william zerella -- chief financial officer
yes. it certainly and so well, i'll go through both of those for you. so, it doesn't seem like at least this year, land will be much of a problem for franchise dealers. now, if you've driven by any lately but there aren't many cars of these lots. so i would say, digital -- i believe, this is my opinion -- is an advantage because, at least you can try to sell it wholesale while it's still on your lot. you can debate between wholesale-retail. so, i believe upstream in digital for this environment is beneficial, not a detriment. i don't believe land -- it maybe historically, let's say 10% to 15% of dealers historically had a land challenge as it relates to wholesale, whatever the right percentages you can guess 10%, 15% or 20% of dealers have land challenges. right now, it's an even lesser percentage
the second part of your question. if we needed land, there's a lot of land out there in this country. so we're not worried about if we have any land, there is -- it's noise. we have a few, very few [indecipherable] going on in small parts of the country that we don't usually broadcast. if we really need it, we would just stand it up. atlanta is generally cheaper these days and it's really just not a problem. if we need it, we can just go and rent it from somebody we need it, but for right now, it's by far not even in the top three things that are usually come up, like, why they would go with us for not with us, but land is not even in the top three at this point.
daniel imbro -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
great, that's helpful. and then one just following up, i think earlier you mentioned helping dealers maybe source directly from consumers. can you talk a little bit more about that service, how differentiated. it is maybe from some of your other peers offer and then longer term, as you help dealers source inventory maybe outside the auction channel, how do you balance that longer-term risk to them., finding ways to buy outside of your digital auctions and maybe directly from consumers. just, how you balance that long-term impact.? thanks.
william zerella -- chief financial officer
yeah, certainly so our dealer partners right now look at it for our current products, one of our current products is called live appraisal. so what does that mean? that means our dealer markets to their consumers, that they will pay more for the cars than others. the others aren't using our live appraisal. some might use acv's brand in their marketing, some may not use our brand, it's is really up to them of whether or not they're going to use our brand. but the marketing would say something like this. why have a local dealer or national dealer give you a price in your car when you can have one of the largest digital auction, we're having dealers across the country, bet on your car, get transparency, know what your car is worth, things like that.
so our dealers are marketing to consumers that they're going to pay more because they partnered with acv basically. now that might be [indecipherable] and the dealers lot where there is like a 10 and imagine like coffee and i you go there. and if i can event or it might be us going to consumers driveway and actually doing a 20 minute inspection and a 20 minute auction. so that was sort of thing. that's our first product and our dealers are enjoying this product because there's differentiation. they're not just -- everyone's going to say we're going to pay the most of your car. it's almost become noise. i'm going to pay the most of your car, you're going to pay the most of the car, just kind of like, why? how?
so at least they've got something to market and our dealer partners and that's expanded quite a bit this year, we mentioned earlier, how much live appraisals has grown. in addition, you're seeing us build [indecipherable] data and pricing capabilities that will help our dealers sort of compete more and more. we're alluding to that. the max products will help because they're behind the scenes doing appraisals even when it doesn't go to currently our marketplace, there is additional products were alluding to that will be coming as part of our product roadmap that will help dealers compete for consumer car sales. we love the category, we think our dealer partners are very well positioned to buy more cars from consumers and you can sort of think about acv's role, so the shopify type of role for all these dealer partners
they need someone that has the scale, the nation's largest inspection network, the technology, the data and that's what we provide for our dealer partners.

and with that, let me turn the call over to george.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
thanks, tim. good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. let me begin by thanking the acv team for continuing to deliver superior value to our growing dealer network, which resulted in record second quarter results. i would also like to welcome our newest team members for max digital. we're excited to have you on board and look forward to working together as we deliver best-in-class data and digital technology to the dealer community.
turning to slide 3, i'll begin with highlights of our second quarter, then share some perspective on the automotive market. as you can see, our momentum continued in the second quarter, where we transacted $2.1 billion of gmv and over 150,000 vehicles sold on our digital marketplace, both of which were records for acv. in fact, we transacted more gmv in q2 than we did during all of 2019 and we delivered very strong revenue of $97 million representing a 117% year-over-year growth.
our strong top line performance can be attributed to three factors. first, we continue to execute on our proven playbook to grow market share by attracting new dealers into our ecosystem and by capturing additional wallet share within our existing dealership network, second, historically high used vehicle values along with historically low retail inventories resulted in record quarterly gmv and arpu and also drove elevated conversion on our marketplace. and third, adoption of our value-added services accelerated quarter-over-quarter and was well above our expectations. simply put, strong execution by the acv team along with continued customer adoption of acv's suite of offerings and favorable market conditions yielded truly impressive financial results.
turning now to the broader market backdrop, we have clearly been operating in unchartered territory over the past year on both the demand side and supply side of the automotive market and these market dynamics contributed to record financial performance in the second quarter for acv. as a reminder, in our first quarter earnings call, we provided an outlook for the balance of 2021 that assumed a more normalized environment, particularly around used vehicle values. i think it's fair to say that our timing was off by a few months, but the market is indeed turning. wholesale vehicle prices after peaking in early june, started to decline in july and continue to soften, which has been well-documented by the industry data providers.
the other half of the equation is supply. last quarter, we also discussed how the lack of new car inventory due to tip shortages and other supply chain headwinds, could factor in our 2021 performance in the second half of the year. in q2, automotive franchise dealers generally had enough supply to support strong retail performance. however, there is an emerging view at the third quarter or perhaps fourth quarter could be the low watermark for retail supply. of course, these market dynamics are transient.
in fact, most industry participants see the new vehicle supply challenge recovering in early 2022, which would be a tailwind for trading volumes and benefit our wholesale supply. ultimately, this is great news for acv. a more normalized pricing environment allows buyers and sellers expectations to converge. more supply coming into the market feeds the top of the funnel, which in turn drives higher volumes in our marketplace. it will take a few quarters for these market dislocations to settle out. but in the meantime, we continue to execute on our plan and take market share.
as bill will discuss in more detail, we have again increased our outlook for the year and are now expecting to deliver approximately 60% revenue growth for the full year. for context, this is a full 20 points higher than our outlook at the beginning of 2021. to frame the rest of our discussion today, we will focus on the three top level elements of our strategy to drive long-term shareholder value; marketplace growth, tam and product expansion and operating scale.
let me begin with marketplace growth. turning to slide 5, we transacted a 153,000 units in q2, which was 74% growth year-over-year and 19% growth quarter-over-quarter. due to the impact of covid-19 in our q2 2020 financial results, we included comparison to q2 2019, which as you can see was very strong at 174% growth. as i mentioned earlier, our unit growth was driven by continued market share gains, as measured by the number of new dealers transacting on our marketplace and by increased wallet share from existing dealers. in fact, we added more sellers to our platform in the first half of 2021 than all of 2020.
unit growth also benefited from very strong customer conversion and our marketplace, which was driven by the low supply environment i spoke about earlier. as expected, we did see conversion begin to normalize in july as market participants began to adjust to declining wholesale values. the record gmv transacted in q2 was a tailwind for arpu, reaching a new high. gmv per unit of 13,900 increased around 90% year-over-year, which reflects both higher vehicle values and an increased mix of front line vehicles transacting on our marketplace. while elevated vehicle values are transient, a sustained mix of front line vehicles on our marketplace could be a nice long term tailwind for arpu.
moving on to slide 6, we continue to make great progress toward our territory coverage goal on the 160 by year-end. this will be about a 30% increase in our footprint since the beginning of the year and will position us to engage with nearly all the franchise dealers in the us. we have continued to attract great talent across our organization with some pretty ambitious 2021 goals. to put this in perspective, we ended q2 with nearly 1,700 acv teammates, effectively doubling our size over the past two years.
turning to slide 7. one of our largest teams at acv is our vehicle inspectors. this team has grown threefold over the past two years supporting acv's hyper growth while delivering highly differentiated services to our dealer network. and with increased territory density along with new technology investments, we're beginning to scale this business, which is a key element of driving long-term operating leverage in our model.
moving on to slide 8, you can see that our strong unit growth and increased arpu yielded nearly a 100% auction marketplace revenue growth and greater than 270% growth versus q2 2019. turning to slide 9, i'd like to highlight one of our offerings contributing to the strong unit growth. in this case, through consumer sourcing. you've been hearing a lot lately about direct consumer sourcing in automotive. acv was an early mover in the category with our live appraisal offering. we enabled our dealers to offer consumers an efficient and effective way to sell their vehicles in acv's marketplace.
we expect these vehicle that dealer locations or in a consumer's driveway and deliver a real time market-based offer based on what dealers are willing to pay. live appraisals has grown significantly in recent quarters. in q2, year-over-year unit volume growth more than a 150% and accounted for high single-digit percentage of our total volume and we plan to expand our offerings to help our dealers compete for consumer-sourced inventory.
let me pivot to our second element of our strategy to drive long-term shareholder value, tam and product expansion. moving to slide 11, i would like to highlight another feature acv launch that enables highly efficient vehicle sourcing for our dealers through programmatic buying. we have invested in two flavors of programmatic buying. our buying api enables dealers have their own technology platform or centralized buying centers to integrate into our real-time api to bid on vehicles on our marketplace based on their inventory wish-list all without human intervention.
our second offering, currently in beta, is our buying matrix, which enables dealers who don't have their own automatic bidding capabilities to create inventory wish-list within acv's user experience including vehicle type, condition, pricing and location parameters to fill their inventory needs automatically. marrying these programmatic buying capabilities with our nationwide inspection team, enables us to offer both highly efficient and trusted experience, which we believe will deliver better results for our dealer partners
turning to slide 12. i would like to remind you about how our marketplace, data and technology, combined to power significant network effects. as more marketplace participants join our platform, we can provide greater liquidity and a better experience, leading to greater scale. this in turn enables us to collect more vehicle and market data bringing greater efficiency and more products. these reinforcing flywheel effects continuously improve our digital marketplace and improve our data services for our customers. ultimately, this drives greater liquidity, greater scale and greater efficiency, which is demonstrated in our attractive unit economics.
an exciting new addition to our data and technology capabilities, is our acquisition of max digital. moving to slide 13, i'd like to touch on some key points about the max digital acquisition. core to acv's mission, is our ability to provide automotive dealers with technology platforms and solutions to compete in a market that is rapidly shifting to digital. max digital is a leading provider of saas-based automotive data and software solutions that provide dealers with unparalleled capabilities to source and sell wholesale and retail vehicles.
max digital's pricing guidance, merchandising and inventory management products create data driven insights that complement acv's current data services, resulting an exciting growth synergies. these synergies include cross selling max digital products into acv's customer base and driving additional marketplace volume by arming dealers with tools to price and sell their wholesale and retail inventory more effectively. for example, acv's pricing engine will be tied directly into max's tools helping dealers more effectively buy and sell used vehicles. this is just one example of many exciting opportunities our teams are exploring and we look forward to sharing updates going forward.
moving to slide 14, let me wrap up this session with an update on our value-added services. we had an excellent quarter for both acv transportation and acv capital. our transport business has expanded significantly over the past year and it's been a key enabler of attracting new buyers to the platform. our expanded carrier partner network and fast cycle times resulted in attach rates of around 45% in q2, well above the mid 30s attach rates achieved in 2020. the number of transports more than doubled year-over-year to around 70,000 in q2.
acv capital, which is still in its early days, has been gaining a lot of momentum in the market. attach rates approach the mid-single digits in q2 with loan volume improving greater than 30% quarter-over-quarter. we also saw material increase in revenue per loan following the launch of our new finance offerings in early june. it should be noted that acv transport and acv capital are tracking ahead of our milestones and achieving our long-term targets.
in summary, as it relates to our tam and product expansion strategy, i think it's clear that we have created some exciting new avenues of long-term growth for acv by leveraging our powerful data capabilities, expanding features across our technology platform and driving adoption across our growing suite of digital solutions.
with that, let me hand over to bill to take you through our financial results and how we're driving growth at scale.
william zerella -- chief financial officer
thanks, george and thank you, everyone for joining us today. q2 was a record quarter for acv across many key financial metrics, and we made significant progress on our long-term strategic objectives. on slide 16, i'll begin with the review of our second quarter results. we delivered very strong top line and bottom line results with revenue of $97 million, which generated year-over-year growth of 117% and was well above the high end of our guidance range. adjusted ebitda loss of $4 million or 4% of revenue was nearly flat versus q1 2020 and was also very favorable relative to our q2 guidance.
this performance was driven by our strong revenue results in the quarter and underscores the inherent operating leverage in our business model. as expected, cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased year-over-year and was in line with our expectations. the year-over-year increase was driven primarily by the mix of acv transport revenue, which grew 10 percentage points year-over-year and exceeded our expectations. total operating costs, excluding cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue improved by approximately 1,100 basis points and we delivered this improvement, despite growing total operating costs, excluding cost of revenues by 76% year-over-year, once again highlighting the leverage in our business model.
turning to slide 17, i will cover some additional detail on revenue. we have a diverse mix of products and services. our auction marketplace revenue comprises about half of our revenue today with our customer assurance offerings and our value-added services, making up the other half of revenue. we had very strong broad-based performance across our portfolio in q2, most notably within our services business as noted benefit from high transport attach rates. and in our option marketplace business, which grew 98% year-over-year, profitability remained strong.
moving to slide 18, i would like to discuss the operating leverage in our business. here, we're showing historical adjusted ebitda margin along with our updated outlook for 2021. as discussed with you last quarter, 2021 is a year of significant investment for acv and as you've seen throughout our discussion today, we're delivering on territory expansion with nationwide coverage expected by year-end. we're launching a host of new offerings to drive additional market share and adoption of our value-added services and we're investing in technology to scale our operations.
these investments translate into a 66% year-over-year increase in operating expenses excluding cost of revenue and despite this increase, our adjusted ebitda margin is down just 400 basis points year-over-year, again highlighting the underlying operating leverage in our business model. lastly, on operating leverage, note that we have absorbed max digital's expense base without impacting 2021 opex guidance excluding cost of revenue.
now, i'll turn to guidance on slide 19. for the third quarter of 2021. we are expecting revenue in the range of $82 million to $85 million, a growth rate of 22% to 26% year-over-year and an adjusted ebitda loss in the range of $20 million to $22 million. as a reminder, q3 2020 was a very strong quarter for acv with the year-over-year revenue growth of 104% as our business recovered from the covid impacted second quarter of last year. as such, we've included the two year growth comparison, which yields approximately 160% growth relative to q3 2019.
for the full-year 2021, we are expecting revenue in the range of $332 million to $338 million, a growth rate of 59% to 62% year-over-year and an increase of $25 million from our previous guidance. adjusted ebitda loss is now expected to improve by approximately $17 million to a range of $62 million to $65 million. as george discussed earlier and consistent with our commentary from last quarter, we believe it's prudent to assume that the favorable market dynamics driving elevated conversion on our marketplace, higher unit prices and supply headwinds for dealers, will continue to normalize in the back half of 2021. and finally on guidance, my earlier point about our investment plans, we are expecting total operating expenses excluding cost of revenue to grow approximately 66% for the full year 2021.
to wrap up my comments, let me highlight our strong capital structure on slide 20. we ended the second quarter with $664 million in cash and equivalents $124 million of which reflects the float in our options business. note that we generated $27 million of cash flow from operations during the quarter due to an increase in the float of our marketplace since march 31, 2021. the amount of float on our balance sheet can fluctuate meaningfully driven by the business trends in the final two weeks of each quarter.
we ended q2 with $500,000 of long-term debt associated with our acv capital business down from $7 million in q1. given our strong cash position, we optimized our cost of capital by paying down the revolving credit facility at current levels, self-funded the acv capital business reducing interest expense.
and with that, let me turn it back to george.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
thanks, bill. before we take your questions, let me summarize. we are extremely pleased with our execution in the second quarter, which illustrates the momentum we're seeing in the market for our leading digital platform. we continue to gain market share by attracting new dealers to our marketplace and by growing wallet share within our existing customer base. we are executing on our [indecipherable] expansion plans, we're launching exciting new offerings that further differentiate us in the market and we strengthen our data services and digital platform, with the acquisition of max digital. we have a proven business model that can deliver scalable growth with attractive unit economics and structural operating leverage that we believe will drive significant shareholder value.
with that, i'll turn the call over to the operator to begin the q&a.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from john colantuoni with jefferies. your line is open.
john colantuoni -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks for my questions. how's it going? so i wanted to start with share gains. it looks like dealer wholesale was down 10% sequentially in 3q, which means acv continued to gain share. maybe you can talk about how dealer wholesale trended sequentially last quarter in the context of acv's nearly 20% sequential increase in 2q just to give us perspective on how the trajectory of your share gains has trended over the past couple of quarters. and i've got a follow-up.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
yes, certainly, john. i'll start and then bill and tim could chime in accordingly. but first, thanks for the question. as we mentioned, wholesale -- the dealer wholesale overall as a segment, whether it be physical or digital, just the wholesale category for dealer was down about 10% as a category, we believe. and we -- so that -- we were -- our units were obviously down less than that, but as a category, we saw that wholesale with all of the changes in the market that we described was down. we, in turn, we've had significant gain, obviously, in new sellers, record-breaking new sellers, where we've been launching our products, taking more share. so we did better than the overall market for dealer wholesale, so very proud of the results with really our ability to grab additional share. bill, do you want to add any more?
bill zerella -- chief financial officer
no. i think -- yes, i mean, the only thing i would add, john, is that, look, these are estimates to the best of our ability, trying to kind of scope out and try to figure out what the market has done over the last few quarters and year-on-year and what the trends have been. so these are our best estimates based on the data that we can see on our side.
john colantuoni -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and just wanted to ask a question about the programmatic buying tool. maybe talk about how quickly you expect to ramp it in q4 and how you'll be marrying it with the auction platform. and maybe you can talk about if you see it providing any gains to overall conversion rates on acv.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
yes, certainly. so yes, conversion rates have been very strong on acv. so we're very proud that we've really -- from a conversion perspective, the platform is operating extremely well. programmatic buying is just going to add additional capabilities from really ensuring our sellers are really getting the right value for these vehicles. as you know, there's two phases of our programmatic buying: first, the api; and then second, the user experience. the api, some of the largest sort of dealers and other types of buyers are already integrating with. and we're already starting to have low single-digit percentage of our buying is happening programmatically, which is obviously fantastic. meaning, these dealers are buying cars in the platform with computers automatically based on their preference. the user experience that's in beta right now with low handful of dealers, i would say, today, we're not broadcasting how many, is going really well. the dealers love the product. it allows them to really create their wish list. so for dealers that don't have a technology team or don't have a platform we can integrate, we have this programmatic user experience. so far so good. so i think we'll see it make, i think, a more material impact more likely throughout next year just because the rate of getting dealers trained, getting them onto the system. but in the meantime, we're already executing extremely well from a demand perspective.
john colantuoni -- jefferies -- analyst
maybe if i could squeeze one more in. can you talk a little bit about -- if you're able to talk a little bit about october, given wholesale prices have started to move back toward an upward trajectory beginning in late august, maybe how does that impact conversion rates and unit sales since the end of q3?
bill zerella -- chief financial officer
yes. john, it's bill. yes. so just if we kind of look back over the last few months going to the beginning of q3, as we talked about on our last call, we saw conversion rates declining in july through august on our platform as basically prices started coming down week over week. what we observed since then, though, was an increase in conversion rates in september. so we started seeing really a lot of strength on our platform in september. that continued through october and has continued through november so far. so we're certainly seeing a lot more stability in the market. prices actually started moving back up a bit in september. and i think you've heard probably similar comments from other companies in the ecosystem. so we've observed the same kind of dynamics on our platform as well. thanks, john.
operator
our next question comes from ali faghri with guggenheim. your line is open.
ali faghri -- guggenheim -- analyst
good evening. thanks for in my questions. hi. so i guess on your fourth quarter guidance, can you help us better understand what that embeds maybe for volumes and then gmv per unit, perhaps relative to the third quarter? even directional commentary would be helpful.
bill zerella -- chief financial officer
yes. ali, it's bill. so first, on gmv, you can assume it's roughly similar to what we've seen in q3. so no dramatic shifts in that regard on gmv. in terms of the other factors affecting guidance. as i mentioned earlier, we've really seen strength on our platform in october, an improvement in conversion rates, so more velocity on the platform. that's continued so far in november. that said, we know that q4 has seasonal factors associated with it as we get toward the holidays. so we have assumed those dynamics this quarter as in previous years. whether or not this year is different or not, who knows, but we've assumed it's kind of consistent with the same seasonal trends. so we baked that into our unit modeling. so you can expect potentially there is some modest decline in units quarter-on-quarter. but the counter dynamic that we had baked into our numbers is the new number of additional sellers that we have on our platform as well. so you've got kind of puts and takes. but that hopefully gives you some sense directionally.
ali faghri -- guggenheim -- analyst
that's helpful. and then as a follow-up here, on your transport attach rates of 50%. as you mentioned, you hit your midterm target in just three quarters. so where do you think transport attach rates can go from here?
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
i think over the -- between now and as we guide to our long-term plan between now and, let's say, march, i think we'll provide more guidance in this area. obviously, we need new goals since we're already hitting our long-term goals there. i think what's really exciting is not only the metrics we're hitting. i mean we're really hitting -- the kpis are going well. we look at actually -- we're making a little bit of money, where transport's starting to really turn into a fantastic business, and we're still in the early days. we just launched this carrier app. we put a dedicated tech team for transport, the metrics of us turning around cars quicker and quicker. you're starting to see all these dealers sending us just unbelievable sort of happiness. like i can't believe i ordered the car, it was shipped to me within 24 hours. so we really just think about taking a step back. i mean 50% has been a great accomplishment. we're making a tiny bit of money, and that should just improve. that's incredible. the kpis are going well. so i think we're really seeing within acv is transport was almost looked at as additional value add, but it's going to become a significant business. so hopefully, that gives you a little more color. but to your point, we're going to need updated goals and objectives since we've already hit our prior ones.
ali faghri -- guggenheim -- analyst
that's helpful, george. and then if i can squeeze one more in here. on the launch of the commercial private marketplace platform, i think you said 2022. should we expect that in the first half of the year or the second half? because i think originally, it was -- your plan was to launch it maybe at the end of this year, and it seems to have been pushed out a little bit. and then as part of that. are you beta testing that product with any fincos? is it being developed? and do you expect to have customers in place when that product is launched?
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, ali, for bringing that up. on the private marketplace for dealers, it's going extremely well, probably going better, faster than we were even expecting. you probably saw as part of the updates already of 20 dealer groups, we're launching about a dealer group a week right now. we shifted a little bit of the resources to focus on capabilities these big dealer groups wanted this year, and that's why you're seeing us say, hey, we probably won't launch our commercial offering until probably now closer to q2. as you know, whenever you're building these things, you really are prioritizing. but the work we're doing on the dealer group side is just incredible. and just remind you all why. you end up getting first look at their inventory. so the dealer groups will get a trade. they get a trade or have an aged inventory. it goes into our platform first. and with that, we end up getting a first look at the open marketplace. so we're still very excited about the commercial opportunity. it's also been a good time to probably double down in dealer. as you know, commercial as a segment is going to stay relatively low next year compared to prior years. so i think in the bigger picture of things, whether we end up launching it in late q1, early q2, you're just seeing us prioritize what our dealer groups have needed this year, and that has worked out extremely well.
ali faghri -- guggenheim -- analyst
that makes sense. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from stephanie moore with truist. your line is open.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
hi, stephanie
stephanie moore -- truist -- analyst
good evening. thank you. actually, just a follow-up on the last question. maybe i'm just missing something. but with these new -- the new acv private marketplace and getting these dealer groups engage, what's the benefit to them to first start out on this private marketplace versus the original acv platform? i guess i'm not seeing the distinction and why they would do one or the other, so just a clarification there would be helpful.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
yes, certainly, stephanie. so thank you. the -- our open marketplace is a fantastic way for dealers to sell their wholesale cars, right? so whether it's a fresh trade, whether it's an aged car, and to your point, we've had that for the last handful of years as a fantastic solution. what private marketplace solves is for dealers to have a platform to first sell cars within their group before letting those vehicles go into open marketplace, with acv's or any other auction. so look at it as like the order of operations. like what comes first? dealers want to make sure they're wholesaling the right vehicles, and they're not wholesaling vehicles that belong to their group. so there's been a couple of, i would say, competing solutions historically that have tried to do this. so we weren't the first, i would say, come up with the idea, but we were the first to execute extremely well in this category. and so what allows the dealer group to take, whether it be a fresh trade or an aged car, have their group in on it. another use case that's come out of this is dealer groups are buying cars from consumers at a group level. and let's say they buy x 100 cars from consumers in a given month, they don't necessarily know where that car will land, whether it will land at their ford store or their chevy store. so what some of these groups are leveraging acv for, again, as they're buying cars from consumers, it goes into acv private marketplace first. and then if they decide not to keep it within their group, it gets wholesaled on acv.
stephanie moore -- truist -- analyst
absolutely. no, that's very helpful. and then presumably, this could be something -- and i think you mentioned that this could also be used with off-lease vehicles that are also traded in with these dealers. and we're giving them the first look with their other franchise dealers as well. is that a fair point?
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
yes, that's correct. and as ali was mentioning, there's off lease. there's other categories within commercial, like fleet and other categories. we -- what those companies need is a little bit more of a co-brand or a white label solution, whereas our current platform is within the acv auctions proper. so we've got a little bit more work to do there to really have more of a white label platform than sort of an embedded co-branded solution. i'm trying not to get too technical here, but there's just a little bit more requirement that we need to deliver on before we can really match what the commercial partners are looking for. and then they'll also get the other benefits of acv, which is our inspection capabilities, more data per car. so think there are certain capabilities we still need, which we will deliver next year, and then they also get the benefit from our other sort of strong and differentiated capabilities.
stephanie moore -- truist -- analyst
absolutely. and then my other question just relates to seeing obviously very impressive operating leverage despite the meaningful investments. could you talk a little bit about maybe some of the scale benefits you're seeing in some of your older markets? whether it's the scale from you're building up the sales team, maybe some improvements on the inspection teams, whether they're just being more efficient. and then also, i would love to hear your thoughts on, as you are expanding into new markets, what you're seeing from a labor standpoint being able to attract talent. so all that would be helpful.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
yes, i'll start and then bill can also chime in. we're -- our mature markets are really, really going as planned. so we're -- we've been able to hire the talent in our mature markets. we've been able to increase efficiency. i mean you're seeing we're using a lot less capital this year than we had originally planned throughout the year. so the business has become -- has really operated extremely well. bill could add a little bit more there. in addition to what's going on in the field, our product and technology -- and i'm glad you asked the question. we haven't done updates so far in sort of our platform for inspections and other capabilities that maybe we'll do in the next earnings call. but we're really -- we're doing a great job of updating our inspections platform. it helps in that efficiency. it helps in delivering more superior results. but i would just say at a really high level, so far, so good. we're really delivering as planned. bill, do you want to add anything else?
bill zerella -- chief financial officer
yes. i guess what i would add, stephanie, is, look, again, this has been an investment year for us. and we're investing, frankly, across the entire business in pretty much every way that we can, right? so we're basically investing in order to be able to scale this company as we get to much larger levels of volumes in a very efficient way. and i think you're starting to see some of that. i wouldn't say there's any one particular area that i would point out. it's kind of broad-based across everything that we do operationally in terms of running the business. so again, i think, over time, these benefits will get larger as we grow in scale. but you certainly are starting to see some of that flow through the p&l this year.
stephanie moore -- truist -- analyst
great, thank you so much.

our next question comes from alex potter with piper sandler. your line is open.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay, great. hi, guys. so i'm going to ask a question maybe that's a little unfair, but i'll ask anyway. you mentioned, obviously, you've got richer mix coming in. clearly, the gmv per unit is super, super high right now, partially because of the market, but some of it is more structural in nature, more permanent in nature. so if you're in my seat, and you're trying to build sort of a long-term model, looking out past all of this covid disruption to something that's more normalized, where do you think gmv per unit settles out?
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
alex, that's a fantastic question. i'm glad you led it with it, it's an unfair question. what did we model in out years?
bill zerella -- chief financial officer
[indecipherable]
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
yes. i mean we had -- alex, i think it's a great question. in the long-term model we provided you all, we only had 12,500 in the long-term model. so it really is a great question. i'm not going to answer it. but i think what we're all sensing is we are starting to hit metrics that we would have predicted we would hit in our long-term model much sooner. we will need updated goals as we move along. i think it's a very fair question, but i don't think we're prepared to answer it yet.
bill zerella -- chief financial officer
yes. the only other thing i would add, alex -- and yes, it is a good question. if you look at the five-year model that we gave everyone in the syndicate for the ipo, right, we basically have already hit our arpu projection from 2025 now. in fact, it was three 73 in q3. if you go back to the long-term model we gave you guys, in 2025, we had projected it at three 71 in terms of auction-only arpu, right? so -- and to george's point, we've already exceeded the five-year projection in terms of gmv per unit. so certainly, some of this is a result of elevated prices for used cars, right? and that will start to moderate over time. but at least versus the longer-term targets that we put out there, we're already exceeding those. so...
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
and i think one more thing. i think why you're pointing this out is important as you are seeing our confidence that the acv platform is being leveraged for a broader segment of vehicles. and we're -- and you're seeing us lean in a little bit more that we're going to see -- we believe we're going to see a broader product mix on acv because i think our buying experience from either the programmatic apis, the filters we've added over the last couple of quarters, the confidence, the low arbitration rate, the confidence, really the ease of buying these unbelievable cars, dealers buying consumer cars, flipping them on acv, these fresh, fresh units, you're really starting to see our confidence that mix is here to stay. obviously, you'll see some price declines or whatever will happen in the industry, but mix is here to stay, and we're really excited. so alex, more to come on this as we start to sort of reupdate you all on our updated goals and objectives.
alex potter -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. great. that's actually a really helpful answer. maybe one last one then on acv transport. obviously, the attach rates there are trending higher than expected. that's all good to see. that's all top line commentary. it looks like profitability of that business is doing ok. it's at least some non-zero number. just any, i guess, commentary you can add on profitability in the most recent quarter and then looking forward for acv transport would be helpful.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
so i'll start, and bill can kind of chime in. to your point, efficiency across the business is going better than planned, right? and transport is one of those areas where we are ahead of plan. so if you ask why, it's -- we -- when we went public, we only had a few people on the tech team devoted to transport. at least we now have over a dozen. so we just in full -- you've seen us be very transparent. we've been hiring, scaling our tech. we're now somewhere around 300-plus people in our product and tech organization across the board. so we've got the resources. we've got more resources we're hiring. you're seeing us plan in q4 additional tech resources, right? you're seeing us lean in. we're doing a great job of expanding that team. and transport is one of those areas that's starting to benefit. and we're just releasing some of these products. and it will help not only turn this into a profitable business but also just as important is great kpis for our dealers, right, where they're getting the cars faster. we're starting to get more scale. carriers are saying great things about acv. you've got carriers around the country, who their whole job right now is just fulfilling cars in acv. entrepreneurs across the country, that's literally how they make all their money. and so we're really proud of where we're at. and i think the tech investments, along with the team we put on, this will create just additional efficiency and additional scale. bill, i don't know if i left anything out.
bill zerella -- chief financial officer
no. i would just add, i believe we spoke about this last quarter, that we've actually created automation in terms of scheduling and arranging for transports. and last quarter, we talked about 20% of all transport transactions were effectively fully automated, right? so no human touch. and that will just increase over time. so yet another example of...
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
and this part, we were just shy of 25%. the 24-point-something percent, almost 25% of our dispatches this past quarter, were done in a programmatic way where we had a carrier ready. so things -- like that's just another area where our team is just killing it.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
interesting. okay, thanks a lot. good quarter, guys.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
thanks. i guess.
operator
our next question comes from rajat gupta with jpmorgan. your line is open.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
great, thanks for that. thanks for taking the questions. so just had like a broader question more around the competitive landscape. we have backlog numbers maybe flattish quarter-over-quarter, maybe slightly more -- down more in the u.s. caroffer last night talked about a sequential decline. so you mentioned the overall market, you outperformed the overall market. but just within the digital dealer-to-dealer landscape, how would you rate your performance versus some of the peers? and then just broadly on competition. are you seeing some more pressures here as these other platforms start to invest more? eblock is going to come soon more aggressively in the u.s. so just broadly thoughts on competition and just your performance relative to them in the third quarter. any update on that would be helpful. and i have a follow-up.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
yes. raj, it's george. thanks again for the question. we -- my generic answer, without getting into any one of these hundreds of competitors we have, is we've had competitors from day one. one of our competitors sells somewhere around four million cars a year. one sells a few million cars a year. the digital guys, all of us in the aggregate, we're still a small percentage, right? and -- but we're -- in a way, to your point, the whole category is growing. so a way to look at last quarter is overall wholesale was down for the quarter more than likely for the category, dealer wholesale. and we had a record break in new sellers. i'm sure other folks are going to say they had record-breaking new sellers. and the segment is maturing. and i think the key is, like any business, what are you investing in. are you investing in technology? and do you have the resources to invest in tech to really create something differentiated, solving the problems for our dealers? and we love our road map. we love our execution. are you building the right culture? are you building the right team? i love my team. i love what we're doing so far. and are your dealers like raving fans of what you're doing? and i believe we've got that going for us as well. so there's always going to be competition. we have had it from day one, right, when we had very little resources, to today, we've got tremendous capital to work with. we've got great momentum. we've got a scaled tech and field team. so we're feeling good.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
great. and just follow up to that. the opex pickup here in the fourth quarter, is that just more trying to get ahead of your investment curve, given like volumes are significantly down quarter-over-quarter? just more...
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
i'll start, and bill can add in. yes, over half of that is just us trying to hire more people. bill can give a little more fidelity to it. but -- we're -- we've got dozens more of tech folks we're trying to hire, a few more sort of field resource folks on the sales side we're trying to hire. so this is -- we've mentioned it's an investment area, but over half of that is trying to expand on the people side. but bill, i don't know if there's any more fidelity we can add to that.
bill zerella -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean what i would -- the only thing i would say, rajat, is that, look, we're continuing to invest across the business as we had planned. although that said, those investments have been lower than previously projected. so while we're investing and opex was expected to increase about 57% year-on-year for this year, that dollar amount of investment is actually lower than we had modeled originally coming into the year. so we're kind of executing across the business on a lower level of opex spend, but we're kind of continuing to invest into growth, right, as we think about not just obviously the next quarter or two, but looking at over the next several years in terms of driving new product and new technologies into the market and operational efficiencies and kind of improvements that we just spoke about. but look, we're spending less money on the opex side than we had previously projected.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. got it. then just one last follow-up on just this competition landscape. are you seeing any sort of like -- are you worried about discipline here going forward as competitors come onboard? you just have like a lot of them investing. and how do you get around that? and then you've talked about this programmatic buying like other competitors have talked about to some extent. just any color on the economics on that front related to that would also be helpful.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
yes. our revenue per unit has been strong. we've -- we're -- to your point, there's been lots of competition out there. there always has been lots of competition. our revenue per unit is strong. we're adding a lot of sellers to the platform. we're doing that, obviously, even leveraging less operating resources than planned, right? so if you just look at this as like if -- if you look at this as like how are we performing amid all this competition, amid all these changes in the marketplace, we're doing extremely well. and so that -- you always have to be aware of your competitors, you need to be respectful. but i'm more focused on our plan, what we said we were going to do, go out there building relationships with thousands of dealers across the u.s., building great products, building great platforms that we can grow in the future. and you're really hearing us say we've -- we're really outperforming our plan, even though there's x, y, z competitors out there.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. and on the programmatic buying economics versus like just the traditional business, any quick thoughts on that?
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
yes. there's two parts of programmatic. you really heard me talk more about the buying side, which is there's really no difference on the economics. it's just a way to buy the vehicle. we haven't really announced yet any programmatic selling capabilities. you've seen us be a little bit more quiet on that. but i would say, at a really high level, we're -- those are all, to me, just features, is a simple way to look at it. and the revenue of sell and buy, in my opinion, won't go down. there might be some opportunities over the next few years for some of these models to -- but i don't want to lean in yet and create any expectations to sort of -- could some of this improve with some of these models. but i would say the simple way to look at it is this new buying and selling capabilities, i don't have any -- you're not seeing any lack of confidence on what we've been doing from a revenue per unit and execution perspective.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
it's a great thanks for all the color. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from bob labick with cjs securities. your line is open.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
good evening and thank you for taking my question. hi. i wanted to go back to gmv per unit. obviously, up materially year-over-year, and market has something to do with that. but it's also higher than a lot of your digital peers, and it also grew faster year-over-year this quarter than other digital peers. so you're obviously attracting a higher price point, i guess, and a higher mix. so maybe help us understand what you're doing differently that's enabling you to get this better mix and faster, better mix, if that kind of makes sense.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
yes, certainly, bob. and obviously you've been watching this for -- i don't know if i would tell everybody, i'll just call it at least a decade of auction experience. i won't date how long you've been watching this industry.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
you're being kind.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
yes. the simple way to look at it is we really have now full coverage from a buying, from a demand perspective, where if everything starts with demand because supply, folks will try you. but if you don't have the right demand, they're not going to try you a second or a third time. they're going to try you once, and they're not going to come back with that asset. and on demand side, we've got buyers for $100,000 cars. we've got demand for $75,000, $50,000, $25,000 for clean cars that have zero carfax issues, and we've got demand for $40,000 cars with a bad carfax. so when you look at the whole segment, even though we started out as sort of that back of the dealership type of auction where you just got the aged stuff, we've grown up, and we're now a full service auction. and we now have all the segments covered. so then the question is why? because as you know, we got a lot of that done before we got programmatic buying done. we got that done before some of these new features we just live. the reason is, is there's confidence that there's trust in the inspection, there's trust in the brand of acv. we're going to do the right thing. i could buy these assets. now that we've built that trust with the best tech in the platform, the best people, are the use cases, whether it's buying cars from consumers and flipping them on acv, whether it's an aged car that's sitting under a lot that's 60 days old, that right now, from a wholesale perspective, is great, every use case you could think about, you know all these details, bob. each one of those now, we've got a buyer for that. and they're ready and they want these vehicles. so the more demand you have, right, the more confidence you get from the supply to leverage the broad power of our platform.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it. okay. great. and then you hinted at this and a little while ago in one of your answers, i think. but as inspections are critical to your success, i think you've talked about in the past, upgrading the inspection system. you've been integrating multiple inspections. can you talk about the progress toward your, maybe for lack of a better term, next-level inspection system or when we might hear more about that?
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
yes, certainly. yes, we -- the internal code name is sia, our single inspection app. we don't have a name for it outside. but bob, it's going well. it's live right now. i believe we have over 30 inspectors...
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
inspector?
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
oh, so we have -- over 100 of our inspector teammates now are already utilizing this. so it's really beyond, i would say, an internal beta. we're really actively rolling this out. and whenever you're going from one platform to another, you really want to train your teammates. you want to make sure they're going from one platform to another. but just to remind everyone else on why this was a big bad. it's actually one of our largest product and tech teams that we have here, which is our inspection platform. it allows us to not only do our wholesale inspections more efficiently, but in addition, it really walks our inspectors through the right things to do per car, and it's starting to bring some intelligence. it allows us with that same app to do commercial or off-lease or other types of inspections. allows us to create reports on a vehicle. let's say, for example, that specific vehicle has a bad carfax, meaning, it's been damaged or whatnot, we can send that report, whether it be to carfax or autocheck or others. so think about multiple different use cases from one inspection platform. and yes, it's going well. we're out there. and by the, i would say, end of q1, beginning of q2, we would likely have all of our inspection team trained and moved over to this advanced platform.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it. okay, that's super. thanks so much.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
yes, thank you.

operator
good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. thank you for standing by, and welcome to the acv third quarter 2021 conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the call over to tim fox, acv's vice president of investor relations. please go ahead.
tim fox -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, operator. good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining acv's conference call to discuss our third quarter 2021 financial results. with me on the call today are george chamoun, chief executive officer; and bill zerella, chief financial officer. before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding future financial guidance. these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. a discussion of the risks and uncertainties related to our business is contained in our quarterly report on form 10-q for the three months ended september 30, 2021 that will be filed with the sec following this earnings call. also during this call, we may present both gaap and non-gaap financial measures. reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures are available in our earnings release, which we issued a short time ago. the earnings release is available on the investor relations website that is included as an exhibit in the form 8-k furnished to the sec. and finally, we will be referencing our earnings presentation today, which you can find posted on our ir website.
and with that, let me turn the call over to george.
george chamoun -- chief executive officer
thanks, tim. good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. let me begin by thanking the acv team for delivering another quarter of superior customer service to our growing dealer network and further differentiating acv in the market with highly innovative products. as i will discuss in more detail later, the automotive industry is operating in unchartered territory with the macro factors creating both tailwinds and headwinds for acv's business. while navigating through these crosswinds, we have continued to deliver strong performance with our financial results again exceeding the guidance we provided to you last quarter. moreover, in addition to gaining market share, we are investing aggressively to extend our geographic presence, expand our technology lead and position acv for sustainable long-term growth as the automotive market normalizes in coming quarters. turning to slide three. i'll begin with highlights of our third quarter. as you can see, our momentum in the market continued in the third quarter where we transacted the second consecutive quarter with $2 billion of gmv. we sold 141,000 vehicles in our digital marketplace, a 19% increase year-over-year and an increase of over 100% on a two-year basis. revenue of $92 million was above the high end of guidance and represented 36% year-over-year growth. our revenue outperformance can be attributed to three factors. first, we continue to execute on our proven playbook to grow market share by attracting new dealers into our ecosystem. second, both arpu and conversion rates after softening in late q2 and early q3 strengthened throughout the quarter. and third, attach rates of our value-added services were well above our expectations. overall, we are very pleased with strong execution by the acv team and continued customer adoption of our growing suite of offerings. as bill will discuss in more detail, we have again increased our outlook for the year.
we are now expecting to deliver 65% revenue growth for the full year, a full 25 points higher than our outlook at the beginning of '21. to frame the rest of our discussion today, we will focus on the three top-level elements of our strategy to drive long-term shareholder value: marketplace growth, tam and product expansion, and operating scale. let me begin with marketplace growth. on slide five, let's cover more details in the quarter. we transacted 141,000 units in q3, which was 19% growth year-over-year and over 100% when compared with q3 '19. year-to-date, unit growth is up 46% compared to 2020. the positive market trends i referenced earlier related to vehicle values contributed to gmv growth of 79% year-over-year and consistent with trends in the first half of this year. vehicle mix in our marketplace continued to move upmarket in q3. in fact, since last year, the percentage of vehicles valued over $15,000 doubled to nearly 40% during the quarter. while elevated vehicle values will no doubt normalize over time, we believe this higher mix of frontline vehicles in acv's marketplace is sustainable, resulting in a long-term tailwind for arpu. moving to slide six. we thought it would be helpful to provide context on the dealer wholesale market in relation to the broader automotive market. as i mentioned earlier, this is a case of competing crosswinds. the two charts on the top row highlight trends in the used vehicle market. sales of used vehicles remain elevated, nearly 70% above pre-covid levels, reflecting strong consumer demand and elevated retail values. the chart on the right shows how this demand environment has translated into historically high wholesale vehicle prices. strong demand and pricing have been nice tailwinds for acv, which you will see reflected in record level arpu this year. the two charts in the bottom highlight the trends for new vehicles, which paint a very different picture.
the well-documented semiconductor chip shortages in the automotive industry have resulted in a steep decline in new vehicle sales. the latest sa reading of around 12 million units is down 1/3 from pre-covid levels. and days supply of light vehicles at franchise dealerships has contracted to around 22 days versus historical levels in the 60s. so why does this matter? consumer trade-ins for new vehicle purchases are a critical input into the dealer wholesale market, historically representing a significant portion of the annual supply. with new vehicle inventories at such acute levels, the volume of trades entering the wholesale market has declined, resulting in a temporary contraction in the market we serve. i say a temporary contraction because the chip supply picture will no doubt improve in the coming quarters. and given the investments we're making in both territory expansion and technology, acv is very well positioned to benefit from the resulting recovery in the wholesale market. turning to slide seven. let me put a finer point on the supply dynamics in the market. based on wholesale transactions from a sample of 1,000 acv franchise dealer rooftops, we estimate that the dealer wholesale market contracted 10% quarter-over-quarter in q3 and 15% from q3 '19. this market contraction effectively mirror the decline in listings per dealer that we observed in our marketplace in q3. after increasing consistently through the first half of '21, this kpi decreased approximately 10% during the third quarter due to the market conditions. had listings per dealer remained consistent with q2 levels, we would have transacted approximately 150,000 units in q3 or year-over-year growth of 32%. simply put, supply headwinds cost us about 13 points of unit growth, all else being equal. despite these transient supply headwinds, our marketplace continues to attract new dealers.
we reached a record number of sellers in our platform in q3, and the number of unique sellers increased by 34% year-over-year in the quarter. the takeaway here is that while our industry is facing temporary supply constraints, acv is gaining market share, attracting new dealers at an impressive pace and delivering strong revenue growth, which bodes well for the eventual automotive recovery. next, on slide eight. we are pleased with the great progress our acv team is making on territory expansion. over the next 60 days, we'll be opening the remaining territories to achieve our goal of 160 by year-end. following each initial territory launch, we execute on our proven go-to-market playbook by investing in our inspection capacity, attracting dealers to the marketplace, creating the powerful network effect that we've repeated over 100 times across the country. by year-end, we'll increase our footprint by 30% and be positioned to engage with nearly all the franchise dealers in the u.s. moving on to slide nine. auction marketplace revenue growth was 22% year-over-year and greater than 200% growth versus q3 '19. note that the year-over-year comparison was against very strong q3 '20 results, which benefited from pent-up demand created in the early months of the covid pandemic. turning now to slide 10. last quarter, i highlighted our consumer sourcing offering, live appraisal, that has contributed to our strong unit growth this year. we are an early mover in this category, enabling our dealers to offer consumers an efficient and effective way to sell their vehicles on acv's marketplace. live appraisal has gained significant traction this year with over 110% unit growth year-to-date, and it contributed a high single-digit percentage of our volume in q3. this offering is being leveraged by dealers across the country today with live appraisal sales in 48 states this year, and we plan to expand our offerings in the coming quarters.
so stay tuned for more on that front as we continue to penetrate this large market opportunity. let me turn to the second element of our strategy to drive long-term shareholder value, tam and product expansion. moving to slide 12. i will provide an update on our private marketplaces offerings that we launched in june. this private auction platform leverages acv's marketplace technology to enable dealers to optimize trades within their dealer groups, maximizing both profit and speed. private marketplaces provides acv with another avenue to engage with the largest dealer groups in the country, create new revenue streams and generate a seamless downstream supply for acv's open marketplace. private marketplaces also lays the technology foundation for a commercial offering we plan to launch in 2022. we are seeing strong initial demand with over 20 large dealer groups live today. we are especially excited about a recent partnership with one of the largest dealer groups in the country operating hundreds of rooftops. following an extensive field test against the incumbent vendor, acv was chosen to power their private trading network. we won this engagement based on the scalability and flexibility of our private marketplaces platform and the quality of our market-leading inspection capabilities. the initial phase of our partnership focused on supporting the dealer group's high-growth consumer sourcing business. we then expanded the scope to include other private network transactions like aged inventory. this key strategic win with a market leader is a testament to acv's core strengths around technology, innovation, customer engagement and inspection capabilities. we look forward to updating you on private marketplaces adoption in the coming quarters.
turning now to slide 13. we are also very excited about the market traction of our programmatic buying offerings. it's the early days, but this innovative way of enabling dealers to engage with our marketplace already contributed a low single-digit percentage of units in q3. our buying api is live today with dealers who have technology platforms that integrate directly with acv's real-time apis to generate bids on our marketplace. we're engaging with a diverse set of customers that include large dealers, rental car companies and a leading specialty auto parts supplier. in addition, our programmatic buying user experience is in beta with eight dealers and will be launching by year-end. this offering will enable the rest of our dealer partners to participate in programmatic buying in our marketplace by creating inventory wish lists to automatically source their inventory needs. these programmatic buying capabilities together with our nationwide inspection team enables acv to offer a highly efficient and trusted experience, which we believe will deliver superior results for our dealer partners. moving to slide 14. we are making great progress with our max digital integration. the teams are fully engaged in the tech integration front while developing joint marketing and sales campaigns. max digital's pricing guidance, merchandising and inventory management products are a natural complement to acv's current data services that together create exciting growth synergies. we look forward to sharing updates on acv's vehicle intelligence strategy in the coming quarters as we launch our integrated offerings in early 2022. turning to slide 15. let me wrap up this section with an update on our value-added services.
we are making significant investments in the technology and resources to scale acv transportation and acv capital. these investments are driving strong top line growth by delivering highly differentiated services to the market while also creating efficiencies for both our partners and for acv. acv transport continues to be a key enabler of attracting new buyers to the platform. our growing carrier partner network and fast cycle times resulted in attach rates of around 50% in q3. recall that our initial plans assumed reaching a 50% transport attach rate within two years. the transport team achieved this milestone in just three quarters. acv capital continues to gain traction in the market, and like our transport business, is tracking ahead of the milestones built into our long-term targets. capital attach rates reached the mid-single digits in q3, with loan volume improving around 30% quarter-over-quarter. the new finance offerings we launched in june are translating into strong revenue per loan growth, which has increased over 15% since the beginning of the year. we continue to be excited about the revenue and margin opportunities for our capital business with expected revenue growth of nearly 300% in 2021. in summary, q3 was another proof point that we have created exciting new avenues of long-term growth for acv by leveraging our powerful data capabilities, expanding our features across our technology platform and driving adoption across our growing suite of digital solutions.
with that, let me hand over to bill to take you through our financial results and also how we're driving growth at scale.

thanks, george, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. we are pleased with our q3 financial performance, having again delivered upside to both our revenue and adjusted ebitda guidance despite the challenging macro factors george outlined earlier on the call. turning to slide 17, i'll begin with a review of our third quarter results. revenue of $92 million was above the high end of guidance and generated year-over-year growth of 36%. adjusted ebitda loss of $12 million or 13% of revenue was also very favorable relative to our q3 guidance. this performance was driven by our solid revenue results in the quarter and underscores the inherent operating leverage in our business model. as expected, cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased year-over-year and was modestly above our expectations. the year-over-year increase was driven primarily by the mix of acv transport revenue, which increased approximately 600 basis points year-over-year and exceeded our expectations. additionally, we incurred higher arbitration costs associated with customer assurance revenues in q3. however, we expect these costs to normalize in q4, consistent with historical norms. total operating costs, excluding cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue, increased by approximately 900 basis points year-over-year, less than expected. the year-over-year increase reflects our planned investments across our technology portfolio, operations and go-to-market functions, investments we're making to fuel our long-term growth strategy. turning to slide 18. i will cover some additional detail on revenue. we have a diverse revenue mix with approximately 85% of revenue evenly split between auction marketplace and service revenue, with the balance in customer assurance. as expected, auction marketplace revenue declined modestly quarter-over-quarter, reflecting constrained wholesale supplies in the market but was above expectations, primarily due to improved conversion rates throughout the quarter. year-to-date,
auction marketplace revenue was up 63% versus 2020, reflecting strong dealership acquisition and continued penetration of the wholesale market. profitability in our auction marketplace remained strong in the quarter and consistent with the high 80% historical rate. our services business continued to outperform expectations with strong results in transportation and capital. services revenue also reflects nearly a full quarter of max digital. moving to slide 19, i would like to discuss the operating leverage in our business. here, we're showing historical adjusted ebitda margin along with our updated outlook for 2021. as i mentioned earlier, 2021 is a year of significant investment for acv. and as you heard throughout our discussion today, we're delivering on our territory expansion plans, launching new offerings to drive additional market share and investing in technology to scale our operations. these investments translate into a 57% year-over-year increase in operating expense, excluding cost of revenue. and despite this increase, our adjusted ebitda margin is expected to be flat with 2020, again, highlighting the underlying operating leverage in our business model. now i'll turn to guidance on slide 20. for the fourth quarter of 2021, we are expecting revenue in the range of $83 million to $86 million, a growth rate of 54% to 60% year-over-year and a meaningful acceleration over our third quarter growth rate. adjusted ebitda loss is expected to be in the range of $22 million to $26 million. for the full year 2021, we are again raising revenue guidance. we are now expecting revenue in the range of $341 million to $344 million, a growth rate of 64% to 65% year-over-year and an increase of $8 million at the midpoint from our previous guidance. adjusted ebitda loss of $51 million to $54 million is approximately $11 million lower than our previous guidance.
our guidance assumes that strong used vehicle demand will persist throughout the balance of 2021, creating a positive backdrop for vehicle values in the market. we're also assuming that automotive supply chain challenges will likely continue to constrain new vehicle sales and associated trade-in volumes, which in turn may pressure wholesale vehicle supplies in the near term. and finally, on guidance. to my earlier point about our investment plans, we are expecting total operating expenses, excluding cost of revenue, to grow approximately 57% for the full year 2021. to wrap up my comments, let me highlight our strong capital structure on slide 21. we ended the quarter with $600 million in cash and equivalents, $152 million of which reflects the float in our auction business. note that we generated $16 million of cash flow from operations during the quarter due to an increase in the float on our marketplace since june 30. the amount of float on our balance sheet can fluctuate meaningfully, driven by business trends in the final two weeks of each quarter. we ended q3 with $500,000 of long-term debt associated with our acv capital business. given our strong cash position, we continue to optimize our cost of capital, and at current levels are self-funding the acv capital business.
and with that, let me turn it back to george.

thanks, bill. before we take your questions, let me summarize. we are pleased with our execution in the third quarter while navigating through the short-term supply headwinds. we continue to gain market share by attracting new dealers to our marketplace and by gaining wallet share within our existing customer base, which positions acv for strong customer growth going forward. we are executing our territory expansion plans. our latest offerings are gaining traction in the market and see some very promising growth synergies emerging for our max digital acquisition. we have a proven business model that can deliver scalable growth with attractive unit economics and structural operating leverage that we believe will drive significant shareholder value.
with that, i'll turn the call over to the operator to begin the q&a.
