timothy r. wallace -- chief executive officer and president
thank you jessica and good morning everyone. trinity's third quarter financial results significantly improved year-over-year due to the growth of our railcar lease fleet and increased deliveries of new railcar. the 34% increase in revenues and doubling of our earnings per share reflects trinityrail's ability to grow and improve its financial results. demand continued at lower levels during the third quarter due to several economic factors. our management team is responding accordingly and is being highly selective when originating new railcar leases. in addition, our third quarter delivery schedule was impacted by various challenges. as a result, our team worked through -- worked with our customers to shift the portion of our new railcar production from this year into the first half of next year. this helped to smooth out the transition to a lower level of railcar production for next year. eric will provide specifics on this topic during his remarks.
trinity is positioned to successfully navigate through the shifts in market demand. we are highly experienced at responding to both short and long-term cycles. the recurring revenues associated with long-term leases in our railcar leasing business provide the company with a predictable level of steady cash flows. in addition, our management team has been successful and lowering trinity's cost of capital and streamlining our operating structure. we're making great progress in optimizing our balance sheet. we just completed another successful financing of the portfolio with railcar. melendy will provide information about this during her comments.
i'm optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead for our company. during my 24 years with trinity, we have successfully navigated through a wide variety of situations, transformed our company multiple times and significantly expanded our competencies. our railcar lease fleet is now one of the largest in north america. our management team is highly collaborative and capable. in my opinion, our strengths open the door to a wide range of new possibilities to create value for our customers and shareholders.
early last month, i informed our board of my desire to transition into retirement. the board has initiated a search to identify trinity's next ceo. the search includes both internal and external candidates and it's progressing well. i will continue in my current role as long as necessary to facilitate a smooth transition. i am confident our board will select a strong well-qualified ceo. it's been my honor and privilege to be ceo of this great company for 20 years. trinity has played an important role in shaping key aspects of our country's infrastructure and has a bright future. the board and trinity's management team is committed to executing a robust strategy that supports our vision of being a premier provider of railcar products and services in north america. my career at trinity has been very fulfilling. i grew up within trinity's culture, which emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, professionalism, integrity and other value. i have a deep appreciation for the craftsmanship of our employees. they are dedicated to the quality and excellence of our products. i treasure our relationship and our employees, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. i'm very grateful for all the people who have helped make trinity great company. i will always be passionate about trinity, our vision and our stakeholders. trinity has a great legacy and i look forward to watching our company continue to grow and flourish.
i will now turn in the conference call over to eric for his comments.
eric r. marchetto -- senior vice president and group president, trinityrail
thank you, tim and good morning everyone. trinityrail had strong year-over-year financial performance during the third quarter. throughout much of 2019, demand for railcars in north america has remained at or above replacement levels. however, continued declines in rail traffic volumes, ongoing trade disputes and slowing industrial production are creating unfavorable conditions in rail equipment markets. in the near term, we believe these headwinds will be a drag on demand for new railcars and drive existing railcars into storage. with that said, a few railcar markets are likely to see strong interest despite the broader market trend.
investments in north american petrochemical capacity, new opportunities to ship fuels from canada and the us to mexico and ongoing attrition are likely to drive demand for new and existing railcars in portions of the north american fleet. we are being very deliberate as of the business we pursue as we adjust our platform for a softer railcar demand environment.
trinityrail's third quarter financial results reflect continued growth of our portfolio of leased railcars and higher manufacturing railcar deliveries with a favorable product mix year-over-year. railcar utilization split sequentially primarily due to customers filings of chapter 11 during the quarter, one of which was the result of a major fire that shuttered the operations of the company. i'm pleased with our ability to renew and assign leased railcars in our portfolio, given the competitive market environment while differentiating trinityrail's platform of products and services.
we expect our lease portfolio to experience a slight increase in average lease rates year-over-year in 2019. our team has done a good job managing the diversification and renewal risk exposure of our railcar lease fleet. as we look ahead to 2020, less than 15% of our portfolio is up for renewal. based on current market pricing, lease rates are approximately 2% below the average expiring lease rates next year. we anticipate leasing revenue and profit from operations will be higher in 2020 as a result of fleet growth.
we are also positioning our manufacturing footprint in response to a softer railcar market. industry orders have declined in 2019 relative to the order placed in 2018, leading to lower delivery expectations for 2020. in the third quarter, the industry received orders for approximately 7,300 railcars and delivered 14,500. our team secured orders for 2,530 railcars during the quarter across our five commercial end markets and we are pleased with the associated economics. as a result of this demand trend as well as operational disruptions and capacity expansion delays in the third quarter, we tempered our railcar production plan for the remainder of this year, have worked for our customers to shift these deliveries into 2020. this change at our plan will facilitate a smoother transition to our expected production phase for the first half of 2020.
based on our current market insights, we expect industry railcar deliveries for 2020 to be in the low to mid 40,000 range. approximately 40% of our backlog or approximately 8,100 railcars is scheduled to deliver in 2020, of which approximately 3,000 will be delivered to our lease fleet from originating lease agreements.
the outlook for our maintenance services business is solid with a backlog and additional line of sight on tanker modification work and foreseeable compliance events. our platform has demonstrated numerous times the ability to successfully navigate through railcar demand cycles and we are responding proactively to changing market conditions. we have built the trinityrail platform to outperform the industry throughout the railcar business cycle. our business model is designed to foster and maintain engagement with the direct customer and end-user of our railcar equipment. our services from leasing and administration to maintenance, design and engineering to build support are all an important part of our platform, generating unique market insights and providing steady, recurring, and predictable levels of revenue and cash flow throughout the railcar cycle.
the commercial and financial synergies generated from the platform have a number of benefits, which include the following. a lower overall cost of business operations including a cost advantaged asset base, lower cost of ownership for maintenance and lower relative sg&a a tax advantage investment in leasing equipment that generate significant cash flow and a valuable sales channel to originate organic lease fleet growth of our railcar lease portfolio. we expect significant cash flow generation and a lower overall cost platform to result in a higher level of relative return investment through the railcar cycle.
our vision is to be the premier provider of railcar products and services. across our organization, trinity's teams are actively working to differentiate our platform of products and services. our expectations are to build customer loyalty with industrial shippers by enhancing the customer experience through innovation and technology that improve the value proposition of railcar transportation. the north american rail transportation ecosphere encompasses over 1.7 million railcars. within owned and managed fleet of approximately 125,000 railcars, trinityrail has room to expand our presence in the railcar market and will do this in a deliberate and returns focused manner.
our integrated platform of businesses work together to deliver solutions that optimize the life-cycle ownership and usage of railcar equipment and provide our customers with a single source to all of their railcar equipment and service needs. few railcar providers if any, can offer the breadth and depth of trinityrail's platform to any given customer. our platform provides a unique ability to integrate new services with our traditional product offering through our existing base of recurring revenue from long-term leases and add high margin services that enhance our returns. we are built to deliver.
i will now turn it over to melendy to discuss our financial performance and guidance.
melendy e. lovett -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, eric and good morning everyone. before i begin my prepared remarks on our financial priorities and outlook, i'll quickly review the third quarter 2019 performance highlights announced in our press release yesterday. the company reported significant growth in year-over-year revenue, operating profit, and earnings per share, primarily due to higher overall railcar manufacturing deliveries with a favorable product mix as well as growth in our railcar lease fleet and sales of leased railcars from our portfolio.
third quarter railcar deliveries were lower than our expectations due to the challenges eric mentioned as well as weakening market demand going into 2020. our team has responded and replanned our production schedules for the remainder of the year and the first half of 2020. a reduction in corporate related expenses also contributed to our financial performance during the quarter. year-to-date corporate expense is down $37 million or 32% due to lower litigation related spend and cost optimization efforts.
as of the end of the third quarter, the company has generated operating and free cash flow before lease fleet investment of $164 million and $215 million year-to-date respectively. we believe free cash flow generation before lease fleet investment will be approximately $240 million for 2019 or around 10% of our market cap as of yesterday's close. our third quarter performance is indicative of trinity's ability to leverage our integrated platform and scale our operations to meet customer demand while generating strong results for shareholders.
we are making good progress on our key financial priorities for 2019 including lowering our cost of capital, deploying capital to return of accretive investments and returning meaningful and steady amounts of capital to shareholders. subsequent to quarter-end, trinity issued $387 million of a rated notes under an existing railcar asset-backed securitization. this issuance yielded a blended interest rate of 2.98% and increased our loan to value ratio for our wholly owned lease fleet to 56%. by optimizing the balance sheet of our railcar leasing company, trinity has lowered our weighted average cost of capital by more than 20% since the spin-off. as we achieve our near-term ltv target for the wholly owned leased fleet of 60% to 65%, we believe we can further lower our cost of capital to stay competitive with other railcar leasing companies.
during the third quarter, we made a number of investments in our businesses including a net lease fleet investment of approximately $90 million and $30 million in capital expenditures for our manufacturing and maintenance platforms. our year-to-date investment in the lease fleet totals approximately $679 million with solid returns, which we expect to be accretive to trinity's return on equity.
trinity also completed approximately $100 million of share repurchases during the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to approximately $234 million. our quarterly cash dividend will be paid at the end of october and results in a dividend yield of 3.7% as of yesterday's closing price. when combining year-to-date share repurchases and dividends, we have returned $295 million of capital to shareholders or around 12% of our market cap. the combined strength and cash flow generation capability of the integrated rail platform enables trinity to meaningfully invest in high-return growth opportunities and return substantial capital to shareholders.
all of these accomplishments are aligned with management's goal to deliver 2019 earnings growth and to improve our pre-tax roe to a three year average target range of between 11% and 13% by year-end 2021. our financial forecast for 2019, the first year of this three year plan is on track for a pre-tax roe of between 9% and 9.5%. this is a significant improvement from the 6.3% pre-tax roe following our spin-off at the end of last year.
moving now to guidance, as you've heard from tim and eric, railcar demand has been further impacted from declining railroad volumes and continued uncertainty related to slowing industrial production and global trade issues. our management team has responded accordingly and has positioned our business for a slower demand market going into next year. as a result of the lower railcar deliveries in the third quarter, some of which were designated to be added to our lease fleet, we narrowed our eps guidance range in our press release issued yesterday. trinity now expects annual eps from continuing operations in 2019 of between $1.17 and $1.27 excluding the impact of any fourth quarter potential restructuring charge. this update results in growth of between 67% and 81% year-over-year. our revenue expectations for the railcar leasing and management services group as a result of timing of railcar deliveries to the lease fleet is now expected to be between $760 million and $765 million for the year. we expect operating profit for this segment to be between $320 million and $325 million for the year.
we have increased our expectations for proceeds from sales of leased railcars to railcar investment vehicle riv partners and the secondary market to approximately $400 million. our riv partners continue to express interest in purchasing lease railcars for their portfolios. a reminder that when we sell railcars to our riv partners, trinity keeps the customer relationship and servicing of the cars for a management fee, therefore we grow our managed lease fleet with riv partner capital. the timing of railcar sales from the lease fleet is always difficult to predict and our margin on railcar sales year-to-date reflects the younger maturity on the railcar assets sold from our lease fleet as well as some portfolio fine-tuning we have done to manage our diversification.
another reminder. we have sales type leases in our earnings guidance, which are required to be accounted for as sales from the lease fleet in accordance with gaap. we expect this to add an additional $160 million in car sales revenue for the year with $61 million of this revenue being recognized year-to-date. the gain on sales from the lease fleet will be attributed to the total leasing segment profit and our eps guidance range incorporate these assumptions.
moving to the rail products group. we are revising our railcar delivery guidance range to 21,500 to 22,000 railcars for 2019. rail products revenue is now expected to be approximately $3 billion with an operating profit margin of approximately 9%. operating performance from the all other segment during the fourth quarter will be impacted by seasonality in the highway business as well as costs associated with new product development efforts. this segment is also impacted by some transition expenses in peripheral businesses to align with our go-forward operating structure. our business and corporate teams continue to work collaboratively to optimize our operating structure and rightsize corporate costs. as a result, we have again lowered our corporate expense guidance range to $105 million to $110 million. as a reminder, our corporate expenses include transition and stranded costs related to the spin-off and separation of arcosa as well as an elevated level of highway-related legal expenses.
in our press release yesterday, we highlighted the potential for a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter as a result of cost optimization efforts specific to underutilized asset writedowns in our manufacturing footprint and employee transition costs. again, our fourth quarter 2019 eps guidance range does not include any restructuring charges we may incur as these decisions are finalized. due to fewer railcar additions to the lease fleet, we are lowering our guidance for revenue and profit eliminations to $1.4 billion and $165 million respectively. these line items reflect the revenue and profit associated with the market-based transfer pricing for inter-company transactions between our railcar leasing and products business segments, primarily for newly manufactured railcars.
regarding our lease fleet investment, we now expect total net lease fleet investment of $850 million to $950 million with fewer secondary market additions, fewer planned railcar additions and a higher level of portfolio sales from the fleet. in addition to our planned leasing capital expenditures, our manufacturing and corporate capital expenditures forecast is revised to $110 million to $120 million given expected project progress by year-end.
looking into 2020, it is too early to provide any specific financial guidance given the uncertainty of economic factors that affect the railcar market as well as the increased pricing competitiveness as a result of lower demand. as eric mentioned, we have market-driven headwinds affecting our railcar production expectation for next year, however we anticipate leasing revenue and profit from operations will be higher in 2020 as a result of lease fleet growth. we are also defining significant goals for cost savings initiatives both in our businesses and our corporate organization. for 2020, we expect our free cash flow before lease fleet investment to improve year-over-year, primarily as a result of lower working capital needs in the business.
in closing, our leadership team has been working closely with our board to refine the strategic plan for trinity industries and establish key priorities and initiatives going forward. our vision, purpose, and strategic priorities stem from our belief that trinityrail's platform is the best model to compete in the railcar industry. and we aim for our results to demonstrate it. we're prepared to respond to a lower railcar demand market in 2020 while a number of macroeconomic factors create headwinds for our business, our leadership team is excited about the opportunity to refine and evolve our business and demonstrate the value of trinityrail's integrated platform.
we have a number of levers within management's control that can provide meaningful tailwinds to our financial performance in 2020, focused on the elements of roe improvement. this business model was built to outperform throughout the railcar market cycle by generating predictable cash flows from long-term leases and capturing upside demand to maximize shareholder value. these combined financial advantages of the integrated rail platform enable trinity to meaningfully invest in high return growth opportunities including our lease fleet while also returning substantial capital to shareholders.
we'll now transition into the q&a session. operator, will you please give our listeners the instructions.
",":
operator
certainly. [operator instructions] and we will take our first question from bascome majors with susquehanna.
bascome majors -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
yeah. thanks for taking my questions here. tim, congrats on the looming retirement. i was hoping that you could share the board's perspective on both the timeline for the next ceo hire at trinity and maybe the skill-sets that you're really focused on when you're trying to find who is going to lead effectively, what's been a lifetime family business for you into the next generation? thank you.
timothy r. wallace -- chief executive officer and president
okay, thank you. i appreciate your comments and here is my response to your question. as i've said, the board initiated a search process for a ceo and we're considering both internal and external candidates and our board is responding by establishing this as a very high priority. this is an independent selection process. i'm participating in the process at the request of the chairman from time to time. i'd say the selection process is going really well and we will comment publicly when there is announcement to be made about this. overall, i'm very pleased with the situation. the search really gives us an opportunity to refresh the ceo role and i'm highly supportive of the entire process. we have a wide variety of competencies that we're looking for in a new ceo and we'll talk more about it as we identify the candidates and introduce the person to the public.
bascome majors -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
fair enough. and once that's completed, is your intent to remain on the board or is that something where you would eventually step down as someone takes over?
timothy r. wallace -- chief executive officer and president
yes. my intent is that as soon as the ceo takes the position as ceo, i will no longer be on the board and i will assume the position as an advisory role and assist when i can, but it's important to me that the person that becomes ceo of the company has the full attitude of being able to lead and direct and manage the company, so i do not plan to be actively involved. i had a lot of fulfillment watching arcosa as a public company and seeing the team there pull together and create value for the shareholders and i ultimately will have that same position as a shareholder of trinity watching the company fulfill its vision. so i have a very active personal life plan and so i'm not going to be actively involved in the company on a long-term basis.
bascome majors -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
tim, thank you for that detailed and thoughtful perspective and we wish you the best and now we'll look forward to the next best update from you guys and the board. thank you.
timothy r. wallace -- chief executive officer and president
thank you.
operator
and we will take our next question from matt elkott with cowen. your line is open.
matthew elkott -- cowen and company -- analyst
good morning. thank you. and tim, congratulations on the upcoming retirement. if i look at the last five years, you guys have averaged about 37% of industry orders. this year-to-date, you have about 27%. so when i look at this and see that you're also expecting writedowns on underutilized manufacturing assets, is this a strategy to reduce your manufacturing footprint as you focus more on growing the lease fleet and transition into more of a lessor?
timothy r. wallace -- chief executive officer and president
eric, you want to take that?
eric r. marchetto -- senior vice president and group president, trinityrail
sure. matt, i'll take that. so i wouldn't know -- i do not think our strategy is to reduce our manufacturing footprint, but the reality is we have 125,000 railcar lease fleet and so all of our opportunities that -- our commercial opportunities, our inquiries have to go through that 125,000 railcar fleet before we build another railcar. so i think the result as you get a more efficient platform as a builder with a large lease fleet that we're going to act more like a asset owner. when it comes to specifically the writedowns, those are older non-operating manufacturing assets. we did not operate them in this last railcar cycle. as we went through it, we've expanded our production footprint elsewhere with our existing facilities and so we really didn't see a need for those facilities in the future.
timothy r. wallace -- chief executive officer and president
this is tim. also some of the facilities we're talking about are legacy facilities that we kept when we intentionally kept some facilities and let arcosa go ahead and have a clean start and we took responsibility for some of the older facilities that had been idled in trinity for a number of years.
matthew elkott -- cowen and company -- analyst
these are good insights. thank you very much. just one more question on the lease fleet. in the current tough environment for freights overall and also given the small cube covered hopper fleet that you have within the lease fleet, how much more pressure should we see on utilization as we exit 2019 and into 2020?
timothy r. wallace -- chief executive officer and president
so we have -- certainly we have a good line of sight on our expirations, both remainder of this year and in the next year. and i think i mentioned that as we look at our expirations next year and the lease rates where those current lease rates are in those car types, we see about a 2% headwind, which is very modest. we do not expect to see significant changes in our utilization. we're working to keep our fleet fully employed and where we're at, we're very comfortable with our renewal expirations, it's not -- we work very hard to smooth out any exposures to certain markets and so we're very comfortable as we go into 2020.
matthew elkott -- cowen and company -- analyst
so eric, if the underlying freight environment does not change much between now and into 2020 or by the end of 2020, you think that it's plausible that the utilization rate will not be materially different than what you have now?
eric r. marchetto -- senior vice president and group president, trinityrail
yeah. i think, as i mentioned in our comments, we do expect more railcars in the north american fleet to enter storage, but it's still a relatively good level. you talked about the small cube covered hoppers and a year ago that fleet was well or was about 90% utilized. today, it's about 75% utilized, but it's still fairly utilized from historical standpoint. a few years ago, it's gotten into the 60% range. so from that standpoint, it feels worse than it is because it's -- 90% to 75% is a big drop, but 75% compared to the overall fleet in the low 80s isn't that different. so i just want to put that out there whether it's -- well, it's lower -- the decline has been dramatic in terms of pace, but the level that it's fallen to is not unprecedented.
matthew elkott -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
and we will go next to justin long with stephens.
justin long -- stephens inc. -- analyst
thanks. good morning and tim, congrats on the retirement and wish you the best. maybe to start with my first question. you gave some color on a few items for 2020 will clearly have some pressure in the railcar manufacturing business, but you mentioned the lease fleet will grow and there are some cost actions under way. when you put everything together, just from a directional standpoint, do you think next year is an up arrow or down arrow for eps?
melendy e. lovett -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, justin. it's melendy. i would say that especially given the deliveries that we expect i would say overall, it would be down, eps however i mentioned there are a number of levers in management's control and i think we've demonstrated this year that we will take action on those such that the eps decline would not be as much as you would expect. so does that give you a good sense?
justin long -- stephens inc. -- analyst
yes, that does. that's helpful. and maybe following up on that. i wanted to ask about railcar sales going forward. obviously the guidance for this year was increased. we're at a pretty elevated level relative to kind of historical averages and i know this will be a key part of the business going forward, but is there any sense you can give us for what you expect from railcar sales going forward whether it's 2020 or just on a normalized basis? and then also the margins on railcar sales, they've have been around 17% this year. just curious directionally, if you think that's still a good place to be going forward? thank you.
melendy e. lovett -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so with regards to railcar sales, we did increase our guidance from $350 million to $400 million and that's primarily driven by our railcar investment partner demand and it's also part of our desire to grow our lease fleet with our investment partners capital. i'm not really prepared today to signal specific car sales for 2020, but what i will point back to you is, as we set out as a new trinity company, we said that we want car sales to be and as we continue to grow the lease fleet, we want car sales to be more of a normal part of the way we do business and we want our riv program to be more programmatic and so i believe at the time we said something like $300 million to $350 million of sales in a given year would be what we were targeting. i see that moderating in years where we don't grow our lease fleet as much and so that kind of gives you our general thoughts about car sales without any specifics for 2020.
speaking specifically to the margin, there are a number of factors that impact what that margin is. one is the age of the cars, another is the type of cars, the market value of the cars that are in the portfolio that we sell as well on those assets. so i would say that we would expect our sales to riv partners to be in a similar margin range to what you've seen historically.
justin long -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay, great. that's really helpful, i appreciate the time.
operator
and we will go next to gordon johnson with glj research.
gordon johnson -- glj research, llc -- analyst
hey guys.
melendy e. lovett -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
gordon johnson -- glj research, llc -- analyst
hey. how is it going? sorry about that. just some issues with the phone. thanks for taking the question. i guess the first question i just wanted to know if you guys -- management there thinks that the investment community gives you guys enough credit for earnings from selling railcar assets between the manufacturing division and the leasing division and if not, how do you plan on addressing that?
melendy e. lovett -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
we have communicated as i mentioned that our plan is -- we consider it an advantage of our integrated platform to have the ability to monetize those assets while at the same time keeping the customer relationship and the servicing opportunity of those assets. so not only do we receive a management fee, we keep the customer relationship and we have the opportunity for those cars to continue to take advantages of services that are offered by our platform. so our goal is that by making our railcar sales more predictable and more programmatic, those will be considered as part of our earnings and cash flow generating ability.
gordon johnson -- glj research, llc -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then there has been some concerns. i'm sure you guys have heard about psr and some of the shippers kind of i guess complaining at least we've heard some recent concerns. have you guys heard these concerns and what's your view there?
eric r. marchetto -- senior vice president and group president, trinityrail
sure, gordon. this is eric marchetto. i'll take that. so let me first -- psr is certainly a big topic. let me just step back and talk about rail transportation and then we'll get into the psr. rail transportation is still the lowest cost and the greenest mode of land-based transportation. so it starts with an inherent advantage. rail traffic has declined in the last year and that's certainly had an impact on demand for railcars. when the railroad implements psr, the first thing they do is they look to rightsize the assets on their lines and so that will have -- where they will try and get railcars off of their line and then when there is growth, they're going to have to turn around and add cars at that time, which will either be in the form of shipper cars or railroad cars.
the good news on psr is now we're hearing for the first time in a few years, more of the railroads talked about growth and driving traffic growth and specifically modal share. we've not heard that in the last few years, so that's real positive that they are going down that path. from an operating system, more efficient operating system, which will lead to a more efficient railroad network would be good for our business certainly long-term. you mentioned demurrage and other fees related to psr. demurrage is incurred on railroad equipment, which is about 20% of the fleet. it's an unplanned expense for shippers, which no business likes unplanned expenses, so that's certainly generated points of frustration with customers. there is also other ancillary fees charge, the private railcars and this is going to be a point of frustration with shippers. generally, the impact of psr has been principally more on railroad supply cars like well cars, box cars, flat cars. it does impact covered hoppers in the green service and agricultural service, which is typically a little more or lessor provided railcars, so that's one spot where it would have little impact on the operating leasing community.
gordon johnson -- glj research, llc -- analyst
excellent. thanks for the questions. and tim, congratulations and enjoy the retirement.

allison poliniak -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hi guys, good morning.
melendy e. lovett -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
first of all, congrats tim. just echoed everyone's comments on that. i just want to go back. i think matt asked the question about lease. just would like to get your thoughts, just over your philosophy on managing the utilization in that fleet. i know lease rates are fairly stable, but if they take a step down from here entering 2020, i mean how are you thinking about that rates versus duration versus that utilization number?
eric r. marchetto -- senior vice president and group president, trinityrail
sure allison. this is eric. i mean that's always the art, is managing no lessor once railcars go in storage is that it tends to be a negative event in terms of earnings. as rates are falling, you have a decision to make, whether you want to go short on lease terms and it's generally going to be determined by what those lease rates are if there and what the yields on those assets are, if they are lower than a cost of capital on a yield basis, you go shorter. if they are higher, then you locked in longer-term and that will vary deal to deal car type by car type. that's certainly something that we are very conscious of and we manage accordingly.

great. and then i just want to go back to the operational challenges and capacity expansion delays. can you expand on that a little bit. it just seemed a little bit unusual for trinity. you've always been a great operator. what was going on there and is it something that's going to continue in q4?
eric r. marchetto -- senior vice president and group president, trinityrail
so allison, i'll start with that and paul can add any color if i missed it. generally, we've had as we talked about on previous calls, this year we have a very high mix of railcars requiring interior coatings both on the tank side and the freight car side. we've made investments to expand our capacity in that space. we built cars ahead of that lining capacity and in return, we had -- once we started linings those cars, this quarter we're aligned in the remainder of the year. so that had additional cost and throughput challenges in terms of getting the units that we expected.
paul e. mauer -- executive vice president, trinityrail, president, trinityrail products
allison, this is paul. just to give a little bit more color on that. we had two major capital projects that we took on this year and our unit deliveries were predicated on us getting those projects done on time. unfortunately, both those projects were delayed for various reasons really outside of our control. so those delays in the project really impacted our ability to deliver units in the third quarter. and as eric pointed out, we had historically high number of line cars coming into our product mix this year.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great, thanks. that's helpful.
operator
and we will take our final question from matt brooklier with buckingham research. your line is open.
matthew brooklier -- buckingham research -- analyst
hey, thanks and good morning. tim, congratulations on your pending retirement. so i wanted to follow on to allison's question. we know that rail group margins are negatively impacted by some inefficiencies in the quarter and obviously lower volumes anticipated that contributed as well, but as we're looking into fourth quarter, directionally where do we think margins are, do you think rail group margins are up, are they about the same, maybe just provide a little bit color there?
melendy e. lovett -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
hi matt, this is melendy. so what i guided for the full year is a 9% approximate margin for the segment and that would be for the full 2019 year and so that would be i would say a little bit of improvement from third quarter to fourth quarter to make our math work.
matthew brooklier -- buckingham research -- analyst
and then as i think about it, there is kind of diverging trends in your two businesses as you guys think about it. next year expectations are that deliveries are going to be down and that's going to put some pressure on profitability within rail group, but the message is you're doing some company specific things on the leasing side of your business where you think you can grow the fleet and hopefully also improve profitability next year. so if you could just talk to what are some of the contributing factors that you know gives you conviction that you're going to be able to grow your lease fleet next year in a market that right now doesn't seem too favorable?
eric r. marchetto -- senior vice president and group president, trinityrail
sure. this is eric. i'll take that. our track record is -- kind of speaks for itself, in terms of the growth that we have, the rate of growth in our lease fleet over the last 20 some odd years. our platform, our market visibility in our platform is unprecedented, our broad product line, our ability to originate leases, so i'm quite confident. we will continue to be able to originate leases that are accretive to our earnings and we will be able to perform. we have line of sight on -- we still expect 40,000 to 45,000 railcars or low 40s to mid 40s in terms of industry deliveries. the industry has a healthy backlog. so while as we expect it to be lower next year in terms of industry deliveries, we still would expect them to be relatively good and so it's a healthy industry. and with that, the demand for leased railcars continues to grow whether that's through psr or other trends, the trend has been for railcars, we provided -- this shippers provide railcars and they typically provide them through operating leases. nothing is going to change there.
timothy r. wallace -- chief executive officer and president
yes. this is tim. another thing that you're taking in consideration, during the slower demand periods that we experienced historically, there are people that want to sell assets and railcars for a variety of different reasons and we picked up a lot of nice railcars during those time periods and this is shippers that want to sell railcars or other leasing companies.
eric r. marchetto -- senior vice president and group president, trinityrail
correct.
matthew brooklier -- buckingham research -- analyst
so i guess the message is doing the things you've done in the past you believe should enable you to grow your market share and given kind of the environment and things being a little bit weaker here, you think there is opportunity to potentially acquire cars portfolios which will be additive i guess to the growth story?
eric r. marchetto -- senior vice president and group president, trinityrail
yeah, all of that. our platform is built to perform throughout our cycles whether it's a -- when you look at railcar manufacturing, the thing you can count on is change year-over-year whether that's up or down and we're used to that. we measure us by improving our returns in the business year-in and year-out and that's what we're going to do.
matthew brooklier -- buckingham research -- analyst
and then just finally i think someone did mention it on the call that in a market that is a little bit weaker, maybe the pricing environment on new railcars has gotten a little bit more competitive if i heard that correctly. can you talk to directionally how much pricing has changed and i guess your expectations going into next year. i'm trying to get my arms around if we could see some incremental pressure in terms of new car pricing across the industry as we move into 2020? thanks.
eric r. marchetto -- senior vice president and group president, trinityrail
sure. when you looked at -- this is eric again. when you looked at existing lease rates, we've seen modest declines in lease rates in the current quarter and as we looked at these lease rates and compare it against our expirations next year, we see a modest decline in lease rates. when you look at new car pricing, new asset pricing has come down somewhat slightly, that's probably more of an impact on raw material prices coming down, some steel prices have fallen, both steel plate coil and scrap prices, so all that has an impact. margins, the orders that we took in the third quarter on for sale. those margins i'd characterize is always good. so from that standpoint, it's good. our new car lease rates, interest rates have fallen, so certainly we've seen lease rates on new assets come down a little bit. as a result, generally there is probably -- in periods like this you get a little bit wider range of pricing, we do see some shippers subleasing railcars in the market and generally when they start subleasing railcars that can have a downward impact on lease rates.
jessica greiner -- vice president, investor relations and communications
matt, are you there? operator, we can go to the next question.
operator
certainly. and we do have an additional question. it comes from steve barger with keybanc capital markets.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey, thanks. tim, as you and the board think about setting up trinity for the next leg of its history, for the external candidates are you considering people from outside the rail world or more broadly from outside machinery manufacturing?
timothy r. wallace -- chief executive officer and president
yes.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great.
timothy r. wallace -- chief executive officer and president
well, we're just very-- the board is very open-minded. we have recruiters and they're looking for people that they think who come in here and take charge of the organization and provide some superior leadership as well as internal candidate. so they are very open-minded.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. thank you. and melendy you said you expect free cash flow before fleet investment to improve next year, but any thought. is there any environment where you would envision free cash flow will be positive including lease fleet investment?
melendy e. lovett -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
we really haven't put that fine of a point on it to this point, steve. as i mentioned, the primary driver of free cash flow improvement before lease fleet investment for next year is that our business will be consuming less working capital.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
right. and then just the environment will dictate what the size of the lease fleet investment is?
melendy e. lovett -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
well, and if you can think about the lease fleet investment, net of financing that we would do as we have leverage to -- as we grow the lease fleet net leverage to that, the net of that financing, our free cash flow before lease fleet investment and after financing would still be positive for 2020.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. and one last one. your buyback program so far this year has a higher average price than the current share price. can you talk about your thoughts about buying shares in the weaker industry conditions as we look into 2020 and has the board considered other ways to deploy capital, maybe a special dividend or something else?
melendy e. lovett -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
at this time, we are operating more in an opportunistic share buyback and we've tried to be very programmatic and we have increased, you saw it in third quarter, increased our share repurchases as the share price declined and so we expect to continue to regularly and programmatically repurchase shares. as far as the board's consideration for any other deployment of capital to shareholders at this time, there hasn't been discussion about anything such as a special dividend, but this is a topic that is routinely discussed with our board and it's something that we will stay flexible as the market gives us the opportunity to make the appropriate decisions to return capital to shareholders.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. thank you.
melendy e. lovett -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.

it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to jean.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
thank you, jessica, and good morning, everyone. i'd like to start today on slide three and pick up where we left off at our investor day in november last year. we laid out our strategy for trinity's rail platform to deliver premier financial performance and deploy capital to drive value creation. 2020 was a year of extraordinary change for trinity, affecting this change to evolve into a cash flow and returns-focused company during a global pandemic was all the more challenging.
but our team pulled together and made difficult decisions that have put trinity on the path to accelerate our financial performance. i want to commend our people for their commitment to the company, to each other and to our customers and all our stakeholders. to begin my remarks, i believe there are several highlights from our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 performance that position us very well for the future.
first, we've aligned our business under a core purpose and laid out our strategy for improving the company's returns. the strategic initiatives focused on optimizing our business structure, and growing our product and service offerings to advance modal share for the railcar industry. second, in line with the strategy, trinity completed the vast majority of our planned restructuring efforts during 2020.
we also made further progress on leveraging trinity's balance sheet under our targeted capital structure. we expect to make additional progress in lowering our overall cost structure in 2021. third, trinity's rail platform proved resilient during the unprecedented market events of covid-19, generating strong cash flow from operations.
and finally, there is potential to return additional capital to shareholders given the attractive cash flow profile of our business and the enhanced capital allocation framework we laid out at our investor day. we are very excited about our future and very much expect 2021 to be a year of execution against our strategy to move the company forward. we believe we have a number of levers at our disposal to improve our performance, and we'll share those results with you along the way.
turning to slide four. let's review the key financial highlights. our fourth quarter financial performance reflects a decline in railcar demand as rail traffic fell amid the covid-19 outbreak last spring. as a result, fourth quarter revenue of $416 million declined approximately 51% compared to last year. our fourth quarter gaap loss of $1.13 primarily reflects onetime charges that occurred during the quarter.
trinity's adjusted eps of $0.04 fell from prior year as a result of lower deliveries and softer railcar pricing. trinity's team worked quickly and diligently to cut cost out of the business. our cost structure was burdened by the lost efficiency from production declines. while our leasing operations held steady during the challenging market, lower lease portfolio sales and railcar deliveries created an earnings headwind for the full year.
our total gaap loss for the year of $1.27 declined 217% year-over-year and 2020 adjusted earnings declined 71% to $0.37 per share. our earnings performance amid the covid-19 environment is disappointing. however, our platform continues to drive significant and stable cash flows. our fourth quarter cash flow from continuing operations totaled $195 million, which is down just 15% from the prior year.
free cash flow after all investments and dividends of $64 million decreased 51% over the fourth quarter of 2019. the for the year, and turning to slide five, operating cash flow of $652 million improved significantly year-over-year. as a result of our more conservative capital structure during the pandemic, free cash flow of $113 million declined approximately 22%, given higher leasing equity capex for the year. both eric and i will speak to the performance factors driving these results in a minute.
but the important takeaway from our consolidated fourth quarter and full year metrics is a resilient and stable cash flow generated from trinity's rail platform in a very challenging market, a testament to the valuable synergies within the business. overall, we continue to operate in a soft but improving market. looking at slide six. rail volumes, which are closely tied to the u.s. economic output, have essentially recovered from the decline we saw over the first half of 2020.
we are seeing the strongest recovery in agricultural and consumer-related markets. railcar loadings for energy-related commodities like crude and coal, continue to lag the recovery given the impact of the economic shutdown. industry railcar utilization is also improving. over 125,000 railcars have returned to service or for scrap since the peak of railcars in storage last summer.
we estimate nearly 51,000 railcars were scrapped in 2020 and resulting in the first year of an industry fleet contraction in over a decade. we expect this elevated pace of scrapping to continue so long as higher steel prices incentivize railcar owners to scrap older assets. while the industry railcar storage rate of 24% remains above the five year average, the trend is a relevant indicator for the health of the railcar industry. looking at the bottom two charts, specific trinity's business, we generally see the sector-specific impacts of an industry recovery first within our lease fleet before we see improvements in new railcar demand.
during 2020, lease rates declined significantly compared to its filing lease rates as a result of lower demand for railcars. as rail traffic has picked back up, lease fleet utilization is stabilizing. we are also beginning to see early improvement in sequential railcar lease rates with the future lease rate differential, flrd metric inflecting positively during the fourth quarter. we introduced this metric at our investor day to provide investors a sense of headwinds or tailwinds the current pricing environment will have upon trinity's lease portfolio in the near term.
orders during the fourth quarter were low as expected and, for the year, represents the lowest number of orders since the financial crisis in 2009. this is not surprising given the availability of railcars within the industry and the current projections for a slowly recovering industrial economy. we are seeing a significant increase year-over-year and the number of inquiries from shippers and class one railroads for available railcar equipment.
while it's premature to estimate when these inquiries will lead to improvement in lease utilization, rates and new railcar orders, it is a very positive sign for the rail market recovery. given where we are today, we expect a modest recovery in railcar demand in the back half of 2021. trinity's market-leading platform and experienced managing through railcar cycles enables us to promptly respond to changing market dynamics and meet customer demand.
more importantly, while the railcar market may likely only improve to a more normalized or replacement level market in the near term, we feel confident in our ability to execute our strategy and improve our financial performance. turning from the industry to trinity's results on slide seven. the value and stability of trinity's leasing business was readily apparent as the year unfolded. our lease fleet utilization took an initial step down in the first quarter of the year, then proceeded to hover around 95% utilization through 2020.
we are highly focused on maintaining our utilization and are seeing green shoots of improvement within various railcar types. approximately 17% of our portfolio was up for renewal in 2020, limiting the impact of declining lease rate on top line revenue for the leasing business. stronger lease rates on railcars added to the portfolio nearly offset the headwind and from utilization and lower lease rates on renewals, with annual revenue from leasing and management declining approximately 1% year-over-year.
looking into 2021 we have approximately 20% of our portfolio up for renewal, and we will have less of a headwind for lease rate pricing as reflected by the flrd metric. the leasing team did a tremendous job managing our maintenance expenses to offset the earnings impact of the revenue decline within the segment. segment profit also benefited from the change in our depreciation policy to extend the useful life of our assets and better reflect the economics of railcar ownership.
we have a number of initiatives in place to lower our overall maintenance cost structure through increasing the use of our internal network and implementing advanced technologies into our maintenance cleaning processes. looking into next year, 2021 will be a heavier compliance year for maintenance events so leveraging our maintenance platform will be key. the rail products segment endured a difficult year as declining backlog required production cuts and layoffs within both our production and maintenance facilities. lower pricing and the unabsorbed burdens from the lower delivery impacted the margin throughout the year.
in the fourth quarter, the performance was also impacted by start-up costs related to our new maintenance facility in the midwest and idling costs associated with other nonstrategic facilities, resulting in breakeven margin in the segment. we do expect there will be ongoing headwinds to segment performance in the first quarter this year due to lower volumes, further headcount reduction and additional maintenance facility start-up costs.
we anticipate the benefit of our cost savings initiatives will begin to benefit segment performance in the second half of the year and will improve the segment margin performance year-over-year. before i turn the call over to eric to discuss our financial results in further detail, let me close with an update on our initiatives to improve trinity's returns on slide eight. first, as a reminder, we believe there are a number of levers at our disposal to improve our pre-tax roe performance to a mid-teen level through the cycle.
the strategic initiatives align under two areas of focus: optimization and growth. as we detailed at our investor day, there is a significant information value in our rail platform, and we are confident in our ability to monetize that value across services, parts and solutions. in 2020, our balance sheet optimization was modest as a result of a healthy level of near-term liquidity and our decision to maintain a more conservative capital structure through the pandemic.
during the year, our net debt increased approximately $135 million. in 2021, we expect to add additional leverage to our balance sheet as we have opportunity to deploy that capital. in regards to sg&a, we achieved over $35 million of annualized administrative cost reductions in 2020. we'll continue evaluating sg&a cost reduction opportunities through process improvements and vendor management, and as always, manage a cost structure of our support organization to the size of the overall business.
to improve our manufacturing performance, we are moving forward with our supply chain initiatives to enhance the value of outsourced fabrication activities from our facilities. we expect these efforts to shift approximately $45 million of cyclical headcount cost savings achieved in 2020 to structural cost savings upon execution. we've also made a modest investment subsequent to year-end to acquire a railcar cleaning company with advanced proprietary robotics.
we expect to scale this technology to our facilities over the next few years, which will improve our overall production operations' efficiency and improved rail segment margins. in regards to fleet optimization, we expect to make modest investments to reposition certain railcars to other commodity service that we believe have better longer-term demand profiles. we also expect to complete a modest level of portfolio sales from our lease fleet to financial investment partners with lower hurdled capital.
earlier this month, our commercial team was very excited to officially launch the new trinsight digital service offering to our customers. trinsight provides real-time intelligence on the location and condition and status of railcar equipment, resulting in rail transportation efficiency and safety that enhance rail feed operations for shippers. this product offering is aligned with our sustainability commitment and is a key initiative in our business strategy to improve the overall rail-mobile supply chain.
trinsight is generating a modest amount of revenue through the beta testing of the product, and we are receiving a very positive response from shippers interested in service following the product launch. it is early days for sure but with the backdrop of improving fundamentals and our confidence in the strategy we have developed, it's an exciting time to be looking forward at trinity.
with that, let me now turn the call over to eric to detail our quarterly results.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, jean, and good morning, everyone. as jean noted, trinity's fourth quarter represents the continuation of lower railcar demand brought on by the covid-19 pandemic. additionally, our fourth quarter operating results were impacted by a number of one-time items. these adjustments primarily relate to the effect of the pension plan settlement as well as later-stage restructuring activities, including writedowns to manufacturing-related assets.
we also had a benefit from our final 2020 income tax provision as a result of tax law changes in 2020. starting with the income statement portion of slide nine. total revenues and adjusted earnings reflect a challenging revpar market with declining railcar deliveries and softer pricing. at these lower levels of manufacturing earnings, timing of railcar sales and fluctuations in lease and operations and legal and administrative expense have had varying impacts on our earnings results.
during the fourth quarter, trinity incurred two impairment charges related to restructuring efforts and other market-related factors. the first charge was a noncash writedown relating to existing maintenance facilities that did not fit our operational strategy or cost profile and have been classified as assets held for sale. our maintenance business has realigned its operational approach to focus on large, full-service railcar maintenance facilities, thereby providing better and more timely service to trace railcar lease fleet and our strategic customers.
the second charge was a write-off associated with an investment in emerging technology for advanced steel materials, where the third-party was unable to secure adequate funding that is in the process of liquidating. moving to our cash flow. total cash from operations during 2020 improved year-over-year as a result of the cash flow synergies of trinity's rail platform as well as the countercyclical effects of working capital from our balance sheet. trinity generated approximately $652 million in cash flow from operations.
with the sequential fourth quarter increase, resulting primarily from the receipt of a $64 million income tax receivable. at year-end, we have approximately $446 million in income tax receivable associated with the 2019 and 2020 tax years. we now expect to receive the 2019 refund in the first half of this year. trinity invested approximately $102 million last year in manufacturing and other company capex. which included the build-out of our maintenance facility in the midwest.
we also made a net investment in our lease fleet of approximately $464 million. considering the effects of modest leverage on new lease fleet additions and associated debt amortization during the year, our equity capex required for this investment totaled $484 million in 2020. total free cash flow after all investments and dividends paid to investors amounted to $113 million for the fiscal year. trinity returned a total of $285 million to shareholders in 2020, including dividends of $92 million, an additional $193 million in share repurchases.
at the end of the year, we have approximately $182 million remaining under our current authorization that runs through the end of 2021. before we move on, we also want to call investor attention to changing the treatment of our portfolio sales from our lease fleet on a prospective basis. we will now present all sales of railcars from the lease fleet as a net gain from the disposal of a long lived asset. this should simplify our reporting for investors.
this change will slightly affect the presentation of our cash flow statement and the net investment in new lease fleet additions, but it will not change the net effect of our free cash flow metric for segment operating profit. at this time, we are not providing specific earnings guidance, given the uncertainty in the market-related to the economic recovery of the covid-19 pandemic.
that being said, our business model generates significant cash flow, and we are highly focused on the value we can create from deploying this capital. for 2021, we expect cash flow from operations to be between $625 million and $675 million. turning to slide 10. as jean noted, our balance sheet is well capitalized, and we ended the fourth quarter with total liquidity of $727 million. during the fourth quarter, we issued over $526 million of new debt at a blended interest rate of 2.4%.
we estimate trinity's pre-tax weighted average cost of capital improved during 2020 by 130 basis points to approximately 5%. the capital markets for railcar securitizations are at historically attractive rates as more and more investors are participating in these financings. as a pioneer in the railcar securitization market in the early 2000s, we are pleased to see this response to be asset class and expect to take further advantage of the market in 2021.
in late january, we are proud that trinity's leasing company was the first north-american railcar lessor to establish a green financing framework. as part of our commitment to sustainability, trinity takes our commitment to reducing our environmental impact seriously. tlc's green financing framework opens trinity's capital raising to new investors with a growing appetite for investing in green assets, and the response has been favorable.
trinity remains in a very good capital position with ample liquidity, strong cash flow generation, and approximately $1.4 million in unencumbered assets. when we consider the long-term performance of the business, we are confident that the changes effected during 2020 will set our company on a path for accelerating our financial performance and unlocking value for shareholders. at our investor day in november, we issued four key long-term key performance indicators presented here on slide 11.
earnings value is inherent in the cash flows of our long duration railcar assets, platform synergies and opportunities for growth and a disciplined capital allocation framework focused on shareholder returns. when evaluated over time, we believe these indicators collectively drive long-term value creation. in 2020, operating cash flow improved year-over-year, as previously discussed, and free cash flow declined modestly. our return on equity declined year-over-year from deteriorating market fundamentals.
however, the company has established a framework for improving our performance for which we feel many of the levers for improvement are within management's control. trinity executed on its commitment to deliver double-digit dividend growth with our december dividend increase of 11% and which is paid in january 2021. our dividend growth in 2020 compared to the previous 2019 year was also nearly 12% for the year. book value per share slightly declined year-over-year, principally due to certain onetime items.
before i leave this slide, let me reiterate the trinity strategy to drive returns and cash flows will not be linear for quarter-to-quarter. each action we take we made with returns and cash flows in mind. the pace of economic recovery will impact the time frame to achieve our goals but i want to be clear that we expect to make progress against our returns and cash flow goals, regardless of the market environment and believe that trinity is well positioned to do so.
i will conclude our remarks on slide 11 -- or slide 12, by reiterating our key takeaways from the fourth quarter fiscal year-end and look forward into 2021. first, we laid out a strategy to reposition trinity's rail platform, improve the returns of the business and unlock shareholder value. second, we made solid progress on our initiatives to optimize both process and expenses across all aspects of our rail platform.
we are proud of the hard work of our people put forth during global pandemic to reposition the company for accelerating financial performance. third, our platform demonstrated the ability to generate significant cash flow in a very challenging market environment. and finally, our commitment to a capital allocation framework that focuses on long-term shareholder value.
in 2021, we intend to further optimize our manufacturing platform through supply chain outsourcing and integrating advanced technologies, enhance our product portfolio through evolutionary products and services for our customers and continue to optimize our balance sheet through additional leverage, fleet modifications and portfolio sales. the uncertainty within the market could be a financial headwind to the impact of these initiatives, but we believe they are critical to accelerating the company's performance. we are confident in our ability to execute and look forward to sharing our results with you throughout the year.
kate, you may now take us to questions from our participants.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] the first question comes from justin long of stephens. please go ahead.
justin long -- stephens -- analyst
thanks and good morning. so jean, maybe to start with something i think you said on rail group margins. i believe you said, second half margins would be better year-over-year versus the second half of 2020. i wanted to one just make sure that i heard that correctly.
and maybe if there's any additional color you can provide around the quarterly cadence? in the first half, you mentioned some cost pressures, the cost saves not really kicking in until later in the year. so, maybe you could give us some perspective on how margins should flow versus what we saw in the fourth quarter?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
sure. thanks justin for the question. so, when you look at the real product segment, what we have seen is the headwinds on very competitive pricing out in the market. and then also the abundance of railcars have been out in the market available to put to use. remember that we switched to making sure that we utilize our existing fleet before we go and add new cars into that fleet.
my comments in the prepared remarks were that the first quarter, we expect to see some headwinds and that is still some decline in the volumes. we still have some headcount reductions going on. and we still have our midwest facility coming up to speed. but the second half of the year, we expect to see results of our initiatives that we have under way putting us positive. and that i said we would expect the rail segment margins year-over-year to improve.
justin long -- stephens -- analyst
okay. but to clarify that was just for the second half and not for the full year?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
no, for the full year, we would expect the rail segment margins to improve.
justin long -- stephens -- analyst
okay. perfect. and then second question is on the operating cash flow guidance. maybe eric this is for you. i was wondering if you could update us on the cares act money that you're expecting in 2021. and is that factored into this operating cash flow guidance? and then maybe you could talk about what you're anticipating from a working capital standpoint as well?
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, justin, this is eric. so, as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, the -- we received our 2018 return $62 million. we had expected at our investor day when we were talking about the 2019 return we expected that to be received in 2020. it was not -- that's about $245 million, so that is now in that cash flow from operations number that i've given you.
based on the timing of the 2019 refund, the 2020 refund which is about $190 million is not -- we are not including that in our cash flow projections for 2021. basically we had a slide at -- we slid 2019 into 2021 and we'll slide 2020 into 2021 or 2022. and then in terms of working capital, we got a significant pickup from working capital in 2020. i would not expect that same type of benefit this year as most of that has flowed through in 2020 already. so, we're not anticipating big pickups from working capital.
justin long -- stephens -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. i appreciate the time.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
thank you.
operator
the next question is from allison poliniak of wells fargo. please go ahead.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi good morning. just want to follow along justin's comments -- or question around margins. you've certainly taken a lot of structural cost out of the business model here, is there a framework to think about incremental margins here as we hopefully start to move toward a recovery?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
sure allison. i'll start on that. if you saw the investor deck on page 18, we talked about the manufacturing margin and how we were going to lower the breakeven by 30% and you should expect the margin improvement over the three years to improve from three to -- by three to 5.5 basis points.
so, we are executing on that. the timing of that's going to vary. it's really hard to say quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year because most of those initiatives were multiyear projects. we have in 2020 made a big down payment by resetting our overall cost structure and we'll continue to update you as we complete these initiatives.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay, great. and then within -- your lease rate trends have been positive. obviously, we've been seeing the industry storage level come in. i don't know eric, if this is one for you or jean. just any perspective on how you think that starts to evolve. is there sort of key areas that we should be looking for in terms of driving demand at least to sort of a replacement level? i guess do you feel like we're getting closer to that actual bottom where we could see a greater inflection? it sounded like that based on your comments.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
sure. so i'll go ahead and start that allison. if you're looking at the north american carloads, year-to-date carloads are down about 2.3%. traffic is up 3.3%. and looking in those areas that have the price spots the chemical and agricultural are the best or the most accretive to us. we still have some headwinds with petro frac and the coal markets. the other thing though that's playing into this is attrition.
i mentioned in the prepared remarks, there's been about 51,000 railcars that were scrapped last year. that's in the areas that have the older or the aged fleet that says the hoppers and the gondolas, covered hoppers and boxcars. now the rate of scrapping increased as a year went on. and i think as long as the scrap prices remain high that you're going to continue to see a higher level of scrapping.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo -- analyst
got it. and i guess we're hearing scrapping and it's coming down. i guess if -- in the order increase that you're receiving, are you starting to sense an appetite for replacement demand at this point?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
so i mentioned again in the prepared remarks that we have a lot more inquiries year-over-year. and that's great to see that. what we haven't seen yet is everyone translating those into orders. so inquiries are up. they're in the markets that we talked about. you can look at those with high utilization, low cars and storage. and those that have the higher scrap rates over the demand is definitely picking up.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. excellent.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and allison, i want to make sure i understood. what did you say was going down?
allison poliniak -- wells fargo -- analyst
well just the idle cars the storage number. obviously, you're getting scrappage and just sort of where we could expect that inflection on replacement.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks.
justin long -- stephens -- analyst
got it. thanks. i'll pass it along.
operator
the next question is from gordon johnson of glj. please go ahead.
gordon johnson -- glj -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for the questions. just a few on my end. can you tell me how much of the operating cash flow was from the onetime tax refund i.e. the cares act?
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. gordon that was as i mentioned we -- in 2020 it was $62 million that we received -- of our cash flow that would have hit into cash from operations.
gordon johnson -- glj -- analyst
okay. sorry, if you said that. i didn't catch that. sorry about that.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no problem. no, no problem.
gordon johnson -- glj -- analyst
yeah. no problem. and then with respect to the flrd, this seems like a new metric. what's the significance of this? and how is it balanced with the utilization rate which was down a little bit i think this quarter?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
so this flrd was -- we showed that at the investor day. the purpose of that was to give you a forward look. some of the things to think about for the flrd is one our comps are getting both year-over-year which is good. we've seen the lease rates in the market stabilize and improve slightly on a sequential basis.
if current market pricing holds, we would expect flrd to improve in 2021 given our current year of portfolio renewals have that easier comp. and we plan on providing the flrd on a quarterly basis to you. so we think it will help you as far as you're modeling going forward and what to expect from us either tailwinds or headwinds
jessica l. greiner -- vice president-investor relations and communications
and gordon, this is jessica. just for additional context when -- we did provide that future lease rate differential for the first time relative to q3 of 2020 in the supplemental materials we have given in our one year look back so you can see how that metric has trended over the last 12 months.
gordon johnson -- glj -- analyst
okay. thanks. that's really helpful. and then with respect to the backlog, can you guys give us any indication of how much you expect to realize this year? and if that's at all front or back end loaded?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
sure. i'll go ahead and i'll start on that gordon. right now we expect 60% of our backlog, current backlog to deliver in 2021 and we'll see what other orders come in during the year.
gordon johnson -- glj -- analyst
okay 60%. okay. that's helpful. and then i guess i got a lot. one more if i could. so this is a more broad -- more general question. it seems like there could potentially be -- there's some thoughts out there that we could be entering into somewhat of a commodity -- long-term commodity super cycle. maybe that's right, maybe that's wrong. but if that is indeed right could you guys talk about how that may affect your business this year and kind of over the next couple of years? thanks for the question, guys.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
you bet. gordon, this is eric marchetto. so if we are we're not -- let me -- one thing that you directly see and we're already seeing that now as higher steel costs. higher steel cost obviously the big input on new railcar prices. so that could have -- if we -- if your premise is correct and we hit a commodity super cycle then that would make certainly asset prices new railcars increase.
obviously, that may dampen some appetite for railcars, but the railcars and the margin that gets built would be more expensive. that would have a positive lease rate increase and that would provide more of a lift to existing car rates more of an opportunity for those existing car rates to move. on the -- more on the supply side, if we're in commodity super cycle a lot of commodities move by rail whether that's for domestic use or exports. and so that would certainly have an impact on the demand side. it kind of depends on where it goes, but i think generally deposit...
gordon johnson -- glj -- analyst
is there any impact from the keystone pipeline shutting down in your business? is that positive or negative?
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i would call it neutral at this point. there wasn't a -- there hasn't -- that pipeline has an existed so the demand has been there on the margin. it should be slightly positive, but we haven't seen that yet.
gordon johnson -- glj -- analyst
all right. thanks guys. thank you.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
the next question is from bascome majors of susquehanna. please go ahead.
bascome majors -- susquehanna -- analyst
yes, thanks for taking my questions. eric to follow-up on justin's question kind of digging into the cash flow guidance, could you just clarify or share maybe a range for cash interest in there? and any other book-to-cash reconciling items that could be lumpy besides the refund quantification? thanks.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so by asking if you -- i just want to clarify are you talking to interest income interest expense i'm sorry?
bascome majors -- susquehanna -- analyst
interest expense in the operating cash. just framing cash interest?
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so that would not be -- well it would be in the income. our debt balances haven't really changed that much. and so it should be relatively stable. as we talked about you'll see in our -- when we release our k later today. we've had a little bit of a pickup from lower interest rates it's offset by marginally higher debt balances. so year-over-year i would expect not a big change in interest income -- or sorry, i keep saying income interest expense in the numbers. but you'll see that as we when we when you dig into the k.
bascome majors -- susquehanna -- analyst
any other book-to-cash reconciling items that could be a little lumpy?
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
in that number there's always some lumpiness, but mainly the big components of it are going to be depreciation and amortization which is a big number. and then i mentioned some modest working capital. and then you guys -- the tax receivable certainly the $189 million. that's kind of the bigger item of the depreciation and amortization.
bascome majors -- susquehanna -- analyst
thanks for that. there were some earlier comments about taking some of the cyclical savings in the manufacturing business and then becoming more permanent this year. can you talk about perhaps the long-term footprint of that business once we get through this cyclical challenging time? and how captive that manufacturing business is expected to be longer term to your leasing business versus selling to third parties? and is that mix expected to change? thank you.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
sure. when you look at it, we don't expect the change in our business model. we think there's a lot of synergies that play out. last year we did have a lot of resetting of that manufacturing to make sure going forward, we could deliver on the margin improvements that we've talked about in investor day through that cycle.
we're going to continue to do initiatives. page 20 of the investor deck have what some of those initiatives are. and you can also look at page 50. it gives you an outline over the three years. i would say throughout the three-year cycle we will be making changes overall. we'll be looking at implementing the strategies that we have in place. and you should see the improvements show up through the years. i just can't give you the get timing for each one of them.
bascome majors -- susquehanna -- analyst
understood. thank you. and perhaps lastly here, i don't know if jean or eric wants to answer to this, but there certainly seems to be a public equity investor appetite for looking at backlog or long-cycle cyclical businesses on mid-cycle earnings and being willing to ascribe that valuation even at those aren't necessarily here this year or next.
do you think that's a useful way to look at trinity's business with the changes that you're making from a valuation standpoint? and are you willing to, kind of, frame to investors what elusive hypothetical mid-cycle could look like with all the initiatives that you've got taking place?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
during investor day, we tried to lay-out what we'd expect on the returns to a cycle on average. and i think that what you really need to look at as a business is we are transitioning to being lease-focused and having our new production and our maintenance facility support our overall business model. we don't expect to stop providing new products into third parties. we think that will help overall with the footprint that we have. but again our focus is utilize assets we have first then we'll put new products into our portfolio from there and we'll service those third parties.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and that -- we think our model will perform. we put out return projections and we think the platform the way it's configured with these businesses that we're going to be able to produce very attractive returns on equity.
bascome majors -- susquehanna -- analyst
thank you, both.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
thanks.
operator
next question is from matt elkott of cowen. please go ahead.
matt elkott -- cowen -- analyst
good morning. thank you. eric, i think, you said the 60% of the existing backlog is for delivery this year. based on this and the current order and inquiry activity, which has not been translating into orders really as much as one would like. i guess, delivery this year could be materially lower than last year? is that reasonable?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
so -- this is jean, sorry. if you look at the range..
matt elkott -- cowen -- analyst
hi, jean.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
no problem. the range of delivery you saw this year it's from the low 20s to 40s right that's out there. if you look at existing backlog currently in the industry, realistically, it's proba bly toward the 20 level or mid-20s not to the 40s. there would have to be a lot of orders coming in very quickly because it takes three months to six months for those orders once received to translate into the production.
matt elkott -- cowen -- analyst
but you still feel -- even if deliveries are lower for you guys this year you still feel confident about growing the operating -- the manufacturing margin?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
we do. we've got a lot of levers in our hands that we can pull. and it's just incumbent on us implementing successfully those initiatives.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it's all why we're trying to lower the breakeven point, right? and it should -- it will start to realize it as we produce our results throughout the year.
matt elkott -- cowen -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and eric, can you elaborate on your comment that railcar securitization market that it's been at historically favorable levels? i think -- what are the drivers behind that? and what it could mean for you guys this year?
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i mean -- simply i'm saying the -- we accessed the securitization market for about $500 million last year and with a lot than we did in the fourth quarter. as we look -- as others have entered the market this year investors -- those investors are looking for yield and revpar assets provide an attractive risk-adjusted yield to them. and so -- and that is driving -- driven spreads down coupled with low benchmarks. so that's why we're seeing the financing that we're doing. and where -- what it means for us this year. i think when we access the markets, i think they'll be favorable and we will continue to lower our cost of capital.
matt elkott -- cowen -- analyst
okay. and during certain phases in the past decade or so, there have been interest by financial investors and railcar assets looking for yield from domestically and then from europe and from japan. what are -- what's the kind of investor profile you're seeing now? is it all of the above? or does there -- is there any region that stands out where people maybe are starting to look at north american railcar assets?
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i think when you look back over the last decade or so, we've certainly seen new entrants coming to the market and look for -- invest in railcars. some of those have slowed in their interest. others have increased their interest. it kind of depends on where their exposures are.
but we still see interest from investors that have yet participated in the market that are interested in coming into the market and -- for those same reasons. they like the risk-adjusted yields of the railcar leases. they like the diversity. they like the inflation hedge potential of the assets. and so we're still seeing that appetite from investors.
matt elkott -- cowen -- analyst
okay. got it. and jean one last question. you mentioned that the inquiry activity has picked up significantly recently, but the translation into orders has not really happened yet. any reason or theory you guys have about why people are not pulling the trigger yet?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
so when you look at it, it's really still too early and the fuel pricing going up is causing some to hesitate. i think as you continue to see the availability of existing railcars out there showing or getting tighter, you'll see that pick up.
the other thing is uncertainty when you look at covid-19, when you look at the fact that we still need to get a lot of people vaccinated then you look at the economic recovery from manufacturing. we've had some supply issues disruptions there especially in the automotive that's occurred. so all of that's weighing in, in people being uncertain and hesitating.
matt elkott -- cowen -- analyst
okay. and just finally did you guys quantify the magnitude of the lease rate improvement in the fourth quarter?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
so if you saw the investor deck the -- what we gave you from the third quarter was 21% negative. and for the fourth quarter, it was minus 13.6%. so inflection point it started coming back up. and as i mentioned earlier, there are signs that indicate, it will continue to improve this year.
matt elkott -- cowen -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
thank you.
operator
and the last question today will be from steve barger of keybanc. please go ahead.
steve barger -- keybanc -- analyst
thanks. good morning.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
steve barger -- keybanc -- analyst
if i try and frame up everything you've said about opportunities and headwinds, it sounds like you think earnings can improve in 2021, but you don't expect a significant step-up, like 2021 is more of a stabilizing year. is that fair?
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we're trying to -- we've given you qualitative guidance. and i don't want to turn into quantitative guidance. so, just suffice it to say, we see it improving. you did hear that, we don't see industry deliveries being a big catalyst for improvement. it's more of a -- it's more of the self-help cost profile changes that we're making. and then, hopefully, we'll start to see demand pick up later in the year.
steve barger -- keybanc -- analyst
understood. as you've modeled out organic lease revenue, based on sequential changes in traffic and utilization rates, care to take a shot at what quarter you expect follow rd could go positive in 2021?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
no. we're not going to guess on that. so like i said, we expect improvement to continue based on the great shoots we're already seeing. but we'll provide that guidance on a quarterly basis. and you'll be able to see that trend.
steve barger -- keybanc -- analyst
okay. and one last just kind of modeling question. based on pipeline, as you take orders for delivery this year, do you expect a nice change in mix? or is the revenue per current backlog that you have right now a good way to think about delivery mix for 2021?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
so in 2021, i would expect that the freight cars will pick up first. that's where the demand is higher currently and where there's, less cars available. and that you would see tank cars lag that recovery.
steve barger -- keybanc -- analyst
got it. okay. and can you talk more about trinsight? how does that generate revenue? what is the benefit to the customer? and how long before that becomes material?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
so from our investor day, we talked about the fact that we're going to see growth there. we think it's valuable to our customers. we are already seeing revenue. we're seeing a lot of interest in having a lot of discussions. it provides them data on. where the car is? the health of that car and it can also provide them information to look at the cargo, that's there safety implications. so a lot of positives for them, those discussions are going well, but we expected modest growth during this three-year planning period.
steve barger -- keybanc -- analyst
and so maybe i didn't understand is trinsight a part of rail pulse? are those two separate things? how do they relate?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
they are separate. so rail pulse to the industry initiative, we are a big player in that. but trinsight is our own internal information that we have from our rail platform. that we are using to help our customers overall with their supply chain.
steve barger -- keybanc -- analyst
and what's different about rail pulse then that's exclusive of what you just said about trinsight?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
so first rail pulse was really just kicking off, so it's behind where we are on trinsight. the other thing is we rail pulse have set the standards for the industry overall. we're a player in there so we can help -- have those discussions and make sure that we're involved for that.
steve barger -- keybanc -- analyst
got it. thank you.

jessica greiner -- vice president, investor relations & communications
thank you, rocco [phonetic] and good morning, everyone. i'm jessica greiner, vice president of investor relations and communications for trinity. we appreciate you joining us for the company's first quarter 2021 financial results conference call. our prepared remarks will include comments from jean savage, trinity's chief executive officer and president; and eric marchetto, the company's chief financial officer. we will hold a q&a session following the prepared remarks from our leaders.
during the call today, we will reference slides highlighting key points of discussion, as well as certain non-gaap financial metrics. the reconciliation of the non-gaap metrics are provided in the appendix of our supplemental slides. the supplemental materials are accessible on our ir website at www.trin.net. these slides can be found under the events and presentations portion of the site along with the first quarter earnings conference call event link. they are also available live during the webcast.
it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to jean.
jean savage -- chief executive officer & president
thank you, jessica and good morning to everyone joining us today. i hope everyone is staying healthy and looking forward to a brighter summer and year ahead. we certainly are and are increasingly encouraged by the improving trends for our business and the economy as a whole. while the railcar market is showing signs of recovery in 2021, we are focused on the execution of strategic initiatives that are more within our control to position the company for an acceleration in our financial performance. many of which were detailed at our investor day last winter as part of our three-year strategic plan.
to highlight the key themes from the first quarter, trinity's results reflect the initial impact of implementing certain of these project initiatives on top of challenging pricing and declining volumes given the lower order volumes last year. additionally, two significant weather events affected our productivity in the quarter -- one of which will have a lingering impact on our business in the second quarter. even so, i'm pleased with our progress toward the goals we laid out at our investor day and the tremendous effort our teams have put forth.
we feel very good about how we are positioning our business for a recovery and the embedded value we are creating in the platform for long-term performance. while earnings were low given the reasons i just stated, trinity's rail platform still generated a healthy level of cash flow in the first quarter. we also believe the investments made during the quarter aligned with our capital allocation framework for creating long-term shareholder value.
let's turn now to slide 4 and review our results. as i mentioned in my opening, we believe the railcar market is early in its recovery from the pandemic-related headwinds of 2020. however, our first quarter financials continue to show the impact of lower demand and pricing pressure in the market over the past year. our first quarter revenue of $399 million was down 35% from a year ago, which was within our expectations, but nonetheless, not where we like it to be.
the past quarter will be the most challenging year-over-year comparison for us, given that covid-19 did not take a broader hold in the u.s. until the second quarter of last year. lower deliveries also impacted our adjusted eps of $0.07, which was down compared to a year ago. while the overall financial results remained weak, trinity's rail platform continues to drive solid cash flow relative to the level of earnings we achieved.
in the first quarter, cash flow from operations totaled $70 million and free cash flow, which is essentially our excess cash after all investments and dividends was $90 million. eric will go into more details on our cash flow results in a moment. what is difficult to see in the consolidated results are the encouraging internal and external trends we are seeing.
i am pleased to report that our operational performance and railcar inquiries are turning the corner and trended positively as we progress through the first quarter. let's first briefly address the railcar market. turning to slide 5, as mentioned, the rail market is still soft, but we are seeing signs of a recovery. market uncertainty in the wake of covid-19 pandemic remains the largest headwind. our customers tell us they continue to refine their expectations for the north american economic recovery and what that will mean for their businesses.
their concerns are starting to ease with increasing vaccine distributions and government stimulus programs. customer confidence in the economic outlook impacts their decisions regarding lease renewals, fleet expansion and asset replacement. looking at rail traffic, first quarter loadings were greatly impacted by weather events, but some positive momentum emerged in the last few weeks. additionally, we've seen nine straight months of railcars coming out of storage, since the peak last summer, leading to industry utilization returning to pre-pandemic levels and trending around the five-year industry average.
we see positive carload and storage trends for railcar types representing over 50% of the north american fleet. previously, fleet serving the agriculture and consumer product markets were presenting the most opportunity based on improving carloads. with early signs of a recovery in the industrial economy, high steel prices and increasing steel mill utilization as well as potential infrastructure bill, we are also seeing positive benefits on railcars within the construction and metals markets.
the energy markets continue to lag. but we are seeing some recovery from the pandemic lows across commodities like coal, crude oil and ethanol, likely associated with the reopening of the economy across the country. utilization and pricing are firming within our lease portfolio and railcar inquiries return to a more normal level of activity.
trinity's flrd metric declined slightly during the first quarter to a negative 14.8% as a result of difficult comps in the quarter for expiring lease rates. we expect lease rates to stabilize to slightly improve in many markets over the course of the year as excess railcar capacity returns to service to meet increasing carloads.
when looking at the potential for new railcar demand, we currently expect industry deliveries to be below replacement levels this year, but believe that current inquiry support railcar deliveries at or just above replacement levels in 2022.
i want to make a quick comment on steel prices. given the decline in industrial production in the past few years, we are in a unique and dynamic environment as it relates to the supply of steel and the unprecedented rise in steel prices seen over the last six to nine months. trinity typically uses contract-specific purchasing practices, existing supplier commitments, contractual price escalation provisions and other arrangements with our customers to mitigate the effects of steel price volatility on our operating profits for the year.
in general. we believe there is enough capacity in the industry to meet current production levels and that our existing contracts will meet our current production forecast. if current steel prices sustain at least at these levels or trend higher, include limit demand for new railcars. of similar importance, current steel pricing could create a profit headwind in some of our near-term deliveries as the supply chain ramps up to meet increasing demand.
turning to slide 6, i'd like to provide a little further color on our segment results. for the leasing business, trinity's lease revenue was slightly down compared to last year due to the continuation of softer pricing on lease rates and slightly lower utilization. the good news is, in addition to prices firming in the market as demand improves, we are seeing positive developments with leading indicators such as high renewal success rates and lengthening terms.
we are taking a disciplined approach to pricing on our lease rates and we believe we are nearing an inflection point as available railcars in certain markets are approaching full utilization. we are also closely monitoring our cost, but expect that maintenance and other operational expenses required to position the lease fleet for increasing demand will be a headwind to the leasing segment margin for the year. as part of our strategic initiatives, we will continue to work towards increasing the percentage of maintenance and compliance events handled internally within our shops.
over the last few years, we have increased our service capacity from roughly one-third to over half of our maintenance events, achieving a target we set out at the end of 2018. with our current footprint, we have the ability to get to 70%, which will continue to reduce the effect of maintenance cost of our fleet and improve the serviceability of the railcars for our customers.
in regards to our railcar production operations, on the surface, rail segment margins are understandably still below our targets. we continue to work hard to rightsize our operations and shift variable and indirect costs. during the first quarter, we reduced manufacturing headcount by another 25% to balance our production capacity with demand. we also experienced two significant weather events that disrupted our operations in the first quarter and impacted profit by roughly $4 million.
first, the severe winter storms that impacted much of the country over the middle of february impacted critical utilities for several facilities with some buildings sustaining minor damage. second, very late in the quarter, a tornado damaged our cartersville, georgia maintenance plant.
fortunately, no one was injured. the tornado damage is expected to have a minor impact on the rail products group second quarter results and we believe our insurance coverage is sufficient to cover property damage cost related to the event. additionally, the company may be entitled to business interruption proceeds due to the work stoppage.
looking forward, we expect progress on our optimization efforts will translate roughly into breakeven margins for the second quarter with continuous improvement through year-end. approximately 55% of our backlog is expected to deliver in the year, resulting in declining year-over-year deliveries although we do expect our delivery rate to build through the year to meet demand from new orders.
moving along to slide 7. in terms of progress on our initiatives in the first quarter, we executed against both our efficiency and our balance sheet goals. over the quarter, we successfully launched various initiatives to enhance the value of our outsourced fabrication activities. i already mentioned the completion of further headcount reductions. in aggregate, we have made great progress to lower our breakeven cost on railcar production and we are starting to see tangible benefits from our efforts.
through the remainder of the year, we plan to continue lean initiatives and install additional automation throughout our rail operations to lower the overall cost structure. we are continuing to evaluate cost savings across the enterprise. we sold several idle facilities during the first quarter and we expect to conduct a number of these transactions over the next couple of years to clean up our operational footprint and reduce the carrying cost of these facilities.
on the balance sheet, we completed a small sale of lease railcars as part of our portfolio yield improvement goasls. this portfolio sale is a small step toward the goal, but we have a number of strategies in progress to improve our balance sheet. as you recall from our investor day, trinity is committed to lowering our cost of capital by raising our leverage to a target of 60% to 65% ltv. eric will speak more to our balance sheet optimization shortly.
and finally, an update on trinsight, which is our real-time digital tracking and fleet data service. we continue to have promising dialog with customers and have moved to an active pilot program with a growing number of those customers. we look forward to updating you on the revenue opportunity and the potential for the market impact in the future.
in summary, we are executing our plans well, and with continued improvements and rail fundamentals, we believe our return and financials will incrementally improve on the up cycle, given the operating and financial leverage we are building in the business. it's always difficult to predict the exact timing of an inflection or the pace of a recovery, but we are encouraged by the momentum we can see both within our business and within the market.
eric, i'll hand it over to you for additional comments.
eric marchetto -- chief financial officer
thank you, jean, and good morning, everyone. i'll start with the financial summary on slide 8 and provide a few more details. trinity's first quarter results are a combination of the challenging post-pandemic market environment and our efforts to position the business for an acceleration in financial performance. while our earnings results are lower in the first quarter of 2020, we believe we are making the necessary changes for improved profitability in 2021. and as jean said, we are seeing green shoots from our efforts within the business.
jean has highlighted several business drivers of our financial performance, including lower overall deliveries and challenging lease and new car pricing compared to prior quarters. during the quarter, our earnings results were impacted by approximately $4 million of direct costs and lost production time associated with two distinct weather events. as we look through 2021, we expect modest earnings improvement in the next quarter with further acceleration in the back half of the year, resulting in year-over-year earnings improvement in 2021.
in regards to cash flow, first quarter cash flow from operations, primarily reflects the lower level of operating income. our working capital was substantially unchanged during the first quarter, resulting in $70 million in operating cash flow for the period. for 2021, we continue to expect cash flow from operations of between $625 million and $675 million.
our investments in the quarter included approximately $108 million in leasing capex for new railcars and betterments and $9 million in manufacturing capex, following the completion of our midwest maintenance facility. over the year, our expectation for net leasing capex and manufacturing capex remains the same at $300 million to $350 million and $45 million to $60 million respectively. we anticipate completing additional portfolio sales from the fleet during 2021 as we execute on our initiative to improve lease fleet returns.
total free cash flow, after investments and dividends, totaled $90 million in q1. the improvement from cash flow from operations is a result of the timing and the financing of our lease fleet growth for the quarter, offsetting the equity capital required. trinity also completed the previously announced acquisition of a railcar cleaning technology company for approximately $17 million. we expect to leverage this new technology and build the capability as part of our automation efforts in rail maintenance operations.
we continue to return meaningful amounts of capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases which combined for approximately $60 million during the quarter. our share repurchase authorization has $145 million remaining through the end of the year. as we look across our opportunity set for deploying capital, we are committed to taking a returns-based approach and do right by the shareholder.
turning to slide 9. trinity remains in strong financial position with a balance sheet capable of opportunistic deployment. we're also making steady progress on our leverage target goals and lowering our cost of capital. during the first quarter, trinity expanded the size of our leasing warehouse. the increased size of warehouse gives trinity the ability to lower our overall interest expense, while gaining exposure to floating rate debt. our liquidity at the end of the first quarter was $772 million.
we expect to continue taking advantage of the low interest rate environment to reduce our overall cost of capital. trinity's nearest term debt maturities, primarily relate to our partially owned subsidiaries, which were financed in a much different interest rate environment. rail asset-backed securities have continued to attract new investors, creating a very deep market and compelling environment for completing new debt deals.
the announcement of our green financing framework for lease securitizations is also potentially opening new pools of capital. we're taking a disciplined approach to matching the increased leverage on the balance sheet with the ability to deploy that capital to create shareholder value. near-term, our capital allocation priorities remain a modest investment in our lease fleet for growth.
a normalized level of manufacturing capex, which includes implementing new cleaning technology into our maintenance business, as well as small tuck-in acquisitions for both secondary market portfolios and other services. our loan to value ended the first quarter at 61%, which leaves us positioned to take advantage of attractive market opportunities including returning capital to shareholders.
in closing, we believe that the strategic plan we laid out for investors is taking hold and while the true success of our efforts will take time to come to fruition within our financials, we are focused on executing upon initiatives that are more within our control and will accelerate our financial performance as the market recovers.
after a year of major change in a worldwide pandemic in big downpayments toward restructuring the company in 2020, the first quarter of 2021 was another example of our people rising to meet the challenge. our platform continues to prove its resiliency delivering a healthy level of cash flows against otherwise lower earnings number. we remain committed to a disciplined approach for allocating capital to build long-term shareholder value. we are encouraged by the continued positive trends we're seeing across the railcar industry and believe outside of a pandemic setback that we're on the road to recovery.
rocco, you may now take us to questions from our participants.

thank you, sir. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] today's first question comes from allison poliniak with wells fargo. please, go ahead.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi, good morning.
jean savage -- chief executive officer & president
good morning.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo -- analyst
i just wanted to talk about really positive comments in terms of the railcar builds in 2022, sort of reaching that replacement level. and i understand you're not giving specific car guidance, but any thoughts on how you guys are viewing that cadence? is it a stronger inflection in the second half that we could see this year? is it more of a gradual building in your perspective? just some general thoughts.
jean savage -- chief executive officer & president
okay. well, thanks, alison. as we look at the trends that we're seeing into the second half, we believe those will continue. it's a combination of supply and demand. last year we had over 50,000 cars that were traded out of the industry and we're expecting to see 50,000 or maybe a little bit more in trade out this year based off the run rate from the first quarter. so, if you look at those dynamics, you would expect to see higher pickup. one thing i do want to point out is in this recovery, the mix of car types is much different than in the last one. so freight cars are coming back much quicker than the tank cars. and so, that's just a little nuance into what we're seeing.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then you had mentioned margin and rail products improving throughout the quarter. any color you can provide to help us understand that exit rate? and then i guess in line with that, you've continued to do some headcount reductions there. should we anticipate that to stabilize here going forward?
jean savage -- chief executive officer & president
sure. thanks, allison. so when you're looking at the head count -- i'll start there -- you should expect to see that to start to stabilize as we've gotten the headcount ready or in place for the demand that we had for the first part of the year. and we have said that we would expect to see the demand increase through the second half. so, you might see a little bit of a change there on what's going to happen. so, it is basically in line for right now. if you look at the margins, a couple of things to look at there is we have been actively taking actions. we talked about be improvements we were going to make in both the outsourcing some of the lower-value added fabrications that is starting to take hold. we have done some initiatives with supply chain overall where possible to lower cost of input materials coming in. that's foregoing the steel prices. you know that is going up and going in the wrong direction there. but we've also spent time on automation and lean events within our factories. we're starting to see that pull through with better efficiencies coming out of the factory. so, all of that coming to fruition gave us a better run rate coming out of the quarter that we see sustaining through the year.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo -- analyst
perfect, thanks. i'll pass it along.
operator
and our next question today comes from matt elkott with cowen. please, go ahead.
matt elkott -- cowen & company -- analyst
good morning, thank you. jane and eric, maybe, did you guys say what your definition of replacement demand is? is it 35,000, 40,000?
jean savage -- chief executive officer & president
so, you're looking at anywhere between 40,000 and 50,000 cars is what we would say replacement demand is.
matt elkott -- cowen & company -- analyst
okay, got it. and eric, i think you mentioned year-over-year improvement this year in earnings. can you help us just narrow that down a bit? is it modest improvement? is it meaningful improvement?
eric marchetto -- chief financial officer
okay. matt, this is eric. so, we did say we're going to have improvement. we did not put any other adjectives around it besides there was improvement year-over-year. but when you look at where we are in the first quarter, obviously it was low. jean commented we expect things to get modestly better in the second quarter and really more back-end weighted. so, i think that's what we expect and that's what you can expect to see from us.
matt elkott -- cowen & company -- analyst
got it. and then maybe a bigger picture, longer-term question about the manufacturing footprints right-sizing. you guys have been doing that for a while now and you did some more this quarter. i believe that you are not ruling out even more in the future. how much of this is due to the current weak environment and how much of it is long-term strategic meaning, maybe not coming back? and if we take a three to five-year view, what will the company as a whole look like from a manufacturing perspective? are we talking about a much smaller manufacturing footprint that's there in large part to support leasing? or can we expect you guys to move back up as a percentage of the manufacturing backlog to the 40% plus that you once had as recently as a couple of years ago?
jean savage -- chief executive officer & president
matt, i'll start on that and then we'll hand it over to eric if he wants to add anything. so, when you look at our manufacturing footprint, one thing that i want to point out is some of the properties that we're selling have been not utilized. so they were there for a potential future growth or other types of businesses. we're cleaning those up and we still have numerous facilities left that fall into that category. so when we talk about selling those types of properties, that's what i'm talking about for the next few years. when we look at demands in the industry and what we're setting up for, we really think that the industry will be at industry or replacement levels through possibly 2024. so, we would make sure that we are sizing for that type of environment and what we believe our share is. and then the next part of it is, even as we have taken some of our capacity out or offline, we've also taken some of the work outside those lower value-added fabrications going outside, opens up floorspace in existing buildings that would actually allow us to produce more cars. we would just be doing more of the high value add and assembly in our facilities. hopefully that answers your questions.
matt elkott -- cowen & company -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you very much.
jean savage -- chief executive officer & president
thank you, matt.
operator
our next questions today comes from gordon johnson with glj research. please, go ahead.
gordon johnson -- glj research -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for taking the question. i guess on the operating cash flow, the guidance for the year is a bit higher than what we see in the first quarter. is there anything out of -- it seems like what you guys are expecting an improvement of business in the back half, anything additional to that which you guys are doing, that's going to help that cash flow number that we should know about?
eric marchetto -- chief financial officer
yes, gordon and i didn't point it out today, but i have pointed -- this is eric -- i have pointed out previously. recall we have a rather large tax receivable on our balance sheet and we are expecting at least the portion related to our 2019 tax year to come into this year. and that's approximately $245 million. so that will flow through our operating cash flow number when that receivables converted to cash. that's the other piece of it. the other piece you're going to see is obviously our cash flow as our earnings improve, then we would also expect our cash flow from operations to improve.
gordon johnson -- glj research -- analyst
okay, that's really helpful. and then we expect in some of our other industrial sectors for things improving the back half. it seems like you guys do, too. is there something that we should look to? a metric? maybe something out of the ordinary or maybe something in the ordinary we should look to i guess just kind of gauge how things are trending versus your expectations?
jean savage -- chief executive officer & president
so, the normal metrics as you look at, as far as carloads that you're seeing, over time what you're seeing for the industry production rates that are going on, overall signs that the economy is opening back up, will all lead to good recovery or potential recovery for our rail industry.
eric marchetto -- chief financial officer
yes, gordon, the weekly railcar loadings are a great indicator of the health of our industry. and so that's the beauty of it is, that you get that real time information every week. and so if there is one metric that i'd point you to for our industry, it's going to be that one.
gordon johnson -- glj research -- analyst
thanks. hey, thanks a lot for the questions, guys.
eric marchetto -- chief financial officer
thank you, gordon.
jean savage -- chief executive officer & president
thank you.
operator
and our next question today comes from justin long with stephens inc. please, go ahead.
george sellers -- stephens inc -- analyst
hey, good morning. this is george sellers, on for justin long. so, i guess to start on your long-term roe target. it sounds like the replacement demand levels for railcars that you're expecting to reach in two years are a little bit lower than maybe what you were expecting when you gave that longer-term roe target. so, just wondering if there's anything that's changed with the timeline there?
eric marchetto -- chief financial officer
george, this is eric. i would say that generally speaking from what we said last november at our investor day that our outlook for the industry really hasn't changed. it's kind of moving as we would have expected. so that longer-term goal, that 11% to 13% goal that was out there, that still remains. we talked about that being a replacement level demand over the cycle. obviously this year is a bit below replacement cycle, or we would expect it to be. and then getting back for replacement level. so i mean without splitting hairs, i would say that the level of nothing has really changed for our industry outlook over the near term.
george sellers -- stephens inc -- analyst
got you. okay, that's helpful. and then could you give us an update on the secondary market for railcars in terms of like where valuations are and just the level of activity there.
jean savage -- chief executive officer & president
so the secondary market is better than it was last year definitely more robust. as you saw, we have a small deal in the first quarter and remember we can be both a buyer and a seller in this market and continue to look. i think it's strong and will remain strong through the year.
george sellers -- stephens inc -- analyst
okay, great. i'll leave it at that. thank you.
jean savage -- chief executive officer & president
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from bascome majors with susquehanna. please go ahead.
bascome majors -- susquehanna -- analyst
thanks for taking my question and wanted to dig into the encouraging commentary on the inquiry levels and what sounds like maybe some increased conviction that the manufacturing market will recover towards mid cycle levels next year. i mean you've just taken down capacity, labor markets have been challenging in a lot of industries here. cost and materials and steel and beyond and just general supply chains have been kind of gummed up and a lot of industries as well. can you talk about the conviction that when your customers, want the cars that you'll be able to ramp that capacity back up to 50% to 100% you would need to get to mid cycle and how you're confident that you'll be able to deliver kind of a historical trading margin as you get to that run rate. thank you.
jean savage -- chief executive officer & president
okay. well, i'll go ahead and start on that one. when you look at our management team, they are very strong and experienced and they've gone through these cycles many times and they're really capable of reacting very quickly to the change in demand. and what we shuttered or idled them -- facilities we're offsetting with efficiencies, enhanced supply chain, some of that outsourcing of those low-value added fabrications. so that also helps us. the ability to ramp the production is more dictated by the ability to get the labor force in, it's not the manufacturing space. we're fortunate that we have very qualified people in the plants we have our own welding schools inside of our own plans. so if we need to go in and bring new people into the industry and train them, we have that capability. so we're feeling pretty comfortable with our ability to ramp up for the demand.
bascome majors -- susquehanna -- analyst
thank you for that. and just one more on the capital allocation. you talked about the returns based approach, you talked about your near-term priorities. with the stock at $28 to $30 instead of in the low $20s, can you give us some thoughts on how you prioritize the buyback versus the dividend on a go-forward basis in and maybe beyond that, we've talked a little bit about acquisitions and your core north american railcar market. is there an opportunity to maybe be a railcar owner in some overseas markets that may offer some more growth mid-term? thank you.
eric marchetto -- chief financial officer
thanks bascome, this is eric. so when you get into capital allocation, obviously, it is dynamic. our share price has changed from last year, itâs improved quite a bit. and so that certainly does change the equation, but still the returns and everything else that we expect going forward. so you know, it's a very dynamic process. we look at each investment decision and in the end we choose what's the highest return. and when you look at what we have ahead of us and what â where our opportunities are, i think you could expect acquisitions, dividends, share buyback, you're going to see a combination of all those things from us. and in the end we are going to do right by the shareholder.
bascome majors -- susquehanna -- analyst
and on the idea of potentially investing capital in overseas railcar markets whether it be europe or india or somewhere else. just any thoughts on whether that's in the potential sort of decision [indecipherable] as you generate cash going forward.
jean savage -- chief executive officer & president
sure. bascome i'll take, this is jean. so we are looking at m&a in different areas, and we will also look for markets that can provide the returns that we need or we're expecting in our business. so, have we considered or will we consider in the future. yes, we just have to again find the right market and the right price to be able to enter into some of those.
bascome majors -- susquehanna -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and our next question today comes from steve barger with keybanc capital markets. please go ahead.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thanks, good morning. can you go back to your comments on steel prices and supply chain constraints, did you say the current backlog, could have some margin pressure due to steel prices?
jean savage -- chief executive officer & president
what i was talking about on the steel prices is we do a lot of different actions to mitigate any of those pricing headwinds. there could be something that comes up that we are unaware of that may cause some pressure, but for the most part, we are covered in our mitigation efforts for orders that we have in place.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
but you do you think that higher steel prices, if they were to persist could cause some demand destruction?
jean savage -- chief executive officer & president
we do. so customers have been already delaying making some decisions. we think some will continue to delay until they have more confidence in their business and where it is in the recovery. but as you look at that, steel price in our new car production, even though at ranges depending on the type of the car has gone up 10% to 20% for the car. so that does change the dynamics in the decision making, so where you're going to see people placing orders are those that you donât have cars that are available anymore for them to take and use, they're going to have to buy new.
eric marchetto -- chief financial officer
and steve, that will make existing railcar assets more attractive, that's one of the things we like about our platform. the demand goes through our existing fleet. and then to the new manufacturing builds and so that will leave our existing, that will leave existing assets a little more room to run in terms of increased lease rates because the replacement costs have gone up. and so, we see that, we expect to see that in the future and thatâs why we're confident in our outlook.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
makes sense. and just in terms of supply chain, i think you said something about component prices, any comments on price and availability from a disruption standpoint.
jean savage -- chief executive officer & president
we've been very fortunate throughout this pandemic. we've had very few if any supply disruptions. most of our supply chain is in north america. so above 90%, so we have been experiencing the same disruptions others may have.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
and are you protected contractually on manufactured components that go into your railcar production.
jean savage -- chief executive officer & president
so just like other businesses you have escalation clauses in there some time for the changes in material input costs. and so that's where we talk about our contracts. we also pass those through to make sure that there is coverage.
eric marchetto -- chief financial officer
yeah, for especially components, it's generally comes through what we call scrap surcharges and that our contracts contemplate those.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. and last one for me, i know you've been really focused on digital platforms and data analytics and the analyst day, you talked about a $20 billion to $25 billion addressable market opportunity for those services. any update on how that platform or how those commercial initiatives are coming along and maybe any early read on trinsight.
jean savage -- chief executive officer & president
i'll go ahead and take that one. so i mentioned in my prepared remarks that we were seeing more and more customer interest. most of the time customer now is bringing that up in our conversations when we're talking to them about their needs. we have approximately 50 customers right now who are in process of going into pilot stages for these and we've seen an increase in the number of cars that are already paying or coming on to that platform. so it's still the beginning, it's still initial results but very favorable recognition from the customer and demand from them.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. thank you.
jean savage -- chief executive officer & president
thank you.
operator
and the next question comes from barry haimes with sage asset management. please go ahead.
barry haimes -- sage asset management -- analyst
thanks so much. had a couple of questions here. one is, i think you mentioned that the flrd was down 14.8% in the quarter, in part due to a tough comp on cars coming off lease. could you talk about how that comp looks for the second, third and fourth quarter. so as we go through the year does that comp state a similar level or just to start to get a little bit easier that's the first question.
jean savage -- chief executive officer & president
okay. so remember our flrd is the forward-looking rate for the next 12 months that we're seeing based off of the renewals that we've had recently, but let me talk a little bit about lease rates and see if i answer the question. so remember there's many different markets and they're all recovering at different rate. 40% of our markets are seeing sequential increases in rates already. other markets still have cars and storage and availability from other lessors, those will continue to have rate pressures and until they are put back into service. scrapping plays a role in this. so if you're scrapping 50,000-plus cars a year, the demand -- supply and demand metrics will give you higher lease rates. so what we're seeing is that everything that underpins that lease rate is trending in the right direction.
barry haimes -- sage asset management -- analyst
got it, ok. let me follow up and ask one related question to maybe try to give a little bit more clarity, if you could take one or two of the car types, perhaps that are starting to get better, could you talk about where the lease rate would have been at the end of the year where it is now? but more importantly with the higher price of steel where the lease rate would need to be for you guys to build a car and put it into lease fleet. so theoretically, where does it have to get to justify new builds, if you will?
eric marchetto -- chief financial officer
so in terms of car types where you've seen improvement generally, iâm not going to give them a lot of details on different car types but generally, we've seen a little more as the slack has tightened on the freight car side, specifically covered hoppers for grain, agricultural products. we've seen a little more tightening there and less so on some of the tank car -- on the tank side, specifically energy related tank cars. there is still excess railcars and serving those markets. getting into your question on what is investable level. so jean mentioned 10% to 20% material cost increases. that statement with no other changes would made lease rates will need to go up 10% to 20%.
now, i'm not say we've seen lease rates go up by 10% to 20% but that fundamentally if you're going to hold the same hurdle rate on your investment. then they would need to go up. and that's why we think the existing car rates will come up because the alternative is invested in new railcar. a new railcar oftentimes provides a ceiling on lease rates for existing railcars. they have similar utility, and so those capital cost on the new railcars going out will give lease rates a little room to run. and so that takes time. it does it, the market is not perfectly efficient. so it doesn't just happen at once. information in our market is less-than-perfect. and so as people start to see that over the next quarter or two quarters, maybe three quarters, you'll start to see that trend pickup and continue.
barry haimes -- sage asset management -- analyst
thanks. that's very helpful. one more very quick one. what is steel as a percentage of cost of goods sold for you guys approximately?
eric marchetto -- chief financial officer
we really don't get into a lot of detail on that. obviously, when you look at -- there is different types of steel, we have steel plate, steel coil and all of our components are generally steel which you're cast products. so when we're talking steel in term today, we're talking more about the raw steel going in coil steel and plate steel. when you get into the overall, all the componentry in a railcar, then basically the material cost for entire railcar is steel. so the only other point on that is that our labor and overhead feat. so when you put all of them together. it's a very high mix when you just look at the coil steel and the plate steel, then you know it's well under way, it's more -- it's much lower than that.
barry haimes -- sage asset management -- analyst
great, thanks very much.
eric marchetto -- chief financial officer

thank you, rocco. good morning, everyone. we appreciate you joining us for the company's second quarter 2021 financial results conference call. our prepared remarks will include comments from jean savage, trinity's chief executive officer and president; and eric marchetto, the company's chief financial officer. we will hold a q&a session following the prepared remarks from our leaders.
during the call today, we will reference slides highlighting key points of discussion as well as certain non-gaap financial metrics. the reconciliations of the non-gaap metrics to comparable gaap measures are provided in the appendix of our supplemental slides. the supplemental materials are accessible on our ir website at www.trin.net. these slides can be found under the events & presentations portion of the website, along with the second quarter earnings conference call event link.
it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to jean.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
thank you, steve, and good morning to everyone joining us today. i hope everyone is enjoying summer so far, especially as the world continues to get back to normal. as you can see from our results, we are very pleased to see the market continue to recover as well. some demand improvement across both our leasing and manufacturing businesses is obviously a welcome development. and when combined with the great progress we continue to make on our internal effort to enhance returns, we're excited for the years ahead at trinity.
as we discussed at our investor day last call, we see significant opportunity to drive returns through the optimization of our fleet, our operations and our balance sheet. in the second quarter, we made meaningful strides across each initiative, keeping us on track to achieve our three-year strategic goals. let me now summarize the key themes from our second quarter. while we're still recovering from the lower order volumes and weaker demand of 2020, you can see improvement across most of the indicators for our industry.
first, railcar loads continue to ramp up from the lows of last year. additionally, the supply of existing railcars is contracting, thanks to elevated scrapping activity driven by higher steel prices. as a result, we saw improving asset demand and steady trinity fleet utilization and rising orders. while we are only in july, from our perspective, we expect each of these industry trends to continue to improve into 2022 based on what we see in our business and the overall economy. if we turn to slide four, you can see how this backdrop in combination with our internal efforts positively impacted our summary financials.
first, our second quarter revenue of $372 million was down 27% from a year ago, which was in line to slightly better than my expectations. our gaap eps for the quarter was $0.12 compared to an adjusted eps for the quarter of $0.15, which includes a $0.03 adjustment primarily from the loss on extinguishment of our partially owned subsidiaries debt. our results were positively impacted by our rail products group operations which achieved breakeven margins from our ongoing optimization efforts.
the last time we're at these -- excuse me, the last time we were at these low production levels was in 2010 and we lost money. we are encouraged that we achieved breakeven margins despite the near-term headwinds of input cost inflation and low volumes. as in previous quarters, trinity's rail platform continues to drive solid cash flow relative to our earnings. in the quarter, cash flow from operations totaled $265 million, and free cash flow or excess cash after all investments and dividends was $269 million. eric will go into more details on our cash flow results in a moment.
to recap, we're very pleased to report that our operational performance and railcar inquiries continue to turn the corner, and we are increasingly optimistic about the year ahead. let's turn to slide five, and i can provide a little more color on the overall railcar market. first, as you know, consumer confidence is very strong, and that activity has begun to ripple into our markets as we are seeing increasing railcar loads which are now running roughly 8% above 2020. however, carload volumes have been below 2019 levels so far this year. so more recovery is required to reach the pre-pandemic levels.
the year-over-year carload trends continue to benefit each of the other metrics on slide five. railcars and storage declined 5% compared to a quarter ago, which has also been aided by strong scrapping market i mentioned. our utilization rate remained relatively flat compared to last quarter. as a result, our future lease rate differential or flrd metric, which is the average of the rates transacted in the current quarter as compared to the average of the next 12 months expiring rates improved to a minus 2.5% compared to last quarter's minus 14.8%, continuing the recovery that we believe began in the third quarter of last year.
this marks a significant inflection point and demonstrates that higher new car pricing is beginning to feed into the overall lease market. while different markets will have different trajectories, this is a very encouraging trend. lastly, the demand is beginning to show up in orders, which were up 224% compared to last quarter. as we mentioned at our investor day, we continue to anticipate that industry deliveries will improve in the coming quarters and settle in line with replacement levels in 2022 and 2023.
before i move on to our segment results, let me give a quick update on steel prices and inflation in general. at a high level, as i mentioned, we and other railcar manufacturers will face a headwind on the production side of our business. although we are experiencing an increase in new car orders, some of our customers are still hesitant to place orders. markets demonstrating the most strength are chemical, construction and intermodal. but we are seeing improving trends across many segments of the fleet.
while it is important to realize, it is -- excuse me, what is important to realize though is historical inflation driven by expanding economic growth is a long-term positive for fixed asset businesses like ours. as an example, inflation has already impacted the underlying economics for many of our end customers in markets like agriculture, construction, chemical and energy. inflation supports fixed asset prices in two key ways. first, asset replacement costs grow with rising prices for input materials like steel. second, increasing commodity prices for asset users make higher lease rates and prices for equipment more acceptable.
turning to slide six. let's walk through trinity segment results for the quarter. for the leasing business, trinity's lease revenue improved compared to last year as we experienced higher per diem asset usage and lease fleet growth. this was somewhat offset by slightly lower utilization, primarily attributable to softness in energy-related markets and the corresponding effects on remarketing rates.
most notably, there are clear signs of a strengthening recovery as renewal success rates continue to improve to a level not seen in recent history. and renewal rates, while in total still slightly down for the quarter, moved into positive territory compared to expiring rates as the quarter progressed. further supporting this improvement and momentum is a recovery to our flrd rate that i mentioned previously. with respect to our cost, as noted on prior calls, we continue to maintain a strong discipline.
it is expected that maintenance and other operational expenses required to position the lease fleet for increasing demand will be a headwind to the leasing segment margin for the year. as part of our strategic initiatives, we continue to work toward increasing the percentages of maintenance and compliance events handled internally within our shops. over the last few years, our service capacity has increased from roughly 1/3 to over half of our maintenance events, achieving a target we set out at the end of 2018.
with our current footprint, we have the ability to get to 70%, which will continue to reduce the effective maintenance cost of our fleet and improve our railcar serviceability for our customers. as a good indicator of our progress, year-to-date 2021, over 60% of our fleet maintenance spend was internal.
turning to our rail products segment, as i noted, we are pleased to have achieved breakeven margins despite a challenging near-term headwind from higher steel costs and the lowest quarterly production volume since 2010. the incremental margin progress we've made over the past six months is almost entirely attributable to our operational efficiencies, cost initiatives and internal supply chain initiatives. we are optimistic that we will see improving margins in the segment as railcar pricing potentially increases given tighter supply and rising demand.
in our maintenance facilities, we're expecting continued headwinds in ramping up our new midwest facility as we are experiencing difficulties in filling open positions at that location. what is most exciting is what we are seeing in our orders, which totaled 4,570 in the quarter, up 224% compared to last quarter.
as you'll recall from the past few quarters, we had an increasing level of interest and inquiries, and it's now great to see those materialize in orders. this is the highest order quarter since the fourth quarter of 2018 and approximately half of our backlog value is expected to deliver in 2021, resulting in declining year-over-year deliveries, although we do expect our delivery rate to build through the year to meet demand from new orders.
let me wrap up our remarks on slide seven, with an update on our return optimization initiatives. similar to last quarter, trinity was busy and executed against both our costs and our balance sheet goals. first, on our balance sheet, eric will give more detail here, but we made the most of the low interest rate environment and have added significant value as a result. in total, trinity has issued and refinanced approximately $2.3 billion of debt since the onset of the pandemic, including our partially owned subsidiaries.
in aggregate, we have lowered the company's borrowing cost by 100 basis points over that time. on top of that, we have continued our disciplined commitment to return capital to shareholders. in the quarter, trinity repurchased $68 million of stock in the open market and also completed a $223 million block purchase from valueact as they monetized a portion of their investment. these repurchases accounted for just under 10% of the company's shares.
turning to our enterprise and manufacturing costs, we continue to make progress on both fronts, which is contributing to our goal to enhance returns. and we continue to optimize our fleet, as you saw by our transaction activity in the quarter. over the quarter, trading was active in the secondary markets and booked gains on lease portfolio sales of $11 million. that said, we expect as railcar demand improves, trinity will have opportunities to both buy and sell in the secondary markets, which continue to open and broaden.
finally, to update on our new product initiatives, we're proud to report that trinsight continues to see strong uptake. although the product is still in its early growth stage, we are ahead of plan and interest continues to build. we're also seeing strong demand for our new covered hopper project, which is hitting the market in the ag market at an opportune time.
also, our redesigned intermodal products are being well received by customers and are driving some of the order activity we touched on earlier. to summarize, the whole trinity team is executing very well against our near- and long-term plans to drive returns and add value for shareholders. we feel confident in the three-year plan we outlined at our investor day last fall, and we look forward to updating you on the progress in the quarters to come.
with that, let me hand the call over to eric for more detail on our results.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, jean, and good morning, everyone. i will start on slide eight with some summary headlines. as jean noted, trinity's second quarter was driven in part by the improving market dynamics for both our leasing and manufacturing segments. additionally, our improving manufacturing margin and consolidated returns benefited from our progress on optimization initiatives. our second quarter consolidated revenue totaled $372 million, which was down 27% compared to a year ago.
this was driven by the combination of lower deliveries from our rail segment, combined with a higher proportion of deliveries to our leasing customers, which are eliminated from our consolidated results. specifically, over 64% of deliveries in the quarter were for our lease portfolio compared to 41% in q2 2020. overall, our adjusted earnings improved sequentially to $0.15 from $0.07, driven by a combination of better fundamentals, gains on lease portfolio sales and our share repurchase activity.
our second quarter earnings and included an $11 million gain on lease portfolio sales, consistent with our ongoing lease fleet optimization efforts aided by the broadening secondary market. we did incur an expense of $11.7 million related to the early extinguishment of debt in our partially owned leasing entities. we've removed this expense from our adjusted results. that said, our segment results continue to improve, consistent with our expectation for higher earnings in the back half of the year. in regards to cash flow, year-to-date cash flow from operations totaled $335 million.
cash flow from operations in the second quarter was $265 million, which reflects the collection of $207 million of our income tax receivable during the second quarter. net of this impact, cash from operations was down slightly compared to the first quarter as our inventory grew, reflecting higher steel prices and a modest ramp-up in expected deliveries in the second half of the year. as a result of these factors, we are revising our cash flow from operations range to $600 million to $650 million, which was previously $625 million to $675 million.
our net investment for leasing in the quarter was approximately $72 million, consisting of $144 million of additions and betterments, reduced by portfolio sales of $72 million. our manufacturing capex was $9 million for the second quarter. for the year, our expectations for net leasing and manufacturing capex is $200 million to $250 million and $45 million to $55 million, respectively. our range for net leasing capex for the year was reduced $100 million, primarily to a shift in deliveries from the lease portfolio to direct sale.
total free cash flow after investments and dividends totaled $269 million in the second quarter. the improvement in cash flow from operations is a result of the timing of the tax receivable. additionally, free cash flow was aided by the debt financing accomplished in the quarter, which increased the loan to value on our wholly owned lease fleet to 62.5%.
turning to slide nine. trinity remains in a strong financial position and our liquidity at the end of the second quarter was $918 million. we have discussed our ongoing work to optimize the balance sheet, and we certainly took advantage of the low interest rate environment. over the past quarter, trinity access to debt markets for approximately $1.6 billion, which included refinancing over $1.25 billion of debt for our partially owned leasing entities and issuance of $325 million of green asset-backed securities at a rate of 2.31% and anticipated seven-year life.
the aggregate effect of our financing activities over the past 12 months has lowered trades borrowing costs approximately 100 basis points. additionally, the secondary market for railcars has improved. in the second quarter, trinity was an active buyer and seller of railcars. we sold 700 railcars, yielding the gain i mentioned earlier. we also purchased 155 railcars, which we were able to deploy at attractive returns immediately. the takeaway is that trinity has the ability to improve our returns with our platform in various ways, and we expect to increasingly pursue these options.
i'll end by reemphasizing that we continue to take a disciplined approach to capital deployment that drives shareholder value. as a reminder, our capital allocation priorities remain largely unchanged. we expect to make investments in our lease fleet for growth, especially in markets where we can meet increasing demand. as we see opportunities in the secondary market, we expect to be a buyer and seller to drive further optimization of our fleet and improved returns.
as highlighted in our release, trinity purchased 10.5 million shares at a cost of $291 million in the quarter, which includes a direct purchase from our largest shareholder. additionally, our dividend in the quarter totaled $24 million, bringing the total year-to-date capital return to shareholders to $375 million.
in closing, our strategic plan is taking hold. and i'm proud that trinity continues to deliver on the commitments we made at our investor day last fall. we are focused on executing upon internal initiatives and the resulting value creation. additionally, i'm excited about the improving market backdrop and how our platform can perform in this environment.
rocco, you may now take us to questions from our participants.

operator
thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] today's first question comes from matt elkott with cowen. please go ahead.
matt elkott -- cowen -- analyst
good morning. thank you for taking my question. can you guys talk about the types of railcars included in your orders and some of the reasons behind why buyers are starting to finally pull the trigger on these orders? and if the inquiry activity and order activity has continued into the third quarter?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
sure, matt. thanks for the question, and i'll start. so when you're looking at new car demand, we're really seeing two different types of demand coming through. the first is going to be replacement demand, that's going to be in the construction, the consumer and the agricultural market. and that's where they are actually having to take older fleet out and they need the replacements because there's still strong economics or demand in those areas.
then, we're seeing some end market growth demand and agriculture falls there, too, but then intermodal and some chemical is also seeing some demand. so it's pretty broad. and as you look across the industries and if you look at the cars coming out of storage, it's not in one single area. it's pretty broad-based, which is very encouraging and helping us to get more optimistic about the future.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
in terms of activity during the quarter, matt, this is eric, inquiry levels have continued into the quarter along with order activities. i think the momentum is carried through into the third quarter.
matt elkott -- cowen -- analyst
got it. and your utilization -- the overall realization declined slightly, but you mentioned that's because of continued relative weakness in energy cars. does that mean that -- the rise in manufacturing orders in the quarter, does it mean that your fleets in markets where the orders came from is basically fully utilized?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
so i'm going to say it's getting close, but really, the slight decline for the quarter was attributable to one major customer that we helped out a win-win situation where we'll see that reverse later this year. and it will give us an opportunity. we kept some orders or didn't give them to them because we think we can get some higher rates for that. and so it's a short-term blip in our overall progress in that utilization.
matt elkott -- cowen -- analyst
got it. and just one last question, jean and eric, we are now all familiar with the dynamic of demand for railcars rising while steel prices keeping many people from pulling the trigger on orders. for you guys as a manufacturer and lessor, does it make it any less painful to manufacture railcars in this environment? are you able to -- are there any cost efficiencies associated with having or manufacturing for your own lease fleet in an environment where commodity prices and labor prices are putting a big premium on railcars?
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so matt, let me take that. this is eric. generally, and this really hasn't changed recently. it's been this way for a long time. we're not taking a lot of risk in the input costs in terms of steel costs. most of that gets passed on to customers. so in terms of the manufacturing process, i don't think that really changes whether the material prices are higher or lower.
in terms of the effectiveness of our -- whether we're going to add cars on lease fleet, this quarter, the mix turned out to be a little bit more direct sale in terms of the order intake and our deliveries were more for our lease fleet. that will change each quarter. but generally speaking, we're able to -- the lease rates that we put in on the railcars that we add to the fleet reflect the higher prices that were -- or the higher cost of our railcars.
matt elkott -- cowen -- analyst
okay, great. thank you very much.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes.
operator
and our next question today comes from allison poliniak at wells fargo. please go ahead.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. so i just wanted to touch on the lease maintenance expense, it seems like there's some competing dynamics there with some headwinds that you know to jean, as well as, obviously, i would assume some level of benefit from bringing more in-house. could you maybe talk about how those dynamics will play out in the back half of the year and into next year? and is there any way to sort of discern sort of that benefit that you are getting from bringing it in-house at this point?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
sure, allison. so when you're looking at this, we're not really expecting anything out of the normal for a recovering cycle. so i wouldn't expect this to be very large. it's just the fact that we have to take cars out of storage, get them prepped and ready to go in service as we're seeing demand increase.
so that's a normal part of an up cycle. and i would just look at our history to see what that may be. as you look going forward, it's really going to depend on what type of prep has to happen for the car types that are going in. typically, if it's more of a tank car, you've got to make sure it's ready for that type of service and may have a little bit more work to be done to it. but it's not anything that any of the other lessors go through.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo -- analyst
got it. and then just turning to, obviously, a nice inflection in orders. how do we think about the cadence in the back half? and then i guess in line with that, costs are structurally lower, clearly by the margins that you posted today. is there -- how do we think about that? are there headwinds in terms of that ramp as we kind of move forward here into this recovery for you?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
we're pretty excited about having a sequential increasing volumes going through the shops, and we think that based on all the work that the teams have done that we'll be able to exploit that or use that to expand the margins as we see that volume grow.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo -- analyst
got it. and then, i guess, last question related to that. i think you did touch a little bit on labor. any concerns that you won't have the lever to sort of manage this upturn at this point?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
the majority of the labor in the areas where we're producing the cars, we're not having issues. i did bring up one labor issue for a maintenance facility that's in the midwest. and that's because we've talked to you in the past about the ramp and expecting the second half of the year for most of that headwind to be gone.
it is still a little delayed. we're hoping that more people are going to want to go back to work shortly. and i think with a lot of the incentives from the government going away, we should be able to resolve that. it's just a little slower than expected.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo -- analyst
perfect. thanks. i'll pass it along.
operator
and our next question today comes from justin long at stephens, inc. please go ahead.
george sellers -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
good morning. this is george sellers on for justin long. i guess my first question is on your build capacity. what does that look like today? and then in a recovery scenario, where do you think that could go? how high do you think that could go?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
so when we're looking at the recovery, i think we're poised well for the recovery. we are already in the ramp mode, as we talked about. so we expect volumes to increase sequentially throughout the year and into next year. and not seeing any issues with being able to do that.
and i'm going to throw one comment, in the past, i've said we've not seen any supply chain issues. we've had one minor one surface that has to do with resins for aligning, but it's in one order. so not an overall market headwind for us, just a slight bump in the road as we work through that. but we think that getting back to replacement levels, we can do that with the capacity we have internally and be able to meet those demands.
george sellers -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
got it. okay. and then on the leasing side of things, could you talk about your sort of view on lease rate recovery in the back half of this year and then into 2022 as well and how that differs on the freight side of things versus tank cars?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
okay. so in the prepared remarks, i talked a little bit about sequentially throughout the last quarter, we saw improvements actually going positive in the last month. even though it could be lumpy from the different type of markets in which of our car types are coming off fleets in that quarter, we overall think directionally, we'll continue to see sequential improvement.
george sellers -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay. and then for freight cars versus tank cars, what are the dynamics you're seeing between those 2?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
the freight cars are actually coming back in and going up faster than some of the tank cars currently, but it's not something that's overly concerning for us.
george sellers -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
great. all right. i'll leave it there. thank you so much.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
thanks.
operator
and our next question today comes from bascome majors with susquehanna. please go ahead.
bascome majors -- susquehanna -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. you talked a little bit about the type of cars that are being ordered and the type of car -- conversations you're having with your customers. can we zoom out a bit and do you have a sense for why this extreme elevation in steel prices hasn't really stopped that activity? i just think it's something that surprised a lot of us on iron. i'd love to hear kind of the customer mentality on that, so we can think about where that goes. thank you.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
so bascome, i'll start and let eric jump in. but the other thing you have to consider is how high scrap pricing is right now, too. that scrap pricing has doubled since last year. and it's actually -- you have to go back to 2008 to get back to these levels. so if you have an older fleet and that's where you're going to come in to some of the gondolas, the box cars and grain cars, that they needed to replace anyway. it's a perfect time with those high scrap prices to go ahead and trade that out.
and the next thing is customers have to respond to the demand that's out there. so in some of those end markets where i was talking about growth, agriculture, intermodal and the chemical, they just didn't have the cars to meet all that demand, so they have to go out and get some.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and bascome, i would -- this is eric, i would just add that while steel prices are higher and therefore railcar prices are higher, as jean mentioned earlier, we're seeing that -- you're seeing that inflation kind of across the industry and our railcars carry commodities, and we have seen commodity inflation. so it stands the reason that i think people can afford to pay a little bit more for a railcar when the commodity prices are up.
bascome majors -- susquehanna -- analyst
thank you for both those perspectives. i want to go back to your comment about progressing to more of a mid-cycle market. a lot has changed in north america as far as some consolidation and mix shift from which cars are hot to a more broad-based market. but as we think about what mid-cycle really means, in your model, can you give us some thoughts about, i don't know if it's market share or how things might look a little different than they would last time we were at those levels. just anything to help us think about the progression in your manufacturing business into '22 and '23? thanks.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, bascome. well, if you look at our manufacturing business, nothing has really changed from our investor day where we talked about the improvement over the three years. and for that, i'm saying that there are a lot of actions that were in our control that we could take without the market recovery. our team has done a great job getting ahead of that and executing on those initiatives. and i think going forward, you're going to see us get to the mid- to high single digits on that margin. now that's the expectation. nothing has changed. we mentioned that a couple of times in our prepared remarks and our outlook for that three-year plan that we did provide you.
bascome majors -- susquehanna -- analyst
and last, i mean, you addressed the labor question earlier and it certainly seems that you and your co-located competitors in mexico have been pretty easily able to pull people back in that were displaced last year. i mean do you foresee that remaining a fairly smooth ramp-up? or as you get more to mid-cycle or better levels next year, do you anticipate some constraints? just anything on how you plan for the labor piece of your highest capacity region would be helpful. thank you.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
sure. and if we look at that capacity ramp that we've had, right now, it's occurring in an area where we are the predominant employer. and we've been able to get 90% plus of our skilled trained employees back. so that's a very positive sign for us. we treat our employees well during their employment, and we try to, during the downturn, make sure we're taking care of them and they're willing to come back to us. we're not foreseeing a problem in getting back to those mid-cycle levels, something could change, but right now, that's our outlook.
bascome majors -- susquehanna -- analyst
thank you for the time.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
thank you.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer

[operator instructions] our next question today comes from steve barger at keybanc. please go ahead.
steve barger -- keybanc -- analyst
hi. good morning.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
good morning.
steve barger -- keybanc -- analyst
jean, you said half the backlog value will ship in 2021. so that's about $600 million. if you get orders in august or september, can you ship them? or is that $600 million a good proxy for the back half manufacturing revenue?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
the majority of the orders that we're taking now will go into next year. we do have a few small areas where we could add, but the majority of what's coming in now will go next year.
steve barger -- keybanc -- analyst
is that for 2q, the order price were lower on those cars? is that included in the deliveries for the second half? or are those more slated for the first half of 2022?
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
more of it is extending into 2022. and the reason that order price that's being lower, that's more a reflection of the mix, the types of railcars that were ordered. there were some -- we've mentioned intermodal cars, well cars...
steve barger -- keybanc -- analyst
yeah.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
... which have a lower per unit cost. so that's what's driving some of that.
steve barger -- keybanc -- analyst
will that mix, the lower per unit cost on those car types affect margins in the first half of next year? is that -- i think, historically, those have been some lower-margin cars. is that correct?
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
historically, perhaps, but i think we're happy with the way those assets were priced in the quarter, and it reflected -- it's a competitive market. but we've seen the pricing -- as demand has recovered, freight margin expectations have gotten higher.
steve barger -- keybanc -- analyst
sounds good.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
and as we mentioned earlier, we're expecting as volumes come back, we'll see those margins coming back also.
steve barger -- keybanc -- analyst
yeah. and so, i guess, bringing it back to the back half of this year, based on what you see for deliveries, mix, price cost, can you get a little more specific on back half margins?
i know they will improve sequentially from the front half, but are we still low single digit? or can you get to mid-single digit in the back half, do you think, on manufacturing?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
we're really not giving guidance. so i don't want to go there. what we've told you, i think, in the first quarter was the fact that, we expect to beat last year...
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
... in total.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
... in total. so that's probably as far as i'm going to go to that line. hopefully, that helps.
steve barger -- keybanc -- analyst
yeah. sure. and well, i guess, to that point, with conditions improving, do you think you'll have the confidence to restart guidance for 2022 to just help investors think about third-party deliveries, lease fleet additions, what eliminations look like?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
so depending on what happens with the delta variant and all, we are considering looking at going back to some sort of guidance in 2022.
steve barger -- keybanc -- analyst
all right. thanks.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
thank you.

i would now like to turn the conference over to leigh anne mann, vice president of investor relations. please go ahead.
leigh anne mann -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, eilee. good morning, everyone. we appreciate you joining us for the company's third quarter 2021 financial results conference call. our prepared remarks will include comments from jean savage, trinity's chief executive office, and president, and eric marchetto, the company's chief financial officer. we will hold a q&a session following the prepared remarks from our leaders.
during the call today, we will reference slides highlighting key points of discussion as well as certain non-gaap financial metrics. the reconciliations of the non-gaap metrics to comparable gaap measures are provided in the appendix of our supplemental slides. the supplemental materials are accessible on our ir website at www.trin.net. these slides can be found under the events and presentations portion of the website along with the third quarter earnings conference call event link.
it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to jean.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
thank you, leigh anne, and welcome to trinity. good morning, everyone. trinity had another strong quarter on a consolidated basis and continues to make great strides to optimize returns, highlighted by our newly formed joint venture with wafra and our new $250 million share repurchase plan, both of which eric and i will talk about later. overall, we remain very confident in our ability to execute and hit the targets we shared with you at our investor day a year ago.
let me summarize some key themes from our third quarter. at the industry level, fundamentals continued to improve broadly, but unevenly. while the industrial production levels have ebbed and flowed with supply chain disruption, overall industrial production is approaching pre-pandemic levels, and strong north american economic growth is forecasted over the next few years. with these macroeconomic trends, railcar load volumes are rising from last year's lows. at the same time, the population of railcars in storage is falling with elevated scrapping levels and relatively slower train speeds. from our vantage point, the improving railcar demand recovery will continue into 2022, which is very supportive for fundamentals in both of our rail-focused business lines.
let's look at the impact of these trends on our consolidated results highlighted on slide 4. in the third quarter, trinity generated revenue of $504 million, up 10% from a year ago. our gaap eps was $0.33 compared to an adjusted eps of $0.29. we'll detail both businesses in a few minutes, but i think it's important to note the strength of our diversified platform. while our rail products group results may vary from quarter-to-quarter based on our specific orders delivered, trinity drove solid and consistent cash flow growth in the third quarter. cash flow from operations totaled $93 million and free cash flow or excess cash after all investments and dividends was $157 million. eric will go into more detail, but the important takeaway here is that our model can drive significant value creation through stable cash flow and a return of capital to shareholders. in summary, we remain pleased with our execution against our returns optimization initiatives, and are equally excited to see continued strength in the industry fundamentals that underpin our future results.
let's turn to slide 5 and we can review the railcar market as a whole. first, railcar loads and traffic continue to improve. the industry carloads are now roughly 6.5% above 2020 year to date. and we're moving closer to pre-pandemic levels last seen in 2019. railcars in storage declined 6% compared to a quarter ago, aided by continued scrapping activity and continued deployment of idle assets in key markets like boxcars, gondolas, hoppers, and tank cars. relative to the modest increase in carload levels, slower train speeds are also helping to drive railcar demand as the average railcar in north america is getting fewer returns.
against that backdrop, trinity's fundamental key performance indicators are improving as well. our utilization improved from last quarter to 95% and the future lease rate differential, which we call the flrd turned positive and now stands at 1.4% compared to a negative 20.9% just a year ago. demand for new railcars has been exciting as well. in the quarter, we took orders for 2,530 new railcars, up 27% compared to a year ago. as we noted last quarter, we believe stronger underlying leasing dynamics and higher car pricing should continue to positively impact our results. and new deliveries will likely trend in line with replacement levels in 2022 and 2023. to be clear, the trend may not be linear each quarter as our rail products segment results prove. that said, we remain very encouraged by the industry dynamics in place today.
on slide 6, let's turn to trinity's segment results for the quarter. in our leasing business, revenue improved slightly compared to last quarter based on a combination of fleet growth, higher utilization rates, and increased services fees. revenue growth in the quarter was also partially offset by lower average lease rates as we cycle through legacy renewals. to contextualize that impact, it's important to note that the forward indicators for lease rates are positive. specifically, our renewal rates in the quarter were 7% higher than expiration, and our view on overall lease rate trends remains positive as evidenced by the trend in the flrd i mentioned earlier.
our margins in leasing and management services were also strong, up 340 basis points compared to a quarter ago. our leasing business benefited from higher servicer fees in the quarter, partially offset by fleet operating costs. we also had modestly higher depreciation driven by our successful sustainable conversion program, which i'll detail later in my remarks. recall from our commentary earlier this year that we expect these expenses required to position the lease fleet for increasing demand will be a headwind to the leasing segment margin for the year. that said, we believe the headwind in the short term is a good problem to have given the value being created by rising demand and the resulting long-term returns to trinity.
now looking at our results in the rail products group, margin improvement progress year-to-date was offset by labor shortages and turnover as well as supply chain disruptions. specifically, operating margins in the rail products group for the quarter was a negative 0.9% compared to 1.2% last quarter. the path of the recovery in this segment will likely be less linear given quarter-to-quarter dynamics like delivery mix, supply chain disruption, and labor shortages. that said, we remain confident based on two main indicators for the business.
the first is that demand for railcars continues to rise as evidenced by utilization, lease rates, and orders in the quarter. the second key indicator is railcar value. while higher input costs like steel conserve as a near-term headwind to our deliveries, we remain very confident that higher cost will drive higher railcar values and ultimately margins as older orders work through our pipeline. lastly, it's important to note that while this quarter was challenged, trinity continues to make significant progress on our expense optimization initiatives in the rail products group.
i'll move to slide 7 with an update on our returns optimization initiatives. we were busy and made some great progress over the quarter. beginning with our balance sheet, trinity and wafra, an institutional investor, announced a joint venture partnership that targets $1 billion of diversified railcar asset sales over the next three years. the joint venture is a significant step in our commitment to optimize trinity's balance sheet and drive roe. trinity also renewed our commitment to return capital to shareholders with a new $250 million share repurchase authorization. in our view, shareholders benefit both from the strong free cash flow that trinity's portfolio generates, and also as we optimize our balance sheet to help drive better returns on equity for the overall enterprise.
touching on our enterprise cost reduction efforts, trinity disposed of three properties in the quarter for a total of $8 million in proceeds and $3 million of gains on asset disposal. in manufacturing, we continue to drive meaningful improvement as our lean initiative and other cost programs have reduced the breakeven cost of producing a railcar.
turning to our lease fleet optimization. clearly, the wafra portfolio sale was a key event driving $325 million in proceeds. similar to last quarter, we were also busy on the investment side as we spent $112 million in leasing capex to add to and improve our lease fleet during the quarter. looking at the fourth quarter, we would expect the pace to slow as we onboard and optimize for the actions taken year-to-date. the key takeaway here is that fleet returns have improved both from mix and the accretive reinvestment of sale proceeds. in addition to portfolio transaction, trinity closed on a small $4 million secondary market acquisition. in the third quarter, our fleet improved as we doubled the volume of sustainable conversions of tank cars, which totaled 242 compared to 119 last quarter.
through the end of the third quarter, we have received orders for over 1,400 sustainable conversions, which includes a mix of tank and freight cars comprised of internal and external orders. these sustainable conversions allow us to pivot our fleet by converting or upgrading existing railcars to better meet the challenging demands of the market and to improve the yield of our fleet. this is an important piece to our fleet optimization effort. lastly, to update on our new products and services, we are on pace with a number of initiatives.
for trinsight, we now have reached our 2021 goal for customers paying subscription fees for the service. additionally, new product development will hit our full goal for 2021. in conclusion, trinity remains very confident in the three-year plan we outlined at our investor day last fall, and we still have a number of ongoing initiatives to continue to enhance returns especially as railcar fundamentals continue to improve into 2022 and beyond. before i hand the call over to eric, i'd like to take a moment to discuss our focus on sustainability
trinity is committed to being a market leader, and promoting and enhancing the sustainable environmental benefits of rail transportation. we believe a more sustainable transportation system starts with a shift from highway to rail as rail reduces emissions to move one ton of freight 75% as compared to on-highway. it leads to less congestion and less wear on our critical infrastructure. to promote this transition, we prioritize product and service ideas, which enable shippers to improve the efficiency of their supply chains, moving more freight with fewer railcars and fewer carloads. we discussed a few of our new products that fulfill this forward-thinking, more sustainable vision including our newest grain car and trinsight.
trinity has also put great focus in leveraging existing assets to meet new demand through our sustainable conversion program. this eliminates the need to produce an entirely new railcar in certain markets. earlier this year, we introduced the railcar leasing industry's first green financing framework, and as of quarter end, approximately $4.3 billion of our railcar-related debt meets this designation. at our facilities, we've implemented a number of different programs to reduce emissions, limit water use and recycle waste. in meeting our purpose to deliver goods for the good of all, we strive to reduce our environmental impact and increase our positive impact on people.
with that, let me hand the call over to eric for more detail on our results.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, jean, and good morning, everyone. i will begin on slide 8 with a summary of the quarter. overall, as jean said, trinity continues to benefit from both the steady improvement in railcar demand and our strategic initiatives.
starting with the income statement. third quarter consolidated revenue totaled $504 million up nearly 10% compared to a year ago. this was driven by higher external deliveries in our rail products group as well as continued improvement in leasing fundamentals in the highway business. adjusted earnings per share of $0.29 grew both sequentially from $0.15 and year-over-year from $0.17 driven by a combination of better fundamentals, gains on lease portfolio sales, and our share repurchase activity. our third quarter results were negatively impacted by accelerated depreciation associated with our sustainable railcar conversion program. our adjusted eps number excludes a $0.04 benefit from insurance recoveries related to the tornado damage at our cartersville facility.
as discussed our joint venture portfolio sale positively impacted our third quarter earnings with a gain of $33 million on our $325 million transaction. in this joint venture, wafra owns 90% of the equity and trinity owns the remaining 10%. similar to the improvement in lease fundamentals, our new riv transaction is another example of the broadening market for leased railcar assets. looking forward to next quarter, we expect our consolidated fourth quarter margins to be relatively consistent with our third quarter results before the impact of lease portfolio sales.
turning to the cash flow statement. year-to-date cash flow from operations totaled $428 million. cash flow from operations in the third quarter was $93 million, which includes the collection of $41 million of our tax receivable. our remaining tax receivable is $192 million, which is not included in our full year cash flow guidance. last quarter we guided to full year cash flow from operations of $600 million to $650 million. given the higher cost of inventory as well as working capital changes we plan to implement, we are reducing our target. our revised guidance is a range of $450 million to $475 million. this is intentional as we are focused on strategic sourcing to mitigate inflationary pressures and protect against supply chain constraints as we increase the pace of deliveries.
in the quarter, we had a net reduction in investment for leasing of approximately $204 million consisting of $112 million of lease fleet investments, more than offset by lease portfolio sales. year-to-date proceeds from lease portfolio sales exceeded the investment in our lease fleet by $41 million. for these -- net lease fleet investment for the full year is now expected to between $40 million and $70 million as we continue to make disciplined investments at attractive returns that support our lease optimization initiative. manufacturing capex for the quarter was $4 million, which brings our year-to-date manufacturing capex to $22 million. our manufacturing capex for the full year is now projected to be between $30 million and $40 million.
total free cash flow after investments in dividends was $157 million in the third quarter, which brings year-to-date total to $516 million. as jean noted, the strength in our platform continues to drive these cash flows and allows trinity to drive value to shareholders through the return of capital. year-to-date, trinity has returned nearly $0.5 billion to shareholders with $69 million in dividends and $405 million in share repurchases, which represents approximately 17% of our market capitalization.
if we turn to slide 9, let's review our capitalization. trinity continues to have a very strong financial position, highlighted by quarter end liquidity of $1.1 billion even after the return of capital i just discussed. this liquidity provides flexibility as we plan to generate additional shareholder value through disciplined, returns-focused capital allocation. our strategy to drive returns over asset growth remains unchanged. while we expect to make investments in our lease fleet for growth, especially in markets where we can meet increase in demand and we remain committed to the return of capital. as you can see from our actions to date, our strong cash flow affords us the ability to do both.
this quarter, we completed our previous $250 million share repurchase program and launched a new $250 million authorization that runs through 2022. we continue to optimize our balance sheet and improve our return on equity, which is a key focus of our long-term strategy. in closing, we are progressing well against our strategic plan. we are proud that trinity continues to execute against our goals. while trinity is not immune to the challenges of the current operating environment, our financial position showcases the resilience of our platform, and the ability to deliver returns through the cycle. as the market recovers, we will demonstrate the power of our platform to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns.
eilee, you may now take us to questions for our participants.

[operator instructions] our first question today comes from matt elkott with cowen.
matt elkott -- cowen and company -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question. jean, eric, canadian national's had that -- the one thing they are most enthusiastic about is the green energy carloads related to alberta's growth in hydrogen projects. they said that the potential is the peak of the crude by rail, but only much more sustainable. is that something that presents an opportunity for you guys?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
yes, matt. thank you for the question, and we have looked at hydrogen and continue to look at the different types of fuels that may be able to be transferred by rail. it's on the radar, we're doing some development on that, and we'll continue and hope that overall that the governments approve the movement by rail for the hydrogen.
matt elkott -- cowen and company -- analyst
okay, and if such an approval is granted, how much lead time should we expect before you guys have an appropriate car for that?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
it would really depend on -- we have a design that would fit fairly well. so it would come down to the testing that would be required by the different governments or countries to put that on rail.
matt elkott -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. and just one more question on the guardrail business. is the improvement in anticipation of the infrastructure bill, and can you just talk broadly about how exposed to the infrastructure bill this business is? and maybe address some of the remaining small litigation risks on the state level.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
sure. i'll start out with saying that the highway business team did a great job. they had the best third quarter ever in the history of our highway business this past quarter. the business is improving because of the input costs a lot. so that is a -- we're able to pass that on along with the freight costs, so you see that in the revenue. when you're looking at the infrastructure bill, will it have an impact? yes, but it's most likely at least six months to 12 months out. the bill has to be passed, they have to get the programs or the construction approved, and then they normally buy the guardrail portion later in the cycle. so closer to when they're ready to start that construction, so that would happen.
on litigation, we've seen smaller changes in our leases on what's going on there. we are seeing less new litigation come in. it's been dropping over the last few years, and we expect that trend to continue. and i think, matt, did i get everything you were asking, or did you have a follow-up?
matt elkott -- cowen and company -- analyst
i believe so. i know this is a three-part question, but i would imagine on the demand front related to the infrastructure bill, even if there is a six to 12-month lag before the -- or it's reflected in the business, i would imagine that the confidence will increase immediately after the passage of the bill and that could lead to some at least inquiry activity. is that reasonable?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
i think it is. i think people may pre-start some projects or they may go ahead with them, but we'll have to wait and see when it gets passed and what confidence it puts out there.
matt elkott -- cowen and company -- analyst
okay. and when you guys spun off arcosa a few years ago, you understandably kept the guardrail business as the only non-railcar business because of the litigation at the time, which is largely out of the way now. would you be open to divesting this business for the right valuation especially that now it's an infrastructure play and it might be in high demand?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
well, matt, i have said in the past that we believe the long-term best owner for that business would not be trinity as we focus more on the rail industry, but we would have to get into the right dynamics, the right situation for us to be able to sell that. so it is on the table and we have talked about that prior.
matt elkott -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you very much, jean.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
thank you.

our next question comes from allison poliniak with wells fargo.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo securities llc -- analyst
hi, good morning.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
good morning.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, morning.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo securities llc -- analyst
just want to turn to the input cost inflation that you kind of called out for manufacturing. i guess one, is it steel or is it actually the components that you're seeing the most inflation? and i guess you had mentioned some older contracts, is there a way to think about how that evolves where some of these input inflation start to get rolled into the contracts going forward in terms of deliveries? any color there?
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, allison. this is eric. i would just say, in the quarter, it was more. probably steel and surcharge related than specialty components, but you also had things like industrial gases being interrupted, both oxygen, nitrogen. so those -- all those things as those gases switch to -- were diverted to hospital usage because of covid. so that certainly had an impact. i think on the specialty side, there is probably some pressure down the road on specialty components, so you have that. in terms of the backlog and how it works through, as jean said in her comments, it's probably less than -- it's not going to be just linear. there'll be -- as we work through some of the older contracts whether they are fixed price or escalateable, they were taken in times when this demand environment was not as good as it is now. and so you'll have that coming through over the next quarter or two.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo securities llc -- analyst
got it. thanks. and then just a bigger question, jean you had mentioned your comfort with deliveries sort of reaching that replacement level. one, pushback were getting quite a bit as obviously rails are operating as efficiently as they would hope just given some of the network challenges that we're just -- to some extent, not throwing capacity at the situation, but some of these cars could actually reverse some of that demand. any color there in terms of how you're thinking about that or is it just really comfort with that replacement level kind of moving forward with limited impact from some stuff kind of returning to storage here?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
sure, allison. so when you look at the number of cars getting scrapped per year, remember we have scrapped around 50,000 in the last two years. we're on pace to do that and maybe a little bit more this year. and the car types that are getting scrapped, many of those have high demand right now, so they're going to need those replacement cars, if it's box cars or grain cars or others. so our confidence in what we laid out there for demand for the industry for the next couple of years of 40,000 to 50,000 is really based off replacing the cars that are being scrapped right now. so it's not a large increase overall in demand.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo securities llc -- analyst
got it. understood. thanks for the time.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
thank you.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.

our next question comes from gordon johnson with glj research.
james bardowski -- glj research -- analyst
hey, guys. this is james bardowski in for gordon. thanks for taking my questions.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, james.
james bardowski -- glj research -- analyst
so i guess the first one is -- relates to the new jv. was that for about 2,000 railcars, give or take?
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no. it was 3,600 railcars. it was about 3,600 railcars and there is more -- there'll be more detail obviously in our q. there is also an 8-k that we filed in august that has a lot of those details as well.
james bardowski -- glj research -- analyst
okay...
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it was about -- it was 3,600 railcars and the proceeds were $325 million. and i'll just go ahead and talk about it a little bit is that joint venture we think really demonstrates our platform. it solves a lot of the initiatives that it's a -- something that we're doing in line with all the initiatives that we have in terms of optimizing our lease fleet and our balance sheet.
james bardowski -- glj research -- analyst
great. okay, that's helpful. clearly that affects your utilization rate as well as your loan-to-value ratio. is that fair to say?
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it does.
james bardowski -- glj research -- analyst
and secondly...
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
go ahead.
james bardowski -- glj research -- analyst
without that sale, what would the utilization rate have been?
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
okay, so it would slightly impact utilization rate by making a little bit lower. the railcars that we sold, those 3,600 railcars, were all utilized. so it does reduce the -- you're selling 3% of the portfolio and 100% that does make it a little bit lower. but i don't have the -- i haven't done the math to tell you what it is off-hand. but i think you can do that math.
james bardowski -- glj research -- analyst
okay.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
in terms of the loan to value, certainly the proceeds of $325 million, some of those railcars were unencumbered, some of those came out of some of our debt facilities and so there is a lot of ins and outs. at the end of the day, our leverage for our wholly owned fleet went up slightly in the quarter. it's about 63%.
james bardowski -- glj research -- analyst
yeah. so that is within your earlier range that you previously guided. is there any change in terms of your strategy right now in terms of capital allocation?
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, james. yeah, you're right. we put -- the target we put out was 60% to 65%, and we are now kind of in the midpoint of that range. that range is still our near and mid-term range. we haven't made any change, but we still certainly have flexibility to change that. but right now, that is still our rate.
james bardowski -- glj research -- analyst
okay, great. and then just a couple more. i'll try to speak through them, but you mentioned that you were going to focus on accelerating deliveries. can you just let us know how much your backlog you anticipate shipping this year?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
so i think we talked about getting cars ready for delivery, so they could go in the market quicker but market activity remains strong. and for the year, i don't know that we came out with what percentage...
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it's in the q in terms of how much of our backlog is delivering this rate in this year and it's about 32%. 31.8% is what will be in the q for what -- the percentage of our delivery that we'll deliver in 2021. that's of our new railcar delivery.
james bardowski -- glj research -- analyst
got it. got it.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
in dollars.
james bardowski -- glj research -- analyst
and this -- i'll cut it off here as a final question since it is a very loaded question. i do apologize for that. but given the rising costs that we are seeing, is there any way you can decipher how much be upward pressure you're seeing in lease rates today is a factor of improving conditions versus simply the lessors passing on higher costs? and...
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
so when...
james bardowski -- glj research -- analyst
with that, i'll say thank you, jean and eric very much.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
you bet.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
yeah, thanks. so when you're looking at the rate changes that we're seeing, a lot of that has to do with supply and demand. in the markets where you have fewer cars available, we're absolutely seeing the rate increase. i mentioned that we had a 7% in the quarter increase on the renewal rate versus the expiring rate and that our forward-looking flrd was positive. so that means, looking at the cars that will be coming off of lease or expiring, we're expecting to see an increase overall in those rates. so it's still a positive trend for us.
james bardowski -- glj research -- analyst
okay. wonderful. thank you very much, again, guys.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
thank you.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, james.

our next question comes from george sellers with stephens inc.
george sellers -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey, good morning.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
morning.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, george.
george sellers -- stephens inc. -- analyst
so i guess my first question, you talked about railcar valuations increasing and i'm just curious. so i know pricing varies by car type, but could you talk about the percentage increase you've generally seen in new railcars. and then how much of that is a function of higher commodity prices versus more just core pricing trends?
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so, george, obviously mix and car types matter, and the amount of steel matters. we've talked on -- when you have some of the input costs that have doubled and tripled over the last -- at least from a pre-pandemic level, that has translated and the core price is being anywhere from 20% to 30% higher. and how much of that is steel or input costs, a lot of it is steel or input costs. it depends on -- there is a margin component and it probably depends on where you're starting from. so margins have improved over the last couple of quarters, but i would say much more of the increase is related to just the inflationary pressures on new railcars.
i just tie them to -- as an owner of 105,000 existing railcars, those was 105,000 railcars benefit greatly from the higher input costs on the 2,000 and 2,500 cars that we delivered this quarter. and so that's really where we get into where we see railcar valuations get impacted as those new railcar prices give the existing railcars more room to run in terms of both -- in terms of lease rates and in terms of valuations from a depreciated replacement value level. so that's really where we get excited about the future with the lease fleet.
george sellers -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay, that's helpful, and then you talked about the backlog, but could you say how much of the current backlog is going to be delivered to the lease fleet in the fourth quarter?
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i did not get into that, but i got to look at their q. i may have to -- hold on. give me a minute. i'll come back and...
george sellers -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay. that's...
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
34% of our deliveries are related to the leasing company.
george sellers -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got you.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah.
george sellers -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay, that's all helpful.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
remember in the past we've told you that typically the railroads and the third-party lessors will come in and buy new cars first, that's still occurring right now. we're getting some secondary market and shippers buying but the majority are still railroads first and then third-party lessors.
george sellers -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay. that's really helpful. i'll leave it there. thank you, all, for the time.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, george.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
thank you.

our next question comes from bascome majors with susquehanna.
bascome majors -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
yeah, thanks. good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. in the spring and even in the summer, you had talked about how you were really well positioned on manufacturing labor, being employer of choice, and east texas and the regions you're in, in mexico, it does seem like that has become more challenging, can you unpack to us kind of what changed in the last three months and maybe give us a little bit of visibility into regionally or functionally we are having the most challenge with labor, and how you feel that's trending as we get deeper into the fourth quarter? thank you.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
sure, bascome. this is jean. i'll take that. so we were very fortunate during the beginning of the pandemic not to have the supply chain and labor issues. and as we've gotten further in, it was just this past quarter that we started to see some things. some of it we think is transitory and that's going to be some of the gases that eric already talked about where there was a short-term disruption in supply and then we had some bout. as far as the labor, in mexico, it's still very strong, very low turnover, very low shortages. within the u.s., just like i think every other company who has labor, is experiencing some of the higher turnover as people are looking -- leaving for other jobs or even retiring and taking themselves out of the marketplace.
so, that came in, again more in the third quarter for us and it's something that we'll continue to work on like everyone else, making sure that we're positioning ourselves in the best place to respond to the needs of the market.
bascome majors -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
have your pain points in the u.s. start to stabilize, do they feel like they're getting worse? just curious where that stands versus the surprise you started to feel in the quarter.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
so the beginning of the quarter was all less. it went up and it's pretty much stabilized from there. so it's -- again, just us getting now the resources in place to be able to make sure we continue to meet all the demand.
bascome majors -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
thank you. and you gave your future lease rate differential and it was encouraging to see that inflect positively for i think the first time since you've been reporting that metric, can you give a sense of what that feels like on the ground? is there -- i mean, are we approaching a point where this price escalation in new cars, which you talked about on a previous question, is creating that faster inflection that you tend to see in upcycles where lease rates can move very quickly? i'm just -- are we there yet? are we getting there? is that on your side? just any thoughts on the supply demand dynamic and tied into lease -- sorry, new car price inflation and what that means for release rates in the next year?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
i'll start on that then turn it over to eric. now, remember that our fleet does expire at different times, so about 17% to 20% of the fleet expires each year. so when you're looking at change of that lease rate, it is over many years to work through all of them. we mentioned the 7% increase on renewal rates versus expiring for the quarter, but the overall average lease rate for the quarter still had some headwinds, so it was still down a little bit. so i think it will take time to work all the way through, but we are encouraged. we've seen the renewals go up and in the markets where the supply demand metric is more toward needing more supply, you'll see that move quicker than some of the other areas. i don't know, eric, would you add?
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, bascome. i would just add to jean's comments that it does change car type by car type, but in absolute terms, newer railcar prices, which lead to higher new car lease rates will cause existing car rates to -- allow existing car rates to come up as you price them. but then also, we've seen steady for 15 months' railcars coming out of the storage. it is that metrics of the fleet continues to get tighter, both from attrition and from increased railcar loadings. so both those things increased, railcar loadings or needing more railcars, move the same freight.
so all of those factors are tailwinds to demand for existing assets and new assets, and should lead to opportunities to improve pricing. i think that's one of the benefits of our platform is as a large manufacturer, as a large lease company with our maintenance operations, we see the market and we generally are able to see these points of inflection quickly and respond accordingly.
bascome majors -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
thank you for that. and maybe to just put a period on that discussion, and i apologize if you mentioned this in prepared remarks. i was hopping calls, but the -- is there a way to think about -- i mean i know spot is not the right word, but kind of an incremental current renewal rate and how that's trending quarter-over-quarter or month-over-month? just any sense of the sequential improvement you're seeing with the caveat that we understand that the renewals happen slowly and the overall average lease rate with the portfolio takes a while to move. thank you.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
sure, bascome, and the market activity has absolutely been increasing. and so, sequentially increasing very, very strong for us as far as renewal rates or assignment rates that go into that. and then we are still seeing a lot of activities for quotes for new cars, and we see orders continuing to come through on that.
bascome majors -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
thank you.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, bascome.

our final question today comes from steve barger with keybanc capital markets.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets. -- analyst
thanks. good morning.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, steve.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets. -- analyst
can you quantify the labor and supply chain issues in the rail group. i'm just trying to get a sense for how much of the operating loss was that versus volume and mix?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
all three of them play a role when the results that we had going through. so when you're looking at supply chain, the inefficiencies that come in from not having gases to be able to do the work you need to do or another example of the valve that you need to put on play into the fact that you can't get the work done on the time that you want it to. then you also have the fact that you either have turnover or labor shortages to be able to do that work. so when you put all those together, it absolutely has an impact. we've not gone through to say, is that 25%, 30%. but when you combine all of them, i think you're going to hear most industries or industrials talking about that impact for the quarter.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and, steve, just -- we've talked in the previous calls about this, our order book being more freight car-centric.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets. -- analyst
yeah.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and so that's there. but i wouldn't call that out as a change from, say, the second quarter to third quarter in terms of mix. it's -- the reason why we're calling out the labor and the supply chain is because those are the biggest drivers.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets. -- analyst
got you. and eric, i just want to make sure i understand your comment on what 4q could look like. if you don't sell more cars into the jv then, plus or minus 4q seems like it's going to look more like 1q given the loss in the rail group, and i think most of your eps came from the gain on sale this quarter, right?
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so my comments in the fourth quarter were around margins before -- when you -- when before you take the impact of car sales, it was on margin percentages. so when you just take the -- that we said the margin percentages would look similar when you exclude that, so i think that's a good way to think about it from those numbers.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets. -- analyst
okay.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
in terms of the car sales, i wouldn't -- the -- we did $325 million of car sales to wafra in this -- in the third quarter. as we talked about that's more of a programmatic over the next three years. i wouldn't expect those large -- we're not planning to wafra transaction in the fouth quarter.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets. -- analyst
okay. how about the first part of next year? is it -- can you...
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. iit's a three-year deal over -- with $1 billion. so you think about it...
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets. -- analyst
yeah.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
ratably over that time.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets. -- analyst
got it. and so, if 4q looks like 3q for the rail group, then the rail group is not going to contribute to operating income this year. do you think 4q will be trough for rail group margins or given recent asps for new orders, should we be tempering our expectations for the oem business for the first part of '22?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
remember, i said it won't be a linear trajectory for the rail products group. so it's really going to depend on the mix and the volume that are going through that. i would expect to see improvement on the same and it may not be linear. and so, we do have a lot of the optimization initiatives and lean initiatives that are still going on that occur through the full three-year period that we laid out in investor day. and as each of those complete, you'll see different types of improvements flow through our results.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets. -- analyst
but is it fair to say that given the asps that you've taken over the last couple of quarters, and the volumes that you expect that the margins will -- are not going to rebound sharply in the first half of '22?
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think the asps really reflect more of the mix than the margins. i wouldn't read too much into the asp from a margin profile standpoint. that's more about the mix is as i think i talked about the margins on new railcars that we're taking are improving because it's a better demand environment than what we did back, say, in the -- during the height of the pandemic. and so, from that standpoint, as backlogs stabilize, as backlog start to extend then generally on the manufacturing side, we start to see margins expand as well. with all of these supply chain disruptions and labor, etc., we're just being cautious about getting ahead of ourselves in terms of expectations because there is a lot of noise in the results.
and so -- but generally speaking the demand profile's improving, which leads to the pricing environment improvement.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets. -- analyst
okay, and last one for me. can you just talk a little bit more about the sustainable railcar conversion program? how are you converting them to make them more sustainable?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
so as the markets change, we look and see that maybe you have the car types you could put into a different market and have better utilization and higher yield, so we can do some modification work to that and rethinking putting a different hopper on, things like that to go ahead and reposition that car, and improve overall utilization and improve yield.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets. -- analyst
are you doing that on a speculative basis or in response to a customer saying, i want to new railcar. i don't want to pay the full railcar price and you finding a creative way to say, well, i can do some more to this car and maybe make it suitable for your purposes?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
great question. and we continue to say that we want to utilize existing railcars first, our existing assets, and that's what we're doing here. instead of building a new car and having the older assets sitting there maybe not as utilized, we're making the choice to -- when it makes sense financially and from a return standpoint to convert that car and put it to use in the market that may have a -- either a longer run or a higher need at the time.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets. -- analyst
but you're doing that proactively or in response to customer requests?
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
it's in response to customer requests. we're not doing anything like that proactively. we either have orders from external customers or we have orders that we need to fill from our lease fleet.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets. -- analyst
and just last one, how many cars in your fleet or in the total fleet do you think lend themselves to conversion?
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
steve, i mean, that's going to be in the eye of the owner, and each fleet owner is going to have different things. when you think about some of the other -- some of the car types that were recently -- have been softer rehab, slower or lower utilization and you think of small cube-covered hoppers where that fleet got ahead of itself as demand change, as carloadings change. so those are relatively young assets, and so those fit. each owner is going to make a decision. we've made -- and the same goes on tank cars where you've had tank cars -- some of the sustainable conversions or things that -- you can do -- i think, retank tank cars, etc. so all those have an impact. and it depends on the underlying age of the railcar.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets. -- analyst
got it. thank you.
e. jean savage -- chief executive officer and president
and it goes to the strength of our platform again. we have the capability of doing those conversions in our own maintenance shop. so it does help meet the demand for the customers and provide us more sustainable product overall.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets. -- analyst
thanks very much.
eric r. marchetto -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
