thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from rod hall from goldman sachs. your line is open.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes, hi guys, thanks for the question. i guess, tom, i wanted to start off with where we are in terms of demand for broadband. i know that just naturally, there's been an increase in demand. but then we've heard other vendors talk about carriers utilizing virtualized enhancements initially just to provide service to people as they all go to work from home and so on, but then maybe people haven't seen as much equipment spending as they would expect to see. so i'm just curious whether you think you've seen the bulk of the impacts from all this. or when do you think the bulk of equipment spending might come? and then i've got a follow-up to that.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes. i think there's i'll try to segment in a way that at least the way i think about it and see if it makes sense to you. so i think where carriers could move quickly, we've seen an increase. and probably the most pronounced increase as a segment would probably be in the tier three space, which has done pretty well. and we've seen significant fiber shipments into that area. and i don't know if it's because of their size, they're able to move quicker or whatever, but they we've definitely seen it there. the larger carriers are all i think they move a little slower, typically. and although we've seen some i really wouldn't say i've seen the bulk of that. a lot of that is still yet to come. so a lot of them right now. and different regions are affected differently. but the larger ones seem to be putting together infrastructure plans and starting to buy infrastructure toward a bigger upgrade. but i wouldn't say, at least from our perspective, that we've seen those larger carriers make a big move yet.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
and if you were to guess, would you say they do it by the end of this year? or do some of that fall in the next year? do you have any feel on when some of these big carriers will delay on spending?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes, i think honestly, i think a lot of it will be next year. there are some plans right now. i mean we are negotiating deals right now that would effect this year. but those are just the negotiations, so whether or not they actually pull the trigger this year, some of that may weather has an impact to that as well. so whether or not they're able to actually do that, i will tell you there are discussions and kind of negotiations going on, but i would still think the majority of that is going to be next year.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. and then my the follow-up question i had for you is on the opex. the opex guide was a little bit below what we had expected. i'm just curious, are you guys taking active measures to reduce opex? or is this just sort of the natural flow of not having less travel and things like that?
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
no, we've actually i mean travel has helped us on the opex line, but we have been moving toward a $50 million goals toward at the end of this year for the last year about the last year or so. so it's really just on plan to what we have been targeting.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. and you don't think you'll undershoot that because of the travel, if travel restrictions continue?
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
i wouldn't say that. right now, our $50 million goal is our $50 million goal. and to the extent travel picks back up, then you'll see us continue to keep things that will allow us to be around that $50 million goal.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay, all right, thank you.
operator
okay. your next question comes from the line of michael genovese with mkm partners. your line is open.
michael genovese -- mkm partners -- analyst
great, thanks. can you give us any examples yet where you had examples or i guess we do know of a couple already. but have you seen new examples about huawei replacement opportunities? can you talk about what you're seeing there in terms of number of trials and where those are regionally?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes. so with europe, we've seen it most pronounced in the u.k. and in germany. we have some of the customers that i actually mentioned in my notes were actually huawei customers that have decided to move away. there are some large deals that we talked about in the past, i think, have been positively influenced by the move, like i said, most notably in germany and the u.k., where there are plans being put in place. and for instance, in the u.k., there are government mandate now to limit, what they call, hostile vendor equipment being installed in the network. and in some cases, they're actually pulling the equipment out. so it's all through europe. less so in the u.s. because there's just less of a footprint in the u.s. it's not really happening in latin america, in any big places. you add brazil, there's some of that. but it really isn't as widespread as it is in europe because the dominance of those vendors were pretty strong in europe.
michael genovese -- mkm partners -- analyst
okay. great. and when talking about the share gains in pon fiber to the home, so i mean are those primarily coming in north america? or are they in other regions as well? and then i imagine they must be you really only have two competitors. is that right? i mean in those kind of share shifts in, say, north america, are you up against two players? or is it a bigger group of players that have any meaningful share there?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
in north america north america is fundamentally two players, one in europe and one in the u.s. the european, of course, is a very, very large player. so yes, two cases there. and then in europe, it's really two players two different players. it is huawei being one of those and then a european carrier as well the same european, excuse me, vendor as well.
michael genovese -- mkm partners -- analyst
so are those that you already mentioned, are they happening in both regions?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes, without a doubt. absolutely positively. the numbers i showed you say because we only have it was the numbers that came out of the most recent deloro report and us moving up to that second place, which is still behind that european vendor, but it was a really solid move for us. i mean picking up eight points, and then i think at a quarter is pretty strong.
michael genovese -- mkm partners -- analyst
okay. and just two more quick ones. so i mean you announced and talked a lot about it, the british telecom win. it sounds like from your comments that shipments have maybe started or revenues have not started. am i reading that right?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
shipments have not started well, let me put this, material shipments have not started. in fact, in that case, shipments have not even started at all. so that is one that we expect to be shipping sometime in 2021 and to be more pointed, we expect to ship in the first half of 2021. we are going through the lab process right now. there will be customer trials that will happen before, mass deployment, but that deployment should start in the first half of next year.
michael genovese -- mkm partners -- analyst
okay. great. and then finally, do you just do you have an estimate yet? is it meaningful yet? i mean to talk about an estimate of overall recurring revenues and then your comments on how that would trend in the future, like a percentage of your recurring revenues in your business?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
we haven't really broken that out yet. so we're in the midst of looking at it. we've launched a lot of new software products and services over the last probably five months that are starting to take fruition, but we have not broken that out. we will be looking at doing that, but probably more toward next year than this year.
michael genovese -- mkm partners -- analyst
thank you, tom.
operator
okay. your next question comes from the line of rich valera with needham & company. your line is open.
rich valera -- needham and company -- analyst
thank you, tom, you gave some pretty specific on one of the, i think, tier one wins that you referenced in your prepared remarks, the british telecom one. can you give us any color on the other two, the sort of the status of them and expected timing of shipment?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
sure. yes, my color was really meant to cover all 3. so all three are on track. all three will be shipping next year. honestly, i believe all three will be shipping for the first half of next year, but give me some lead way because they are carriers. but all three of them are going well and were either we have shipped product to all three, including software. so we're just going through the lab process. we will have some announcements later on this quarter about customer deployments with some of those 3. but we let's wait for those announcements. but those will be initial, let's get it up and running and get it started, they won't be the mass deployment piece and be fully operationalized until early next year.
rich valera -- needham and company -- analyst
can you remind us what you said about the two that aren't british telecom, like what you said publicly about them today?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
we have announced...
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
we announced the european market, we have not named the u.s. one.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
okay. the tier one in the u.s. i guess we haven't announced. that was for sdx, mosaic, disaggregated, start deploying this across the entire footprint. and it's 100%. at this point, we are the only provider that is going to be doing that, and that will happen like i said, get operationalized this year. it is a customer that we've had before. and let me see, it's not a wireless carrier, so that kind of narrows it down. in europe, long-standing relationship with a german service provider that is moving forward with our disaggregated solution.
rich valera -- needham and company -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then just on fourth quarter, i know you don't give guidance more than a quarter out, but wondering if you could comment sort of if you think this year, you're going to see typical seasonality or maybe if some of these programs you're talking about, which might hit might change the profile of that and i guess maybe even defining typical seasonality since, let's say, the last couple of years have been flattish, 3q to 4q. and historically, i think it's been a down quarter, but any thoughts at all there would be helpful.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
it usually is down in the single digits, kind of like high single digits. i really don't i don't think that these will move that needle this year materially. i think i mean we're trying to get through the lab as quickly as possible. there are i had mentioned before that there are some negotiations going on for kind of to actually help some of the business get kick-started in the fourth quarter for these carriers because they're wanting to get on with it, but i think those are speculative at this point. so i wouldn't do anything other than to say there's nothing that looks materially different in seasonality with the fact that there is still a covid impact to everything. and sometimes, it's a positive impact. sometimes, it's a negative impact. biggest issue that we have today is not really demand, the biggest issue we have today is making sure that we have enough supply. so there are some still material shortages out there. if you look at the semiconductor industry right now, it's lead times are ridiculous, and it's not getting any looser. so that's probably that is the biggest hurdle we have. i think mike mentioned that in his comments as well. i think it's really making sure that we have the material available.
rich valera -- needham and company -- analyst
got it. just one more, if i could. you mentioned real strong growth in the fiber portion of your business, i guess, both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. can you give us a sense of what that is as a percent of either total revenue, product revenue, whatever you wanted to slice that?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
mike, do we break that out? let me turn that over to mike.
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
we have not reported that in the past. but the fiber revenue piece is definitely growing faster than any other piece. as copper is a little more spotty, so it tends to be up and down, but over time, it's declining. and fiber is actually larger than the copper piece of our business, but we haven't actually broke it down to percentages.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
i mean it's a very material piece of our business, it's bigger than copper today, and it is growing really strong. and that's before we actually start shipping any of the tier one awards that we have won. so it's not a bad place to be right now.
rich valera -- needham and company -- analyst
okay. yeah, that's great. thank you.
operator
okay. your next question comes from the line of fahad najam with cowen and company. your line is open.
fahad najam -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you for taking my question. tom, if you look at some of your the health of your customers. in the u.s., you have windstream is about to emerge from bankruptcy. frontier's further along and is restructuring. centurylink reported last night fairly decent financial operating results. are you beginning to see any kind of stepped-up engagement, especially with a more restructure those service lines that have been going on to restructuring. are you seeing more engagement with them? can you provide some outlook as to how you are thinking about your business with these providers in the u.s.?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes, sure. so we had mentioned that actually tier 2s and tier three, i believe we mentioned that in my comments were actually strong in the quarter. i think we actually did that in the press release actually last night. and so that speaks directly to what you're talking about. so the carriers that have gone through the process are very much through that process, seemed to be opening back up and have set public goals on what they want to cover. and they believe that fiber deployment and broadband is their growth path, and they're executing on that. and we're seeing a benefit from that. i would expect that just to continue on from where we are right now. in the tier one space, it's maybe a little bit more muted, i think, as they kind of i think as they have some really real needs in their planning their process right now, but the same thing happening with at least the long-standing customers that we have there. and that's part of that whole award with the disaggregated piece, getting that through their labs, so that they actually have a platform that they want to grow in the future. so the direct answer to your question is, yes, that space has gotten better. it was abysmal last year, but it's definitely gotten better this year.
fahad najam -- cowen and company -- analyst
sure. okay. i appreciate the color. related question is, can you walk us through your customer concentration? can you give us a color on how much top five customers accounted for the percent of total revenue, top 10 customers as a percentage of total revenue? just trying to get a sense on how concentrated your revenue piece is.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
well, let me we don't really go through that detail. but i will tell you that quarter in and quarter out over the last year or so, what always shows up in that top five or six customers is the distribution channel to the rsps, so to the regional carriers, the tier 2s, the tier 3s and the municipalities. it's really more tier 3s and tier 2s. so that is always in that, let's say, top six and so that piece of it and if you aggregate all of our distributors that sell into that market, they're usually in the top two or three or sometimes the largest. so there is a big chunk of our business that has moved from kind of like the telmexes of the world to that distribution component, which sells to hundreds of rsps. so that portion isn't very so that literally, the biggest portion of our business usually is a very distributed piece. the problem is, is getting one of those carriers by themselves don't mean a lot. but when you aggregate them, they're a very large piece of our business.
fahad najam -- cowen and company -- analyst
can you give us a sense of how big that is? is it like 30%, 40% of your total revenue?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
let me say, it would be over 30% of our business. mike, i'm looking at you, just give me the nod. yes?
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes.
fahad najam -- cowen and company -- analyst
all right. i appreciate the answers. i'll pass.
operator
okay. your next question comes from the line of tim savageaux with northland capital. your line is open.
tim savageaux -- northland capital -- analyst
hey, good morning. i wanted to dive down on the guidance a little bit for q3 in light of, i guess, what you just mentioned, which i think kind of the rural broadband piece of your business served by distribution at 30% plus of revenues and also looking at the fiber performance. in q2, i think you mentioned it was up 21% sequentially. so as you look into q3, i mean, do you expect trends in either one of those markets, understanding they overlap, to slow a bit? because it seems like a continuation of those trends would drive you on the stronger levels, are you seeing offsets anywhere either on the copper side or internationally?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
so to answer your first question, i think that trend will continue. i will tell you that we exited the quarter with a strong backlog, and some of our trepidation has to do with just making sure that we don't have any supply chain issues that would have held us to meet that demand. like i said, there's very strong demand in that segment of the business. as far as offsets, i don't i will tell you that some of our carriers are a little more seasonal. so usually, the german our strong german carriers usually slows down some in q3. and then the other big component of that right now is kind of we have not quite the visibility is what australia will do, whether it'll be up or down. that's probably the only offsets that i can think of. i think everything else is at. and australia very well could be up, but i think everything else is up
tim savageaux -- northland capital -- analyst
if i can just follow up on that. it seems like australia will be working from home for question time, so maybe that will be up. but any chance you could size any potential supply impact that you might be seeing in q3?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
every time we've gone into if we went into this quarter, it looks big and then we whittle it down. i would say the same thing is here today. i mean it's i don't know actually. i mean right now, what's happening is people give you days and then they try to beat the days, and the days they give are terrible and then they try to come in and improve on what is a difficult supply environment. and i think that's going to be the same case here. so whatever i gave you would not be correct. i would just tell you we're working through it. we've worked through it every quarter so far. and we've been able to keep all of our customers happy with what we've been able to deliver to them. and it truly is just a there are a few vendors that are just having real capacity issues, and they're trying to keep up. we have enough capacity here to be able to manufacture plenty. that's not the issue. it's really just a matter of us making sure we can get all the components.
tim savageaux -- northland capital -- analyst
thank you.
operator
okay. your next question comes from the line of george notter with jefferies. your line is open.
george notter -- jefferies -- analyst
hi guys, thanks a lot guys. maybe just along those lines, how much of a gross margin impact do you think you're seeing because of the component supply chain issues this quarter, q2 and before, in q3? and then i've got another question also.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes. probably the biggest impact that we saw because we really don't see prices escalating. there are some components where we had to buy, and they're more expensive. but i would say that that's not that material. i wouldn't even call it material. where we've seen the biggest impact is on freight where we've seen our spending on freight. but our impact on freight probably, right now, we're paying about twice what we were paying a year ago on freight. and that just has to do with the number of lanes that are open and the last minute kind of component shortages, things coming through, and that having to flat things. so it's not what we typically like to do. but so the biggest impact is on freight. and my guess it would be we're talking about a couple of million dollars in freight in the quarter.
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
that's right.
george notter -- jefferies -- analyst
got it, a couple of million dollars incrementally this quarter.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
material for us on gross margin, right?
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, between one and two percentage points.
george notter -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. great. and then if i and then looking forward for q3, i mean do you think that would be the same level? or when do you think that might abate? is that going to be with us for the rest of the year? what's the perception?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
my guess will be it will be with us for the rest of this year. just it just really hasn't eased up. and like i said, it's not the entire supply chain. the optics have gotten better. it's really silicon where we're seeing the biggest issue. and yes, my sense is it's just going to be that way through the rest of this year.
george notter -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. okay. and then i also wanted to ask about your opportunity in europe vis-a-vis huawei. yes, i heard certainly your comments about the bt project and then deutsche telekom. but if you look elsewhere in europe, are you seeing opportunities also presenting themselves to displace huawei? and obviously, you've got a big competitor in nokia over there, which is an incumbent in a lot of those accounts, but how do you kind of see your positioning for that opportunity relative to nokia in terms of picking up incremental business?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
i feel really good about picking up incremental business. so in most of these carriers and by the way, there are other tier 1s. i mean i don't want to preannounce processes that are out there, but they're right now, the software deals that are literally going to be decided this week with a major tier one. there's pon xgs-pon deals that are going to be mounted by major tier 1s over the next probably three to four months. i just announced that i just mentioned on that we had won a tier one account, another tier one account in europe, that will be announced by us, we say within, i think, september or so. so i mean the benefit that we have is most of these carriers have two vendors, and they don't with a single source. so our ability to pick up share in relation to who is already a source within these accounts is very strong. and as you probably understand this as well as anybody, we're coming at it with a truly disaggregated kind of next-generation xgs capable system, that's being controlled, orchestrated in everything. and that's what they so they're going to make a choice. it's really easy for them to say, well, now is the time to do this. and it works, right? it's up and running. and so i think we have a good we have the best competitive product out there. and at the same time, they don't want a single source. so we're just in a really good position in europe. it is it's a good place to be, like i said.
george notter -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. okay. and then the timing on those opportunities. i guess there's a lot of factors. there are probably plenty of this. i mean, certainly, the direct product rule may have an impact on people's ability to continue to source huawei gear that would make this, i think, skew faster. and then on the flip side, i think in a lot of those situations, you have been and historically been a supplier in a lot of those types of accounts. and so maybe it takes longer to qualify a product, train people and so on. i mean how do you kind of think about the yin and yang of timing?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
well, i think so what we did sometime back as we started really we put a footprint in your outside of what we normally did in germany. and what we were trying to do is to grow recognition within the community there within the eu about our fiber expertise, right? so we started winning a bunch of alt-net carriers. and those kind of helped us get credibility within the larger carriers. and we did have a relationship, for instance, with bt prior. although we weren't selling them anything, they have known us and we had been through a couple of processes with them. i can't really overemphasize the importance of having dt and bt buying our next-generation disaggregated solution as being a proof point for other carriers that are trying to figure out what to do. they're the two you'd want to have. and so not only do we have small carriers, but we have two very large carriers that are moving forward and have selected our next-generation system. so i think it's done well. now as far as the timing, i mentioned before that what we're doing, and i just i want to make sure i said it, trouble here to see what we've already announced, but we have a very accelerated time frame on getting these things operationalized. so there's been no slowdown because of lack of knowledge. and in fact, the feedback that we've been getting has been very positive on where we are positioned relative to what their historical experience has been in getting these things approved. so i don't think that is the problem.
george notter -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks very much.
operator
okay. your next question comes from the line of paul silverstein with cowen. your line is open.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
thanks. first, mike, your explanation earlier, i apologize, but i appreciate your comment about the trade cost causing one to two percentage points of gross margin. i guess, i'm curious why what's depressing gross margins into that low 40s range? i know you said consistently that mid-40s is what original best case is. if deutsche telecom is going to be down in the third quarter, consistent with historical seasonality, and that's always been a meaningfully lower gross margin, why wouldn't that help move gross margin up? and what's keeping gross margins depressed? and finally, on the same vein, if and when these large wins kick in, do they help gross margin? as i would think if the event solutions or because they're european, non-u.s., do they continue to depress or further suppress gross margin consistent with the historical disparity in the gross margin profile between u.s. and non-us?
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
i'll let tom cover the new tier one wins, but i do want to say what i've said over time is low to mid-40s as the target, not necessarily mid. so you might be modeling the long-term target at 45%, and i'm thinking it's somewhere around 42%, 42.5% somewhere in there. so generally, that's about where we've been depending on mix. so we continue to work to improve gross margins through our cost basis and a lot of different things. but at the same time, there's always price pressure and new wins and all the rest of that. so we do continue to expect that we'll be in the low to mid. so that's what i would keep in your mind.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
on the longer-term issues with respect to these new ones?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
i wouldn't expect a new win. i'm not going to i wouldn't expect the new wins to change the margin profile from where we are now. i mean when we talk about mid-40s, that includes new wins.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
just to tie this up, with dt being down, your expectation that dt will be down in the third quarter consistent, why want that help improve gross margin? i recognize we're only talking about one quarter, but what do you offset that's pushing gross margins down?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
first of all, dt itself, depending if they're buying line cards, as you are well aware, or buying chassis or buying switch modules, the margin profile of those are dramatically different, unfortunately, they're dramatically different. so although there's maybe lower revenue in dt, depending on the mix of what we're shipping that quarter, it can have a negative impact on gross margins.
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
we're also seeing strength in cpe. so the end points for the fiber network and those things tend to also have a lower margin than the rest of our access and ag business for fiber.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
we do have some cost reduced products that are coming out later this year. but without a doubt, olts are a drag on margin.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
okay. i appreciate your response.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
all right. at this point, i think we're out of time. so i appreciate everybody that joined us on the conference call today. look forward to talking to you next quarter. [operator closing remarks]

operator
thank you for standing by, and welcome to adtran's second quarter 2020 earnings release conference call. [operator instructions] during the course of the conference call, adtran representatives expect to make forward-looking statements, which reflect management best judgment based on factors currently known. however, these statements involve risks and uncertainties, including the continued spread and the extent of the impact of the covid-19 global pandemic, the ability of component supplies to align with customer demand, the successful development and market acceptance of our products, competition in the market for such products, the product and channel mix, component costs, manufacturing efficiencies and other risks detailed in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019. these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, which may be made during the call.
it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to tom stanton, chief executive officer of adtran. sir, please go ahead.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
thank you, tamia. good morning, everyone. we appreciate you joining us for our second quarter 2020 conference call. with me today is adtran's cfo, mike foliano. following my opening remarks, mike will review the quarterly financial performance in detail, and then we'll take your questions. to begin, i'd like to address the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. given our global operations, we have been carefully monitoring the covid environment in all regions where our employees and customers reside. we continue to strive to deliver the right solution to help people stay connected through these difficult times. adtran has been extremely proactive in taking significant measures to protect our employees, partners and customers, and i want to thank our employees for the diligence they're using to keep themselves and others safe. one thing that is abundantly clear thus far through the pandemic is the vital importance of high-speed broadband connectivity. and adtran is committed to providing an exceptional broadband experience to help drive the global economic recovery. whether it's work on home, school from home, enabling virtual healthcare, keeping businesses running or keeping families connected, we are doing what we can to make that experience exceptional. 2020 continues to be a pivotal year for the company. the fiber investment cycle has continued to accelerate globally aided by government actions to encourage broadband service providers to limit and/or ban the threat of high-risk vendors in their critical infrastructure. this timing aligns well with these operators' plan to transition to next-generation software-defined architectures, creating tremendous new opportunities for adtran in our sdx and mosaic cloud platforms.
furthermore, the need for network and home virtualization to provide better connectivity, enable remote customer connections and changes and provide a better integrated experience is fueling our momentum with our mosaic software subscription services. during the quarter, we made tremendous progress in capturing new customer opportunities with next-generation platforms, subscription software and services. we exited the first half of 2020 with very strong momentum in our fiber business with a good mix of awards in both the gpon and xgs-pon. as a result, we have been gaining market share and have jumped to the number two position to become the leading u.s.-based supplier in north america for all pon olts in the most recent market share reports industry analyst firm, delaware. gaining seven share points in the xgs-pon category, adtran gained eight share points against our competitors in the strategic growth market. our market share gains not only include service providers that are moving from legacy fiber access solutions to next-generation platforms where we are also continuing to see a surge of new entrants in the market, including utilities, municipalities, developers and electric co-ops in the u.s. and alternative broadband providers in europe and australia who have stepped up to deliver gigabit services to unserved and underserved communities. we are very pleased that we added 33 new service provider customers during the quarter, bringing our new customer account for the year to 61. these operators are now counting on adtran to help them accelerate the delivery of exciting new services in the communities that they serve. we are making excellent progress at each of our tier one operators in the u.k., the eu and north america, in which we have one major awards with our software-defined sdx fiber access platform, and we are on track to start seeing material revenue from these programs in 2021.
and in fact, we will soon be announcing live customer on some of these awards this quarter. these market share gains new customers and scale tier one awards position the company for solid growth for many years to come. given that backdrop, the financial results for the second quarter demonstrated solid execution against our plan with strong demand in most of our segments, with the domestic regional and emerging service provider market segment leading the way. from a top line perspective, revenue for the quarter was $128.7 million, with 41.5% gross margins. network solutions accounted for 80% 86% of the revenue at 111.3%. global services revenue contributed 17.4%. to provide some context, our 2019 revenue included a major latam project. excluding this project, revenue was up 12% in 2q on a year-over-year basis. we continue to build a strong diversified customer base from a geographic, product and market segment perspective. for the quarter, our fiber access business grew 21% over the previous period and increased 16% on a year-over-year basis and continues to be our top sales growth category. in addition to growth of our pon olt revenue, the fiber cpe, adtran revenue grew 27% quarter-over-quarter and 37% on a year-over-year basis. our supply chain team continue to work hard in helping us deliver in q2, managing through logistics and component availability challenges. during the quarter, we were affected by higher freight cost as available capacity as decrease in rates continued to rise. from an organizational perspective, we continue to execute and accelerate structural changes to improve our operational cost bases to achieve the target operating model in our plan. we have achieved material reductions in operating expenses through operational control and expense management over the past five quarters, and we are on track to achieve our target expense profile on plan. overall, it was a solid quarter. let me now provide a little more detail around some of the products and segments. our continuing investment in the highly successful and widely deployed total access 5000 platform continue to pay great dividends.
during the quarter, we deployed our xgs gpon combo card for the ta 5000 that enables service providers to cost effectively accelerate 10-gig service delivery in new and existing markets. we have also expanded our sdx portfolio to deliver a greater capability operators that are migrating to software defined networks. adtran continues to lead the industry in the development of an open disaggregated software-defined fiber access solutions centered around our sdx product family and the mosaic cloud platform. by offering our customers the flexibility to evolve their networks by adding 10-gig delivery in existing chassis or in new virtual solutions leveraging a common management platform, it enables them to accelerate service delivery while significantly lowering their cost. we are also providing service providers greater visibility, network intelligence, analytics and capabilities to deliver a more immersive connected-home experience as we continue to build out our mosaic cloud services portfolio of software applications. during the quarter, we introduced new software services that are gaining strong adoption by both new and existing customers. in fact, 28 of the 33 new customers this quarter also purchased software subscription services, enabling us to surpass over 2.4 million devices under management. these software applications will work together in concert, providing an operator with an end-to-end disability, network intelligence and automation in a unified view. and the upcoming mosaic one virtual control center enables operators to efficiently deliver a seamless customer experience to accelerate new subscription revenue streams while reducing costs through automation. in addition to the exceptional progress in our fiber access business, our next-generation fiber extension portfolio, coupled with our mosaic cloud platform remains strong. a new tier one customer in central europe selected adtran second-generation g.fast fiber extension solution to further accelerate its delivery of high-quality, high-capacity broadband services for business and residential customers.
additionally, we announced g.fast awards from mnet in germany and from welcomm net in finland during the quarter. outside of europe, our international revenue performance was driven by our continued progress in australia with fiber to the curb deployments for the national broadband network. while the pandemic has hit small and medium enterprise is the hardest, our enterprise cpe business remained resilient given our long heritage in diversified sales channel. revenue for the enterprise cpe business for the first half of 2020 was in line with the same period of the prior year. despite the covid-19 headwinds in this sector, we remain encouraged on our enterprise business, and we have continued to invest in refreshing our highly successful route-and-switch portfolio business, which we will be announcing later this fall. in the residential broadband market, the current work from home and online school environment provided some tailwinds. we had a strong quarter for our residential cpe portfolio, with revenue growing 29% quarter-over-quarter and 40% on a year-over-year basis. we are seeing strong demand from our residential gateways by regional service providers in north america, the alt-nets in europe and in the tam. from a market segment perspective, our revenue from regional service providers grew 29% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, and revenue in the segment grew 37% for the first half of 2020 over the same period of 2019. we expect to see further uplift in our domestic, regional and emerging service provider segments going through 2021 as the $16 billion fcc rdoc auction paid out this fall plays out this fall and into the first half of next year. during the quarter, adtran announced the most comprehensive rdoc portfolio, which is ideally tailored to support the build-out of rural broadband across a wide range of network topologies. adtran was heavily cited in the fcc rdoc order as we influence the selection criteria to ensure the program provides maximum funding for low-latency gigabit solutions to help ensure that we close the digital divide for rural america.
we continue to be extremely active as we assist operators with network planning and their applications, and we are well positioned to help our operators to participate in this program and expect to see awards in revenues in mid-2021, with the possibility of the program accelerating earlier in the year. several years ago, we embarked on a mission to invest heavily in r&d to put the company in a position to lead the industry paradigm shift to the next-generation of software-defined fiber access platforms. our success rate during this narrow window of next-generation platform selection puts the company in a strong position in the next decade and beyond, in addition to addressing the connectivity bottleneck. our vision includes redefining the subscriber experience, and the investment is paying off as we are beginning to see strong adoption of subscription software across our customer base. these technology advancements, along with the flexibility we're building in our organization, really puts us in a strong trajectory for growth. the share gains we made, tier one awards and government focus on broadband initiatives will provide sustainable growth for the company for the years to come. and while this global pandemic has created many challenges, i continue to be extremely proud of our company's progress and strong execution. we have performed exceptionally well across all areas of the company with a strong focus on mitigating supply chain risks and helping our customers meet today's demands while enabling them to quickly transition to the network of the future. our team remains safe and healthy as a result of our early actions, and we continue to ensure that health and well-being of our employees, customers and partners are a top priority. our vision to enable a fully connected world where the power to communicate is available to everyone everywhere could not be more relevant or more important in our current environment.
mike will now provide an overview of the financials, and then we'll open it up for questions. mike?
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, tom, and good morning to all. i will review our second quarter results and provide our view for the third quarter of 2020. during my report, i will be referencing both gaap and non-gaap results. with respect to non-gaap financial measures that are discussed on this call that are not presented in our earnings release, reconciliations to their comparable gaap measures are published in the supplemental financial schedule that appears on our investor relations web page at www.adtran.com. for non-gaap measures discussed on this call that are presented in the earnings release, reconciliations are contained within the release. the supplemental financial schedules on our web page also present certain revenue information by segment and category and other non-gaap reconciliations, which i will be discussing today. with that, now let's get to the numbers. adtran's second quarter revenue came in at $128.7 million compared to $114.5 million in the prior quarter and $156.4 million in the second quarter of 2019. breaking this down across our operating segments. our network solutions revenue for the second quarter was $111.3 million versus $97.4 million reported in q1 of 2020 and $139.2 million in q2 of 2019. our services and support revenue in q2 of this year was $17.4 million compared to $17.2 million reported for the first quarter of 2020 and also for the second quarter of 2019. across our revenue categories, access & aggregation revenue for quarter two of 2020 was $82.8 million compared to $66 million in the prior quarter and $109.4 million in quarter two of 2019. revenue for our subscriber solutions & experience category was $40.4 million for the quarter versus $42.2 million for quarter two of 2020 and $40.5 million for quarter two of 2019.
traditional & other products revenue for the quarter was $5.5 million compared to $6.4 million from quarter one of 2020 and $6.5 million for quarter two of 2019. looking at our revenues geographically. domestic revenue for q2 2020 was $84.5 million versus $79 million reported in q1 and $75.3 million in quarter two of 2019. our international revenue for the quarter was $44.3 million compared to $35.5 million for quarter one of 2020 and $81.1 million in quarter two of 2019. for the second quarter, we had two 10% of revenue customers: one domestic and one international. our gaap gross margin for the second quarter of this year was at 41.5% as compared to 45.1% last quarter and 41.6% in the second quarter of 2019. non-gaap gross margin for quarter two was 41.6% as compared to 45.4% in the prior quarter and 41.4% in the second quarter of 2019. the quarter-over-quarter decrease in both gaap and non-gaap gross margin were driven by product and geographical mix, increases in freight-related expenses. and these were partially offset by increased volume efficiencies. the change in gross margins in both gaap and non-gaap on a year-over-year basis were minimal, resulting from favorable product and geographical mix and lower manufacturing expenses, which were offset by lower volume and increased freight-related expense. total operating expenses on a gaap basis were $59.5 million for quarter two of 2020 compared to $56.5 million reported for the prior quarter and $65.7 million for quarter two of 2019. the quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily related to market-driven increases in our deferred compensation expense, contract services and restructuring expenses, partially offset by expense reductions in both r&d and sg&a as a result of our restructuring program initiated in 2019 and also reduced travel expenses. the year-over-year decreases in operating expense were a result of lower expenses in both r&d and sg&a and lower travel expenses, partially offset by market-driven increases in our deferred compensation expenses and an increase in r&d contract services.
on a non-gaap basis, our second quarter operating expenses were $52.3 million compared to $56.7 million in the prior quarter and $61.2 million in quarter two of 2019. both the non-gaap quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year decreases in operating expenses were primarily the result of expense reductions and lower travel expenses. these reductions were partially offset by an increase in r&d contract services. our operating loss on a gaap basis for the second quarter of 2020 was $6 million compared to an operating loss of $4.5 million in the prior quarter and an operating income of $562,000 reported in q2 of 2019. non-gaap operating income for the quarter two of 2020 was $1.3 million compared to a loss of $4.6 million in q1 of 2020 and an operating income of $3.6 million in quarter two of 2019. the higher quarter-over-quarter operating loss was driven primarily by the higher deferred comp expense, contract services and restructuring costs and partially offset by higher gross profit on increased revenue. the quarter-over-quarter non-gaap profitability was driven by higher sales and reduced operating expenses. on a year-over-year basis, the lower operating income on both gaap and non-gaap basis was a result of reduced sales volumes. other income on a gaap basis for the second quarter of 2020 was $8.4 million compared to a loss of $9.4 million in the prior quarter and other income of $2.8 million for quarter two of 2019. our non-gaap other income for the quarter just ending was $5.7 million compared to a loss of $7.5 million in q1 of 2020 and an income of $2.4 million for quarter two of 2019. the increases in both the gaap and non-gaap other income as compared to quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year comps were primarily market-driven caused by changes in the valuation of our investment portfolio. the company's tax provision for the second quarter of 2020 was a $1.6 million expense as compared to a benefit of $4.4 million in the prior quarter and a benefit of $588,000 in the second quarter 2019.
the current quarter tax expense was primarily due to profitability in our international operations as the deferred tax benefits generated by our domestic operations continue to be offset by changes in our valuation allowance. as a reminder, the significant tax benefit realized last quarter was primarily related to the passage of the cares act in the u.s., partially offset with tax expense in our foreign operations as the deferred tax benefits generated by our domestic operations were offset by additional changes in the valuation allowance. the tax benefit in the second quarter of last year was the result of a provision to return adjustment that was related to the completion of the transfer pricing study, which was partially offset by tax expense related to pre-tax profitability. gaap net income for quarter two of 2020 was $752,000 compared to a net loss of $10 million in the prior quarter and a net income of $4 million for the second quarter of 2019. non-gaap earnings for the second quarter of 2020 were $1.6 million as compared to a loss of $2.2 million in the prior quarter. and net income of $5.9 million in the second quarter of 2019. earnings per share, assuming dilution, on a gaap basis was $0.02 per share as compared to a loss of $0.21 per share last quarter and an earnings of $0.08 per share in the second quarter of 2019. non-gaap earnings per share, assuming dilution, for the second quarter of 2020 was $0.04 compared to a loss of $0.05 per share in the prior quarter and earnings of $0.12 per share in the second quarter of 2019. turning to the balance sheet. unrestricted cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled $136.7 million after paying $4.3 million in dividends during the quarter. for the quarter, we generated $1.7 million of cash from operations. net trade accounts receivable was $95.3 million at quarter end, resulting in a dso of 67 days compared to 69 days in the prior quarter and 68 days at the end of the second quarter of 2019. the variability in dsos quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year is mainly attributable to the timing of shipments during the quarter and the customer mix.
net inventories were $106.1 million at the end of the second quarter compared to $99.5 million in q1 of 2020 and $95.1 million at the end of q2 in 2019. the increase in our inventories for the quarter was related to strategic inventory buffer purchases that were designed to ensure supply continuity during the pandemic. we do believe that we are positioned to maintain adequate liquidity in the current environment. looking ahead to the next quarter, the possible effects of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, the ability of component supplies to align with customer demand, the book-and-ship nature of our business, the timing of revenue associated with large projects, the variability of order patterns and the customer base into which we sell as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates may cause material differences between our expectations and the actual results. having said that, we do expect that our third quarter 2020 revenue will be in the range of $127 million to $137 million. after considering the projected sales mix, we expect that our third quarter gross margin on a non-gaap basis will be about 41%. we also expect non-gaap operating expenses for the third quarter of 2020 will be in the range of $51 million to $52 million. finally, we anticipate the consolidated tax rate for the third quarter on a non-gaap basis will be in the high-20s percentage rate. we believe the significant factors impacting revenue and earnings realized in 2020 will be the following: continued component availability; the macro spending environment for carriers and enterprises; the ongoing effects of the covid-19 pandemic; the variability of mix and revenue associated with project rollouts; the proportion of international revenue relative to our total revenue; professional services activity levels, both domestically and internationally; the adoption rate of our broadband access platforms; any potential changes in tax laws; currency exchange rate movements; and inventory fluctuations in our distribution channels. once again, additional information is available at adtran's investor relations web page at www.adtran.com.
now i'll turn the call back over to tom.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of rich valera of needham & company. your line is open.
richard frank valera -- needham & company -- analyst
thank you. good morning. tom, you mentioned that you -- it sounded like you mentioned you got a new tier 1 in q3 when you talked about your new customers. just wanted to clarify is that the case. and if it is, can you say anything about that win?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
i didn't actually say that in my notes. in reality, we did announce a new tier 1 at the end of september, which was for fiber extension, and we did pick up another tier 1 customer within the quarter where they expanded their programs with us to include a different variation on the technology that we had been previously awarded. so there has been, but i didn't mention any in my notes.
richard frank valera -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then, i think you also mentioned that you made good progress with your previously announced tier 1s, and i guess those would include among others, bt openreach may be and the unnamed us tier 1. is there any updates you can give us on those in terms of progress and/or revenue expectations -- initial revenue expectations?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yeah. so, one of those is a brand-new customer for us, as you're aware. and all three of them are going well, all three of them are different stages of lab work. we actually have received some pos from the new customer but that's associated with initial, say, initial lab work and kind of some of the software work that we're doing for them. so we actually -- so that actually booked and shipped in the quarter. but all three of them are going well. so when we expect material revenue contributions from them, they'll really start in the first half, toward the tail end of the first half of next year.
richard frank valera -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. and then a question on rdof. you've talked about it being kind of a mid-'21 revenue opportunity. i think some of your competitors have suggested maybe it's more of a 2022. any further clarification on your thoughts on timing? is that sort of a 3q '21 or a 4q -- any thoughts on that?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yeah, yeah. and i guess -- i guess here again, this is the different -- when does it -- it's one of those things that's going to start -- it will start slower. you have so many participants. some of them have plans completely worked out. some of them don't have plans shared at all. they've been just focusing on the bidding process. so i think you'll start seeing it in the -- around the half and then you'll start seeing a ramp-up from there.
richard frank valera -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. just one more, mike, a modeling question on opex levels. if we're looking into next year -- and i know you don't give guidance out there. but if we're trying to think about what an opex number looks like, it's kind of a normalized t&e level. any thoughts on how much that maybe add back into the model as t&e gets back to some kind of normalized level?
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
we expect -- we've had a plan to get to about where we are right now, and we expect that we're going to hold that into next year. so, i wouldn't try to model any increases. i think like a lot of companies, everybody's rethinking the whole t&e going forward. so i think your -- your model going into next year should look a lot like what we're seeing at the end of this year.
richard frank valera -- needham & company -- analyst
very good. thank you for that, mike, and i'll cede the floor.
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer

your next question comes from rod hall of goldman sachs. your line is open.
bala raghav reddy -- goldman sachs group -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my questions. this is bala reddy on for rod. just to start off, could you give us some color on what you're seeing in terms of broadband demand and activity here in the us and maybe try to handicap that across the tier 1, 2, 3 and then also how you're thinking about the sustainability of the momentum for next year?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
first of all, a lot of activity. and had i touched on the growth rates in the tier 3 space. a lot of activity in the tier 3s which is just separate from what's going on with rdof. so a lot of network upgrades. we rolled out our combo card, which is a 10 gig solution. good pickup on the combo card. and so just a lot of activity. and i think a lot of it has got to do with just end user demand based on the environment that we're in and people understanding the importance of good connectivity.
same thing in the tier 2s. i think the tier 2s finally getting past whatever financial issues they may have had and some of them have started executing. one of them explicitly has started executing on expansion plans. i don't see that stopping. and i think the other one actually has kind of woken up and getting better. and that includes not just those, but some of the msos as well. so i don't see a near-term end. in fact, i see people planning farther out than -- and kind of figuring out how they're going to readjust to what may be a different work environment in a lot of areas than what they had going into this pandemic. and i don't think it's all pandemic-driven either. i mean, the activity that's going on in the tier 2s has been part of their stated plan. it just got put off. the tier 3s have been heating up for some period of time even prior to that, and we had solid growth in that space last year as well.
and then the tier 1s. we -- really in the us, we're in the cable mso space and we're with large carriers, and with one of the large carriers here in the telco space in relation to pon. and i would say the activity there is -- i would say we've seen good activity. i wouldn't call it [indecipherable]. i will say it's solid. and there is more -- a lot of that work is really trying to figure out what they're going to do into next year. so i think a lot of that is just -- i think it will pick up there. it'll probably be a year -- at this time next year or maybe a little bit earlier than that. does that answer your question?
bala raghav reddy -- goldman sachs group -- analyst
it does, it does. thanks so much. and a different -- quick follow-up on the gross margins. i know you mentioned about the volumes and product mix. maybe could you expand on it a little bit like what volumes you're talking about?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
what -- so it's product mix. i mean, at the end of the day, it's -- we're selling, without getting too deep into -- we're selling -- pon -- one of the things, if you step back and look at what our business has done, we've really made the transition from copper to fiber. and some of the fiber components that we're selling, specifically when you're talking about olt, just have a richer mix. we also have, based on international and domestic revenue mix, we have a material difference in those gross margin profiles. those are probably the two biggest things that -- that were driving gross margin difference.
bala raghav reddy -- goldman sachs group -- analyst
makes sense. thank you.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
okay.

your next question comes from the line of paul silverstein of cowen. your line is open.
paul jonas silverstein -- cowen and company -- analyst
so, just a clarification first before my question. so, the response to the previous question -- obviously -- or a trough [phonetic] non-us lower margin than the us is a general proposition. but on the product piece of the revenue -- i apologize if you just said this -- the margin differential, it's more favorable for your fiber base, is there a less favorable impact? is that the [indecipherable] making in terms of the product mix influencing the gross margin profile and what is the key difference there on the product side?
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i would say on -- i would say what's happening in the fiber space is, we're selling -- the mix toward olts is much higher.
paul jonas silverstein -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. [speech overlap]
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
exactly right.
paul jonas silverstein -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. so that's the key driver in the product mix?
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
that's probably -- i don't have them listed. that's definitely in the top three. [speech overlap]
paul jonas silverstein -- cowen and company -- analyst
all right [speech overlap]. i apologize.
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
go ahead.
paul jonas silverstein -- cowen and company -- analyst
mike, a question i ask you every quarter in terms of long-term margin profile. you obviously just had a very good margin quarter driven by both volume and the shift to the olts. you're guiding back to -- your traditional guidance in the low 40s for the december quarter. has there been any change in your view about longer-term? are you still looking at low 40s gross margin profile longer-term? or with the benefit of volume shift to olts, can that be better than that? and then i've got one follow-up question.
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i think i always -- i always say low to mid, somewhere right in that range. and you see variability in here. remember, in q1 we were pretty [indecipherable] also. so it jumps around a lot. so i try to project this by looking at what we see. but we are a book and ship business, and what comes in during a quarter is a little bit hard to test, but i believe that that 41% to 42% guidance is probably what the mix will turn out to be for the quarter.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
i don't know -- i think the variability -- also, the thing to maybe think about, paul, we don't have -- we don't know exactly what tier 3s will do next year. that tier 3s are strong typically helps us because not just the nature of what they buy, but also the software components associated with that. so that tends to drive more strength. the thing that we're trying to factor in -- at this point you're not changing the longer-term guidance, is there is a -- a real potential for material international revenue upticking next year and whether or not the tier 3s here in the us are going to keep pace with that is -- is kind of the thing that we just have to look and see. there is no doubt that the pressure -- some of the pressure has been alleviated in places like europe because of the -- the stance on -- on some of the vendors there. but there is still a hangover effect on all of that, and the stronger the effect, that businesses, you'll tend to see a weakness on the gross margin.
paul jonas silverstein -- cowen and company -- analyst
[indecipherable] made it sounds like you've made good progress in tier 3. what percentage of total revenue are tier 3 today?
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
we've -- we really don't break that out. i'll tell you it's material. it's over [indecipherable] it's over $50 million. but we don't break that out.
paul jonas silverstein -- cowen and company -- analyst
one quick final question if i may. i know it's about predicting the future, but assuming you get the revenues you are expecting from these new tier 1 wins, mike, you have any visibility as to what the margin profile -- in total -- not asking you any specific customer, but on the tier 1s, would that be consistent with the current margin structure? would it be dilutive? would it be accretive? any sense?
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so i'm going to talk to you about international gross margins. it will probably be a little accretive to international gross margins, but it would be dilutive to total corporate gross margins.
paul jonas silverstein -- cowen and company -- analyst
all right. i appreciate that. thank you.
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
right. and that's the mix i'm talking about, how much does that pile in. that gets better over time, how much does that pile in versus what's going on with the us market in tier 3s.
paul jonas silverstein -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you again.
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
all right.

your next question comes from the line of bill dezellem of tieton capital. your line is open.

thank you. a couple of different questions. first of all, the two tier 1s. so one that you won and the one with the new program that you specifically called out. would you talk about the ramp and the timing for material revenues? and is that different than your comment about late in the first half of next year that you made it to a bigger comment? and then a second question is, can you talk through just the european country shutdowns that are happening once again here in the last few days and what implications if any that has for you?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
sure. let me start with the first one, of course. and it's -- the first-half ramp that i was talking about was really around the previous sdx awards, the three customers that we've talked about -- and really, i'm talking about in totality, there is some different dates on all of those, but we'll start seeing, as a combination, we'll start seeing material revenue around the half of next year.
as far as the new ones -- one is going to be fairly quick, but it's -- it's a -- as far as seeing any revenue, i think it's -- i don't have a good sense of timing as to when that picks up. at this point, i think that they want to get started and they have some very target areas and then i want to kind of see how it works. the other one is very specific. and mike, i don't recall the date on that. i think it's third quarter of next year?
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
right. and that one is big. it's a well-known customer to us. and they have very specific plans with very specific revenue targets associated with it. the current date is third quarter of next year. i will tell you that these things tend to slip a little bit. but so the -- what i was talking about before was really the fiber side [phonetic]. as far as the shutdowns are concerned, other than -- it really hasn't -- we've been operating in a relatively shutdown environmentally. so from an end user demand, really no difference, and we haven't seen any near-term changes in the way that they're operating. where it really affects us is when you're trying to meet with customers and really -- what the lab activity we have going on around the world right now, it tends to impact that. so far, we've been able to maneuver around that. i'm not aware of any material delay because of the -- the quarantine situation that we're in. and i don't expect it. i think, especially our bigger customers -- or even our small customers, now, i think about going on in europe, have kind of developed an environment where we can talk to their counterparts in the lab, work through issues, in many cases, get into the systems themselves remotely and operate the way we need operate. so i'm not -- every once in a while, you hear about a week delay here or there and -- but that's -- that's not that frequent.
william j. dezellem -- tieton capital management -- analyst
and the deployment is not impacted by stay-at-home orders?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yeah, yeah, no change in that. and even in europe, what we were seeing is, as far as infrastructure and especially with the new awards, we're talking about really material infrastructure build, to begin with, because we're really talking about building out footprint, either replacing existing infrastructure that they have or expanding footprint. in many cases, there has been no change in those plans.
william j. dezellem -- tieton capital management -- analyst
great. thank you. and if i may throw in one more question. latin america -- what -- what are you seeing with your important customers down there?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
so, they're -- in the caribbean, we're actually doing well. we have some strong -- i don't want to overplay it at this point. we have some activity going on in places like brazil where there are also -- of course, honestly, as you know, the sdx -- maybe, the sdx is kind of the architecture people want to go to and so there are large carriers -- there is not a large carrier that isn't looking at a migration toward xgs 10 gig and if you're going to do that, you're going to do that with a virtualized system like the sdx. so there is activity going on, and those tend to be longer-term. we do have one traditional customer down there. there are still ongoing negotiations with that customer, but there is no material change at this point.
william j. dezellem -- tieton capital management -- analyst
great. thank you for the time.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
okay.

your next question comes from the line of fahad najam of mkm partners. your line is open.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
hello?
fahad najam -- mkm partners -- analyst
sorry, i was on mute. i apologize if you've already addressed this, but are you seeing any significant pull-in of orders from your customers?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
no. no. we did at the beginning of the pandemic. so if you think about kind of the end of q1, we saw a material increase in order activity. i think at this point in time, i would say that order rate is reflecting what their demand is. i don't see any real -- we do on particular -- i talked a little bit about the fact that we're still having some supply issues, most predominantly with silicon. but -- and in those cases, we may really try to nail down our forecast with them and try to get them to reach farther out, but that's really not the norm.
fahad najam -- mkm partners -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. if i look forward to next year, with all these tier 1 ramping, how should we be thinking about your customer concentration? is most of the growth going to come from...
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
good question. really good question. yeah. so we are adding tier 1 customers as well. so the good news is that there will be more tier 1s to kind of spread the fluctuations around within. but having said that, we're also adding more tier 1s, so you've got the -- that issue. we are adding tier 3s. and i use tier 3s -- we're really talking about alternate carriers of all different types. we're adding municipalities on a very fast clip. i mean, we usually have an internal announcement here if something that goes out, and we have a weekly update here, and there is always a municipality that's being added. and we're adding tier 3s, the traditional tier 3 players at a very quick clip. i think i mentioned before 30 something like customers. a large percent of those were in these alternate type carriers. so from that perspective -- and by the way, i mentioned we had a distribution partner that was actually a top 10% customer. that is not typical. i do believe that that will be typical going forward because i do believe -- and those are all being sold. those are one of our conduits to that alternate carrier, that municipal space, tier 3 space. so -- and utilities. so that base is growing.
now, when we get to this time next year, it will still be kind of early in the cycle of some of these wins, but if we get into this time next year, it's really how are those tier 1s comparing to the growth rate within the tier 3s. i have no doubt we'll be more diverse, but we're adding tier 1s at a -- at a nice clip as well. so -- but we will have more customers, which will help in that diversity.
and then one other thing i just want to add. i mentioned before the attach rates on our cpe gear and our rgs, some of our new wifi solutions are really growing well, which will help add in that product diversity as well. it is something we are focused on.
fahad najam -- mkm partners -- analyst
that's really helpful. thanks for the color on that. i think one last question from me is more topical, a big picture view. i think at&t recently announced that they're going to stop selling their copper-based dsl service. it seems like the secular shift toward fiber is ongoing with all the major tier 1s around the world just migrating toward fiber. can you talk a little bit about your competitive positioning [indecipherable] in fiber? is it similar to copper that you previously or is that actually better [speech overlap]?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
i'd love to like about -- i would love to talk about that. one of the hangovers that we had gone through -- we've had a couple of program -- really one big program that kind of --that was copper based that died, and which caused us an issue. but really it was the longevity of the copper and the r&d requirements associated with that copper versus the fiber. and i think this is the first quarter, depending on how you count it, where you're really seeing fiber eclipse copper within our revenue. and so, to us, that's a big milestone, and it really -- because there was a lot of work to make that happen. so i'm happy with the -- the shift within the company. and if you look at the r&d spend, the r&d spend is predominantly fiber based, it has been for some time. so i'm glad to be able to see the revenue kind of mimic what it is that we've been doing internally here.
competitively, right now we're in a very good position. we have launched new flexibility and new capabilities in our total access 5000 platform product which has been in the market for a long period of time. we've upgraded the switching capability. and we're the only -- well, i shouldn't say we're the only one. there are quite a lot of people -- are working on one, but we are shipping combo -- combo card, which is the xgs 10 gig and standard 2.5 gig within the same card profile, which is unique in that customer base and getting a lot of traction because people don't want to have to go out and replace infrastructure they don't have to.
when i talk about the sdx, there's is nothing else out there, completely disaggregated. it is the next-generation system that people have been talking about for five or six years. it's actually now out in the market. we've actually shipped it to paying customers. it is what has been selected by a pretty much every tier 1 that we have won in relation to pon. and we think -- there is nothing else that will touch it right now. there are people that kind of trying -- are reacting to it, but we think we have a good headway in the r&d that we've put into it.
fahad najam -- mkm partners -- analyst
that's great. appreciate it. thank you.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of tim savageaux of northland capital management. your line is open.
timothy paul savageaux -- northland capital markets -- analyst
good morning. got to a lot of my questions on that last one there, but i will say that actually nokia made the same comment this quarter with regard to...
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
see, i can believe that [speech overlap]
timothy paul savageaux -- northland capital markets -- analyst
fiber eclipsing -- fiber eclipsing copper in their access business. so what seem to be -- well, what comment were you talking about?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
i was talking about the sdx. i was talking about whatever [phonetic] they were doing talking about their disaggregated solution.
timothy paul savageaux -- northland capital markets -- analyst
okay. i see. a little competitive intensity there.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yeah, yeah.
timothy paul savageaux -- northland capital markets -- analyst
but that does -- does suggest there is an industrywide trend toward copper going on. and so -- thanks for clarifying that fiber was larger this quarter. i wanted to follow back up on the tier 3 comment. that $50 million, that's a quarterly number that you gave for the size of the tier 3s? okay. so, well, that's interesting.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
i guess it's larger than $50 million. like i said, we don't want to give [speech overlap]
timothy paul savageaux -- northland capital markets -- analyst
i here you.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
okay.
timothy paul savageaux -- northland capital markets -- analyst
yeah. and that would make it your largest segment, if you look at kind of international, us tier 3, tier 2 and tier 1 by some distance actually. and you're obviously seeing good growth there, and you had a lot of impressive growth numbers in various segments, both of which would seem to imply something on the order of, kind of a -- i don't know, 30% year-over-year decline among us tier 1s or other parts of the business that are domestic based. and i'm guessing that may be a function of the copper programs that you referenced, but is that about right? and what does it take to kind of -- will it take the new deal coming in to kind of stabilize and make that grow or how are you looking at that part of your business?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yeah. first of all, i don't think it's tier 1s. i think -- i think it's -- i think in tier 2s and tier 3s, on a year-over-year basis, we've done good. i think the issue that we had last year was predominantly, on a comp basis, was predominantly telmex. and so we had a large copper-based program going on with them that was 10s of millions a quarter and it just completely stopped. so the whole that you're talking about in the north american market is telmex. not -- it's not the us carrier base. and that was very much a copper- based vectored vdsl solution that they are rolling out. i think i just answered your question. is that...
timothy paul savageaux -- northland capital markets -- analyst
yeah, in part. and last one from me is, as you think about your potential international growth next year, obviously, should the tier 3s continue to grow 60%, maybe they could keep up with that rate of growth. i assume, for planning purposes, you model some slowing in that tier 3 growth rate despite rdof ramping up and some other positive drivers. just to begin with, can we assume that from an international standpoint, you expect international revenues to grow faster than domestic next year?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
good. that is a really good question that i -- i don't have an answer for you today. so, the thing about the tier 3s is not just -- let me just say off-carriers because it's broader than traditional tier 3 carriers. but the thing about these carriers is, the growth rate through the year has been increasing, and i don't see a change in next year. so you're going to have two quarters of growth before these -- the -- really, we have one mammoth tier 1 in europe that's going to start -- that's going to be [indecipherable] and will that eclipse it -- now, there are other activities going on. there's a process going on in australia. carriers like orange, who we announced an award with, vodafone, all of these -- telefonica, which is, of course, not just in europe, but in brazil -- all of those have got processes that are in place where they're coming toward a decision on, but those will carry -- so those are really -- and if you think they don't get award until next year, they're a year away from that. so the real mammoth new incremental piece is a new customer for us that's deploying the sdx next year. and it will just be starting around the half. so i could absolutely envision next year where the tier 3s actually eclipse it on a pure gross dollar basis. but i don't know that -- i don't know that for a fact, and we'll have to get into the year and really see.
rdof will start around the turn of the second half. but really for it to be material, it's going to take some time. so that will just be -- i don't see that as a huge kind of wave of thing coming in the second half of next year. i think it just starts to start ramp up from there. these olt carriers...
timothy paul savageaux -- northland capital markets -- analyst
thanks. i appreciate all that color.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
these olt carriers -- yeah, these olt carriers are -- they keep the momentum they have right now, the us could be stronger. okay. so thank you very much for joining us today. i appreciate your interest and we look forward to the call next quarter.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to adtran's third quarter 2020 earnings release conference call. [operator instructions]
during the course of the conference call, adtran representatives expect to make forward-looking statements, which reflect management's best judgment based on factors currently known. however, these statements involve risks and uncertainties, including the continued spread and extent of the impact of covid-19 global pandemic, the ability of component supplies to align with customer demand, the successful development and market acceptance of our products, competition in the market for such products, the product and channel mix, component costs, manufacturing efficiencies and other risks detailed in our annual report form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019. these risks and uncertainties could cause results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements which may be made during the call.
it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to tom stanton, chief executive officer of adtran. sir, please go ahead.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
thank you, ian.
good morning, everyone. we appreciate you joining us for our third quarter 2020 conference call. with me today is adtran cfo, mike foliano. following my opening remarks, mike will review the quarterly financial performance in detail and then we'll take any questions that you may have.
i'd like to begin by expressing our concern and sympathy for those affected by the ongoing global pandemic that has touched our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. the current times have changed the way we communicate, work and learn, and i remain encouraged by our perseverance in the face of such adversity. with these challenges, it is more critical than ever to connect people, communities and businesses with each other.
the results for our third quarter demonstrated solid execution against our plan. this included broad-based demand across our customer segments, with the regional and emerging service providers leading the way. we were also making great progress with tier 1 fiber access projects that we announced earlier this year and continue to have very strong momentum on new customer acquisition across a broad base of market segments.
from a top line perspective, revenue for the quarter was $133.1 million with 44.3% gross margins. network solutions accounted for 87% of the revenue at $115.2 million while services contributed $17.9 million. during the quarter, we had one 10% service provider customer and one 10% distribution partner, along with strong contributions from both our direct and distribution channel partners that serve the regional broadband service provider market.
we added 38 new service provider customers during the quarter, bringing the total to 99 for the first three quarters of 2020. these new customers range from global tier 1 operators to electric co-ops -- cooperatives, municipalities, cable mso and regional broadband providers. the new customer traction remains positive, reinforcing our belief that we are in the early stages of a generational communications infrastructure network upgrade cycle driven by a confluence of favorable government, regulatory, technology and competitive factors.
the strength we saw during the quarter was fueled by our continued momentum with regional broadband operators who were up 60% year-over-year and 33% quarter-over-quarter. we were also helped with a solid performance for our us tier 2 customers who were up 18% year-over-year as they started to emerge from restructuring and are again investing in their network expansion. in europe, our revenue from emerging alt-net providers was up 76% year-over-year and 20% quarter-over-quarter and -- highlighting our -- highlighting our growth for that region.
for the third quarter, our fiber access and aggregation business grew 34% over the previous period and increased 66% on a year-over-year basis. this continues to be our top sales category. within fiber access, our pon olt revenue grew 31% quarter-over-quarter and a strong 77% year-over-year, which we believe is significantly outpacing the growth in the general market and we'll continue to step up our market share position in this key segment. we also saw strong revenue contribution from our us regional broadband service providers, growing 37% over the previous period and 58% over the previous year, with broad-based growth across both direct and distribution channels.
from a supply chain perspective, lead times remained extended on some key components and vendors, but our operations team took several proactive steps to mitigate logistics and component availability challenges to meet our customers' needs. in our efforts to address these needs, we have increased our inventory levels and incurred increased freight costs due to decreased capacity associated with higher transportation rates and expedite fees.
from an organizational perspective, the structural changes that we have implemented over the last 12 months continue to improve our operational efficiency. the company has achieved material reductions in operating expenses through control in expense management, and we are ahead of our plan for the target operating model moving forward.
on the product side, we are focusing on growing our wallet share with our service provider customers. in addition to selling fiber access olt, we are growing our residential gateway business. the residential gateway revenue grew 22% quarter-over-quarter and a strong 64% year-over-year as we increased the number of olt customers also buying our rgs by 17% year to date. in addition to rg attach rates, we have also focused on increasing attach rates for our mosaic software subscription services as we migrate customers from mosaic suite into our upcoming mosaic one virtual control center.
on october 29, the fcc began its 904 auctions for $16 billion of rdof broadband subsidies. there are 386 qualified bidders that represent over 700 operators. whereas the connect america fund was targeted to the large price cap carriers providing a first right of refusal, the rdof subsidies provide an opportunity for rural local exchange carriers and community broadband providers such as rural electric co-ops to receive 10 years of funding. we expect to see rdof funding to begin to positively impact our revenue beginning in the mid-2021 time frame.
in europe and around the world, the strategic importance of 5g and fiber broadband infrastructure is causing governments to carefully reconsider the security risks of their networks and implementation policies -- and are implementing policies to ban high-risk vendors for participating in these network builds. as a result, adtran stands out as a safe, technically advanced alternative to those high-risk vendors as national operators look to limit, cap or replace high-risk vendors in their network.
2020 has brought forth a number of challenges that none of us could have envisioned. however, we have risen to these challenges and are emerging as an even stronger and more resilient company. we have achieved much thus far in 2020, with the material benefits just beginning to bear fruit and as they start to begin -- to be more fully recognized next year.
we have much to be excited about, including the growing number of new customers selecting our products and services to build out or upgrade their networks with rapid adoption of our mosaic platform and subscription services and our sdx solutions as tier 1 operators begin their transition to the network of the future and the promise of rdof awards and begin -- and being able to help regional service providers, utilities and municipalities provide gigabit services to the communities that they serve.
i am proud of our company and our employees for the success we have seen thus far this year. we look forward to a strong finish to 2020 and have a bright outlook as we look ahead into 2021.
mike will now provide an overview of the financials, and following his remarks, i will answer any questions that you may have.
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, tom, and good morning to all.
i will review our third quarter results and provide our view for the fourth quarter of 2020. during my report, i will be referencing both gaap and non-gaap results. with respect to non-gaap financial measures that are discussed on this call but are not presented in our earnings release, reconciliations to their comparable gaap measures are published in the supplemental financial schedule that appears on our investor relations web page at www.adtran.com. for non-gaap measures discussed on this call that are presented in the earnings release, the reconciliations are contained within the release. the supplemental financial schedules on our webpage also present certain revenue information by segment and category and other non-gaap reconciliations which i will be discussing today.
as tom said, adtran's third-quarter revenue came in at $133.1 million compared to $128.7 million in the prior quarter and $114.1 million for the third quarter of 2019. breaking this down across our operating segments, our network solutions revenue for the third quarter was $115.2 million versus $111.3 million reported for q2 of 2020 and $94 million in q3 of 2019. our services & support revenue in q3 of this year was $17.9 million compared to $17.4 million reported in the second quarter of 2020 and $20.1 million for the third quarter of 2019.
across our revenue categories, access & aggregation revenue for quarter three of 2020 was $85.4 million compared to $82.8 million in the prior quarter and $65.1 million in quarter three of 2019. revenue for our subscriber solutions & experience category was $43.1 million for the quarter versus $40.4 million in quarter two of 2020 and $42.5 million in quarter three of 2019. traditional & other products revenue for the quarter was $4.6 million compared to $5.5 million for quarter two of 2020 and $6.5 million for quarter three of 2019.
looking at our revenues geographically, domestic revenue for q3 2020 was $92.8 million versus $84.5 million reported in quarter two of 2020 and $83.1 million in quarter three of 2019. our international revenue for the quarter was $40.3 million compared to $44.3 million for quarter two of 2020 and $30.9 million in quarter three of 2019.
for the third quarter, we had two 10% of revenue customers. both of these were domestic customers.
our gaap gross margin for the third quarter of this year was 44.3% as compared to 41.5% last quarter and 40.6% in the third quarter of 2019. non-gaap gross margin for quarter three was 44.5% as compared to 41.6% in the prior quarter and 41% in the third quarter of 2019. the quarter-over-quarter increase in both gaap and non-gaap gross margins were driven by increases in volume as well as favorable product and services mix and lower freight-related charges in the current quarter. the increases in both gaap and non-gaap gross margins on a year-over-year basis were driven by increases in volume as well as product mix which were partially offset by higher freight-related charges and expedite premiums.
total operating expenses on a gaap basis were $54.4 million for quarter three of 2020 compared to $59.5 million reported in the prior quarter and $62.7 million for quarter three of 2019. the quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily related to market-driven decreases in our deferred compensation expense as well as expense reductions in both r&d and sg&a as a result of our restructuring program initiated in 2019 and reduced travel expenses, offset by increases in some restructuring-related costs. the year-over-year decreases in operating expenses were a result of lower expenses in both r&d and sg&a and lower travel-related expenses, partially offset by market-driven increases in our deferred compensation expense and an increase in contract services costs.
on a non-gaap basis, our third quarter operating expenses were $49.4 million compared to $52.3 million in the prior quarter and $59.4 million in quarter three for 2019. both the non-gaap quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year decreases in operating expense were primarily driven as a result of our expense reduction efforts and lower travel related expenses.
operating income on a gaap basis for the third quarter of 2020 was $4.5 million compared to an operating loss of $6 million in the prior quarter and an operating loss of $20.3 million reported in q3 of 2019. non-gaap operating income for quarter three of 2020 was $9.9 million compared to an operating income of $1.3 million in q2 of 2020 and an operating loss of $12.6 million in quarter three of 2019. the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year gaap and non-gaap profitability was driven by higher sales with favorable gross margin mix and reduced operating expenses.
other income on a gaap basis for the third quarter of 2020 was $1.5 million compared to other income of $8.4 million in the prior quarter and other income of $1.9 million in quarter three of 2019. our non-gaap other income for the quarter was $900,000 compared to other income of $5.7 million in q2 2020 and other income of $2.7 million for quarter three of 2019. the decreases in both gaap and non-gaap other income as compared to quarter-over-quarter were primarily market driven caused by changes in the valuation of our investment portfolio. the decrease in gaap and non-gaap other income on a year-over-year basis was primarily driven by realized foreign exchange losses, offset by market-driven upsides in the valuation of our investment portfolio.
the company's tax provision for the third quarter of 2020 was $600,000 of expense as compared to an expense of $1.6 million in the prior quarter and an expense of $27.7 million in the third quarter of 2019. the current-quarter tax expense was primarily due to profitability in our international operations as the deferred tax benefits generated by our domestic operations continued to be offset by changes in our valuation allowance. the tax expense in the third quarter of last year was the result of a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets.
gaap net income for quarter three of 2020 was $5.5 million compared to a net income of $800,000 in the prior quarter and a net loss of $46.1 million in the third quarter 2019. non-gaap net income for the third quarter of 2020 was $7.9 million as compared to an income of $1.6 million in the prior quarter and a loss of $2.8 million in quarter three of 2019. earnings per share assuming dilution on a gaap basis was $0.11 per share as compared to $0.02 per share last quarter and a loss of $0.96 per share in the third quarter of 2019. non-gaap earnings per share assuming dilution for the third quarter was $0.16 compared to an income of $0.04 per share in the prior quarter and a loss of $0.06 per share in quarter three of 2019.
turning to the balance sheet. unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaled $132.2 million at quarter-end after paying $4.3 million in dividends during the quarter. for the quarter, we used $7 million of cash from operations. net trade accounts receivable was $100.2 million at quarter-end, resulting in a dso of 69 days compared to 67 days in the prior quarter and 73 days at the end of the third quarter of 2019. the variability in dsos quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year is mainly attributable to the timing of shipments during the quarter and customer mix. net inventories ended the quarter at $120.3 million compared to $106.1 million in q2 of 2020 and $104.9 million at the end of q3 2019. the increase in our inventories for the quarter that just ended was in preparation for new product ramp-ups and strategic inventory buffer purchases made to ensure supply continuity during the pandemic. we believe that we are positioned to maintain adequate liquidity in the current environment.
looking ahead to the next quarter, the possible effects of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, the ability of component supplies to align with our customer demand, the book and ship nature of our business, the timing of revenue associated with large projects, the variability of order patterns into the customer base in which we sell as well as the fluctuation in currency exchange rates in our international markets may cause material differences between our expectations and the actual results.
we expect that our fourth quarter 2020 revenue will be in the range of $122 million to $132 million. after considering the projected sales mix, we expect that our fourth quarter gross margin on a non-gaap basis will be in the range of 41% to 42%. we also expect non-gaap operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2020 will be between $50 million and $51 million. and finally, we anticipate the consolidated tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 on a non-gaap basis will be a benefit at a mid-single-digit percentage rate resulting from the expected mix of domestic and international income in the quarter.
we believe that the significant factors impacting revenue and earnings realized in 2020 will be component availability, macro spending environment for carriers and enterprises, ongoing effects of the covid-19 pandemic, the variability of mix and revenue associated with project rollouts, the proportion of international revenue relative to our total revenue, professional services activity levels in both domestic and international markets, the adoption rate of our broadband access platforms, potential changes in tax laws, currency exchange rate movements and inventory fluctuations in our distribution channels.

thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
great. thank you, mike.
ian, at this point, we're ready to open up for any questions people may have.
",2020-Q3,ADTN
0.9999,,,,":
operator
[operator instructions]. the first question comes from rod hall of goldman sachs. your line is open.
bala reddy -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, tom. i can make it quick. this is bala reddy on for rod. [indecipherable] you mentioned different factors that go into it, like supply constraints, macro environment, what are you baking in? any further color would be helpful. and then i have a follow-up. thanks.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
can you repeat that? you were cutting out a little bit there.
bala reddy -- goldman sachs -- analyst
i was talking about the -- could you talk about the supply constraint situation that you are factoring in the guidance?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
oh, the supply chain situation? yes. so i mean we've seen tightness throughout the year, but it's definitely, at least on the silicon side, continued to increase. i think everybody or a lot of people are aware of the lead time extensions by some of the silicon vendors. and there have been -- when you're having to go and buy chips from pretty much any outlet you can get and you sometimes see expedite charges on those, we have factored that into our guidance for the next quarter. the reality is that we don't know exactly what that will be until we actually get those chips, whatever chip it may be, in-house. but we have tried to factor that into our guidance. did i answer your question?
bala reddy -- goldman sachs -- analyst
could you help us maybe quantify it a little bit? it does, but could you help us quantify it like how much are you putting on the table -- off the table right now because of the supply situation?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
that level of detail, to be honest with you, is not at hand right here, but it's not everything. it is predominantly on the chip side by far. and certain chips are worse than others. so i don't have an exact number. i can just tell you that when we rolled up our margin forecast that we did try to take into account. and we look at that -- we look at that, as mike had mentioned, gross margin forecast is fairly detailed and that we look at it on a sku level. so certain skus are impacted by that and certain ones aren't, but i don't think we have a total number on that.
bala reddy -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. fair enough. i guess one more question. could you expand on this rdof opportunity? i believe last quarter, you talked about how some of the providers were still figuring what the path was going to be. maybe you had a few more conversations with them. and then could you expand on the opportunity? i believe you mentioned second half, but it's going to be gradual?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
i do think it'll -- some carriers will kick off as quickly as possible. others will wait because there is some time period that you don't have to build everything right off of the bat. the quiet period is now over. and so we're able to have dialogue with a lot of the customers. i think we are happy as of now with kind of how things turned out. a lot of those customers are long standing customers with adtran. and some of the bigger ones are definitely long standing customers with adtran.
we also -- although there are wisps involved that have won a significant amount of that award, some of those wisps, if you actually get into the details, are actually going to be building out fiber, which is good for us. and then even where they are doing something different, let's say, like fixed wireless, which is typically at lower rates, right, so there's still connectivity opportunities for us with those wisps. so i would say we're feeling pretty good about how the auction itself turned down at this point.
bala reddy -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. bye.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
okay. bye. thank you very much.
operator
your next question comes from george notter of jefferies. your line is open.
george notter -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks very much. i guess as i look into the quarter, my impression is that your largest north american customer was slow again as they have been, i think, in prior q4s. and it sounded like you're really able to backfill for that softness with the tier two and tier three operators in the u.s. and is that the right picture that we should be thinking about here? and then i'd also like to know what the mix of your tier two and tier three operators is at this point. i think in the past, you said it was about 1/3 of the business, but it seems like that must be quite a bit bigger now. any sense of that would be great. thanks.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes. i think we said last time -- mike, what did we say last time on the call? well, first of all, it's the fastest-growing segment we have, but i think it was -- you remember what percentage we got?
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
i think we have said in the past that, in general, it's been roughly 1/3 of each. but we've had so much growth in the tier three segment that it's at least twice the 1/3, right? it's growing fast.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
so it's over 50%. and like mike said, it may actually from quarter to -- it's been growing fast. so at this point in time, it's closer to 60% than 50%. and as far as the tier one customer in the u.s., you're exactly right. that customer did fall off in the q4. the u.s. business was still up, which tells you that even -- we typically see a seasonal decline in q4. so the rest of the u.s. business was pretty strong. there's also another piece that's kind of hidden a little bit. i shouldn't say hidden, but not readily apparent, which is we do have another large customer in australia that was down. and for the most part, the altnet carriers in europe were able to make up for that. so we had two areas of strength that we were glad to see happening.
george notter -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. and then centurylink, i think, has been the biggest customer historically. any sense for what centurylink accounted for in the year as a percentage of sales? or should we just wait for the 10-k filing?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes. i literally don't have that in front of me. but they were stronger in the first half and kind of dwindled down a little in the second half, and then the fourth quarter was not a great quarter. so i really don't know. i don't know that, george. i guess you have to wait.
george notter -- jefferies -- analyst
great. okay. super. hey, thanks very much, guys.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
okay.
operator
your next question comes from richard valera of needham & company. your line is open.
richard valera -- needham & company -- analyst
thank you. wanted to follow up on the component tightness you're seeing. at this point, do you think that would impede your ability to ramp in the second half? i mean you noted making good progress with a number of tier 1s, so presumably some ramp there. what's your confidence you'll be able to get the components to enact that ramp?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
where we have some predictability, and believe it or not, there's actually more predictability in infrastructure builds like that, i think we're good. we have been placing orders out for a long period of time. this newest change in lead time is relatively new, but the orders that we had already placed under the old late time regimen is still in place. so i don't have a lot of worry about that.
where we kind of hurt you the most, honestly, is the more unpredictable piece is like take rates on onts and rgs and things like that, where you could -- that business has just been going fantastic for us, and we've been able to keep up the -- being able to buy those pieces, those parts because the variability can be 30%, 40% quarter-to-quarter and you have different skus and everything. so that's probably a little bit more problematic. so far, we're doing ok, but it's just -- it's going to get tougher.
richard valera -- needham & company -- analyst
yes. no, understood. and relatedly, i know you guys don't give multi-quarter guidance. but with these ongoing components issues, should we think of gross margins as sort of being relatively flattish over the next few quarters at sort of the level you've guided for q1? just wondering if there's any kind of broad color you could give on your thoughts on gross margin.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes. that's probably the safest bet right now. we were expecting gross margins actually to expand this year. and at this point, because we just don't know how bad third quarter, fourth quarter will be as far as trying to find parts. so that's probably a safe way to look at it.
richard valera -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. and then, tom, could you expand on the outstanding rfps that you're bidding on? you mentioned that you might see some of them actually be awarded as early as midyear. can you give us a little color on what that pipeline looks like?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes. the number of rfps out there is probably material rfps. i don't know, somewhere between six and 8s. two of them, we expect to close. and i will tell you, we don't control that, but current expectation is for two of them to close before the half. both of those are global carriers with headquarters based in europe.
richard valera -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then finally, just on international, i mean, you noted that australia was weak. but overall, that business, the international was down pretty meaningfully year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. anything else in international that was going on?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
now, well, our german carrier is typically a little bit of a wildcard. they came in about where we expected. so i mean the biggest decline, it was a material decline in australia. having said that, that is a lumpy customer. there are times where they come in and we sell a lot. and there are times where we don't. we have just started shipping actually this quarter, a new award for them, which will continue to ramp through this year. having -- but it will still be lumpy. it will still be lumpy. i mean the key to us is to grow that tier three, tier two altnet carrier segment, which is hundreds of customers to a point to where any of those materials -- those larger tier 1s won't have such a material impact.
richard valera -- needham & company -- analyst
right. understood. okay. thanks for taking my questions.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
all right. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions]. the next question comes from paul silverstein of cowen. your line is open.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
thanks, guys. i appreciate taking the questions. tom, as the tier 2s and 3s, assuming that their growth continues to outstrip the growth of your tier 1s so that they become a larger percentage of revenue as they did this quarter, does that change -- all the things being equal, does that have an impact on your margin structure one way or the other?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes. yes. yes. that's a good assumption, yes. yes, it would -- that is a -- i mean that's a good market for us.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
based on your current visibility, looking at your order book, your pipeline, i assume you expect that class of customers to continue to outstrip in terms of growth relative to overall growth relative to your tier 1s?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
i think this year, in totality, yes. i think next year, because we'll be in full bore with three tier 1s buying fiber access equipment, i think next year will be more difficult for -- to keep up, but i don't know. rdof may have an impact on that as well.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
that begs the question, given that, that shift should have a positive impact and you're pointing out this year, what's the offset that keeps -- i recognize you all have been very transparent in saying that gross margin for the foreseeable future. and i think you all quantified over the next two years, feel free to correct me if i'm wrong, that we should expect a meaningful change from the low-40s where it's been for quite some time. but given that shift, that, that should have a positive impact and it sounds like you're not expecting any uplift or any meaningful uplift in gross margin this year, what's the offset that's counteracting the benefit you should get from that customer mix shift?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
well, there are two things. we don't expect the supply chain to get better. and i will tell you, we're paying expedite fees now. we paid them in q4. and we paid, at least from a historic perspective, very high logistics charges versus our typical. we don't expect that to get materially better this year. so in fact, we expect pressure to increase. so that's point number one. point number two, what we have tried to forecast in is some additional wins. so although -- what you're talking about, is gross margin better in the smaller carrier segment? yes. do i expect that growth to eclipse the growth in the, let's say, larger carrier segment this year? yes.
but having said that, we also still have some tier one projects that are just going to be getting kicked off that will have a margin impact as we get them up and running. so that will also be a negative.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
got it. appreciate that. and tom, i trust you're indicating that there is, which have been around for a while for you and for others for the better part of the past year. you're telling us that they're actually higher this past quarter and you expect it to stay at that elevated levels relative to previous quarters? or is that not the case?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes. let me be a little more granular on that. so if i look at expedite fees for last quarter versus previous quarters on logistics and chip supply, it was a little higher. i expect it to get tighter this year.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
all right. but -- so it sounds like perhaps the bigger issue is you're hoping, expecting rollouts from the new tier one awards. and as you pointed out, in the initial stage of those rollouts, the margins are especially -- again relative to over time.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes, yes, right. once you get up and running and you got some scale and volume and things, yes.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
all right. and i apologize because i'm asking to repeat yourself. but relative to your previous comments, you said there's six to eight rfps in terms of pipeline of additional opportunities. and did i hear you that, sure, those tier 1s that you expect to be awarded in the first half of this year?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
no, no, no. so yes. so two of those are tier 1s, but probably -- if i look at the number of rfps that are out there or opportunities, it's way bigger than six or eight. so if i look at material, like large customers, it's in the realm of six to eight that we're working on right now. but i will tell you there's probably 100 smaller carriers that we're working on. i mean we captured, what, 34, i think, carriers just last quarter. so at any point in time, there are hundreds that we're working on.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
understood. i appreciate the clarification. and the six to eight you referenced, are all of those non-u.s.?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
most of them.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
and i -- do you think that's tied specifically to huawei getting cut back? or is it more than that?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
i think it's three things. i think it's -- well, i think it's really four things. so i think it's huawei. i think it's 10 gig. i think it's disaggregation. and i think it's covid.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
all right. i appreciate the responsible counselling. thanks, tom.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
okay. all right.
operator
your next question comes from bill dezellem of tieton capital. your line is open.
bill dezellem -- tieton capital -- analyst
thank you. tom, i'd actually like to follow up on your last comment. why do you believe that covid is playing a role there?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
i think broadband became more important. and some countries -- like i just had a conversation late last night with a customer. some countries found themselves a little flatfooted. and for whatever reason, around the same time, fiber was gaining in importance. and i think people that have kind of ok broadband plans have been having to relook at those plans and refresh those plans and make sure that they're going to keep up in the future pandemic or wherever the world may turn. so i think the highlight, the visibility that it put on carriers but just, if not more importantly, on governments and relooking at their infrastructure has absolutely added fuel to this.
bill dezellem -- tieton capital -- analyst
makes a lot of sense. thank you for the clarification. and then you referenced the substantial growth in your tier two and tier three and yet you had four 10% customers. can you tell us how that can happen? it almost seems like mathematically, that's a really small needle to thread.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes. i tried to highlight this in my notes, but i don't think it came out clear. so we have four 10% customers. we typically have two or three. those are typically tier one carriers, very rarely are they not tier one carriers. sometimes a tier two may come in, but they're typically direct sales to carriers. three of our four this quarter were actually distribution partners that sold to tier 3s. so those customers are actually -- those three are actually selling to hundreds of carriers, and they're typically in the tier three segment. is that makes sense to you?
bill dezellem -- tieton capital -- analyst
it makes perfect sense. thank you for the clarification, and i didn't even think of that as a possibility. thank you.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes. okay. all right. at this point, i see no more questions in the queue. so i appreciate you for joining us, and we look forward to talking to you this time next quarter.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to adtran's fourth quarter 2020 earnings release conference call. [operator instructions]. during the course of the conference call, adtran representatives expect to make forward-looking statements, which reflect management's best judgment based on factors currently known.
however, these statements involve risks and uncertainties, including the continued spread and extent of the impact of the covid-19 global pandemic, the ability of component supplies to align with customer demand, the successful development and market acceptance of our products, competition in the market for such products, the product and channel mix, component costs, manufacturing efficiencies and other risks detailed in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019, and our quarterly report on form 10-q for the quarter ended september 30, 2020. these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, which may be made during the call.
it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to tom stanton, chief executive officer of adtran. sir, please go ahead.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
thank you, chris. good morning, everyone. we appreciate you joining us for our fourth quarter 2020 conference call. with me today is adtran's cfo, mike foliano. following my opening remarks, mike will review the quarterly financial performance in detail, and then we will take any questions that you may have. covid-19 continues to impact our day-to-day lives and the way that we do business and highlight the importance of the work we do, enabling operators to provide high-speed broadband connectivity for consumers and businesses. i am proud of our employees' perseverance throughout these difficult times and want to start by saying thank you to all of our team.
moving to the quarterly performance. the results for the fourth quarter demonstrated solid execution against our plan. this included broad-based demand across our customer segments with a strong contribution from regional and emerging service providers. we continue to make great progress with the tier one fiber access projects that we announced earlier last year, while still growing and diversifying our customer base across a variety of market segments. from a top line perspective, revenue for the quarter was $130.1 million with 41.1% gross margin. network solutions accounted for 88% of that total revenue at $114.1 million, while global services contributed $16 million.
during the quarter, we had four 10% customers, one of the highest numbers we have ever reported. each of these customers' percentage of total revenue was in the low double digits, pointing to the success of our diversification efforts. of these, there was one service provider customer and three distribution partners. these distribution partners serve hundreds of regional service providers in the u.s. market with a mix of broadband access and connected home and enterprise solutions, further reinforcing our success that we are having with both customer and portfolio diversification. new customer acquisition remains strong. we added 35 new service provider customers during the quarter, bringing the total to 134 for the year.
our fiber access portfolio has led the way in terms of both new customer acquisition and revenue growth. we expect this to continue as our fiber access solutions and software platforms are adopted by customers around the world who are upgrading their networks due to favorable government, regulatory, technology and competitive factors. similar to q3, the growth that we saw during the quarter was led by our continued success in the tier two and regional broadband operator market in the u.s., which was up 85% year-over-year. we are seeing increasing demand for our fiber access, connected home and cloud services offerings.
our fiber access and aggregation business grew 98% year-over-year and home service delivery platforms were up 68% year-over-year and cloud services increased 46% year-over-year. we are seeing similar trends in europe where favorable regulatory and funding environments are driving the build of fiber access networks. we posted revenue growth of 54% year-over-year in the emea market segment. this increase was driven by investment in 10-gig fiber access networks with european altnet providers. in the tier one customer segment, as mentioned earlier, we are making great progress with all three announced wins, including two european and one u.s.-based customer.
two of the three have already achieved a significant milestone of first-customer connections, and we expect lab exit for all three around the middle of the year. in addition, we are actively involved in several other tier one decision processes around the world, some of which we expect to reach decision points around the middle of this year. covid-19 related logistics issues and global chip shortages continue to impact lead times and inventory levels, and our operations teams continue to take proactive steps to mitigate logistics and component availability challenges to meet our customer needs.
however, lead times do remain extended on some key components. and as a result of our efforts to address these needs, we have maintained elevated inventory levels and incurred increased freight costs due to decreased capacity associated with higher transportation rates and expedite fees. from an organizational perspective, we continue to maintain a disciplined approach to operational expenses. the structural changes that we have implemented over the last year continue to improve our operational efficiency. in the past 18 months, we have reduced our non-gaap quarterly operating expenses by almost $12 million or 19% through disciplined expense management.
these changes have allowed us to reach investment levels that align with our target operating model moving forward. on the product side, we continue to invest in end-to-end broadband solutions that make it easy for broadband operators to deploy and operate fiber-based broadband access networks. in the customer connectivity segment, we expanded our in-home service delivery platforms with our new sdg series of cloud-managed mesh wifi six gateways. these platforms deliver gigabit speeds wirelessly throughout the home or business. they are complemented by an intuitive mobile app and cloud-based software suite that simplify deployment and management of wifi mesh, iot, advanced security and parenteral control services.
these platforms will enhance our ability to capitalize on the increased investment we are seeing in the connected home segment. in fiber access, we have established ourselves as one of the fastest-growing vendors through the widespread adoption of our 10-gig fiber access platforms. whether you're a regional operator looking for an easy-to-deploy system with integrated access and transport or a large tier one broadband operator seeking the leading open disaggregated fiber access platform available, adtran has solutions that are an ideal match for these customers' needs.
on the software side, we enhanced our cloud software suite with the launch of mosaic one, a saas offering that combines network and subscriber analytics with ai-driven algorithms to optimize end-to-end network performance while providing actionable insight for operations and marketing teams. highlighting our growth in cloud services, we secured our largest saas contract to date with an award that covers hundreds of thousands of customers over a multiyear period. the consumer demand and government support for fiber-based broadband services are at an all-time high. one notable program, of course, is the fcc's rural digital opportunity fund, or rdof.
and in december, the fcc announced 180 winning bids in the rdof phase one auction. these winning bidders are expected to receive a total of $9.2 billion of funding over a 10-year period to build out broadband service to over five million homes. over 85% of these homes will be served with gigabit broadband speeds. adtran's portfolio is a great match to these service tier and customer segments. in europe and around the globe, many global operators are significantly increasing their fiber investment, while also looking to diversify the vendors in their supply chain.
as an established global vendor with a leading fiber access portfolio and global r&d presence, including europe, adtran continues -- stands out as a reliable option for future broadband deployments. the shift to gigabit-enabled fiber access networks will also drive further demand for gigabit-capable, cloud-managed wireless mesh connectivity in the home or business, providing material additional growth opportunities for adtran as an end-to-end broadband solution provider.
i mentioned earlier in 2020 that adtran's fiber business had eclipsed our copper business for the first time in our history. in q4 of 2020, fiber-related solutions represented over 70% of our business. overall, we achieved some key milestones in 2020, and we have a lot of positive momentum in the growth segments of our portfolio, driving a diversified customer base in our target markets. the progress that we had in 2020 has us well positioned for additional success in 2021.
mike will now provide a review of our financials. following these remarks, i will be happy to answer any questions you may have. mike?
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, tom, and good morning to all. i will review our fourth quarter 2020 results, and i'll also provide our view on the first quarter of 2021. during my report, i will be referencing both gaap and non-gaap results with reconciliations presented in our press release and supplemental financial schedules on our investor relations web page at www.adtran.com/investor. the supplemental financial schedules on our web page also present certain revenue information by segment and category, which i will be discussing today. as tom stated, our fourth quarter revenue came in at $130.1 million compared to $133.1 million in the prior quarter and $115.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2019.
breaking this down across our operating segments, our network solutions revenue for the fourth quarter was $114.1 million versus $115.2 million reported for q3 of 2020 and $96.2 million in q4 of 2019. our services & support revenue in q4 was $16 million compared to $17.9 million reported for the third quarter of 2020 and $19.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. across our revenue categories, access and aggregation revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $79 million compared to $85.4 million in the prior quarter and $74.6 million in quarter four of 2019. revenue for our subscriber solutions and experience category was $45.4 million for the quarter versus $43.1 million for quarter three of 2020 and $33.2 million for quarter four of 2019.
traditional and other products revenue for the quarter was $5.8 million compared to $4.6 million in q3 of 2020 and $8 million for quarter four of 2019. looking at our revenues geographically, domestic u.s. revenue for q4 2020 was $95.8 million versus $92.8 million reported in quarter three of 2020 and $69.9 million in quarter four of 2019. our international revenue for the quarter was $34.3 million compared to $40.3 million for quarter three of 2020 and $45.9 million in quarter four of 2019. in the fourth quarter, we had four 10% of revenue customers. our gaap gross margin for the fourth quarter was 41.1% as compared to 44.3% in the prior quarter and 40.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019.
non-gaap gross margin for the quarter was 41.3% as compared to 44.5% in the prior quarter and 41.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019. the quarter-over-quarter decrease in both gaap and non-gaap gross margins were driven by product, services and customer mix and lower volume and lower manufacturing absorption. the increases in both gaap and non-gaap gross margin on a year-over-year basis were driven by increases in volume as well as product, services, customer and geographical mix changes. during the quarter, we did experience extended component lead times, which we expect to continue into 2021, potentially affecting component availability and component and logistics costs.
total operating expenses on a gaap basis were $56.8 million for quarter four of 2020 compared to $54.4 million reported in the prior quarter and $61.3 million for q4 of 2019. the quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily related to market-driven increases in our deferred compensation expense, restructuring-related costs in both r&d and sg&a and contract services partially offset by a decrease in labor expense as a result of our restructuring program, which was initiated in 2019. the year-over-year decreases in operating expenses were a result of lower labor expenses in both r&d and sg&a as a result of our restructuring program and lower travel-related expenses partially offset by increases in contract services costs, restructuring expenses and market-driven increases in our deferred comp expense.
on a non-gaap basis, our fourth quarter operating expenses were $49.5 million compared to $49.4 million in the prior quarter and $56.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. the slight increase quarter-over-quarter in non-gaap operating expenses was primarily due to increases in contract services offset by a decrease in labor expenses. the non-gaap year-over-year decrease in operating expenses was primarily the result of our expense reduction efforts and lower travel expenses year-over-year partially offset by an increase in contract services. operating loss on a gaap basis for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $3.3 million compared to an operating income of $4.5 million in the prior quarter and an operating loss of $14.1 million reported in q4 of 2019.
non-gaap operating income for quarter four of 2020 was $4.3 million compared to $9.9 million in the prior quarter and an operating loss of $9 million in quarter four of 2019. the quarter-over-quarter gaap decrease in profitability was attributable to lower sales volume, less favorable gross margin mix and higher operating expenses driven by restructuring and market-driven deferred compensation expenses. the year-over-year decrease in gaap operating loss was driven by higher sales with favorable gross margin mix and reduced operating expenses. the non-gaap quarter-over-quarter decrease in profitability was mainly driven by lower sales volume and less favorable gross margin mix. the non-gaap year-over-year operating income improvement was related to higher sales volume, higher gross margin mix and reduced operating expenses.
other income on a gaap basis for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $3 million compared to other income of $1.5 million in the prior quarter and other income of $3.2 million for quarter four of 2019. our non-gaap other income for the quarter was $1.7 million compared to a non-gaap other income of $876,000 in q3 of 2020 and $2.9 million for quarter four of 2019. the increases in both the gaap and non-gaap other income as compared to the prior quarter were primarily market-driven, caused by increases in the fair value of our investment portfolio and lower realized foreign currency exchange losses.
the decrease in gaap and non-gaap other income on a year-over-year basis was primarily driven by higher realized foreign currency exchange losses and lower gains in our investment portfolio. the company's tax provision for the fourth quarter of 2020 was a benefit of $6.5 million as compared to a $562,000 expense in the prior quarter and a $768,000 expense in the fourth quarter of 2019. the current quarter benefit was primarily the result of finalizing our 2019 net operating loss carryback claims related to the 2020 cares act and a shift in profitability across tax jurisdictions.
the tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 was a result of our international operations as the deferred tax benefits generated in that quarter by our domestic operations were offset by additional changes in the valuation allowance that was previously established in the third quarter of 2019. gaap net income for quarter four of 2020 was $6.1 million compared to $5.5 million in the prior quarter and a net loss of $11.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. non-gaap net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $5.2 million as compared to $7.9 million in the prior quarter and a net loss of $2.5 million in quarter four of 2019.
earnings per share, assuming dilution on a gaap basis, was $0.13 as compared to $0.11 per share in the prior quarter and a loss of $0.24 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. non-gaap earnings per share, assuming dilution for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $0.11 per share compared to $0.16 per share in the prior quarter and a loss of $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. turning to the balance sheet. unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaled $118 million at quarter end after paying $4.3 million in dividends during the quarter. for the quarter, we used $11.2 million of cash from operations. net trade accounts receivable was $98.8 million at the end of the quarter, resulting in a dso of 70 days compared to 69 days in the prior quarter and 72 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019.
the variability in dsos quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year is mainly attributable to the timing of shipments. net inventories were $118.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter compared to $120.3 million in q3 of 2020 and $98.3 million at the end of q4 of 2019. while our inventories were down slightly quarter-over-quarter, we continue to carry higher inventory levels in preparation for new product ramp-ups and strategic inventory buffer purchases which have been made to ensure supply continuity throughout the pandemic. we believe that we are positioned to maintain adequate liquidity in the current environment.
looking ahead to the next quarter, the possible effects of the ongoing pandemic, the availability of component supplies to align with our customer demand, the book and ship nature of our business, potential supply chain expediting costs and other component and logistics cost variations, the timing of revenue associated with large products, the variability of order patterns into the customer base in which we sell as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates in our international markets may cause material differences between our expectations and actual results.
having said all that, we expect that our first quarter 2021 revenue will be in the range of $122 million to $130 million. after considering the projected sales mix, we expect that our first quarter gross margin on a non-gaap basis will be in the range of 40% to 42%. we also expect that non-gaap operating expenses for the first quarter of 2021 will be about $50 million. and finally, we anticipate the consolidated tax rate for the first quarter on a non-gaap basis will be in the low 20s percentage rate.
we believe that the significant factors impacting revenue and earnings realized in 2021 will be component availability and costs, macro spending environment for carriers and enterprises, the ongoing effects of the covid-19 pandemic, the variability of mix and revenue associated with our project rollouts, the proportion of international revenue relative to our total professional services activity levels both domestic and internationally, the adoption rate of our broadband access platforms, potential changes in corporate tax laws, currency exchange rate movements and inventory fluctuations in our distribution channels. once again, the financial information is available at adtran's investor relations web page at www.adtran.com/investor.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of rod hall from goldman sachs, your line is open.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey guys, thank you for picking my question. i just wanted to dig into the tier 1s in the u.s. a little bit on visibility. we're hearing from some other suppliers that visibility is starting to improve a little bit as people get worried about supply chain disruptions or supply chain shortages. and i'm just curious whether you guys are seeing that? and what -- how you feel about tier one visibility as you look into the second half of the year. then i've got a follow-up to that.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
i think we're feeling pretty good about it. i do think that some of the carriers understand the supply constraints better than others. and typically, the larger ones are really coming on board and trying to, at least, if not place purchase orders, at least place serious forecasts that are things that have been maybe a little more sure than they have been in the past. so i would say visibility across the board is better. and that's not just with tier ones, that's pretty much across the board.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay, thank you tom. and then the other thing that is coming up more and more is inflation on all sorts of different -- not just semiconductors, but steel and freight and so on. i'm just curious if you guys could comment on what you're seeing in that respect? do you see upward pressure on underlying costs? and do you think you could pass that through to customers for the most part? or do you think it will pressure margin? just kind of what's your take on inflation here?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
well, if i take a look at the -- let's take semiconductors out. i mean, we're still having the ability to drive overall purchasing costs down. so -- but i would say not at an aggressive rate. it's been -- maybe we're able to do that consistently. and i would say right now it's probably maybe a little bit less than historical, but we haven't seen any material price increases other than with semiconductors themselves.
we haven't really tried to exercise the right to raise those prices into the customer base. we have done that, for instance, with the tariffs, and we're able to do that. and to some respects, i consider this to be a semiconductor tariff. but my guess would be to the things -- to the extent that these things continue on or actually accelerate that we would be passing some of those costs off onto the customer base.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay, alright. thanks a lot.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
okay.
operator
your next question comes from the line of george notter from jefferies.
george notter -- jefferies -- analyst
hi guys, thanks very much. i guess maybe to start, i think, tom, you mentioned record bookings at the start of the call. is there -- could you give us a book-to-bill number or a backlog number or give us some sense for where bookings are right now? and then also, i guess, kind of extending on a question earlier, is it simply customers just giving you more visibility or longer-dated pos? and do you think the rate of consumption in the end market is going up?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes. we don't -- i don't -- answer [indecipherable] anyways, but we typically don't give that. i was going to give you something to -- that you can manage off of that, which is -- i don't know how to say it, mike, but without giving a book-to-bill number. let me just say it was a strong booking quarter. so -- and this is including -- we had kind of this booking uptick at the first part of last year when covid was coming in line. and it was actually stronger than that. so bookings wise, we're feeling good. now as far as how much is in this quarter versus people buying out, i will tell you, we try to do that analysis. and if we take out the things that are scheduled far into the future, which is really those customers trying to buy typically commit our shipments to them further into the year, if you remove that, it was still a very strong booking quarter.
now the only thing that i can't explicitly tell you is, well, are they trying to put the inventory on their shelves versus keeping it in our shelf effectively. and i can't -- there's really no way to gauge that. although i didn't -- if we look at the demand increase that we've been seeing over the last, let's say, three quarters, it's not atypical. it's really -- a lot of that growth is coming from tier 3s. and what we're seeing in order demand out of those is very typical to what we have been seeing. i mean we just -- that segment is growing very strong.
george notter -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. and i think last quarter you guys gave us percentage of sales coming from that tier three customer set. is there a percentage of sales number you could give us here for q1?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
i don't know if we gave a percentage of sales. i think we gave -- it was over $50 million or $60 million -- and it grew sequentially and year-over-year. so it's over that number now, of course.
george notter -- jefferies -- analyst
great. okay, thank you very much.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
hey, and one other thing, just -- i know you're not on the phone anymore, but one thing, we did talk about the growth in that segment too. so you can -- you may be able to come up with a number from that perspective. okay, christine.
operator
your next question comes from the line of michael genovese from west capital park, your line is open.
michael genovese -- west capital park -- analyst
hi, great. hi, mike. it's westpark capital. so my question, my first question is just that the nature of the business, has it completely changed? i mean, you used to always talk about being a book-and-ship business. but is there no room now for book-and-ship orders to come in? and is it now a plan a year in ahead business completely? so that's my first question.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
no. i would -- no, in some ways it would be nice if it was, but no. so we still have a large amount -- i mean, the majority of our orders come in and they want us to ship them within a two week period of time. but the highest runner pieces and selected parts are things where if you're not placing orders right now for six months from now or even a year from now, you're liable to run into a real supply constraint. so i would say it's more of a -- it's definitely shifted more toward longer-term perspective, but we -- but it's still -- the majority of our orders still come in and they want us to ship them within the quarter definitely and typically within the month.
michael genovese -- west capital park -- analyst
right. when you look at your tier one business for the second half of the year, do you feel like you're managing to supply and demand for those projects being in balance? or is there a supply shortage? or is there demand -- potential demand shortage? how are you thinking about that?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
tier 1s, i think, we're by and large good at, if you look at it from an infrastructure perspective. so you almost have to go by product type. if you look at the tier one business that's coming on in europe, that's been forecast for some time. so we've already got the supply chain lined up for that increase that we're expecting in the second half. in the u.s., i would say the same is predominantly true. where we run into issues is where there's variability in the forecast from the customer, and that's typically with things like rgs and onts.
so on end-user devices, we can run into problems because the demand for those products is through the roof. i think combined it was up like 94% year-over-year. it's just going through the roof. we did not forecast that because our customers weren't forecasting that. we've been able to keep up. but yes, it's -- that's the type of product that's more problematic.
michael genovese -- west capital park -- analyst
does that include wifi six devices? is that a meaningful piece of your business? like how many -- what percent of your customers buy wifi from you?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
a large percentage of our customers buy wifi from us. it's not -- wifi six itself is relatively new for us, so it's just now starting up. future course, we got to drive demand. we think we've got a handle on the forecast for the chips required for that. but here again, so far everything that we forecasted we've been out-stripping on the ont and rg side. the real thing that hurts us is we do have some of our vendors decommitting, right? so when you've got orders in place and all of a sudden they're not -- you can't count on anymore, that causes material repercussion. so we're continuing to fight that challenge.
michael genovese -- west capital park -- analyst
is the wifi stuff growing at a similar or faster rate than the o&t stuff?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
i would say it's -- i don't have the actual breakout of those skus. but i would say it's probably leading the charge.
michael genovese -- west capital park -- analyst
and my final question is just -- i appreciate all this color. my final question is just -- is this a point of gross margin outperformance in the quarter? you guided in line than the quarter you beat. so where do you attribute the better performance in 1q to?
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
mix. it was a mix.
michael genovese -- west capital park -- analyst
you mean domestic mixed or mix? or that would be domestic?
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
no, no. it -- well, it could be. there was definitely -- the answer to your question is yes. because if you think of the growth that we saw, i mean, tier 3s are going through the roof, and a lot of that is infrastructure business, right? so it was just a good mix.
michael genovese -- west capital park -- analyst
thank you.
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
okay.
operator
your next question comes from the line of tim savageaux from northland capital, your line is open.
tim savageaux -- northland capital -- analyst
hi good morning and congrats, especially on the bookings. one question and then a follow-up. i think it's been a while, maybe a very long while since you've had a quarter without any 10% service provider customers. i think last year you had two or three. and i wonder if you could characterize your u.s. business in terms of the growth, assuming your historic tier one was over 10% last year and was under this year.
i wonder if you have any comments on u.s. growth, excluding that customer. and then more broadly speaking, do you expect some of your historic tier 1s to reattain 10% customer status as we move on in the year?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes. so that's a good question. so let's talk about tier 1s in the u.s. so the tier 1s in the u.s. -- and i could actually just say kind of north america. so let's include what has happened in mexico. you're seeing two things happen. one is we are growing the pon market share in those tier 1s and -- or let's say pon shipments in those tier 1s. but we are also seeing a decline in our copper business. and i think a lot of people lose sight of that. so we have, you could call it today definitely a legacy business.
but copper, that if we did not have that legacy business, our number -- our growth numbers would be through the roof, right? so you're seeing copper decline. i think -- and i don't know if i have the exact number but [indecipherable]. at this point in time, fiber is over 70% of our business. if you can look back a year ago, it was less than 50% of our business. so you're seeing that decline in copper while you're seeing huge growth in the fiber business. and some of that is of course affecting the tier 1s. and so i don't know if that answers your question or not, so.
tim savageaux -- northland capital -- analyst
yes, that's great. and just a follow-up, with regard to the booking strength, i don't know if there's any -- if we could just assume that's similar to what you saw in revenue-wise in overall broadband and what's your -- whether there's any sort of different character to what you saw from a booking standpoint?
and can you comment on whether that booking strength has continued into q2 and whether perhaps adjusting for some caf ii services we might reasonably expect a record revenue quarter at some point fairly soon after seeing a record bookings quarter?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes. so by the way, i didn't finish the answer to your last question. so let me just kind of finish that. so as you know, we did won a tier one award, which is a sole source award for xgs here in the u.s. that is one of those things that we expect to start shipping in the second half of the year. so i think you'll see the tier one business trajectory change after that point. on the bookings strength, yes, that's what -- our biggest problem right now is supply. our problem is not bookings.
so i think it has to do, where that record falls is largely dependent upon when we can actually -- i mean, we walked out of q1 with a significant amount of orders that the customers wanted to take in q1. and the same thing is going to happen this quarter. and the same thing will happen in the third quarter. and i don't have line of sight to a real cure for that as to when it actually gets better. so i think it's highly dependent on our ability to supply product.
tim savageaux -- northland capital -- analyst
okay, thanks very much.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
okay.

your next question comes from the line of paul silverstein from cowen, your line is open.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
thanks guys. tom, first off, and i apologize if you already said this, but did you address when you expect rdof to have an impact and to what extent?
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
no, we didn't. i would -- i think there's a good chance we'll start seeing some rdof in the second half of this year. i don't have a good line of sight to the ramp of that, but i would be surprised if we didn't start seeing -- i'm not -- by the way, not so sure we haven't seen it already in some of the smaller customers.
but the bigger customers, and there's, of course, a really large customer in the u.s. that we're an incumbent to that we'll hopefully start seeing some shipments in the second half of this year.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
so do you think -- is it too much to say it's a given that will have a meaningful impact next year? do you have a confidence level as to what's [indecipherable].
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
yes, it should have a meaningful impact. yes. it should have a meaningful impact next year. they have a longer time to build, of course, as you know, but it should be a nice tailwind next year, yes.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
all right. and then, mike, i think i ask you this question every quarter, so i do apologize, but i'll ask it again, which is longer-term from a margin standpoint on the gross margin line, you've been very candid about this. i think historically you've said consistently you expect model to remain in the low 40s. but as you look out to the prospective impacts of these large projects, of these large tier ones, assuming they come in as advertised in terms of volumes? all the things being equal, will that -- should that drive margin lower given that some of those projects, at least the non-u.s. ones probably have lower margin structure as has been the case historically? or does it -- do you think long-term at least model one for us?
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
no. paul, i think it's still the same as what i've said in the past, it's low to mid-40s. so i can take the middle of that range. and if you start looking at those tier 1s, i think the additional volume that it's driving through gives us a little bit of a tailwind as well. so i think there's really no change to our plans going forward, still in that same model.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
i would also add, paul, that i think -- there's two other things that affect us, one is there was predatory, i mean, to put it lightly, predatory pricing going on in europe, that has somewhat been mitigated. so i think the types of margins that you -- i mean, i think we have sustainable business type margins out of europe today where that wasn't the case historically. and then we have a positive draw that we haven't yet tried to put numbers around. but our saas customer base, which is predominantly in the tier 3s here in the u.s., that customer is basically 60% -- 66% year-over-year. and that will, at some point, really start kicking up and being very positive gross margins, but we haven't really forecasted that impact at this point.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
got it. and one last quick question from me. it's only 90 days further on. but tom, is there any incremental insight with respect to these large projects in terms of them panning out to the extent that the particular customers have projected to [indecipherable]
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
[indecipherable] yes, yes. there's still no real changes there. i mean everything is still -- we're planning on getting to start shipping in the second half of this year and then seeing them ramp from there. so there's no material change. at this point, we're going to end the call.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
i appreciate it.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
i appreciate everybody for joining us, and i look forward to talking to you next quarter at this time.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to adtran's first quarter 2021 earnings release conference call. [operator instructions]
during the course of the conference call, adtran representatives expect to make forward-looking statements, which reflect management's best judgments based on factors currently known. however, these statements involve risks and uncertainties, including the continued spread and expense of the impact of covid-19 global pandemic, the ability of component supplies to align with customer demand, the successful development and market acceptance of our products; competition in the market for such products, the product and channel mix, component costs, manufacturing efficiencies and other risks detailed in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ending december 31, 2020. these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, which may be made during the call.
it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to tom stan, chief executive officer of adtran. please go ahead.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
thank you, christine. good morning, everyone. we appreciate you joining us for our first quarter 2021 conference call. with me today is adtran's cfo, mike foliano. following my opening remarks, mike will review the quarterly financial performance in detail, and then we will take any questions that you may have. we had a strong first quarter, and we expect this to be an exciting year for adtran. we grew revenue 11% year-over-year, increased non-gaap eps by $0.18 year-over-year and recorded the highest product bookings for any quarter in our history. this success was primarily driven by the demand for our fiber-based broadband solutions, continuing the positive momentum from the second half of last year. if we look at the market, there are several key indicators that provide a positive outlook for our business.
on the consumer side, we continue to see increased demand for fiber-based broadband access paired with premium cloud-managed wifi in the home. from a funding perspective, governments are prioritizing high-speed broadband connectivity to all residents more than ever. in the u.s., president biden has proposed $100 billion to future-proof broadband as part of an eight year infrastructure plan. he referred to high-speed broadband as the new electricity that's a necessity for all americans. the u.k. government has also pledged $7 billion in funding for gigabit capable broadband for hard-to-reach areas. similar multibillion-dollar investments are being committed in the eu to accelerate high-speed broadband connectivity across its member countries. in addition to government spending, we continue to see increased investment from private equity, municipalities, utilities and others to fund the build-out of fiber access networks for high-speed broadband and future 5g connectivity.
from a technology standpoint, refresh cycles around 10 gig fiber access, mesh wifi six and cloud-based services are driving increased investment in our growth products. finally, supply chain diversification and vendor risk mitigation initiatives are also being -- are also accelerating vendor selection programs across our target customer base. with our strong presence in key growth markets, including the u.s. and europe, along with our trusted vendor status and differentiated portfolio, we are well-positioned to take advantage of the major investment cycles that we see ahead of us. taking a closer look at our key growth areas of fiber access, in-home servers, delivery platforms and software, you will see several highlights that reinforce our success in these areas.
in fiber access, dell'oro's q4 2020 market share report noted adtran as the fastest-growing pon olt vendor in both north america and emea in terms of year-over-year market share gains. for our in-home service delivery platforms, q1 was the record revenue quarter with growth being led by cloud-managed mesh wifi gateways. on the software side, our growth was led by our cloud-based saas offerings where we have grown our customer base by 66% in the past year. as we look at the q1 financials, revenue for the quarter was $127.5 million with 42% gross margins. network solutions accounted for 89% of total revenue at $113.8 million, while global services contributed $13.7 million. during the quarter, we had two 10% customers, both distribution partners.
these distribution partners serve hundreds of tier 2s and regional service providers in the u.s. with a mix of broadband access, connected home and enterprise solutions. this reinforces the success we are having with both customer and portfolio diversification. we continue to make good progress toward our customer acquisition and diversification efforts in q1 with an addition of 26 new service provider customers. we expect to continue to grow our customer base as our 10 gig fiber access solutions, connected home solutions and software platforms are adopted by customers that are upgrading their networks due to favorable government, regulatory and technology factors. much like the second half of 2020, the growth that we saw in q1 was led by our success with regional broadband operators in both the u.s. and europe. in the u.s. market, revenue from regional broadband operators was up a combined 48% year-over-year, while european regional operators were up a combined 70% year-over-year. we continue to see increasing demand for our fiber access, connected home and cloud-based offerings. our fiber access and aggregation business grew 51% year-over-year. in-home service delivery platforms were up 94% year-over-year and saas offerings increased 32% year-over-year.
the growth in these areas more than offset the decline in our traditional copper access business. for the previously announced tier one fiber access projects, we continue to make great progress and expect to exit the lab for each of these around the middle of the year. in addition to these previously announced awards, we are still on track with several tier one projects globally, and we are also experiencing growth in tier one mso customers with our 10 gig fiber access portfolio as they begin to transition to more full fiber network deployments. inventory levels remain higher than normal due to the increased lead times from the global chip shortage and covid-19 related logistics issues. we continue to see lead times extend and expect that this will continue for some time into the future. we are taking the necessary steps to mitigate these challenges to the best of our ability, but the supply chain constraints do present risk in the near-term or midterm. from an organizational perspective, we continue to maintain a disciplined approach to our operational expenses. the structural changes that we implemented over the past year continue to improve our operational efficiency.
we have reduced our non-gaap quarterly operating expenses by 9% year over through disciplined expense management. as we secure additional tier one wins, we do expect to see a slight increase in r&d expenses. on the product side, we introduced several key advantages during the quarter. in our fiber access platforms, we announced several new products that will simplify the deployment of fiber-based gigabit services in low-density areas for rdof recipients. for in-home service delivery platforms, we have begun to ramp deployments of our cloud-managed mesh wifi six gateway. as mentioned previously, q1 was a record revenue quarter for our in-home service delivery platforms, especially in mesh wifi, and we have very strong order bookings going forward for this growth area. on the software side, we have two primary areas of growth. in the saas category, we are seeing increased demand for our cloud-based tools that proactively optimize end-to-end performance for broadband access and in-home networks while providing actionable insight to the operations and marketing teams.
as noted earlier, we grew our customer base for saas offerings by 66% year-over-year. saas projects are typically pay-as-you-grow multiyear programs that will continue to increase over time. in addition to our saas solutions, we also offer leading edge access domain orchestration software that simplifies the programmability of open multi-vendor networks. we have seen an increase in customer additions, including multi-vendor integrations in this category as service providers modernize their it and oss processes. in our enterprise gateway portfolio, we very recently launched our low-end iot gateways. we have a growing backlog of demand for these products that simplify the connectivity of large-scale iot sensor networks to cloud-based iot cores. these iot gateways are the latest additions to our updated enterprise portfolio that consists of fiber access routers, business class ethernet switches, business wifi, all to support the next-generation of industrial automation applications.
continued investment in our portfolio, coupled with the success we are having in our growth products has us well-positioned for additional success throughout the year. this will also enable us to continue to meet our customer and portfolio diversification objectives. on the q1 call last year, we first spoke of covid-19 and its impact on our company. i want to say i'm extremely proud of how our employees continue to weather the storm. they have remained flexible and resilient throughout this difficult time, and i want to thank them. with that background, mike will now provide a review of our financials.
following his remarks, i will be happy to answer any questions that you may have. mike?
michael foliano -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, tom, and good morning to all. i'll review our first quarter 2021 results and provide our expectations for the second quarter. during my report, i'll be referencing both gaap and non-gaap results with reconciliations presented in our press release and supplemental financial schedules on our investor relations web page at www.adtran.com/investor. the supplemental financial schedules on our web page also present certain revenue information by segment and category, which i'll be discussing today. adtran's first quarter 2021 revenue came in at $127.5 million compared to $130.1 million in the prior quarter and $114.5 million in the first quarter of 2020. subdividing this across our operating segments, our network solutions revenue for the first quarter was $113.8 million versus $114.1 million reported for q4 of 2020 and $97.4 million in q1 2020. our services and support revenue in q1 of this year was $13.7 million compared to $16 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $17.2 million in the first quarter of 2020. across our revenue categories, access & aggregation revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was $69.1 million compared to $79 million in the prior quarter and $66 million in q1 of 2020.
the revenue for our subscriber solutions & experience category was $54.6 million for the quarter versus $45.4 million for quarter four of 2020 and $42.2 million for quarter one of 2020. traditional and other products revenue for the quarter was $3.9 million compared to $5.8 million for quarter four of 2020 and $6.4 million for quarter one of 2020. looking at our revenues geographically. domestic revenue for q1 2021 was $86.5 million versus $95.8 million reported in quarter four of 2020 and $79 million in quarter one of 2020. our international revenue for quarter one of 2021 was $41 million, compared to $34.3 million in q4 of 2020 and $35.5 million in the first quarter of 2020. as tom stated, in the first quarter, we had two 10% of revenue customers, both of these were domestic. our gaap gross margin for the first quarter of this year was at 42% as compared to 41.1% in the prior quarter and 45.1% in the first quarter of 2020. non-gaap gross margin for the quarter was 42.1% as compared to 41.3% in the prior quarter and 45.4% in the first quarter of 2020. the quarter-over-quarter improvement in both gaap and non-gaap gross margins were driven by product and customer mix in both our products and services segments.
the year-over-year decreases in both gaap and non-gaap gross margins are attributable to both domestic and international product mix, partially offset by higher volume manufacturing efficiencies. during the quarter we experienced extended component lead times, which we expect to continue, potentially affecting component availability and also component and logistics costs. total operating expenses on a gaap basis were $54.9 million for the quarter compared to $56.8 million reported in the prior quarter and $56.5 million for quarter one of 2020. the quarter-over-quarter decrease was driven by reduced restructuring expenses, market-driven decreases in our deferred compensation expense and lower legal expenses. partially offset by increases in employee benefit expenses in both r&d and sg&a and higher r&d project-related expenses. the year-over-year decrease in operating expenses was a result of lower labor expenses in both r&d and sg&a and lower travel and marketing-related expenses, partially offset by market-driven increases in our deferred compensation expense and contract services costs.
on a non-gaap basis, our first quarter operating expense was $51.4 million compared to $49.5 million in the prior quarter and $56.7 million in quarter one of 2020. the increase in quarter-over-quarter non-gaap operating expenses was primarily due to increases in employee benefit expenses in both r&d and sg&a, and higher r&d project-related expenses, partially offset by decreases in legal expense and other planned sg&a expense reductions. the year-over-year decrease in non-gaap operating expenses was a result of lower labor expenses in both r&d and sg&a and lower travel and marketing-related expenses, partially offset by increases in contract services costs.
operating loss on a gaap basis for the first quarter of 2021 was $1.3 million compared to an operating loss of $3.3 million in the prior quarter. and an operating loss of $4.9 million reported in q1 of 2020. non-gaap operating income for quarter one of 2021 was $2.4 million compared to $4.3 million in the prior quarter, and an operating loss of $4.6 million in quarter one of 2020. the quarter-over-quarter gaap improvement in profitability was attributable to a more favorable gross margin mix and reduced operating expenses. the year-over-year decrease in gaap operating expenses was driven by higher sales and reduced operating expenses. the non-gaap quarter-over-quarter decrease in profitability was driven by higher operating expenses and reduced sales volume, which partially offset by improving gross margins.
the non-gaap year-over-year operating income improvement was related to higher sales volume and reduced operating expenses. other income on a gaap basis for the first quarter of 2021 was $3.3 million, compared to other income of $3 million in the prior quarter and a loss of $9.4 million for quarter one of 2020. our non-gaap other income for the quarter was $3.3 million compared to non-gaap other income of $1.7 million in q4 of 2020 and a non-gaap loss of $7.5 million in quarter one of 2020. the quarter-over-quarter increases in both the gaap and non-gaap other income were related to higher realized foreign currency exchange gains partially offset by reduced returns in our investment portfolio.
the increases in both the gaap and non-gaap other income on a year-over-year basis were related to increases in the market-driven fair value of our investment portfolio and, to a lesser extent, higher realized foreign currency exchange gains. the company's tax provision for the first quarter of 2021 was an expense of $1 million as compared to a $6.5 million tax benefit in the prior quarter and a $4.4 million benefit in the first quarter of 2020. the current quarter's expense was primarily driven by tax expense from our international operations as the deferred tax benefits generated by our domestic operations continue to be offset by additional changes in the valuation allowance. the tax benefits in the first and fourth quarter of 2020 were primarily due to the passage of the cares act in the first quarter and finalization of those calculations as part of finalizing our filing and related 2019 net operating loss carryback claims as well as in a shift across our profitability jurisdictions.
gaap net income for quarter one of 2020 was $900,000 compared to $6.1 million in the prior quarter and a net loss of $10 million for the first quarter of 2020. non-gaap net income for the first quarter of 2021 was $6.3 million as compared to $5.2 million in the prior quarter and a net loss of $2.2 million in quarter one of 2020. earnings per share assuming dilution on a gaap basis were $0.02 per share as compared to $0.13 per share in the prior quarter and a loss of $0.21 per share in the first quarter of 2020. non-gaap eps, assuming dilution for the first quarter of 2021 was $0.13 compared to $0.11 per share in the prior quarter and a loss of $0.05 per share in quarter one of 2020. on the balance sheet, unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaled $123.2 million at quarter end after paying $4.4 million in dividends for the quarter. during the quarter, we generated $10.7 million in cash from operations. net trade accounts receivable was $103.2 million at quarter end, resulting in dsos of 73 days compared to 70 days in the prior quarter and 69 days at the end of the first quarter of 2020.
the variability in dsos quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year is mainly attributable to the timing of shipments during the quarter, customer mix and sales volumes. net inventories were $122.9 million at the end of the first quarter as compared to $125.5 million at year-end 2020 and $99.5 million at the end of q1 2020. while inventories were down slightly quarter-over-quarter, we continue to carry higher inventory levels in preparation for new product ramp-ups and strategic inventory buffer purchases designed to aid and supply continuity. looking ahead to the next quarter, the continuing effects of the covid-19 pandemic, the ability of component supplies to align with customer demand, the book and ship nature of our business, the timing of revenue associated with large projects, the variability of ordering patterns from the customer base and to which we sell as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates in our international markets may cause material differences between our expectations and the actual results.
keeping that in mind, we expect that our second quarter 2021 revenue will be in the range of $136 million to $146 million. after considering the projected sales mix, we expect that our second quarter gross margin on a non-gaap basis will be in the range of 41% to 43%. we also expect non-gaap operating expenses for the second quarter of 2021 will be about $52 million to $53 million. and finally, we anticipate the consolidated tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 on a non-gaap basis will be in the low to mid-20s percentage rate. we believe the significant factors impacting revenue and earnings realized in 2021 will be component availability, the macro spending environment for carriers and enterprises, the ongoing effects of the covid-19 pandemic, the variability of mix and revenue associated with project rollouts, the proportion of international revenue relative to our total revenue, professional services activity levels, the adoption rate of our broadband access platforms, potential changes in corporate tax laws, currency exchange rate movements and inventory fluctuations in our distribution channels. once again, additional financial information is available at adtran's investor relations webpage at adtran.com/investor.
now i'll turn it back over to tom.
thomas r. stanton -- chief executive officer and chairman of the board
great. thank you, mike. christina, at this point we're ready to open up for any questions people may have.

your first question comes from the line of rod hall with goldman sachs.
bala reddy -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi guys. thanks for taking my question. this is bala on for rod. so to kick it off, i want to touch on the wider revenue guidance, which is not surprising given the supply constraints that everybody in the industry are seeing. but maybe to give further color, are you seeing more constraints on the rgs and onts side of the business or more the access and aggregation part of the business?
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
about both. were -- yes. i mean, i would -- its both. so theres not really a single material product set that we have that doesnt have some constraints. and on -- although sometimes theyre different chips that are causing those constraints, i would say theres really no difference between the two.
bala reddy -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it and on the larger projects, the rfps, et cetera. so you mentioned some lab exits that you expect in the near future, and it looks like some customers are already placing orders. so i just wanted to understand or get some color on how do we expect the second half, and more importantly, this next year would look like apart from the supply constraints with this because --
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. i mean, were expecting good things next year. so the lab exits, so i mentioned weve exited one lab at this point. theyre still doing -- were still going through early field kind of deployments that will pick up through this year. and we expect it to be going at a strong clip next year. but the other two, theyre not far behind. and like i said, one of those two that we dont have lab exits, theyre kind of accelerating order placement, just to make sure theyre in good stead for next year. so i feel very good about those.
bala reddy -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it and one more question, if i may, on the gross margins. so pretty good margins, obviously, despite constraints here. so given the cost inflation that you are seeing and also, on the other hand, increasing fiber portion of the revenues, which i would assume carry higher margins and also tier three, which is growing strong. so how should we think about gross margins as we go through next year or so?
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
let me modify your backdrop just a little bit because i think there are several things that are affecting gross margins. one is, like you said, your strong fiber demand. and the customer base that were selling into, both in europe and in the u.s. and then weve also had some pickup in our software platforms or saas offering, which has got fairly strong gross margins, really strong gross margins. so i think those are all positives to it. and i know that mike will kind of take the backend of that question.
michael foliano -- senior vice president of finance, chief financial officer & corporate secretary
and i think the backend, what weve been seeing, and i think were still on the same plan that were expecting our gross margins to trend toward the mid-40s. like in the past, weve said low to mid-40s, but as we start to transition over to our new products and make additional efficiency changes in our business. were expecting that well, over time, well be able to work our way to the mid-40s.
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
let me just add one other thing on gross margin. its -- who knows exactly when this thing will -- the supply constraints will work themselves out. but we have been seeing in this quarter was no different. weve been seeing material impacts to our gross margins throughout this year. so the fact that theyve held up as well as they had and have actually picked up is actually very good toward us getting to our targets.
michael foliano -- senior vice president of finance, chief financial officer & corporate secretary
and its driven by both expedite costs, price pressures and also freight and logistics costs. its a pretty tight market out there for moving things.
bala reddy -- goldman sachs -- analyst
and last follow-up, whats the impact from these supply constraints, higher logistic costs, et cetera, mike, for the quarter, gross margin impact?
michael foliano -- senior vice president of finance, chief financial officer & corporate secretary
id say it is more than a full point and less than two.
bala reddy -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. very helpful. thanks so much.
operator
your next question comes from the line of george notter with jefferies.
george notter -- jefferies -- analyst
hi guys. thanks very much. did you mention how much revenue impact you are seeing in the quarter? what -- are you unable to ship product? how much might that be? just out of curiosity. and then i have a follow-up.
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. thats a -- if i look at request dates -- if you look at this request dates where people wants the product, it was tens of millions of dollars. i mean, if i look at just like this quarter, i have enough orders right now where people want the product or i wouldnt have to sell another thing and i can take this quarter. so its all about supply. its not about demand.
george notter -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. okay. makes sense and then the tier one progress that youre talking to, i assume were talking about european tier 1s. is that correct?
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
plus we have one here in the u.s. yes. so i guess im not sure which one youre talking about. so we have some that weve already secured that were going through lab exit with, two of those are in europe, one of those who are in the u.s. and we have other ones that were in contract negotiations with. one mso that we talked about where we have finished that contract negotiations. and then two others that are ongoing, ill say, those are in europe.
george notter -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. okay and then the -- i guess im referencing the situations where you guys have left the labs and are in field trials. and then i think you mentioned two other cases where youre starting to get orders, but youre still kind of working through the labs. i guess my question for you is, are those projects being driven by the huawei replacement exercises? are they driven by more organic infrastructure stimulus type of activity? i guess im trying to understand what the motivations are there. and then do these turn into really significant revenue opportunities for the company? or are these situations that will kind of trickle in over time? like how do you think about the potential ramp?
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
okay. so let me just kind of clarify the first part of that. so where we are is weve exited the lab with one of the three that we were talking about, although we have received orders for two of the three, which means lab exit is pretty certain. and lets say, the cases where huawei is entrenched or has been selling, there is a component, and i dont want to speak for the customer, but their carriers are wanting to replace the equipment thats in there. so that is one driver. and thats all through europe. theres not a single major carrier that were talking to because huawei is very well entrenched where they dont have some type of mitigation plan for the equipment thats there. secondarily and in europe, most probably specifically because theyve been very clear about it and certainly in the u.k. and in germany, they have very much accelerated their fiber deployment plans and are expecting to deploy roughly, lets say, $20 million a piece of new homes passed within the next three to four years. so you have both of those things going on. and those numbers, by the way, are very public. i mean theyre -- the companies themselves, the carriers themselves speak about what their targets are.
george notter -- jefferies -- analyst
right. yes. and weve seen those numbers. got it. and then how quickly does that turn into a more significant revenue stream for adtran? is that a 2022 event? is that a 2023 event? like how do you think about materiality to your business?
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
we expect those awards will be impactful next year. definitely going to.
george notter -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. thank you.
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
okay.
operator
your next question comes from the line of michael genovese with west capital park.
michael genovese -- west capital park -- analyst
great. thanks a lot. a few things. i think you said it was in the 40s, maybe 44% total order growth year-over-year for the quarter. and i just wanted more color and context on that. and particularly, did the two tier 1s placing orders, were they a major piece of that? or was it more broad-based?
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
it was way more broad-based than that. it was way more broad-based to that. were just getting kind of initial orders right now for those two. we have forecast that go further, but order placement is just starting with those two. so its much more broad-based than that.
michael genovese -- west capital park -- analyst
and then what about the 44%? i mean, is that -- have you seen that in previous product cycles? i mean, obviously, thats a really strong number. but is that something that when you launch more -- launch new products, in the past youve seen that kind of growth rate or is this something extraordinary?
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
i would say the booking -- you can -- so first of all, yes, its extraordinary. i dont recall ever seeing order growth of that magnitude other than it being maybe one project like telmex could drop in a big order or whatever, thats not the case here. its very much broad. its broader than that. the mitigating thing that you could maybe throw a little water on that as well, are they ordering ahead because of supply chain issues? there is some of that going on. but as i mentioned earlier on in one of the questions, i mean, like backlog for this quarter is incredibly strong. i mean we could literally hit our guidance numbers today. we can beat our guidance numbers today with just the backlog we have right now in place with request dates for this quarter. unfortunately, im not going to ship all of that.
michael genovese -- west capital park -- analyst
okay and then a couple of other things. i mean, i noticed in the quarter that sequential growth, more than a 100% of it was access and aggregation, which was very strong. so it seems like, were you able to get pretty good supply of that product or those products in the quarter? i mean, i havent seen sequential growth like that. it was up double digits year-over-year and up more than 30% sequentially. so it was pretty strong performance. so just more color on that. and then related or somewhat related, my last question on gross margins. i guess i just want to understand more why you did well in the second quarter, even though theres supply constraints and youre being conservative for the third quarter in the outlook? i understand supply constraints are getting worse, but why the upside in the second quarter? and why wouldnt that repeat in the third quarter? thanks.
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
i think in the second quarter, it was -- you have to say mix had an impact on it, that mix being both the product mix as well as target the segment mix. i mean, were just seeing really strong growth out of the tier 3s, both in europe and in the u.s., and that plays a part in that.
michael foliano -- senior vice president of finance, chief financial officer & corporate secretary
and our services business improved.
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. service business improves. but materiality of that was probably -- its mix. its mix is whats driving it. and as far as endpoints, that is 100% supply availability, which from -- once a month can change, right? so i mean, it feels like theres always this big truckload of chips thats supposed to arrive a week after the end of the quarter. and then sometimes they slip those out. so it just -- its all about supply.
michael genovese -- west capital park -- analyst
yes. so last question on that then. does that just imply looking at numbers that just for -- just reasons of the supply chain that there was more availability of access and aggregation this quarter than there was in the in-home --
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes, exactly. yes. its a 100% that. and honestly, i can tell you exactly which chip it was that we got more than we were hoping for and which chip we got less. so yes, its absolutely that. and a lot of times, its down to one specific chip.
michael genovese -- west capital park -- analyst
okay. great. thanks a lot.
operator
your next question comes from the line of paul silverstein with cowen.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
thanks guys. first off, i recognize weve addressed this in previous quarters, but given the very strong growth in your tier 3s, im hoping that tom and mike, you all can update us on what percent of total revenue does now account for? obviously its going up, but can you give us a number?
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
let me see if i have something here that i can give you. im trying to think about the way that we have paraphrased it before. i dont want to particularly broaden ourselves to get ourselves the -- because i think we need to be consistent on the way that we think about it.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
and tom, if it helps, im going to ask you the same question every quarter.
michael foliano -- senior vice president of finance, chief financial officer & corporate secretary
its the majority of the business.
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. thats a good way to say it.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
so tier 3s are now over 50%. and mike, how long have they been over 50%?
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
well, let me make sure we say that. i mean, sometimes tier 2s versus tier 3s, but i think even if we were just to say tier 3s, tier 2s are a little lumpier. but i would say, just if you say tier 3s, my guess would be, were over 50%.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
and tom, is that -- if i look back a quarter ago or two quarters ago, were they meaningfully less than 50%?
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
its -- i think we first started talking about it being 1/3 of the business or over 1/3 of the business is the way we had characterized it before. i know it was continuing to grow at a 30% to 40% clip. so i think, i mean, we, a lot of times, just explicitly lay out the tier two and tier three growth. so i think you could really hone in on that number. but its been growing at a fast clip pretty much every quarter. and if i look back at the tier three business here in the u.s., it has been growing solidly for almost two years now. i mean, solidly by being in the 30% to 40% range.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
okay. tom, i know that its less than 10% of your revenue at present. and i know the announcement was only made this morning, so its hot off the presses. but im hoping you could share with us some initial thoughts on -- given that lumen, i think is one of those three customers that youve already secured that youve been talking about for the past year in terms of incremental business. any thoughts on what the asset sale to apollo will mean? have they given you any heads up, any insight in terms of, does that change your expectations for whatever revenue growth youre expecting from them over the next 12 to 18 months and beyond?
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
no explicit guidance from them. i can just go by historical what has happened. whenever weve seen this happen, i think the last big ones were like verizon some time ago divesting properties. in every single case where weve seen that divestiture happen, weve seen an increased focus on improving their network. sometimes thats regulatory driven. many times thats just market share driven. so my hope would be that we would see actually an increased focus on what it is were doing with them. theres no change in the product approval cycles or anything like that.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
im not surprised with what youre indicating. you havent -- they havent communicated to one way or the other relative to --
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
they havent given us numbers. we are in communication with them, but they havent given us numbers, no.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
last question, if i may. with respect to the european opportunities, historically, youve cited around half a dozen incremental opportunities that had not been awarded, but some of which you were expecting to be awarded around the midpoint this year. i assume the cable mso, european opportunities, one of those six. any insight you can provide regarding the others. and just to be clear, i assume also that the two carriers you referenced that one -- two which are in labs, one of which has placed orders, not withstanding that theyre still in the labs. those are two of the three opportunities youve referenced historically, i.e., the lumen and dt. in dt, i assume, with respect to the other sets, if i have that right, can you give us any incremental insight on where those rfps awards are at?
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. i mentioned one, the mso, which some people count and some people dont. weve finalized contract negotiations with that. and i also mentioned that we are in contract negotiations with two others.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
so those are two of the other six youre in contract negotiations with, one of the six, youve now secured the contract. the other three, is there any visibility as to when those awards would be made?
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
i dont have that at this point, no.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
and tom, with respect to the three you just referenced, are you expecting those to be meaningful in calendar 22 on top of the other three youve been talking about for the last year?
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
i think the cable one, i feel really good about. i think the other two are too early to understand their lab cycle to be able to give you kind of -- sometimes these things take forever. because the cable one, im already through the lab, lets say, 99.9% through the lab, going into the field trial right now. so i feel good about that one because i know the timing. the other two, we have not really entered -- weve done some lab testing, but we havent really gone through the cycle yet. so that would be more difficult to say on those two.
paul silverstein -- cowen -- analyst
all right. i appreciate the response. ill pass it on. thanks tom.
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
okay.

your next question comes from the line of will dezellem with tieton capital.
will dezellem -- tieton capital -- analyst
thank you. id like to dive further into the supply issues that youre dealing with. did you earlier say its specifically ics? and if that is the case, are these specific to, i guess, are the asics of yours? or are they more general commoditized products?
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
it is, by far, predominantly ics, i would say everything other than ics, is manageable in like normal course. every once a while you run into something thats kind of strange, but not that often. i mean, we ran into problems with resin that was used in plastics to make our housings, for some reason, there was a run on that for a while. but you run into those. thats typical. so its predominantly ics. i mean we would not have an issue if it wasnt ic issues. and as far as the type of ic, it is now down to the most benign component level ic that you can think of. its everything.
will dezellem -- tieton capital -- analyst
great. thank you for that perspective. and do you have a time frame that you are hearing or that your insights would say that these issues ought to loosen by a certain time?
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
no. in that regard, im kind of held to the same kind of knowledge that you have because its really more about fab capacity than it is the chip supplier themselves. we do know that fab capacity is coming online. we are mapping fab capacity by process. the size of the process itself and where that capacity is coming in line or online so that we can do a couple of things. one, better steer, well see some relief. if well see relief and if everybody just builds, i dont know what the processing the sven-nanometer, really, really super high-end chips, and that doesnt solve some of these general component issues. so its harder to forecast when you get down to the actual type of chip that were talking about. but we do have the ability over time to steer our designs as well to some of these areas where we think capacity will come more online, and thats what were trying to do now. weve redesigned several products already in order to keep customers happy, and were going to continue to do that. but i dont have a real endpoint.
will dezellem -- tieton capital -- analyst
great. thank you and good luck with the process.
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of tim savageaux with northland capital management.
tim savageaux -- northland capital management -- analyst
hi. good morning
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
morning.
tim savageaux -- northland capital management -- analyst
capital markets, we havent changed our business model. a couple of things. tom, you mentioned tier 2s. and it seems like new financial backers and coming out of bankruptcy, the investment there, generally, at least among a couple of them, is starting to pick up. are you seeing that? is that becoming -- was that a material contributor in addition to tier three strength in the quarter and the outlook? or is that maybe still in front of us?
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
i would say, im expecting more like next year than this year, but i would also say that this year, was good. it was actually -- and we did see that pick up. its just a little lumpier. where in the tier 3s, its just like every quarter youll see just more variability in the tier 2s in this because theres less of them, very project oriented, and its just -- its just not as consistent, but theres no doubt theyve gotten stronger over the last year. and theyre talking about kind of material deployments going forward. so i would expect that to be an area of strength.
tim savageaux -- northland capital management -- analyst
right and then you mentioned at least some initial orders in the tier one side. is that a meaningful part of your q3 guidance at all, some of these new tier one engagements?
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
no, no. no, its not -- i mean, its only because that theres just, here again, well, on that case, it is just now starting to ramp up. i dont expect that to be material. maybe at the end, its all going to be about supply constraints at the end of the year.
tim savageaux -- northland capital management -- analyst
yes, understood on supply. thats actually where i was headed. the follow-up piece of that question was going to be, could we be seeing a scenario where some combination of continued rural broadband strength and initial tier one deployments serve to offset your normal q4 seasonality?
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
its all about supply. i have no doubt that the order flow would allow us to do that, which is all going to be what we can ship.
tim savageaux -- northland capital management -- analyst
great and last question for me. you mentioned the bookings up over 40% year-over-year with revenues up 11%. and i dont know if those type of -- we should look at those two and try and back into a book-to-bill metric or you might want to share one with us?
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
its -- actually i dont have the book-to-bill in front me anyway, so that makes it a little bit easier. but it has been constantly above one, the entire year.
tim savageaux -- northland capital management -- analyst
okay. thanks very much.
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
all right. with that, id like to end the call. so thank you very much for joining us, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to adtrans second quarter earnings release conference call. [operator instructions] during the course of the conference call, adtran representatives expect to make forward-looking statements, which reflect managements best judgment based on factors currently known. however, these statements include risks and uncertainties, including the continued spread and extent of the impact of covid-19 global pandemic, the successful development and market acceptance of our products, competition in the market for such products, the product and channel mix, component costs, manufacturing efficiencies or other risks detailed in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ending december 31, 2020. these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, which may be made during the call. it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to tom stanton, chief executive officer of adtran. sir, please go ahead.
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
thank you, demetrius. good morning, everyone. we appreciate you joining us for our second quarter 2021 conference call. with me today is adtrans cfo, mike foliano. following my opening remarks, mike will review the quarterly financial performance in detail, and then we will take any questions that you may have. we continued the momentum that weve seen over the past year with another strong quarter in q2. although total revenue in the quarter was materially constrained by supply chain constraints, we grew revenue 11% year-over-year and increased non-gaap eps by $0.12 year-over-year to $0.16 per share. our success continues to be led by strong demand for our fiber-based broadband solutions across regional service providers in the u.s. and europe, driving 66% year-over-year growth in our fiber access platforms. reinforcing the growth phase we are in, we increased our product bookings by 43% year-over-year.
the success that we have had in the quarter was against a backdrop of growing investments in fiber access connectivity. in the u.s. market, there is a bipartisan support for a proposed infrastructure bill that includes $65 billion in funding for high-speed broadband connectivity. in addition to this federal funding, there are increasing commitments from state level funding to improve broadband connectivity to underserved households. similar initiatives are moving forward in the u.k. and the eu to provide universal coverage for high speed broadband. a recent article cited pledges of over $30 billion to be spent in building out fiber access infrastructure in the u.k. alone over the next five years. as for the market activity, we continue to see increased vendor selection initiatives in our key growth areas of 10-gig fiber access and cloud-managed wifi six as operators look to modernize their networks, diversify their supply base and transition away from high-risk vendors.
given our strong presence in key growth markets, particularly in the u.s. and europe, we remain well positioned to take advantage of this major investment cycle that is still in the early growth phases. taking a closer look at our key investments in fiber access and software, you will see several highlights that reinforce our optimistic view of our positioning in these markets. we added 33 service provider customers in q2. and as of the end of q2, we have over 100 of our fiber to the prem customers deploying our latest 10-gig fiber solutions just in the last past year. this has been one of the most successful product launches in our company history. on the software side, our customer base for saas applications increased 57% year-over-year, while revenue increased 46% year-over-year. we also secured our first tier one service provider deploying our managed wifi saas offering. the saas segment of our business is poised for substantial growth as we scale the number of subscribers under multiyear saas agreements.
as we look at the q2 financials, revenue for the quarter was $143.2 million and with 43.8% gross margin. network solutions accounted for 88% of total revenue at $125.4 million, while global services contributed $17.8 million. we had 10 3% customers during the quarter, two distribution partners and one european tier one service provider. as noted in previous quarters, these distribution partners serve hundreds of regional service providers in the u.s. market with a mix of broadband access, connected home and enterprise solutions. this continues to reinforce the success we are having in both customer and portfolio diversification. much like the past few quarters, the growth that we saw in q2 was led by our success with regional broadband operators in both the u.s. and europe. in the u.s. market, revenue from tier three operators was up a combined 51% year-over-year, while european regional operators were up a combined 91% year-over-year.
for the previously announced tier one fiber access projects, we remain on track and have a lab exit from one of these and expect exit for the other two in the near future. two of these have already begun to place orders with us for deliveries later on this year and next year. in addition to these previously announced awards, weve achieved lab certification from our latest fiber access platform with a tier one mso on our contract negotiation with multiple tier one fiber operators. inventory levels remain higher than normal due to the increased lead times resulting from the global chip shortage and covid related logistics issues. we continue to see component lead times being extended and becoming more unpredictable. we expect that this will continue into next year, and we are taking the necessary steps to mitigate these challenges to the best of our ability. but supply chain issue constraints do present risk to revenue and gross margins over the near term. from an organizational perspective, we continue to maintain a disciplined approach to operational expenses as we secure additional tier one customer wins, we expect to see targeted increases in those operating expenses.
looking ahead, we expect to continue to see growth in our core areas of fiber access platforms, and home service delivery platforms and software. our fiber access platforms -- for fiber access platforms, we are gearing up for a ramp in tier one business in the upcoming quarters in addition to the continued growth we are seeing in fiber deployment from regional service providers. for in-home service delivery platforms, bookings for our cloud-managed gateways are at an all-time high, and we are working through supply chain constraints to fulfill the demand. on the software side, we -- our enhanced saas platform, mosaic one, with a set of tools, we have increased -- enhanced our saas platform with a set of tools to automate and improve marketing operations and customer care for broadband service providers.
continuing our investment in these high-growth segments of our portfolio, coupled with the success we are having in new customer adoption has us well positioned for additional success throughout the year and will enable us to continue to meet our customer and portfolio diversification objectives. finally, i want to thank all of our employees for their continued flexibility and resilience as we navigate the challenges of covid-19. their ability to continue to execute while being faced with these ongoing challenges have allowed us to continually meet the needs of our customers. with that background, mike will now provide a review of our financials. and following his remarks, we will open the call up for questions. mike?
michael foliano -- senior vice president of finance, chief financial officer & corporate secretary
thanks, tom, and good morning to all. ill review our second quarter results and provide our expectations for the third quarter of 2021. ill be referencing both gaap and non-gaap results with reconciliations presented in our press release and supplemental financial schedules on our investor relations web page at investors.adtran.com. the supplemental financial schedules on our web page also present certain revenue information by segment and category, which i will be discussing today. adtrans second quarter 2021 revenue came in at $143.2 million compared to $127.5 million in the prior quarter and $128.7 million for the second quarter of 2020. subdividing this across our operating segments, our network solutions revenue for the second quarter was $125.4 million versus $113.8 million reported for q1 of 2021 and $111.3 million in q2 of 2020. our services and support revenue in q2 was $17.8 million compared to $13.7 million reported for the first quarter of 2021 and $17.4 million in the second quarter of 2020.
across our revenue categories, access and aggregation revenue for the second quarter of 2021 was $91 million compared to $69.1 million in the prior quarter and $82.8 million in quarter two of 2020. revenue for our subscriber solutions and experience category was $47.8 million for the quarter versus $54.6 million in quarter one of 2021 and $40.4 million for quarter two of 2020. traditional and other products revenue for the quarter was $4.5 million compared to $3.9 million in q1 and $5.5 million for quarter two of 2020. looking at our revenues geographically. u.s. revenue for q2 2021 was $94.7 million versus $86.5 million reported in q1 and $84.5 million in q2 of 2020. our international revenue for q2 of 2021 was $48.6 million compared to $41 million for the prior quarter and $44.3 million in quarter two of 2020. in the second quarter, we had three 10% of revenue customers, two were domestic and one was international. our gaap gross margin for the second quarter was at 43.8% as compared to 42% in the prior quarter and 41.5% in the second quarter of 2020. non-gaap gross margin for the quarter was 43.8%, which compares to 42.1% in the prior quarter and 41.6% in the second quarter of 2020.
the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year improvement in both gaap and non-gaap gross margins were attributable to an international product and customer mix as well as improvement in our services gross margin. during the quarter, we continued to experience extreme constraints in the electronic component market, which worsened during q2. we expect this to continue to tighten further during q3 and for the remainder of the year, potentially affecting product availability and component and logistics costs. total operating expenses on a gaap basis were $58.7 million for q2 of 2021 compared to $54.9 million reported in the prior quarter and $59.5 million for q2 of 2020. the quarter-over-quarter increase was a result of market-driven increases in our deferred compensation plans and higher professional services costs. the year-over-year decrease in operating expenses was a result of lower market-driven gains in our deferred comp plans, reduced restructuring charges and reduced legal-related expenses, partially offset by higher professional services costs.
on a non-gaap basis, our second quarter operating expenses were $52.7 million compared to $51.4 million in the prior quarter and $52.3 million in q2 of 2020. the increase quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year in non-gaap operating expenses were primarily due to increases in contract services costs partially offset by decreases in legal expenses. operating income on a gaap basis for the second quarter of 2021 was $3.9 million compared to an operating loss of $1.3 million in the prior quarter and a loss of $6 million reported in q2 of 2020. non-gaap operating income for quarter two of 2021 was $10.1 million compared to $2.4 million in the prior quarter and $1.3 million in q2 of 2020. the quarter-over-quarter improvement in profitability on a gaap basis was attributable to increased sales volume and a more favorable gross margin mix, partially offset by higher operating expenses. the year-over-year increase in gaap operating profitability was driven by increased sales volumes, stronger gross margins and lower operating expenses.
the non-gaap quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in operating income were driven by increased sales volume and improving gross margins. other income on a gaap basis for the second quarter of 2021 was $2.3 million compared to other income of $3.3 million in the prior quarter and $8.4 million for q2 of 2020. our non-gaap other income for the quarter was $1.1 million compared to non-gaap other income of $3.3 million in q1 of 2021 and $5.7 million for quarter two of 2020. the quarter-over-quarter decreases in both the gaap and non-gaap other income were related to realized foreign currency exchange fluctuations, offset by favorable market-driven fair value changes in our investment portfolio. the decreases in both the gaap and non-gaap other income on a year-over-year basis were related to lower gains in the market-driven fair value of our investment portfolio, offset by lower realized foreign currency exchange losses.
the companys tax provision for the second quarter of 2021 was an expense of $1.1 million, as compared to $1 million in the prior quarter and $1.6 million in the second quarter of 2020. the current quarters tax expense was primarily driven from profits in our international operations as the deferred tax expense generated by our domestic operations continue to be offset by additional changes in the valuation allowance. gaap net income for quarter two of 2021 was $5.1 million compared to $900,000 in the prior quarter and $800,000 for the second quarter of 2020. non-gaap net income for the second quarter was $8.1 million as compared to $6.3 million in the prior quarter and $1.6 million in quarter two of 2020. for the quarter that just ended, earnings per share, assuming dilution on a gaap basis were $0.10 per share as compared to $0.02 per share in both the prior quarter and in the second quarter of 2020. non-gaap earnings per share, assuming dilution for the second quarter of 2021 was $0.16 compared to $0.13 per share in the prior quarter and $0.03 per share in q2 of 2020. on the balance sheet, unrestricted cash and marketable securities totals $128.2 million at quarter end after paying $4.4 million in dividends during the quarter. for the quarter, we generated $7.5 million of cash from operations. net trade accounts receivable was $122.7 million at quarter end, resulting in dsos of 78 days compared to 73 days in the prior quarter and 67 days at the end of the second quarter of 2020.
the variability in dsos quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year is mainly attributable to timing of shipments during the quarter, customer mix of those orders and sales volumes. net inventories were $119 million at the end of the second quarter compared to $122.9 million in the first quarter of this year and $106.1 million at the end of second quarter 2020. while our inventories were down quarter-over-quarter, we continue to carry higher inventory levels in preparation from new product ramp-ups and strategic buffer inventory purchases that are designed to assist us with supply continuity in the currently challenging electronic component market. looking ahead to the next quarter, the continuing effects of the covid-19 pandemic, the ability of component supplies to align with customer demand, the book and ship nature of our business, the timing of revenue associated with large projects, the variability of order patterns from which the customer base and to which we sell as well as the fluctuation in currency exchange rates in our international markets may cause material differences between our expectations and the actual results.
with that in mind, we expect our third quarter 2021 revenue will be in the range of $138 million to $158 million. note that this wider than usual range better reflects both the strength were seeing in demand and the current issues with the component supply. after considering the projected sales mix, we expect that our third quarter gross margin on a non-gaap basis will be in the range of 41% to 43%. we also expect non-gaap operating expenses for the third quarter of 2021 will be between $53 million and $54 million. and finally, we anticipate the consolidated tax rate for the third quarter on a non-gaap basis will be at a low to mid-20s percentage rate.
we believe the significant factors impacting revenue and earnings realized in 2021 will be component availability and costs, a macro spending environment for carriers and enterprises, the ongoing effects of the covid-19 pandemic, the variability of mix and revenue associated with project rollouts, the proportion of international revenue relative to our total revenue, professional services activity levels, both domestically and internationally, the adoption rate of our broadband access platforms, potential changes in corporate tax laws, currency exchange rate movements and inventory fluctuations in our distribution channels. once again, additional financial information is available at adtrans investor relations web page at investors.adtran.com. now ill turn it back over to tom, and we will take your questions.
thomas r. stanton -- chairman & chief executive officer
all right. thanks, mike. demetrius, at this point, were ready to open it up for any questions people may have.
