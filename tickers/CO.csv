zheng ting, tina -- chairperson, chief executive officer, director, and chief executive officer of beijing division
good morning, ladies and gentlemen. welcome to global cord blood corporation's fiscal 2020 fourth quarter earnings conference call. during the quarter, from january to march 2020, the group faced tremendous challenges as efforts to contain and control the covid-19 outbreak stalled the economy and the consumer market languished.
despite the extremely difficult environment, the management team managed to achieve the company's fiscal 2020 new subscriber target. in the reporting quarter, we recruited 18,488 new subscribers, down by 17% year-over-year and 21% quarter-over-quarter. for fiscal 2020, we acquired 84,241 new subscribers in total. by march 31, 2020, our accumulated subscribers has reached 833,094.
data from china's national bureau of statistics show that newborn numbers in china and the group's operating markets continued to trend downwards in 2019. despite a flatter downward slope, judging by the general direction in the past three years and our first-hand observations from the field, we anticipated that the newborn pool in fiscal 2021 will continue to shrink.
although cross-province migration continued to be population drivers in guangdong and zhejiang, the immediate benefits to our business is limited. moreover, our covid-19 countermeasures have resulted in additional upward pressure to our operating costs, though we continue to strive to curtain such impact.
in the meantime, the pandemic continues to erode the already weak consumer sentiment, further discouraging consumers' discretionary spending and may possibly delay some of our potential clients' pregnancy plans. therefore, management expects that the group's total new subscribers for fiscal 2021 would drop to between 60,000 and 65,000.
furthermore, as china's national health commission has not yet provided any guidelines to its policies, regulatory uncertainties in the cord blood banking industry in china remains. we will need to be mindful of such uncertainty and continue to proactively make ourselves ready for changes in the market.
facing a rather complicated operational and regulatory environment, we need to be prepared to constantly adjust our sales and marketing resources in order to mitigate the impacts from fewer expected newborns, slower economic growth, more cautious consumer sentiments and the continued impacts of the covid-19 pandemic.
in addition to focusing on achieving our fiscal 2021 targets, the management team continues to evaluate opportunities that possess the best shared synergies with the group's existing resources and core competencies in order to ensure the company's sustainable developments over the long run.
this concludes my remarks. and thank you again for your support of gcbc.
i will now turn the call over to our cfo, mr. albert chen to go over the highlights of our fourth quarter financial performance.
chen bing chuen, albert -- chief financial officer and director
good morning, everyone. thank you for joining our call today. in the fourth quarter, revenues increased by 19% year-over-year to approximately rmb300 million, which was mainly driven by the adoption of a new processing fee since april 2019 and the expansion of the accumulated subscriber base.
during the reporting quarter, the covid-19 pandemic continued to affect the company's operations. although the business environment remained tough, we still managed to recruit 18,488 new subscribers, finishing the year at the high end of our target range.
as a result of the new processing fee, processing and other services revenues increased by 23% year-over-year to rmb183 million, which accounted for 61% of total revenues.
as our accumulated subscriber base increased to more than 833,000 as of march 31, 2020, fourth quarter storage revenues increased by 13% year-over-year to approximately rmb117 million. storage revenues accounted for 39% of total revenues compared to 41% in the same period of last year.
fourth quarter gross profit increased by nearly 26% year-over-year to rmb256 million. gross margin expanded to nearly 86% compared to 81% of last year period, thanks to the boosting effect from the new processing fee.
as a result of improved gross profit as well as the application of multiple cost saving measures, operating income in the reporting quarter increased by 68% year-over-year to rmb149 million. operating margin increased to nearly 50%.
depreciation and amortization expenses were approximately rmb12 million. non-gaap operating income increased by 59% year-over-year to rmb162 million. non-gaap operating margin increased by 13 percentage points to nearly 54%.
during the fourth quarter, sales and marketing expenses decreased by 10% year-over-year and 20% quarter-over-quarter to less than rmb61 million. as the covid-19 pandemic evolved, client recruitment remained challenging, which led to a decrease in staff and performance-related costs. at the same time, we imposed a massive cutback in our marketing and promotional activities and non-essential marketing and promotional activities were either suspended or delayed.
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues dropped to 20% in the reporting quarter, an abnormal low from 27% in the prior year period.
general and administrative expenses decreased to rmb43 million from nearly rmb44 million in the prior year period and rmb48 million in the prior quarter. the reduction was mainly driven by reductions in provisions and stock-related expenses.
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 14% from 17% in the prior year period and remained the same as in the previous quarter.
in the reporting quarter, the company recognized a decrease in fair value of equity securities or mark-to-market losses of rmb24 million, compared to a mark-to-market gain of approximately rmb12 million in the prior year period.
as a result of the increase in operating income, which was partially offset by a decrease in fair value of equity securities and an increase in income tax expense, net income attributable to the company's shareholders increased by 7% year-over-year to rmb97 million. net margin for the reporting quarter was 32%. basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share improved to rmb0.80.
these are the highlights of our fourth quarter results. we are now happy to take any questions from the floor.
cathy bai -- vice president of corporate finance
hello, tai. i think we could move on to the question-and-answer session now.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question is from cyrille pichot from altimeo asset management. you may begin your question, sir.
cyrille pichot -- altimeo asset management -- analyst
yes, hello. thank you for taking my question. it's cyrille pichot from altimeo asset management. hello albert. hello cathy. do you hear me? yes?
chen bing chuen, albert -- chief financial officer and director
yes.
cathy bai -- vice president of corporate finance
hi, pichot.
cyrille pichot -- altimeo asset management -- analyst
okay. yes, hello.
chen bing chuen, albert -- chief financial officer and director
your line quality is excellent.
cyrille pichot -- altimeo asset management -- analyst
okay. yes, just -- i have just few questions very quick, just about the tax rates. can you just elaborate a little bit why it's higher than in the previous quarters? and do we have to consider that this is -- i mean, in the coming quarters, what will be the tax rate?
second question is just about the -- can you comment a little bit about the trend of your business, i mean in the last two months? i mean, are you seeing an improvement based on the improving situation with the covid-19 within hospitals?
and last question is, has the board thought about alternative listing place because of the situation for chinese companies listed in the u.s. and all the trend of the chinese company going to list in hong kong, especially? thank you.
chen bing chuen, albert -- chief financial officer and director
thank you. i will answer your questions one at a time. in terms of the income tax expense, as we highlighted in our earnings release, the income tax expense for this quarter was approximately rmb34 million roughly. and it's slightly higher than normal, because -- partly because of the upstream dividend that we received from the onshore subsidiary, which resulted in an additional, roughly rmb4.5 million additional income tax expenses. stripping that out, that will put the company's effective tax rate at the lower bracket.
the company -- because several of our subsidiaries are still enjoying what we call the high and new technology enterprise tax incentive, so the onshore subsidiary's tax rate is 15%. but if you look at our prior disclosure, our prior quarterly earnings, you will realize that on a group basis, after taking into account offshore subsidiaries and offshore expenses, which are not tax deductible under the prc tax law, normally it's at the high-end of the -- between the 15% to 20% range.
so, what we consider to be a normal effective tax rate in our case on a group basis will be probably at the 15% to 20% range. and, but that said, the fourth quarter of last year is slightly higher than normal, that's largely because of the additional withholding tax that we have paid. but if you strip out that rmb4.5 million, the numbers kind of brings you back to the normalized tax rate. so, that is the questions with respect to the income tax expense.
the second question is regarding the latest business trends that we are experiencing. if i recall correctly, when we published our press release, i think early this year pre -- suggesting a potential target range for fiscal year 2021, which will be between 60,000 to 65,000, we also mentioned that the situation was dire, and we are kind of heading toward the low end of the range.
i think, based on what we have seen in the past couple of weeks, before the second wave hit in beijing, i am sure that many of you are aware that there are also another round of infection that's going on in beijing regions as a result that there is a mini lockdown going on. prior to that event, i think the overall business trend is definitely trending up. we have seen some positive feedback and also some positive development on the hospital side.
so, instead of heading toward the low end of the range, i think we are kind of comfortable, such as that now we look like we're heading toward the mid-range of our full year target range.
so, i think this is definitely a positive development, but it all depends on how the covid-19 pandemic evolves and i'm definitely hope that there won't be any more lockdown from this point onwards. and i also obviously hope that the world will come out from this and be a better place.
so, that's my comment on the latest business trend. as for the company, right now we have explored the potential listing venues as a result of the latest u.s. regulatory developments. we are also -- we are still monitoring the situations, because, right now we -- i think the regulatory bodies in u.s. have not issued any definitive policies with respect to how u.s. listed foreign issuer will be treated, because of the pa -- pcaob inspection issue.
we are monitoring the development on that front and also looking at potential alternatives, as well. but no definitive answer at this stage, but we are also, as you rightfully pointed out, we are also aware that several u.s. listed issuers is seeking a second listing at hong kong. so, it will be interesting to see how that goes.
operator
thank you. moving on to next question. we have sandy mehta from evaluate research. you may begin your question.
sandy mehta -- evaluate research -- analyst
yes. congratulations on a strong fourth quarter and the full year results. i have two questions. one is, the new policy announced by china of 18 pilot free zones, could you comment on the status of that and the timeline and rollout of that policy and what benefit there could be to your company?
and my second question which is, your margins have been very strong. you talked about strong cost controls in terms of sales and marketing, sg&a expense. what is the outlook for those expenses and the margins for this new year? thank you.
chen bing chuen, albert -- chief financial officer and director
thank you for the questions. maybe i'll answer your second question first, which is regarding the margin trend. as we discussed during the earnings call, in light of the lockdown, which took place in the first quarter of this year or mainly between january and march, we have proactively, basically stopped and put a lot of promotional activities on hold.
looking back at the company's historical track record, our sales and marketing expenses tend to range bound between 20% to 25%, which in our view supposed to be -- which in our view is considered to be a normal range.
and the fourth quarter fiscal 2020 sales and marketing expenses, is definitely at the low end. and we -- and that's because we put in a lot of effort to make sure that happens.
but going forward, i think a fair assumption is that, assuming business going back to normal, a fair sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue should range bound between, i will say, 22%, probably 22% to 26% roughly. so, that's our view with respect to the cost and our own sales and marketing expenses.
general and administrative expenses is a little bit tricky because most of the costs are not variable costs, and a lot of those costs are actually fixed costs. so, we have to put in more effort to actually contain that cost. and believe me or not, actually one of the key drivers that have been pushing up the general and administrative expenses has been labor costs.
and the same go with the direct cost component, as well. so, we are keeping a close eye on that. but general and administrative expenses technically issued -- we are trying our very best to try to maintain the quantum with respect to the general and administrative expenses. but, again, fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, g&a is -- we will push the envelope, so it's definitely on the low end as well.
in terms of the direct cost itself, primary reason for the gross margin expansion, as i explained earlier, is because of the introduction of a new processing fee, as we revised our processing fee from rmb6,800 to rmb9,800.
but direct itself, we are facing some level of upward pressure. i mean, as you can imagine, mainly on the raw material side and the labor cost side. so, that is something that we try to contain as well.
but as you are aware, i mean, our gross margin is reasonably lucrative. so, i think we there are in that buffer at least on the direct cost side to absorb some of the upward cost pressure.
with respect to your questions on the policy itself, instead of answering your question with respect to the policy of the 15 free-trade zones, i want to address your question to the overall policy environment.
as you are aware, corporate banking in china is heavily regulated and is a one license per region in the past, until they introduced the free-trade zone policy. and the one license per region policy is meant to expire at the end of this year.
this -- in order to better understand the situation, we have been constantly reaching out to the development authorities to try to indicate or try to get a sense as to where the policy is heading. unfortunately, because of the covid-19 pandemic, it's definitely expected or i think, it definitely creates a lot of distractions from the regulatory authority's point of view.
so, to answer your question in short, right now we don't have a clear indication as to whether or not there will be more opening up or whether the policy will stay status quo or there would be any potential changes.
so, we don't have a clear indication from the authority as of this point. but we will continue to monitor the situation and we'll continue to reach out to the authorities and try to better understand the situation. but, fair to say that i think the pandemic has really created a lot of distraction in terms of government attention.

thank you, greg. good morning, everyone. welcome to our fiscal 2022 first quarter earnings conference call. a press release discussing our financial results has already been published and a copy is available on our company's website. during the call, our management team will summarize corporate developments and financial highlights for the quarter. a question-and-answer session will follow.

today on behalf of our ceo, tina, i will read her prepared remarks. let's begin our presentation.
zheng ting, tina -- chairperson, chief executive officer, director, and chief executive officer of beijing division
good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call. during the reporting quarter, the group managed to recruit 19,673 new subscribers, up by 14.2% year-over-year as a result of the relative to the low base in the previous year and up by 1.6% quarter-over-quarter, in line with management's expectations.
at the end of june 2021, our accumulated subscriber base had surpassed 920,000. as a result of the effective control measures implemented in china, the impact of covid-19 among chinese consumers has gradually alleviated as our potential clients became less concerned about hospital admissions for child birth, the pandemic impact on our business gradually decreased. despite this progress, we remain cautious about the general business environment as overall new born numbers remain on a downward trend. certain hospitals continue to maintain strict access policies compared to pre-pandemic and occasional outbreaks in china still trigger localized lockdown as economic activities resume.
overall, concerns about the cord blood banking licensing regime and biosecurity laws have yet to subside and the management team continues to pay close attention to new developments related to such policies as well as any potential industrywide implications. we will not rule out the possibility that further details on government policy implementations will be announced from time-to-time. as such, the company will remain vigilant and be prepared to respond to any shift in the competitive industry landscape.
meanwhile, due to the lack of women of childbearing age and the persistence of high cost to raise [phonetic] child. the three child policy stimulus has yet to create a notable boost in the newborn numbers in our operating markets. despite this, it is worth mentioning that a top government decision recently published on july 20th, discusses a target plan to reduce the cost of raising children and increase fertility rate by 2025. in light of this, we will closely monitor future announcements and the impact of supportive policies and measures to follow. with this in mind, the management team has determined the fiscal 2022 new subscriber target is expected to remain in the range of 72,000 to 75,000.
as a result of regulatory and market uncertainties, the management team actively communicates with relevant regulation agencies, while continuing to evaluate alternative scenarios. we will carry on our efforts to expand our marketing and sales channels and pursue both on and offshore business development opportunities. we will continue to execute upon our goals through enhanced customer viscosity, foster new business growth and income sources, and improve the group's overall risk resistance capacity. this concludes my remarks regarding our fiscal 2022 first quarter results. thank you for your ongoing support of global cord blood corporation.
now, i will turn the call over to our cfo, mr. albert chen, who will discuss our first quarter financial performance. mr. chen, please go ahead.
chen bing chuen, albert -- chief financial officer and director
good morning, everyone. thank you for joining our call today. in the first quarter, revenues increased by 12% year-over-year to approximately rmb315 million, mainly driven by the increase in processing fee revenues. during the reporting quarter, the group recruited over 19,600 new subscribers, representing an increase of 14% year-over-year due to the relatively low comparable base in the first quarter of last year coupled with gradually improved consumer sentiment as various covid-19 containment measures started to take effect. as a result, revenue generated from processing fees and other services increased by 14% year-over-year to approximately rmb185 million, which accounted for 59% of total revenues. by the end of june 2021, our accumulated subscriber base expanded to over 920,000. accordingly, storage fee revenues for the first quarter increased by 9% year-over-year to rmb130 million.
gross profit in the first quarter increased by approximately 13% to rmb267 million, and gross margin improved by 30 basis points from last year period to approximately 85%. operating income for the first quarter increased by 17% year-over-year to rmb157 million, and operating margin improved to approximately 50% from 48% of last year because sg&a expenses only increased slightly. depreciation and amortization expenses for the reporting quarter were approximately rmb12 million. non-gaap operating income increased by approximately 16% year-over-year to rmb169 million, and non-gaap operating margin improved by 1 percentage point year-over-year to 53%.
sales and marketing expenses in the first quarter increased by 8% year-over-year to rmb59 million, mainly due to an increase in sales incentives as we carefully redeployed sales and marketing resources during the consumer sentiment recovery rephase, while facing occasional localized lockdown due to various covid-19 clusters. sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 19% from 20% in the prior year period. general and administrative expenses increased by 4% year-over-year to approximately rmb46 million, mainly due to increases in accounts receivable provisions and professional fees, but was partially offset by decrease in overhead spending. general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 15% in the reporting quarter.
in the first quarter, we recognized an approximately rmb5.6 million increase in fair value of equity securities or mark-to-market gain compared to over rmb18 million in mark-to-market gain in last year. in the reporting quarter, we also recorded approximately rmb1 million in dividend income from equity investments compared to no such income in the prior year period as a result of the increases in operating income and dividend income, partially offset by the decrease in mark-to-market gains. income before income tax for the first quarter increased by 7% year-over-year to rmb172 million.
net income attributable to the company's shareholders increased by 3% year-over-year to rmb136 million. basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share for the reporting quarter increased by approximately 3% to rmb1.12. these are the highlights of our first quarter financial results. we are happy to turn to the floor for any questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] and we have one question from mr. bill jones. sir, please begin.
bill jones -- analyst
hello, thank you for taking my questions. can you provide a breakdown of your new subscribers? also what was the payment breakdown of your respective services? thank you.
chen bing chuen, albert -- chief financial officer and director
thank you for the questions. in terms of -- in terms of new subscriber breakdown by geographical regions, approximately two thirds, like 67% of our new subscribers are derived from the guangdong province, approximately 20% of our new subscribers derived from the zhejiang province, and the rest came from the beijing municipality area.
in terms of payment option breakdown, approximately 30% of our new subscribers elect the normal payment option, approximately 42% new subscribers elect the upfront payment option, and the remaining balance are people electing the instalment payment options, which varies from three years to 10 years.
operator
okay. we don't have any more question for the moment. [operator instructions] we have a new question from [indecipherable] please go ahead.
unidentified participant
hi, thanks for taking my call. what would you say is your excess cash balance that you have available for either acquisitions or returning cash to shareholders and how do you think about those two options?
chen bing chuen, albert -- chief financial officer and director
the capital on hand as you are aware is in excess of rmb6 billion and half of which or close to half of which is the result of people electing to pay the upfront payment option, which result in deferred revenue. fair to say that the company right now is in a relatively strong financial position to potentially withstand any potential regulatory changes in the cord blood banking industry in china as well as the our ability to potentially pick on additional acquisition or diversification projects. so this is probably the best way to put it.
but as you are aware, the company is taking on a relatively prudent approach lately, especially taking into considerations of various changes in the regulatory environment. i trust that many of you are aware that there are many new regulations coming out from the authorities in the prc, which governs from how consumers behave, encouraging more birth, and also maybe reducing children reliance on mobile games. so lately, one of the policy which we highlighted in our 20-f as well as the introduction of the biosecurity law as well as the leases, couple of banking licensing policy as well. so as mentioned in our ceo remarks, we are living in a very interesting time right now. so it is possible that we -- it is possible that more regulations with respect to cord blood banking or healthcare industry as a whole may come out from time to time. so we are also carefully evaluating our options as we speak. i guess, right now, because of all the new regulations coming into play, it is better to take a more prudent approach when evaluating our options.
thank you. [operator instructions] it seems that there is no further question. at this point, i will turn the call back to madam, cathy bai. please go ahead.

good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call. during the reporting quarter, the group managed to recruit 19,066 new subscribers, up 8% year-over-year as a result of the relatively low base in the previous year period and down 3% quarter-over-quarter, in line with management's expectation.
at the end of september 2021, our accumulated subscriber base surpassed 938,000. during the second quarter, although business environment continue to improve long-standing challenges remained. as a result of the effective covid-19 pandemic control measures implemented in our operating markets, potential clients were less concerned about hospital admissions for child birth and pandemic impact on our business were gradually alleviated.
however, as economic activities resumed, occasional local outbreaks forced certain hospitals to maintain strict access policies. thereby, still hindering our sales activities in hospital channels. in addition, the overall number of women of childbearing age and newborns continue to decline. given its intractable nature, we do not expect this demographic trend to reverse in the near future. compared to the previous quarter, there have not been many observable industry-related policies or changes that affected the group's business in the second quarter.
regarding the three child policy, various regulatory bodies in china rolled out series to our follow up rules and measures aimed at reducing the cost of childbearing and raising children. such as expansion of child care services, rectification of off-campus education and training, and curbing of health crisis in select school districts among others. despite these efforts, current contributions of a family's third child have yet to make a substantially notable difference to the group's new subscribers.
as discussed last quarter, concerns over cord blood banking licensing regulations and biosecurity laws have yet to subside. the management team continues to closely monitor any new development related to these policies and potential industrywide implications that may be announced.
with this in mind, the management team maintains the guideline for the fiscal 2022 new subscriber target, which is expected to fall within the range of 72,000 to 75,000. facing regulatory and market uncertainties, the management team will continue to focus on the company's long-term development, maintain active communication with the relevant regulatory agencies, expand marketing and sales channels and carry out extensive work as we dive deep into new business development opportunities.
this concludes my remarks regarding our fiscal 2022 second quarter results. thank you for your ongoing support of global cord blood corporation.
now, i will turn the call over to our cfo, mr. albert chen, to discuss our second fiscal quarter financial performance. mr. chen. please go ahead.
chen bing chuen, albert -- chief financial officer and director
good morning, everyone. thank you for joining our call today.
in the second quarter, revenues increased by 10% year-over-year to approximately rmb314 million, driven by the increase in revenue from both processing fees and storage fees. during the second quarter, the group recruited more than 19,000 new subscribers, representing an increase of 8% year-over-year, partially due to the low comparable base in the same quarter of last year, the improved business environment and also our sales efforts during these challenging times.

operator
thank you, sir. we have no other questions. [operator instructions] so we have next question from mr. bill jones from panamas capital. sir, please go ahead.
sam john -- panamas capital -- analyst
hi. thank you for taking the question. this is sam john [phonetic]. can you talk about the timeline, it might take for the special committee to evaluate the offer that was made nine months ago, that's question number one. number two, how do you think about the potential for a stock buyback? what are the returns you might be able to achieve on deploying a cash for stock buyback as opposed to maybe capex? and then the third question is, do you have any capex estimates or a budget for next year? thank you.
chen bing chuen, albert -- chief financial officer and director
thank you for the questions. as you all aware, the special committee is formed to evaluate the non-binding proposal offered by alternate ocean to the company. and i believe that the independent or special committee is taking the lead in evaluating the offer. unfortunately, i'm not in the position to discuss the details regarding the latest discussions. but i'm sure that the special committee will try their very best to evaluate, as well as come up with the appropriate recommended course of actions for the company with the best interest of the shareholders and the company as a whole in their mind.
in terms of the company capital allocation plan, we're constantly exploring different capital allocation decisions. we have done obviously share repurchase in the past, we have also dividend out -- part of our income in the past as well. and as for the time being, we are also looking into other new opportunities that can potentially diversify the company income streams and to a certain extent, mitigate some of our geographical concentration risk.
with that being said, if the board decided to relaunch a share repurchase program, or announce a dividend decisions or even a potential acquisition in the future, we would definitely make those decisions known to the market through our announcement and publications.
in terms of capital expenditure for time being, routine capital expenditure as you can see from our press releases, for the past six months, our capital expenditure is approximately roughly at rmb6 million and those capital expenditure were spent on the procurement on the equipment's in the absence of building out a new facility, routine capital expenditure will mainly consist of the purchase of storage equipment and the replacement of laboratory equipment.
but with that being said, we are keeping a close eye in terms of our capacity utilization and if there's a need for further expansion in our storage facilities, we will definitely do so. however, currently we don't have an immediate plan to expand our capacity as of this point in time. but obviously, the capital expenditure plan will change, if the new subscriber numbers are picked up significantly, and we certainly hope that will be the case.
operator
thank you, sir. we have no other questions. [operator instructions]. we have another question from mr. sam john from panamas capital. sir, please go ahead.
sam john -- panamas capital -- analyst
thank you. as a follow up, what do you estimate your current capacity utilization is?
chen bing chuen, albert -- chief financial officer and director
for our beijing facilities, the current capacity utilization rate is approximately 70%. for our guangdong facilities is roughly similar, around between 65% to 70%. zhejiang facilities probably has the lowest in terms of utilization rate, you're looking at probably less than 25%.
operator
thank you, sir. we have no other questions. back to you for the conclusion.
