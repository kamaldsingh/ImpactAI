thank you, mr. mondor. [operator instructions] our first question will come from scott searle with roth capital. please go ahead.
scott searle -- roth capital partners, llc -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. hey, just a quick clarification, craig. i want to make sure i understood the 12% 5g number was that for the fourth quarter or was that for the year? and also to clarify on the r&d front, is there a -- do you have some more granularity as it relates to certification costs, which tend to be lumpier versus anything that's started to flow through related to software capitalization?
craig foster -- chief financial officer
sure, so let me start with the first question you had, which was sorry?
dan mondor -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
12% was the year.
scott searle -- roth capital partners, llc -- analyst
for the year, ok.
craig foster -- chief financial officer
yeah, that was for the year, sorry. and then regarding the capitalization of software and stuff, so we've -- for q4, we've definitely seen a peak of our costs as it relates to the capitalization and amortization relating to software development costs, internal and external. and i think that you're going to see that tick down substantially going forward, more normalizing toward where we were in q3 of this year.
scott searle -- roth capital partners, llc -- analyst
got you, helpful. and just digging in on the ctrack front, i want to clarify. so the intention at this point is to retain the remaining ctrack businesses that are not south african based, and ultimately kind of fold that into the enterprise business that you're developing. is that correct?
dan mondor -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
yeah, yeah. scott, it's the -- it's sort of the rest of world assets that we're keeping, are, uk, western europe, australia/new zealand, which importantly line up with our target markets in 5g, and our expectation of our enterprise strategy will align there as well. so, those are strong markets, have great growth trajectories and we think it's a good alignment. as we look across our total cloud subscription business they align very well with our 5g strategy and with our cloud strategy.
scott searle -- roth capital partners, llc -- analyst
got you. and lastly, if i could, you mentioned some initial orders coming from some of the new customers that were announced during the fourth quarter, i was wondering if you could put some more color around the magnitude, the size of that. and so far, we're two months into the first quarter, what are you seeing so far from a linearity perspective? and any color you could give us on kind of the sequential growth of the course here would be helpful. thank you.
dan mondor -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
sure, yeah. well, it's a continued ramp through the year. every quarter last year was higher than the previous and we expect that to start that pattern. i'm asked all the time, when are you going to start to see another customer that has a higher business potential or profile than verizon? and i'm pleased to report, it's early in the year, six weeks, eight weeks of data and sell-through, but our 5g hotspot device is the sell-through data from t-mobile is roughly 50%, actually 54% per week higher than verizon. so we're seeing very strong demand there and that's a very important customer. so, we expect to see steady run rates with -- through the operator channel that has to settle down. we're onboarding new operators that's additive. so, we see an up and to the right profile this year. and quite frankly, we should see in the second half, 5g revenue crossing over with 4g, in other words, higher. so very, very strong uptick, very strong demand, great reception and the enterprise activities just getting going.
scott searle -- roth capital partners, llc -- analyst
great. thank you.
dan mondor -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question will come from john marchetti with stifel. please go ahead.
john marchetti -- stifel, nicolaus & company, incorporated -- analyst
thanks very much. dan or craig, i was wondering if you talk a little bit more about your expectations for the enterprise contribution here in '21? where are we? dan you mentioned some work that still needs to be done on the go-to-market side and some things along those lines, just how do we think of that as a contributor for '21?
operator
pardon me, speaker, your line might be muted.
dan mondor -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
sorry. i wanted to say that our principal focus on 5g until roughly the middle of last year has been on carriers. that's where we were pursuing, putting our energy investment. naturally, we saw the enterprise market in fact, the 5g enterprise market is about three times larger than carrier. so the way in my words, enterprise is a front row seat now in inseego's strategy. we are launching a number of new 5g products this half and we are adding muscle to our channel, if you will, in high touch sales, but importantly, channel partners, system integrators, that sort of thing, is what we're now in the process of recruiting master sales agents, etc. so we're bulking up, muscling up on our 5g portfolio. at the same time, we're investing and adding resources to recruit and onboard channel partners for the enterprise market. so that's the power of -- and there that we expect a nice uptick in the enterprise business. and that's certainly a fundamental part of our strategy now.
john marchetti -- stifel, nicolaus & company, incorporated -- analyst
got it. and then on the software side of the business, i guess how should we think about that growing through this year and into next? do we expect to see more of these sort of joint sales similar to what we saw with t-mobile, where that becomes a bigger piece of the initial agreement with the service provider? is there a specific software module that comes out to support the enterprise group as well, just curious to think about that enterprise -- excuse me, the software contribution as we go through '21 as well?
dan mondor -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
yeah, well we're very bullish on our cloud subscription business. from a growth perspective, coming off of last year, inseego manage, the subscribed component of that software stack was triple-digits. and as we look at the growth profile of the ctrack's assets in uk, western europe, australia/new zealand, that is strong double-digits. so we see overall, our subscription business growth in strong double-digits this year putting those two together. as far as the attach, if you will, your question, t-mobile is very strong inseego subscribed customer. they've adopted inseego connect. and that's going gangbusters. we're starting to see adoption into other carriers. and we're starting to see adoption into enterprise customers. this is our pre-5g products, skyus. so we see it as a very strong component of our growth strategy and our margin expansion strategy.
john marchetti -- stifel, nicolaus & company, incorporated -- analyst
got it. and then maybe i can just get one last one in. craig, you mentioned some of the initial loads of 5g products that you saw with a number of new customers in the fourth quarter. are those largely completed now for those customers? should we be thinking about, the 1q quarter here as more sort of sell through related or are we still getting a bit of that uplift as you're adding some of the new product into the channel?
craig foster -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think, thanks for the question. i think there was a lot of push by the carriers to get their stuff launched in q4. so that meant we were shipping pretty sizable volumes to the new partners that we had. and now we're in the middle of getting kind of the run rate reports, which would translate into second orders over the quarter. so i think we're still in the wait and see mode in terms of how the inventory is going to move through based on those initial loads.
john marchetti -- stifel, nicolaus & company, incorporated -- analyst
thank you.
dan mondor -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
yeah, i would add going back to the weekly sell through numbers that we're monitoring very closely. so that's what we're staying on top of.
john marchetti -- stifel, nicolaus & company, incorporated -- analyst
thank you.
dan mondor -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
yeah.
operator
our next question will come from mike walkley with canaccord genuity. please go ahead.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. hope everybody's doing well on the call. i guess, yeah and congrats on all you guys accomplished in 2020 and look forward to all these new 5g products coming to customers. just a question on modeling maybe for, craig, just on the ctrack south africa business. can you help us just what the run rate is of the business sold so we can maybe remove that from models as we think about that business for comps going forward?
craig foster -- chief financial officer
sure. as you think about ctrack, roughly for what we were modeling for the 2021 is the ctrack south africa is roughly half of our business in the ctrack line.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
okay, great. thanks. and then just on q1, i know it's an interesting quarter after you fill up the channel for 5g and you're waiting for orders for sell-through and then we had the surge demand. but anything we should think of for q1? is there any of these well-known component shortages that might be impacting your business in the first half of the year? how do you guys feel about your ability to supply and any thoughts on just seasonal trends as we start off the year?
dan mondor -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
yeah, i can -- hey mike, i'll comment. it's dan here. thus far we have not seen an impact on the component shortage dynamic, if you will. done a lot of work and planning ahead and ordering frankly, these long lead time components. the market is tight. there's lot of constraints, everyone knows that. but thus far, we're not seeing any impact, at least in the near-term. having said that, we are working very hard on that exact thing.
craig foster -- chief financial officer
and i'll just add one piece of information is that, while we believe that we have raw materials and inventory covered, what we are seeing from our key suppliers is, longer lead times. so something that might have been three quarters now moving out to four quarters. so really the onus on us is to make sure that we have a steady supply as we move into the second half of the year. and i mentioned in my comments that you should expect to see some increased inventory, i would think a bunch of that would be in raw materials to make sure that we secure the supply that we need.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
got you. that's helpful. thanks. and maybe a question on the product roadmap. can you talk about just any early feedback on the private network business with customers. and the partnership with celona that you guys put out a press release? maybe a little color on that and do you have a kind of opportunity you see with them?
dan mondor -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
yeah. ashish, do you want to take that one?
ashish sharma -- president of iot & mobile solutions
yeah, sure, dan. yeah, i mean look, early days, the private network market is just beginning and there's lot of activity. there's lot of new players coming in. we've mapped out the ecosystem. and we are working, from infrastructure to end customers to system integrators, software partners, we're working with a whole slew of different technology ecosystem partners. it is a very exciting market, mike, and we believe our solutions are very well suited for the market. and early days, but, just phenomenal use cases, number of different use cases that are popping up here. so you're going to hear more from us as we move forward and make progress in this market.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
great. last question for me to whoever wants to take and i'll pass the line. just you're investing in a lot of new products, as you highlighted 5gs in the early innings. do you feel like you guys have the cash on hand, the balance sheet in place to support the growth objectives over the course of 2021?
dan mondor -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
well, i'm going to give a short answer, mike. yes, we do. no, we feel very good about where we're at. i mean, we did a lot of work last year, a lot of work to strengthen the balance sheet as you know, early in the year, and then subsequently, and of course, now most recently, the sale of ctrack south africa. so we're in a good spot. we like where we are.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
great. looking forward to following your progress this year and thanks for taking my questions.
dan mondor -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
thanks mike.
operator
our next question will come from jaeson schmidt with lake street. please go ahead.
jaeson schmidt -- lake street capital markets, llc -- analyst
hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. just curious if you've seen anything out of the ordinary from a pricing standpoint, within the ctrack business outside the south african operations?
dan mondor -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
well, i think, yeah, hey, jaeson. one of the things with south africa's challenging business environment, but it also had a fairly low on average, arpu and the reason for that is legacy consumer market. some of the insurance business, some of the government business, so that was -- that frankly was a low arpu type of market, and a challenging environment. so, long and short of some of the factors behind deciding to divest that asset. we're in a much better place in uk, western europe and australia/new zealand and that plus we've got a new product platform called clarity. we're building a software stack of applications on top of that, so in fact, our arpu profile is going up in aggregate, rather than down.
jaeson schmidt -- lake street capital markets, llc -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then just curious, looking at the ctrack business, how you think the north american market fits into the future plans?
dan mondor -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
yeah, so great question. looking at the overall remaining assets, rest of world, we're taking along look at the north american market that's a function of that and are going to be looking at some strategic planning around our growth opportunities, in addition to, as i said, western europe, uk, australia. so we're assessing it, there is opportunity there. we'll update as we move forward.
jaeson schmidt -- lake street capital markets, llc -- analyst
okay, thanks a lot, guys.
dan mondor -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
thank you.
craig foster -- chief financial officer

operator
our next question will come from lance vitanza with cowen. please go ahead.
lance vitanza -- cowen and company, llc -- analyst
thanks, guys. thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. i wanted to ask you about the inseego manage cloud subscriptions, over 3.5 million. just the first question is, how many did you have? how many subscriptions did you have at the end of the third quarter and how many did you have a year ago? and then if we could talk a little bit about what impact these subscriptions are having on the company's revenue and margin profile? in other words, are we -- is there any frontloading in those subscriptions or is it the opposite? are we kind of creating a headwind because maybe we're replacing point-in-time sales with a subscription tail, so to speak? but any color on that would be appreciated.
dan mondor -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
yeah. hey, lance. well, the first part of your question, we entered 2020 with 1 million subscriptions and we exited 2020 with 3.5 million. so there's your growth profile through the year. t-mo was a great customer. and they placed their confidence in us, and this is managing subscriptions for principally as enterprise and their government sector. and as magenta and yellow came together last year, it was really a boost in the demand for that capability with us. and as well, now you know they're having inseego connect. so, i mean, that was the principal driver. it was the demand from the markets for subscriptions for devices. and that's what we provide as a service. so overall, triple-digit growth last year. we're going to moderate our view this year. we think it's going to be very, very strong double-digit, but in the subscribed portion that is, but we still see very strong growth opportunity in 2021.
lance vitanza -- cowen and company, llc -- analyst
thanks. and then and what kind of, can you talk at all about the impact that this growth is -- has had and i guess is likely to have going forward on the margin profile? thanks.
dan mondor -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
well, yeah, highly accretive from a margin perspective, as you can probably imagine. it's a very important growth driver. and as i said before, our strategy this year is to expand the carriers with more 5g slots and/or enterprise and for our cloud subscription business. so inseego manage under which this subscription module falls is really that and we are driving for very, very strong double-digit growth overall. as i said as well, ctrack rest of world has that profile. so we feel very bullish on our subscription business this year in terms of revenue growth, and of course, margin expansion.
lance vitanza -- cowen and company, llc -- analyst
thanks, guys. appreciate it.

aditya dagaonkar -- northland capital -- analyst
second question was like how many 10 percentage customers did you have in 4q?
craig foster -- chief financial officer
it really falls. it's -- we could disclose the breakout, but i believe we had two as our top -- as our 10 percenters.

dan mondor -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
hello, everyone. it is great to be with you today. 2020 was a phenomenal year for inseego in every respect, as we extended our lead in the 5g market. we launched groundbreaking 5g products with mobile operators in four continents, shipped our first fixed wireless access products, unveiled a suite of powerful software-as-a-service cloud solutions and posted record revenues. the launch of our second-generation 5g products and surge in demand for our 4g products played a major role in our outstanding 2020 financial results. our 5g strategy came to fruition and we recorded significant wins and successful 5g customer launches in north america, emea and asia-pacific, with approximately 12% of our total revenue coming from these products.
the most significant win was the groundbreaking deal with t-mobile, who selected inseego for their very first and only 5g mobile broadband hotspot and our inseego manage cloud portfolio. the un-carrier now has inseego 5g technology and device management capability to offer to their 100 million-plus consumer and enterprise customers. 2020 was the culmination of the inseego team accomplishing what we said over three years ago, when we announced inseego 2.0. we brought numerous new products to market, added major new customers and established business in new high growth geographies. i cannot tell you how proud i am of our amazing employees. as we sit here today, the four largest mobile operators in the u.s. have all adopted in inseego products into their lineups.
now every american can experience the fastest, most reliable and secure 4g and 5g mobile technology on the planet. we successfully navigated the numerous challenges of the covid pandemic, including lockdowns globally. our team did an outstanding job to fulfill the explosive demand that fueled our impressive revenue and profit growth in 2020. we made tremendous progress in the first half of last year, strengthening our balance sheet with additional liquidity and elimination of bank debt. most recently, we announced the sale of ctrack south africa, which allows us to focus on building our business in markets, where we are experiencing substantial demand for our products in the rest of the world.
as such, enterprise saas ctrack will continue to operate in high growth markets in the uk, western europe and australia/new zealand. the inseego manage subscription software business grew like triple-digits in 2020. so our combined cloud subscription business is both sizable and growing very rapidly. we think it is important to be a pure-play 5g story, and extend our leadership position in the hardware platforms and grow our cloud subscription business for the decade long 5g technology cycle. we launched inseego 3.0 in january with a goal of becoming the global 5g technology partner of choice for carriers and enterprise. and we are focused on three primary objectives in 2021.
first, expand our product footprint in each major carrier with multiple 5g product slots with fix wireless access and mobile broadband hotspots as stock products, and launch a non-stock sellers strategy to sell to the enterprise markets in conjunction with the carrier's enterprise salesforce. second, launch a comprehensive 5g enterprise portfolio to secure the edge with inseego technology, targeting enterprise, small medium businesses and private networks. and third, roll out the inseego manage cloud portfolio to grow our recurring revenue cloud subscription business at higher gross margins. our 5g pipeline continues to grow significantly in all regions, and we are seeing momentum throughout our entire 5g and cloud product portfolio.
our new wins are a testament to the strength of our 5g portfolio. as we enter 2021, we continue to see strong demand for new 5g mobile hotspot products from verizon and t-mobile as well as other new customers. carrier 5g revenue from mobile broadband products and fixed wireless products will continue to grow in 2021. and our new 5g enterprise products are coming to market in the first half. obviously, 4g will continue to transition to 5g. but it's important to note that 4g and 5g coexist in the network. so it'll be a gradual technology transition. in addition, i should point out that we have at&t as a major new 4g customer. craig will comment on our 2021 outlook in his remarks.
now, i would like to turn it over to ashish to provide the details on our 5g go-to-market strategy, hardware and software platforms and customer highlights.
ashish sharma -- president of iot & mobile solutions
thank you, dan. i'm very pleased with our 5g progress across all geographies, and i'd like to highlight several key areas of strategic focus that will drive our growth this year and into the future. first, our service provider business grew significantly in 2020. the growth was driven by the new 5g launches with several carriers and by the work from home demand for our 4g products. in 2020, we developed and launched our second-generation 5g solutions with customers in north america, middle east, japan and europe, resulting in over 250% year-over-year growth. in q4, we executed several 5g mobile broadband launches with verizon, t-mobile, uscellular, sumitomo, ciscom and vodafone qatar.
we are proud to have the opportunity to work with these early adopters. in this category, our launch with t-mobile was pretty significant, given we're the only 5g hotspot in their portfolio, and we also launched our inseego manage cloud solution with them. 5g is a generational opportunity and we are at the top of the first inning of the technology cycle. let me provide some data on that. in january 2020, there were 61 live 5g networks and there over 140 as of january '21. inseego 5g products now support all network strategies and frequency bands in the low, medium and high band spectrum. today 5g finally solves a host of last mile access problems with speeds as good and sometimes better than fiber optics and coax cable.
5g can provide high speed connectivity to millions who are outside current broadband network footprints and can do all this at costs lower than traditional wired networks. over the last two, three years, we've set the company up nicely for long-term success by taking a lead in the development of multiple generations of 5g technology. and we plan to stay ahead with the future enhancements in 5g. note that developing and launching these products is a pretty involved process that includes field testing and network and comparability, along with regulatory 3gpp, and carrier certifications. it also involves a lot of time spent with the carriers working on developing their 5g solution they want to deliver and the underlying economics of that solution.
this is our core expertise. we have a strong execution team that knows how to build and launch these products. second, a geographic expansion that help drive the long-term growth of our 5g business. our early technology lead is opening many doors, and our products are outperforming competition in our product categories. i want to point out that about 18 months ago, we started to play some key sales and support resources in a few focused markets, which resulted in a strong and growing pipeline of opportunities. these opportunities are now turning into real deployments, and i'm happy to report 5g revenue coming from europe, middle east and japan. as i mentioned earlier, launching 5g products is an involved process, particularly as it relates to new network build-outs.
and we maintain confidence in our continued invest-to-grow strategy. third is our strategy to create a global fixed wireless access business, both with carriers, and importantly, with enterprises. in q4, we launched a market-leading high performance 5g fwa solution with uscellular. this is a powerful 5g platform that incorporates the latest wi-fi 6 technology and can be easily set up utilizing the inseego mobile app. we also just launched a version of this solution for enterprise customers in several global markets, and the reception has been extremely positive. in addition to these indoor solutions, we are working on launching several other indoor-outdoor and industrial fwa solutions in the next few months.
in several instances, we are through the field trials and technical acceptance from carriers, while working to complete certifications, and begin commercial orders. in other cases, we are in the customer labs testing the product and looking forward to getting their approval soon. 5g fwa is a new greenfield market that would provide an alternate way to bring broadband into homes and enterprises. this includes taking 5g into enterprise and smb markets for wan as use cases. businesses of all sizes are focused on creating flexible working environments with employees at home, in the office, or in the field closer to their workflows. our 5g fwa solutions are a key enabler to this new way of working. and we are making great strides in bringing high performance fwa solutions with many customers worldwide.
in addition to these traditional fwa users, there is an interesting ecosystem starting to form around the private network market. we are actively engaging in the market and we plan to build up our business as the market develops over the next few years. fourth is broadening our software business through value-added features that our customers can monetize. in 2020, we revamped our cloud solutions portfolio, inseego manage. our cloud subscriptions grew significantly to over 3.5 million subscriptions. we also launched a new cloud management solution, inseego connect, which is built for highly scalable remote management of our 4g and 5g solutions.
we also released a new mobile app that simplifies the installation and onboarding of our solutions. these new software solutions allow the end customers to self-install their broadband connections for many different use cases. moving forward, we are focused on growing recurring more saas-like revenues that are bundled with our 5g equipment-based solutions. our focus is on three types of recurring revenue, complex carrier subscription management, cloud management services for carrier and enterprises and 5g edge enablement. all these areas have a large tam associated with them.
now, i'd like to hand it over to craig.
craig foster -- chief financial officer
good afternoon, everyone. and thank you for taking the time to join the call today. while preparing for the earnings call, we are provided with an opportunity to reflect on the evolution that inseego is currently undergoing. it was only a few years ago that we were basically a one product, one customer company. what we lacked as a firm was not initiative or drive, but a comprehensive strategy on how we're going to develop this growing market. from my point of view, our current strategy boils down to four major initiatives, all of which are well under way. first is our geographic expansion and revenue concentration. as noted earlier by dan, we announced the number of new wins with leading international and domestic carriers.
these initial returns come after investing in long sales cycles and will help us diversify our revenue into fast growth markets. second, is our focus on building industry-leading products. despite the early nature of the 5g market, inseego continues to be on the forefront of product development. we recently added a significant number of products to our portfolio, including a suite of fixed wireless access points. we will continue to push the boundaries to better serve our customers' needs. third is our focus on software platforms. we believe that a great deal of our future success will be driven by our ability to differentiate ourselves within our software platform, inseego manage, which was announced during the quarter.
we realized a while ago that it was critical to build a cloud-based management and security platform that allowed it teams to manage our products in a ubiquitous computing environment, which leads me to our fourth and final point, penetration of the enterprise. with the growth of 5g comes new connectivity needs that require advanced solutions. and we believe that is a natural extension of our r&d dna to build comprehensive platforms for the enterprise. building the products is actually the easy part. and we made several announcements during the quarter. the real focus for us was expanding our relationships with the system integrators and other go-to-market partners and making sure we'll have the right value proposition for customers.
one major development for us was the repackaging of our full offering into recurring revenue pay-as-you-go model we call inseego select, which we believe will be commercially aligned with our enterprise customers. with that, let's review our results for the fourth quarter. net revenue of $86.1 million, down 4.6% sequentially and up 64.5% year-over-year. it should be noted the quarter included several initial stocking orders from the previously mentioned new customers. turning to our business units, fourth quarter, iot and mobile solutions revenue was $72.1 million, down 6.8% from the third quarter. we saw relatively stable demand for our legacy 4g products and received a series of stocking orders for a group of new customers. we are encouraged by our 5g revenue mix, which trended up during the quarter.
our inseego manage software continues to grow rapidly with the number of subscriptions increasing 18% quarter-over-quarter and is up 231% year-over-year. fourth quarter enterprise saas solutions revenue was $14 million, up $8.3 million from the prior quarter. for this line of business, covid restrictions continue to have an impact on our ability to install our solutions in the field, thus impacting some of our bookings. we continue to monitor all of the counties' covid developments very closely and expect some improvements over the coming periods. additionally, the south african rand, which is our largest fx exposure versus the us dollar has continued to trend positively during the quarter. at the beginning of the quarter, the dollar-rand exchange rate was 16.8 and we ended the quarter with the rate at 14.6.
it has been a roller coaster of a year for this exchange rate and thankfully we will no longer have this complication after we close the sale of the south african ctrack business unit in the second quarter. we closed the quarter with a cash balance of $40 million. with our new products and customers coming to market we expect inventory to continue to increase and we will not have a sense of expected run rate from these new customers for several quarters. from this point forward, i'll focus on non-gaap measures. a reconciliation from gaap to non-gaap is detailed in our earnings release. for the iot and mobile business, gross margins were 25.6% for the quarter, up approximately 160 basis points compared to last quarter and up 880 basis points versus the same period a year ago.
we continue to work on a series of initiatives to improve our margins through streamline operational improvements, and leveraging economies of scale. enterprise saas solutions gross margins for q4 were 62.5%, which were down approximately 190 basis points from the prior quarter. the total company gross margins for the fourth quarter were 31.6%, up approximately 180 basis points sequentially. this increase is due to our software subscriptions, sales of our new 5g products and partially offset by our continued sales volume of lower margin 4g products. q4 opex was $32.3 million compared to $24.6 million in q3.
our r&d expenses of $15 million will continue to fluctuate as we continue to spend on regional certifications and capitalized some of our software development costs. we currently capitalize our external use software on a product-by-product basis per the accounting guidance. therefore, the capitalization and amortization impact to our r&d line will be hinged on various factors such as revenue stream or the intrinsic useful life of such software. due to the launch of 5g products in late q3, our amortization expense on the associated capitalized r&d for 5g products in q4 has increased almost by $5 million compared to q3.
sales and marketing expenses increased to $9.4 million, and g&a expenses were $6.6 million, both of which were slightly up due to some increased activities around product launches and some enterprise-focused activities. our q4 non-gaap net loss was negative $6.9 million or a loss of $0.07 per share. adjusted ebitda for q4 was $7 million as compared to $1.7 million loss for q4 2019. and a $7.4 million gain last quarter. subsequent to the quarter close, i wanted to mention some additional details on the sale of our south africa ctrack business to a private equity buyer based in south africa for sar529 million south african rand, which is approximately $36.2 million before deducting transaction-related expenses.
the divestiture of the south african business unit allows us to focus our capital and resources on higher growth regions of the global 5g market and significantly streamlines the operations of the ctrack business, aligning it squarely with our enterprise market focus. we intend to use the proceeds to reinvest in the strategy points mentioned earlier in my comments. the deal is subject to local government review, and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021. and finally, some comments on our outlook for the rest of 2021.
as mentioned before, there are separate market dynamics going on in the 4g and 5g segments of our business. continued expansion of our 5g customer base, and the launch of our mobile broadband and fixed wireless access products throughout the year is very encouraging and the long-term growth trajectory of 5g revenue is clear. given the market is transitioning from 4g to 5g, it is always challenging to predict the exact trajectory of this technology migration. in addition, factors specific to us that add to this complexity are expected lower demand of our legacy 4g products, and the pending sale of the ctrack south africa operations next quarter. taking everything into consideration, we expect the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half. and we'll share more color on this going forward.
thanks for listening. and with that, i will turn the call back over to dan and some final comments.
dan mondor -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
thank you, craig. covid turned the world upside down in 2020, which both tested and demonstrated our resilience during these extraordinary times. despite the numerous challenges, we're on an incredible pace of bringing new 5g products to market and winning new customers. i want to express a sincere thank you to every inseego employee who did an amazing job in 2020 despite unprecedented circumstances. the carrier and enterprise 5g addressable market combined is over $50 billion. with best-in-class performance, security and reliability of our products, we are confident in our goal to become the global 5g technology partner of choice for carriers and enterprise. 2020 was a monumental year, and we expect 2021 to be even more exciting for the company and investors.

we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] first question comes from john marchetti with stifel. please go ahead.
john marchetti -- stifel -- analyst
thanks, very much. dan, if i could just a couple of quick questions on the overall business trends in the enterprise. you mentioned some of the initial sales that you saw here in q1. how do we think about that as we start to move through the year contributing to that second half strength? i mean, obviously, big focus on 5g products, obviously with mobile hotspots and things of that nature. but how do we think about the enterprise opportunity? is that more a '22 event? or do you think it's a real contributor to that second half growth outlook you just highlighted?
dan mondor -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, john, great question. great question. well, as you know, we've just recently launched our enterprise 5g portfolio. so it is any traction in the market, terrific that t-mobile for business certified three of our products, indoor and outdoor fixed wireless products. we're starting to work with them on market opportunities, and then broadly through our distribution channel that we described in north america and apac. so we see it beginning to contribute in the second half, it will be a ramp as usual. but we have the portfolio, we have the software solutions to go with it and the distribution in our target market. so it's a ramp for the second half as we see it and certainly carry a great momentum is what we're expecting to see going into '22.
john marchetti -- stifel -- analyst
and again, just as a follow-up to that is, is there a better margin profile with those enterprise products relative to maybe the mobile hotspot products? and obviously, the software pieces are very different margin profile, but how do those solutions stack up? i guess margin wise, relative even to the 5g mobile hotspots?
dan mondor -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. as we all well know, the enterprise market in general has a different gross margin profile. there is the benefits of the distribution, but i will say this, yes, it is higher than if you will, the kind of the carrier gross margin profile as far as this fixed wireless access products. i would expect somewhere in the mid-40s.
john marchetti -- stifel -- analyst
and then, maybe just the last question for me, and i'll jump back in the queue. from a software perspective, obviously, a lot of that you mentioned some of the carriers that are now offering alongside, but as you go-to-market in that enterprise market as well, is there a different attach rate there for software? is it higher or is it lower? just curious, how that stacks up relative to what you're seeing on maybe some of the mobile hotspot side as well. thank you.
dan mondor -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, a great question in addition, john, thank you for that. well, we're seeing strong attach rates across the board. as you know and as we announced t-mobile is adopted our inseego managed solution as part of the -- their initial 5g hotspot deployment, at&t is now adopting inseego connect to offer to their enterprise customers that's -- as part of their -- the launch of our new -- the new 4g hotspot business with them. all of the conversations with enterprise and all for the right reasons that they want to look at how they can deploy how you acquire, how you manage and how you secure their enterprise. so they don't have their own, so naturally, it's a packaged solution.
and we're also seeing an offering we call inseego select that is kind of, if you will a bundled offer for select sales partners that would sell the complete package, kind of, in a rental type of model, which will add to recurring revenue, good recovery, high gross margin. so the answer is both. we're seeing strong interest and attached rates in both carrier and enterprise, john.
john marchetti -- stifel -- analyst
thanks, very much.
dan mondor -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question comes from mike walkley with canaccord genuity. please go ahead.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
great, thanks for taking my question. i guess first place to start is just good to learn that 4g levels are above pre-covid areas, but just trying to get a cadence of, with the work-from-home and school from anywhere type of surge in demand. how should we think about the cadence for that business and the overall maybe iot and mobile solutions businesses? is q1, the trough, kind of, a seasonally softer quarter and it builds throughout the year? or there still may be a pocket of 4g coming out in q2 and then a stronger second half of the year?
dan mondor -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. hey, mike. thanks very much. and also a great question. well, as we've said and mentioned on the earnings call previously, we are seeing our 4g demand levels for our newest generation hotspots, selling at higher levels than pre-covid. so that is what we're seeing and we see no evidence of that trailing off. now, i will say this, the onset of covid and the dynamic that played out toward the end of the first quarter drove 4g revenue, which was a combination of both -- some of our older legacy products that are coming near end of life, as well as our newer generation, our cat '22, cat 2022 lte products.
so the dynamic that played out from 2020 to this year is, a number of those end of life, older 4g products have just tailed off. they were sold out. they're no longer sold in the market, they were naturally reaching their end of life and in fact, an up tick in demand accelerate at the end of life. so that revenue is being substituted now by our newest generation 4g products. and that's what i referred to as the run rate we're seeing is higher than pre covid of those. and of course, now 5g is coming into the mix, software service is coming into the mix.
so long story short, there's a substitution effect going on in our revenue composition. the good news is, what's driving revenue now is our latest generation lte, in terms of that ongoing work-from-home demand and 5g and some of the newer products. so we have fresher, newer revenue that's making up our quarter q1 and will make up the quarters going forward.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
thank you. and then, just as we think about gross margin trends may be on a short-term, is there any component constraints are tightening, inventory creating maybe some gross margin headwinds as you maybe expedite shipments or try to track down components? but then, it sounds like over time with software and with the mix changing, you should see gross margins, improving pretty steadily throughout the year.
dan mondor -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, i've heard an expression called chip are getting, i don't know if that one's caught on yet. but now, again, great question, mike. and thanks for the question, it's obviously topical. so i think, as we said, we're doing a good job. and we did get out in front with the semiconductor dynamic going on with our key partners. we did advance purchases to secure components supply, which is reflected in some of our use of cash. and we see this prevailing -- this condition prevailing, i think through the end of this year, likely into the early part of '22. now there's a lot of the technology companies are standing up new foundries billions going in, so there will be recovery in supply. so far, we have not seen -- we've not had customer deliveries impacted, we've not seen price increases.
but having said that, if that does begin to occur, we will go back to our playbook last year where based on the demand, we've passed on price increases and we would fully expect to do that going forward. so that's a conversation we have with our customers. but i think the macro conditions are well understood. because we keep our eye on the ball working on the forecasting and pre-planning, spending a lot of time with our customers talking about future demand and with our key silicon suppliers, securing supply.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
last question remain, i'll pass the line just good to see sunrise switzerland is a new 5g customer. just any commentary on a pipeline for adding new carrier customers for either fixed wireless or overall hotspots for 5g in 2021?
dan mondor -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, yes, in north america, i think we've talked about that we're super excited about fixed wireless opportunities in north america, throughout us and canada. great start having t-mobile certified three of our fixed wireless products. it is fantastic. all the conversations we're having around the world involve both hotspot and fixed wireless. we're adding new carriers there, we're pursuing enterprise business. i would put it all in one category that we expect fixed wireless to start to take hold in the second half of this year in a big way.
and i think there's two elements going forward: one is the consumer to the home broadband entertainment, we think the enterprise with a number of use cases will be an even bigger playbook for fixed wireless. so, we're spending a lot of effort on both enterprise and working with the carriers, tons of rfps, tons of conversations. i think the markets are getting their bearings of how fixed wireless will play. hotspots really started first, but now it's coming on strong. so we've seen good momentum going forward in fixed wireless.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
great. that sounds encouraging. thanks for taking my questions.
dan mondor -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, mike.
operator
our next question comes from lance vitanza with cowen & co. please go ahead.
lance vitanza -- cowen & co -- analyst
thanks, guys for taking the questions. i guess i have two; the first is you've got the company on sound footing, but revenue came in a good bit softer than we were looking for. it sounds like though you were neither surprised nor disappointed with the revenue performance in the quarter. and if that's correct, it just leads me to think that the problem is to a certain extent around messaging. and so understanding of a new, seasoned cfo in place will inseego adopts financial guidance at any point over the year, if not today, perhaps in conjunction with 2q earnings this summer?
dan mondor -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. hi, lance. thanks for the question. well, as we were coming off and we indicated priorities call, that we were going to see a lower level of demand for our 4g. a couple of things i mentioned that q1 of last year and early in the q2 had a number of our older generation, 4g usb prior generation hotspots that had come end of life. so that's a year-over-year faster in comparison.
but in general then we were now to our 5g products ramping up and our 4g lte the latest gen hotspot products ramping up. so as i said earlier, in one of the questions i responded to, there's a mix, a very different mix. so we saw, the first half of this year, generally a little lighter, because of post-covid. the good news is though, the demand level of our lte hotspot is higher than pre-covid. 5g is now a layer on top, it's not a substitution effect. so -- and as that builds as fixed wireless kicks in as 5g enterprise kicks in software, we see a bill throughout the year and that's our comment of second half stronger than the first half.
on your question on guidance, we don't think it's prudent at this point in time, we did not provide guidance. there's a lot of dynamics going on our business, all the things i just mentioned, which are nicely additive. as well as the ctrack, south africa sale, we want to get that behind, and then we'll revisit, how we can communicate to the markets. but we just don't feel it's wise to provide guidance, previously, we still failed to think that we're not at the point that that's prudent. and we'll determine when we feel comfortable in the future.
i think it's important to know that with all these new products, you need to reach kind of a normalized run rate before you have your bearings on what the ongoing revenue look like. so a lot of factors behind not providing guidance, it's not that we are not interested in doing it or we're just some are negative against it in general. it's just the dynamics going on the business. it's just not prudent at this point.
lance vitanza -- cowen & co -- analyst
fair enough. okay, so the other question i had and bob, i think you'd mentioned on your prepared remarks that the 5g sell through in particular remain strong in that you expect, i think, if i get it right, you expect orders to harmonize going forward. so what i took from that is that the carriers were working off inventory in the quarter, is that right? and if that is the case, then did you or could you say when you expect to see the benefit of the sort of the replenishment, so to speak? is that a 2q? or is that a h2 or is that a second half event? thanks.
robert g. barbieri -- interim chief financial officer
good question and thanks. this kind of dovetails a bit to what dan just said, we do see those trends continuing and -- almost in perpetuity and specifically that's a q2 trend. but we're also looking forward to building that momentum, and then that'll shape, more color around forward look. and we'll also shape maybe rethinking in terms of quantitative guidance. so all of these trends are not adn it they're all aware. so what we're trying to do is just gauge that level of momentum, that level of adoption. so we can kind of move forward and articulate more strongly those details, if that's helpful to you.
lance vitanza -- cowen & co -- analyst
thanks. yes, it is, appreciate it.
robert g. barbieri -- interim chief financial officer
okay.
dan mondor -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks. i guess i would add one other thing by the way that our highest -- our largest 5g account, now is t-mobile. it has typically been for this company verizon. so verizon is going on strong demand level is good. it's not a cannibalization by the way of 5g to 4g, that's not what's occurring. it's additive. and t-mobile is, thankfully, has jumped out in front is the largest 5g customer in q1. and we expect to add more. so i think the trend is up to the right, the timing. we need to work through that. and once we get there, we'll have our bearings and be able to come back with better information.
lance vitanza -- cowen & co -- analyst
okay, thanks guys.
dan mondor -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, lance.

our next question comes from michael latimore with northland capital. please go ahead.
aditya dagaonkar -- northland capital -- analyst
hi, this is aditya on behalf of mike latimore. could you tell me how much did international revenue contribute in terms of percentage?
dan mondor -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. hi. good question. well, i guess just the long story short, we don't break out the composition of revenue that way. so we are growing our international business. as you know, through none of the carrier win announcements, we talked about western europe, japan, australia other places. so international revenue is growing, it is still currently a relatively small percentage. and i think till such time, it reaches critical mass, we will then talk about absolute numbers. but at this point in time, we're not breaking out international revenue as a percent of the business.
aditya dagaonkar -- northland capital -- analyst
all right, fine. any idea as to when you might actually expect the 5g sales to exceed the 4g sales?
dan mondor -- chairman and chief executive officer
i would expect to see that in the back half of this year. i think we commented, we had a question like this previously on a prior call. so that was a comment, i made then. yes. same view, no change.
aditya dagaonkar -- northland capital -- analyst
alright. alright, alright, fine. thank you.
dan mondor -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks very much.
operator
the next question comes from scott searles with roth capital. please go ahead.
scott searles -- roth capital -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thank for taking my questions. dan, bob, i hope you guys are doing well. i apologize. i got on the call a little bit late. so i apologize if this is redundant, but did you give any mix or breakdown between 4g and 5g? and i just heard that the prior come in now t-mobile is your largest 5g customers. t-mobile your largest overall customer?
dan mondor -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, scott. great questions. while we did say on the call that 5g was 20% of total revenue. and if you combine 5g and saas that reached in the neighborhood of 44% of total revenue. so that's just showing the differential in mix. t-mobile isn't yet our largest customer. there's a large run rate of 4g, lte sales continuing verizon. it is, however, our largest 5g customer in terms of new products. so that's kind of the landscape there.
scott searles -- roth capital -- analyst
good. and maybe to follow-up on the verizon account. there were some issues with franklin wireless recall this quarter. i'm wondering if you've seen any pickup related to that? do you get any of that opportunity? or is your product more high-end than them using, for example, a lower end or big solution?
dan mondor -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, so great question. they really don't cross over, because it fundamentally is exactly as you said, our product is a higher end product geared for enterprise. some of these other products you mentioned franklin are so called lower end products. so they really actually don't overlap in the target markets. so, i guess franklin's working through these issues. but there again, it's not really a market sector that pulls on our product. so that's frankly a benefit the way we'd like to see it.
operator
thank you. this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to dan mondor for any closing remarks.
dan mondor -- chairman and chief executive officer
great, thanks. well, great questions to end on. thanks again, everyone for joining us today and tuning in. we're off to a great start to what we certainly expect to be a fantastic year with our new revenue streams from 5g, fixed wireless, saas and enterprise as the main events and recurring revenue growth with strong margins. so thanks again, everyone. take care, everyone.

operator
hello and welcome to inseego corp.'s first quarter 2021 financial results conference call. [operator instructions] after todays presentation, there will be an opportunity for analysts to ask questions. [operator instructions]

dan mondor -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, and hello everyone. it's great to be with you today. let me begin by saying that today this company is better positioned than it ever has been on almost every possible measure. as i look back at our progress over the last few years, inseego is a very different company in a much stronger position. this is illustrated in our first quarter results, compared to last year.
we reported a 120% increase in our combined 5g and software-as-a-service revenue over last year and gross margins over 35%, up over 400 basis points. we ended the first quarter with approximately $60 million in cash on our balance sheet and zero bank debt.
there are four predominant reasons for a remarkable transformation. first, we have greatly reduced our customer concentration by expanding our 4g and 5g carrier customer base in the us and increasingly in the international market. second, our rapidly growing software business is yielding recurring, higher margin revenue on top of device revenue, which contributed to our strong gross margins this quarter. third, carrier customers are embarrassing our recently launched 5g fixed wireless access products and we see fixed wireless access as a major growth driver for the company going forward. fourth, our first enterprise 5g fixed wireless products were launched and sold this quarter in the north america, emea and asia pacific.
as we enter 2021, we have just announced the biggest win in company history with the launch of our 5g mifi hotspot at t-mobile, which is quickly become our highest volume 5g customer. t-mobile has also adopted our inseego manage software platform, which adds recurring subscription revenue to those hotspot sales. we are making solid progress in international markets with some initial 5g customer deployments with more to come. we continue with testing, regulatory approvals, and customer contracts in multiple regions. while it's taking a little longer to establish business in new regions, we see international markets as an important growth driver.
the most important development in the last six months has been our 5g fixed wireless access portfolio and the great news is that every customer dialog now includes fixed wireless in addition to our hotspots. it is key for mobile operators to create new revenue streams to generate a return on their capital investment in acquiring spectrum and building national networks. and it's not only relevant for consumer home broadband and entertainment, but also in the enterprise and private network space. we believe both are very large market opportunities with a wide range of use cases.
and, i'm very pleased to report that t-mobile has certified three of our fixed wireless access products for their enterprise business and we're working closely with them to support customer engagements. and this is central to our 5g enterprise initiatives announced late last year and it goes far beyond the work-from-home market. 5g enables new technologies for the enterprise, such as edge ai and edge computing. we have existing 4g customers such as dell, vmware and other enterprise technology leaders and all of our dialogs with them now include our 5g product lineup. you've seen recent announcements of our new enterprise products and channel partners in north america, emea and asia pacific with more to come.
now let's turn to our new software-as-a-service offering. almost every conversation we have with carriers and enterprise customers involves our software platforms, which enable them to onboard, manage and secure the growing number of 4g and 5g devices on their network through centralized cloud management. our saas business has grown significantly over the last 12-months, representing a healthy 24% of our revenue in the first quarter.
our 4g business continues to be strong and we continue to add new customers. we saw a surge in demand for our 4g products starting in march of last year, with the pandemic driving the need for work-from-home solutions. that helped us win at&t as a 4g customer, which means our products are now being sold by all of the largest us carriers. while 4g is down from 2020 levels, we are seeing higher demand levels that we did pre-pandemic. the bottom line is 4g will remain an important part of our business. and it's key as we continue to land and expand 4g customers to 5g. we have positioned inseego as a pure play 5g company. ultimately, all our efforts are aligned on the global 5g opportunity. this led us to divest our ctrack fleet tracking business in south africa, which is not a target 5g market for us. in addition to reducing our headcount by over 540 people or 53% overall, the divestiture will increase revenue per employee to over $600,000 on a pro forma 2020 basis. we think this is an important financial metric for the investment community to know.
finally, i want to address the global semiconductor shortage. our business has not been impacted thus far, thanks to our deep and long standing direct relationships with key components suppliers, in addition to our manufacturing partners. through our proactive approach, we have avoided delay in customer deliveries. we expect the current conditions will extend through the end of this year and likely into 2022. our leadership team will continue to work closely with our silicon partners and take necessary actions to secure supply.
with that, i will hand off to ashish, who will go into further detail on our incredible momentum in 5g and cloud solutions and some groundbreaking customer use cases. ashish?
ashish sharma -- president of iot and mobile solutions
thank you, dan. over the past year, our customers have relied on our innovation to accelerate broadband adoption through our state-of-the-art 4g, 5g and cloud solutions, while protecting the end users from security threats. from my numerous conversations with customers, it is clear that our 5g technology, along with our cloud innovations will form a powerful engine for their business transformation growth as their technology needs continue to evolve at a rapid pace.
from a product revenue perspective, we saw strength in our 5g mobile broadband portfolio and inseego managed cloud portfolio, which now accounts for 20% and 24% of our overall business respectively. this combined 44% is at 2 times from a year ago.
the mobile broadband business continues to build up and we are experiencing great reception of our m2000 and m2100 5g solutions from all customers. consistent feedback we are receiving from our carrier customers is that our technology is far superior to any other similarly categorized product in the market. we secured another 5g operator sunrise in switzerland, the commercial launch plan for early june. we also just launched the mifi 8000 in canada with rogers and fido. many new carrier customers in international markets are trialing our 5g solutions and we anticipate new launches in the coming months.
moving to 5g fwa, we just released a series of new wavemaker products focused in both carrier and enterprise markets, including two indoor activewear products, fg2000 and fx2000 and a rugged outdoor product the fw2000. these products are certified for use in many different regions globally and have recently been certified for use on the t-mobile network. this is a major accomplishment for inseego. our focus now is on implementing joint go-to-market strategies to maximize our success in this very early market.
in addition, on the enterprise side, i'm happy to report that we have generated our first wavemaker revenue by shipping units to north america, australia and europe. this was accomplished through our growing list of channel partners such as scansource, ingram micro, synnex in north america, powertec in australia and sphinx, solid state supplies and others in europe. in terms of our enterprise market push we are seeing some exciting use cases even at this early stage of 5g deployments.
let me provide some examples of customer projects we are working on. in the area of traffic, transportation and logistics, a global leader in transport solutions is deploying our 5g cpe on lampposts in the uk to support video streaming. they're starting with traffic monitoring, but ultimately, the goal is to support autonomous vehicles. a smart city in georgia, peachtree corners is deploying our 5g solutions on streetlights and other locations where fiber would not be economically feasible to enable smart traffic control, management of autonomous vehicles and other use cases. a global leader in package delivery is looking at connecting remote hubs and depots and rural areas where cellular reception can be greatly improved with our high gain products.
our solutions enable many retail use cases as well, [indecipherable], a system integrator in europe is connecting a video feed through our 5g solutions in conjunction with their ai platform. their objective is to provide a solution for retail stores to monitor shelf stock, spillage, theft, surveillance, etc. in the us, a leading retail chain is trialing wavemaker as a connectivity solution for vaccine distribution locations. we're also seeing opportunities in the private network space. a government agency is evaluating wavemaker for secured private networks. one particular use case for them is deploying secure networks in remote areas where cellular coverage is limited.
the transformation of our business to more software subscriptions continues to show great progress, as we achieved 11.5% quarter-over-quarter growth in subscriptions. these are five consecutive quarters of our 40% growth in our recurring software revenue, excluding ctrack.
dan mentioned earlier, at&t now carries the mifi 8000, but it is important to note that it will also make inseego connect available for enterprise customers. we are seeing this in almost all of our customer dialogues that the technological capabilities of our devices coupled with our software management layer is a powerful combination. it is examples like this that give us confidence that we will continue to grow software beyond its current 24% of total revenue.
let me conclude with some thoughts on our product portfolio vision. access to corporate data anywhere and everywhere securely has become the beating heart of the new enterprise. our 5g and top platforms are built with extensive reach, massive scale and multiple layers of security to help drive this digital transformation. we are excited about our position in the market. they're executing and innovating with speed. i'm so proud of what our 5g and cloud teams have achieved.
now i'd like to turn the call over to bob.
robert g. barbieri -- interim chief financial officer
thanks, ashish. first off, let me say how happy i am to be here on the call with you today. given today is my one month anniversary and i've not had the opportunity to speak with many of you. let me start off the call by introducing myself and offering why i was attracted to join inseego. i have over 25-years of experience as a senior executive, including being the chief financial officer at growth software, cloud and technology companies and specifically public companies such as apogee enterprises, lawson software and trizetto. i was brought on by the board of inseego as interim chief financial officer with a mandate to support the company's transition to a high growth 5g and saas company.
i would like to now review the results of our first quarter of fiscal 2021. q1 revenue was $57.6 million, up about 1.5% from q1 of 2020. we should recall q1 2020 benefited from the onset of the covid demand surge, which began in the final weeks of the quarter. the favorable year-over-year comparison is largely due to growth in 5g and software revenue as dan and ashish highlighted. the sequential decline results from a lower level of the surge demand for 4g hotspots, albeit they are running at higher levels than the pre-pandemic activity.
first quarter iot in mobile solutions revenue was $43 million, up 1.3% year-over-year and down 40% from $72.1 million in q4. inseego subscriptions were up 11.5% sequentially, and up 175.7% year-over-year, which helped drive the growth versus the prior year. sell through of 5g hotspots continues to be strong and we expect an increase in new shipments in coming quarters as units ordered harmonized with the ongoing demand.
enterprise saas revenue for q1 was $14.6 million, up 4.8% quarter-over-quarter and relatively flat over the prior year. the sequential increase reflects both better sales as we recover from lockdowns in south africa and the continued strengthening of the rand versus the us dollar. with respect to the sale of ctrack south africa, the transaction continues to progress according to schedule and we'll continue to anticipate closing the sale at the end of the quarter, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions. this will lead to approximately an additional $36 million to our cash balance based on the current exchange rate.
speaking of cash balance, cash at the end of q1 was almost $60 million, including cash classified for held for sale up almost $20 million from q4 of 2020. the increase in our cash balance reflects the net proceeds of $29.4 million from our atm offering in january and solid cash collection offset by our need for higher levels of in transit inventory as we transition from air to ocean shipments. we're taking these actions to better manage cost, as well as buying long lead time components to ensure we can meet customer delivery schedules going forward.
from this point forward, i will focus on non-gaap measures. a reconciliation from gaap to non-gaap is detailed in our earnings release and is found on our ir web page. for iot and mobile business, gross margin was 26.1%, up 50 basis points from the 25.6% in the prior quarter and up approximately 560 basis points, compared to q1 of 2020. gross margin improved both sequentially and year-over-year, the results of a higher mix of 5g and inseego managed revenue and the decline of lower margin 4g sales from 2020 high, as well as solid execution throughout 2020 and 2021 year-to-date an improving supply chain efficiency. going forward, we expect a higher mix of 5g and software revenue and new initiatives to improve operational efficiency will lead to better economies of scale, which translate into improved iot and mobile gross margin steadily as the year progresses.
our enterprise saas solutions gross margin for q1 was 63.8%, up 130 basis points from 62.5% in q4 and down 20 basis points from prior year. total company gross margin for q1 was 35.7%, up 410 basis points from 31.6% in q4 and up 420 basis points from the 31.5% in q1 of 2020. as discussed earlier, the increase is predominantly a result of better sales of higher margin 5g products and software uptake in our iot and mobile business.
q1 opex was $26.7 million down $5.6 million, compared to $32.3 million in q4, the decrease was primarily a result of the research and development spending related to our 5g product programs with the capitalization impact over the course of the software's useful life. we capitalize our external use software on a product-by-product basis per the accounting guidance. therefore, the capitalization and amortization impact to our r&d will cause certain volatility and our quarter-over-quarter operating expenditures. in addition, our testing and certification was lower versus the prior quarter. sales and marketing and general administrative charges remained relatively flat, with the delta being largely seasonal changes, due to product launches and annual audit fees.
our q1 non-gaap net loss was $7.7 million or negative $0.08 per share, versus $6.9 million or a loss of $0.07 per share in the prior quarter and a loss of $5.7 million or $0.06 a share last year. this result reflects our ongoing investment in 5g and saas product development and additional sales resources offset by stronger gross margins.
adjusted ebitda for q1 was a loss of 900,000 versus a positive $7 million in q4 and a loss of $1.7 million last year. for additional details on non-gaap and adjusted ebitda results, please refer to the reconciliation tables in our press release.
finally, some thoughts on the rest of 2021. as stated previously, the company continues to believe that the second half of this year will be better than the first half, driven by 5g sales growth from existing customers, new 5g carrier deployments primarily internationally, revenue growth from our entry into the enterprise market and increased software revenue across our product line. we're bullish due to the many positives that have been articulated today. with the expected closing of the ctrack south africa sale at the end of the second quarter, our financials will more accurately reflect the 5g pure play as mentioned by dan.
with that, let me turn it back to dan for closing remarks.
dan mondor -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, bob. we're delighted to have you on the inseego team. i want to close by expressing my sincere thanks to our dedicated employees, who continue to do an amazing job in these challenging times. they are the driving force behind our numerous accomplishments and i can't thank them enough. we've made significant investments over the past two years to create a best-in-class 5g and software solution portfolio and in sales and marketing resources to capture significant market opportunities. these investments have begun to be reflected in our results.
the strength of our portfolio has helped us succeed in initial customer engagements across multiple regions in the developing fixed wireless access market with carriers and enterprises. we have excellent customer relationships and are seeing tremendous traction with our industry leading 5g products and new software-as-a-service solutions. this gives us more confidence than ever in our ability to become a high growth, high margin, 5g and saas global solutions company generating strong free cash flow.
with a strong second half, you can only imagine what 2022 will look like. thanks again, everyone.

[operator instructions] our first question will come from john marchetti with stifel. please go ahead.
john warren marchetti -- stifel, nicolaus & company, incorporated -- analyst
thanks very much and thanks guys for taking a question. if i can just start first on the ctrack sale, can you let us know what revenue was for the portion of that business that you're divesting in the first half just as -- i'm assuming, given your comment about -- of a better second half over first, we need to exclude that out. i just want to make sure that we have a sense of what that revenue is that we should be accounting for?
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. john, it's dan. thanks very much. good question. i think bob was jumping in ready to answer. so take it away, bob.
robert g. barbieri -- interim chief financial officer
yes. thanks a lot, john. if you -- with respect to south africa, in the first two quarters, the amount of revenue generated was $14.2 million. and in the july month, i think in terms of about $2.5 million because we saw that exactly at the end of the month. that's helpful.
john warren marchetti -- stifel, nicolaus & company, incorporated -- analyst
thank you very much. that's helpful there. and if i can just follow-up with a question on the margins. i want to make sure that i understand this correctly. you clearly saw more 5g in the quarter, all of that very, very positive, so i was a little bit surprised that margins took a step back here given the growth that we're seeing in 5g and in the software portfolio. can -- is it solely a function of more 5g mifi hotspots versus something -- fixed wireless access or things of that nature? just if you can help me understand that dynamic just so we can think about that as we're looking out over the next several quarters and into '22.
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. thanks, john. thanks. well, the overall margin for our 5g products is better than our 4g products. that said, our fixed wireless access products are even better than our hotspots. we believe there will be a large improvement in overall 5g solutions gross margin, and especially when you have the value-added software when we attach it to the hardware, economies of scale, learnings. and we did, through the journey on 4g, get pretty appreciable gross margin improvement over time, better inventory, supply chain costs. that said, there was premiums for spot market purchases as well as higher freight and shipping costs that we saw in the quarter for all the reasons that i think the market knows well.
john warren marchetti -- stifel, nicolaus & company, incorporated -- analyst
great. and then maybe one last one for me, and i'll jump out. just on the software side, should we expect more applications launch this calendar year or is that more of a '22 event?
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. let me turn it over to ashish.
ashish sharma -- president
hey john, good question. so we do expect to launch some new solutions later this year in addition to continuing to add more functionality and more features to the existing customer base and solutions. so there would be some new ones coming out, but we do continue to puff up the existing ones.
john warren marchetti -- stifel, nicolaus & company, incorporated -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
thank you, john.

our next question will come from lance vitanza with cowen & company. please go ahead.
lance william vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi thanks guys for taking a question and congratulations on the nice quarter. i wanted to actually ask about the pipeline in the enterprise channel. and actually i don't know if it was dan or ashish someone mentioned that there's now well over -- i think the phrase was well over 100 customers trialing and buying right now, and then there was the list of all the different types. i wanted to try to get a sense for how close or far you are from converting the pipeline to revenue, but it sounded like from that statement that maybe you're already beginning to do that. and i'm just wondering, from the press release and the language regarding the improved revenues in the back half versus the first half, it sounds like that's largely attributable to the enterprise pipeline being sort of converted, is that right, am i reading it the right way, and was enterprise -- was it measurable? was there a contribution in 2q, was it measurable, will it be measurable in q3? how should we be thinking about that? thanks.
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
lance, thanks for the question. well, as you know, in enterprise and 5g is what we were referencing, we're just getting going. really, when the comment was, you're right, 100-plus 5g customers in our enterprise pipeline but that's from 0 in may. so that's pretty incredible growth. yes. and some of the -- i can't name names, but largest corporations and brands in the world very, very impressive 5g pipeline, they're looking to adopt them. so we have good visibility in the pipeline. the projects are defined. we understand the scope, the budget, the start time, who the decision-makers are, who cuts the pos, that sort of thing and the selection process. so in terms of time line, to answer your question, the start dates or the pipeline we're referencing can be anywhere from 30 days to a few months. and the other part of your question, yes, there was 5g enterprise revenue in q2 but it was a very, very small number as you could imagine. so we do see that ramping up quite nicely.
lance william vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
okay. and then my other question was, if i think about 5g plus cloud, that -- if i got it right, that improved sequentially to 49%, i think you said 49% of revenue from 44% in the first quarter. and i think it was the 5g piece went from 20% to 29%. the cloud piece, if i got it right, that actually, as a percent of revenues went down even though the revenue grew 49% year-on-year. so was that -- i guess, it was just that when you've got the 5g piece tripling year-over-year then that piece is going to get smaller but are you pleased with sort of the way that those two are growing relative to one another?
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
well, very, very pleased and i think you hit it. the denominator was a different number. so larger numbers, so the ratios were different. 5g is clearly going gangbusters. i think overall, if you look at the 49% up from where it was a year ago and last quarter, the way i said it is we're getting the growth in the areas we want to get the growth. those are the engines that we invested in, incredible market traction, the numbers speak for themselves. so we expect to see that growth curve continuing.
lance william vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. if i could just squeeze in one more on the cash balance. if i just take the $37 million from the sale of ctrack and add it to the $30 million that you reported, is that sort of the way that your pro forma cash balance is kind of $67 million or will there be some taxes payable there? and i'm just wondering, i know you mentioned that you think that the burn is going to decline, i think you mentioned noticeably over the next few quarters but on a straight map basis, i mean, $20 million burn versus $67 million pro forma cash, it's only three or four quarters worth of cash. are you feeling comfortable with your liquidity position? would there be perhaps a need to raise incremental capital at this stage?
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes, i'll ask bob to comment. just a slight correction. it was $40 million cash at q2 end. but your question nonetheless...
lance william vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
sorry. i apologize.
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes, no problem. no problem. there were some things associated with q2 that were, if you will, specific to q2, if you will some one-time cash burn aspects and we want to -- bob, i'll ask you to explain that so we can go through that. but we do see cash burn was high because of the working capital changes and you certainly see a steady decline going forward. but bob can give you some of the color on the q2 cash -- use of cash.
robert g. barbieri -- interim chief financial officer
yes. lance, a couple of things. first, just in terms of the raw cash amount in the held-for-sale treatment. what happens is the cash that we have gotten after the sale closed, a little bit under $7 million accrues to us, but is in the line of the assets held for sale. and then second, we have restricted cash of about $3.7 million for a period of about 12 -- exactly 12 months after closure. and that will be our cash and that is just held separately from, lack of a better term, a rep and warranty standpoint on the sale but that is our cash. and then if you add those together that's where you get to the $40 million that dan mentioned. and then going forward we -- and how do you think about it. in the first quarter, a couple of things. one is the company paid its bonuses and restricted stock in the first quarter and that had an impact. in that we basically held taxes from the employees and our cash account in the first quarter, but then relieve them in the second quarter through our outside payroll company. so that was about $7 million of an impact of a cash movement. the remainder was, certainly, just the movement from quarter-to-quarter we had some less rebates only because of -- if you look at the q3 and q4 prior year versus the lower q1 revenue, certainly less rebates were earned and there's about a one quarter lag. so that contributed and...
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
qualcomm rebates.
robert g. barbieri -- interim chief financial officer
yes. for more of a cash burn. and then that will reverse itself going forward because of the step-up in revenue to q2. and as well as some other in and out of working capital. certainly, when you have a lower like a q1 revenue number, you -- your accounts receivable activity is less on your recovery and then that will reverse itself because of the strength of q2 as we move forward. so hopefully, that's a little bit of color, lance. the other thing is, as dan mentioned, we are managing that cash burn down, and that's the goal, and that's how we're executing.
lance william vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks guys [indecipherable].

daniel j. park -- analyst
hey guys good afternoon. this is daniel on for mike. thanks for taking in questions. i guess just a quick one for me. could you just give us a sense of the timing of some of the new carrier launches you mentioned moving forward?
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. hi. thanks for your question. well, we have -- it's part of our pipeline. we have a number of launches that we expect to occur this quarter and going forward. the pipeline has a pretty long tail on it, different stages. so i can't really give specific answers as to numbers but again, it goes back to a very healthy pipeline. and in terms of the carrier pipeline it's a longer cycle -- sales cycle, as you can imagine. so the engagement from testing the products to approval to certification to launch takes time. but we expect to expand our carrier customer base going forward. i think at any moment in time -- i think right now, we've got something like 30 rfps that we're responding to. again, it's a function of healthy pipeline. but we expect to have and we expect to announce a steady flow of new carrier customers. that's number one. number two, it's additional product slots within a customer we already have. that's another aspect.

hi. this is aditya on behalf of mike latimore. could you tell me how many 10% customers did you have?
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
well, bob is looking for numbers. the answer i'm going to give is two.
aditya dagaonkar -- analyst
okay. okay. can you give me like what were their individual percentages to total revenue of these two customers?
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
no, we're not going to -- we don't break out the actual revenue dollars. so that's just not something that we discussed because we do not want to identify revenue numbers for any specific customer. so we just don't provide that kind of breakout.
aditya dagaonkar -- analyst
all right. all right. and on the mobile and iot pipeline, what percentage of it is international?
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
ashish?
ashish sharma -- president
yes, aditya, not a lot at this point. we've got a nice pipeline, we had some early customers, but majority of the revenue is still coming from north america.
aditya dagaonkar -- analyst
thank you.
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. i think to answer relative to revenue is answer relative to pipeline. so not a lot of international revenue currently. i would say on a relative basis because the international market is a new market, and we're building in products and our go-to-market teams. the pipeline on a percentage basis would be much higher than the current revenue on a percentage basis, if that helps.
aditya dagaonkar -- analyst
all right. thanks thanks. thank you.
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to dan mondor for any closing remarks.
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
well, thank you, operator. i will say this, and just to wrap up, the inseego team is executing exceptionally well in every part of the company. as you saw we're seeing growing customer adoption of our 5g and software solutions with carriers and the market reception of our newly launched enterprise portfolio is incredible. we have highly differentiated products, and our go-to-market teams have never been stronger. so you put it all together, these are the reasons behind our pipeline of opportunities being the largest in recent company history. so net-net, we've laid the groundwork for a strong second half, as we discussed, and i think an amazing 2022. so thanks again, everyone.

dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
thank you, operator, and hello, everyone. thanks for joining the call today. i'm pleased to report a very strong second quarter for inseego, with revenue up 14% sequentially to $65.7 million, and we approached breakeven adjusted ebitda, both well ahead of consensus. the strength in the second quarter was driven by continued growth in the sell-through of our suite of 5g hardware and software solutions. i want to highlight an important fact. our 5g solutions now represent almost 29% of total revenue, an increase of 182% over the second quarter of last year. these remarkable results reflect the continued overall market growth and customer adoption of inseego 5g products. one of the core reasons we can meet our customers' growing demand for our products is our long-standing direct relationships with key component suppliers and manufacturing partners. unlike what other players are experiencing, our business was not impacted this quarter by the global semiconductor supply shortage. that said, we believe this challenging environment will last at least through the rest of the year. we remain vigilant and have confidence that our supply chain is set up to support growth for the remainder of the year. our rapidly growing software-as-a-service business also experienced similar strength. excluding ctrack south africa, software including ctrack rest of world, and inseego manage grew 49% year-over-year and subscriptions increased 10% sequentially and 139% year-over-year. more on our software initiatives will be provided from ashish. after the close of the quarter, we successfully completed the sale of our ctrack south africa unit, which brought in more than $36 million to our balance sheet. this gives us the financial flexibility to meet customer 5g demand and continue to invest in our products while striving for free cash flow positive. so here we are halfway through the year, and we see great momentum in our business as we remain diligently focused on our transformation into a 5g pure-play company. back in may, we stated the belief the second half of 2021 would be better than the first half, and we remain confident in that expectation, and here's why. first, we continue to see 4g lte sell-through stabilize at levels higher than we had pre-pandemic.
with two more 4g u.s. carrier launches planned for this quarter, you will note that we now sell to the four largest mobile networks in the u.s. and our pipeline of opportunities with international carriers and enterprise customers continues to grow. net-net we expect continued robust demand for our 4g lte solutions. second, we continue to roll out 5g product deployments with new carrier customers across the globe. the reception to both our existing and new products as well as our software platform has been fantastic. we are steadily building our fixed wireless business, and we see fixed wireless as a major contributor in the second half and 2022. third, we continue to see strong sales of our software offering that not only adds to the top line but improves the overall value proposition of our solutions with greater stickiness, pricing power and inseego's overall margin profile. and fourth, i'm happy to report that we're seeing a dramatic increase in engagement and pipeline for enterprise 5g fixed wireless solutions. these opportunities are being driven primarily by well-known enterprises that are increasingly looking for ways to integrate 5g into their workflows. this quarter, we've begun to see our investment in this strategy pay off. ashish will go into more specifics on these, but i would like to highlight that there are well over 100 companies trialing and purchasing inseego 5g solutions for primary connectivity use cases. these customers represent a wide range of verticals from the department of defense, federal, state and local agencies to major global logistics companies, automotive manufacturers, global airlines, retailers, utility companies and many other fortune 1000 companies. given what i just discussed, i'm confident that the ground has been laid for a strong second half, and i can only imagine what 2022 will look like. with that, let me turn the call over to ashish to provide additional detail.
ashish sharma -- president
thank you, dan. for the past few years, the company has been investing in the state-of-the-art 4g, 5g and cloud solutions to form a powerful engine for business transformation and growth. as you heard from dan, we had impressive momentum in q2, which gives me great excitement and optimism for what's ahead. we saw customer demand across the business led by major market shifts, hybrid work, digital transformation and continued strong uptake of our subscription-based software offerings. as dan mentioned, our 5g broadband portfolio grew 182% year-over-year in q2 and now represents almost 29% of total revenue. and cloud software portfolio grew 49% year-over-year, which is now 20% of total revenue. combined, these next-generation products now represent almost half of total revenue, up from 44% of our business just last quarter. let me reiterate that because it's impressive. our new generation of products now represents almost half of total revenue, and we are just getting started. inseego's end-to-end portfolio is laying the foundation toward 5g controlled enterprise networks that can untether numerous applications and extend reach to areas never connected before. what an exciting time to be in the 5g space. now let me provide details on our key businesses. let's start with mobile broadband. we saw great growth in the quarter with this portfolio and, as dan mentioned earlier, we see no signs of that slowing down with two more 4g launches on track for the third quarter in the u.s. our 5g solutions are proving to be perfect for the work-from-anywhere paradigm and our carrier customers are leveraging these solutions to provide amazing broadband experiences for a variety of use cases like employee remote connectivity. this is because these solutions are capable of delivering sustained 5g performance with gigabit-plus speeds, low latency and security. let me provide an example of a new use case. we are collaborating with a tier one carrier in western europe for digital transformation.
this program is powering a wide range of innovative use cases across multiple sectors. one such use case is for mission-critical search and rescue efforts in which our 5g mobile solutions are being leveraged to greatly improve time to locate and rescue injured persons. by utilizing drones outfitted with location equipment and cameras, search and rescue teams can map unknown areas, especially areas with complex terrain before deploying a land team. our solution is enabling real-time mapping with ultra-fast processing of massive data. use cases like this are not possible with lower speeds and higher latency of legacy technologies. next, let's talk about fixed wireless access. in the first half of the year, we released a series of 5g fwa products including two indoor products and two rugged outdoor products, which were certified for use in many markets globally. we also just released a new industrial 5g gateway purpose-built for vertical markets. response has been extremely positive, and we believe 5g fwa will be a major revenue driver for us moving forward. in addition to anchor channel partners who've been quick to adopt our portfolio, we secured four product awards with operators in the u.s., australia and the middle east. also note that we now have five 5g products certified by both t-mobile and verizon including hotspots and fwa. these new products are the primary drivers of the dramatic increase in customer engagements, and they will be instrumental in driving revenue growth in the coming quarters. let me highlight three factors that are driving the adoption of these 5g products. first, the 5g networks continue to be rolled out at an aggressive pace, and operators are looking to quickly capitalize on this newly added network capacity. this is reinforced by the work-from-anywhere paradigm and a growing enterprise customer pool. second, the breadth and depth of our 5g portfolio is resonating with customers. our partners and customers tell us that inseego products bring out the best in their networks. no other vendor has the performance of our 4g and 5g solutions. not only are inseego solutions fast, but they are extremely reliable and proven to deliver consistent throughput for long periods of time. and our new fixed wireless outdoor products can also sustain better connection at exceptionally long distances. in addition, our products are built with a security-first mindset with multiple layers of security built in our proprietary hard and operating system software, which is at the core of all of our devices. in this environment with ransomware and security breaches dramatically rising, everyone is coming to the realization that security is one of the killer apps for 5g. the combination of performance and security is unique to inseego and creates a highly differentiated, competitive advantage. to put it simply, no other company empowers users to connect wirelessly with confidence like inseego.
third, our strategic decision last year to increase our investments in go-to-market is yielding fantastic results. i'm very pleased with our performance and momentum across all geographies, all market segments and all products. we're building a strong pipeline of 5g customer opportunities across many enterprise segments and our global markets. allow me to now go over some of the use cases that are driving this incredible growth in user engagement for our fwa products. the work-from-anywhere shift across the board has increased the demand. when the pandemic began, business continuity or connect first was paramount and often meant that security considerations took a backseat. this created significant vulnerabilities to an enterprise's overall network security posture. now as we come out of the pandemic, we're seeing demand extend beyond work-from-home as enterprises look to create more flexible work environments for their workforces. our fwa portfolio is a natural choice as it improves on the already impressive capabilities of our mobile hotspots with stronger antennas, better heat dissipation that allows for 24/7 use and centralized cloud management. another growing use case is the branch office or remote location connectivity. whereas in the past wireless was used as a backup, the capabilities of our 5g products allow enterprises to make wireless their primary source of broadband. for example, we are working with household name retail outlets but deep inside shopping malls, a heavy equipment manufacturer wanting to implement digital pin application at a remote location and a global airline to light up secure wireless connectivity at all their gates, just to name a few. with our record-breaking long distance connectivity capabilities, work-from-anywhere locations such as secluded industrial parks, remote logistics centers, pop-up emergency response centers and other rural and outdoor settings can be lit up with high-speed wireless access in no time.
we are seeing this in action now through trials and pilots across the globe. we're also working with the police department in one of the largest metro areas here in the united states. they're piloting an application to deploy new innovative counterterrorism tactics leveraging our wavemaker fw2010 millimeter wave solution to enable a secure and reliable live stream of 4k surveillance video at the edge where fiber would just not be economically feasible. another exciting pilot leveraging our 5g fwa cpes is the department of defense testbed powered by a handful of partners to demonstrate a smart warehouse for a military logistics space. a secure 5g network ensures the necessary material is ready to deploy around the world at a moment's notice. in this example, inseego 5g solutions are enabling several applications, including autonomous vehicles for inventory management, machine learning for inventory tracking, and augmented reality for improved workforce efficiency. again, these incredible use cases and applications were not possible before with other broadband technologies. lastly, let me cover the progress of our software business that continues to perform well. during the first half of this year, we added over 65 new large enterprise customers to our inseego manage software subscription customer base. major retailers and wholesalers are using our cloud to securely connect, configure and monitor operations in distributed locations. we will continue to drive new cloud innovations to improve our software attach rates. in closing, i'm proud of the 5g and cloud innovations we've been bringing to market, which are driving such phenomenal growth for inseego. our unique ability to bring out the best in a network is making inseego the partner of choice to deliver 5g solutions to the enterprise. our team will continue the rapid pace of innovation so we can continue fueling the fantastic growth we are seeing with 5g. and now, i would like to hand the call over to bob.
robert g. barbieri -- interim chief financial officer
thank you, ashish. let me now review the results of our second quarter fiscal 2021. before i start, i would like to remind everyone that year-over-year comparisons will be impacted by the pandemic-driven surge for current and 4g hotspots, which began in the june quarter last year and continued through the remainder of fiscal 2020. that demand for our latest generation 4g products has now normalized at a level higher than where it was pre-pandemic. with that, let us get into the results. q2 revenue was $65.7 million, up 14% from the prior quarter's $57.6 million. the strong result was driven by 5g solution revenue, which was up 71% sequentially and 182% from the prior year. second quarter iot & mobile solutions revenue was $51.8 million, up 20.7% quarter-over-quarter due to the strength of the 5g solution sales. accelerating sell-through of 5g products led to strong reorders in the quarter from our current partners, t-mobile in particular. enterprise saas solutions revenue of $13.9 million was down 5.3% from q1 and up 21.8% from q2 of 2020. the year-over-year increase resulted from continued subscriber growth and ctrack rest of the world that we are now able to recognize as covid-related restrictions have eased in some countries allowing inseego to install our iot modules. cash at the end of q2 was $40.4 million and includes $5.8 million of cash classified as held-for-sale as well as $3.7 million of restricted cash related to the sale of ctrack south africa. the decrease in our cash balance is reflective of increased r&d spending on 5g products and net working capital adjustments. we continue to diligently manage use of cash including working capital, and we expect cash burn will steadily decline in the coming quarters consistent with our free cash flow positive goal for inseego. with respect to the sale of ctrack south africa, the deal closed on july 30 with net proceeds of approximately $36.6 million. you will see that amount reflected in the balance sheet when we report our q3 results.
from this point forward, i will focus on non-gaap measures. a reconciliation from gaap to non-gaap is detailed in our earnings release and is found on our ir webpage. gross margin for the iot & mobile business was 24%, down from 26.1% in the prior quarter but up from 23% in the prior year. the decline from the prior quarter was due to product mix, more specifically much stronger hardware sales versus q1. we expect gross margin to steadily improve through the year as we see a higher mix of 5g and software revenue. this dynamic is visible in the 100 basis point improvement from q2 fiscal 2020. enterprise saas solution gross margin was approximately 60%, which is roughly in line with the prior quarter and prior year. our q2 operating expense was $28 million, up $1.3 million from the prior quarter, and up from $22.9 million in the prior year. the increase in operating expense year-over-year reflects the investments we have made to take advantage of the considerable 5g opportunities we are pursuing. the significant increase in engagement and the opportunity pipeline is clear evidence we were right in pursuing this path. q2 net loss was $8.7 million or $0.08 a share compared with a loss of $7.7 million or $0.08 a share in the prior quarter and a loss of $1.3 million or $0.01 in the year before. our adjusted ebitda loss of $51,000 improves on the prior quarter's loss of $868,000 but is down from the pandemic aided ebitda gain of $4.3 million last year. for additional details on non-gaap and adjusted ebitda results, please refer to the reconciliation tables in our press release. finally, some thoughts for the rest of 2021. we have seen a significant expansion of our sales pipeline with the carriers, especially with our fixed wireless products and from enterprises. and as a result, we remain confident to reiterate the second half of the year will be stronger than the first half. in addition, we expect to see iot & mobile grow sequentially for the rest of this fiscal year. with that, let me turn it back to dan for his closing remarks.
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
thanks, bob. before moving to q&a, i want to welcome stephanie bowers to our board of directors. stephanie brings a wealth of experience in international relations and government affairs, and we're delighted to have her join our board. she will be instrumental in opening new global markets for inseego by helping us with the security, supply chain and government approval aspects of our 5g products. on the cfo search, we continue to make good progress and we have narrowed our list of candidates. that said, bob has been doing an excellent job. i am in no great rush and plan on taking the necessary time to find the right candidate. one that will have the experience and capabilities to support the growth of our next-generation 5g and software solutions. i will conclude by expressing my sincere thanks to our dedicated employees who continue to execute so amazingly well in these challenging times. they are the driving force behind the strong second quarter and the tremendous growth in our opportunity pipeline, and i can't thank them enough. their accomplishments gives us even more confidence in our ability to become a high growth, high margin, 5g and software-as-a-service, global solutions company. thanks again, everyone.

[operator instructions] our first question will come from lance vitanza with cowen & co. please go ahead.
lance vitanza -- cowen & co. -- a
hi. thanks guys. thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the quarter. let me start actually, maybe if ashish, could you talk a little bit more or dan, could you talk a little bit more about how the sales funnel for cloud software has developed over the past few months? i don't know if that's best discussed in terms of the number of channel partners or the number of active engagements, but if there's any details that you could provide there, that would be helpful? and then i have a follow up with respect to revenue as well, but i'll stop there for now.
ashish sharma -- president
lance, hope you're doing well. so the funnel is developing really well. we just also said in our script today that we've signed now multiple large carriers who are now attaching our cloud software to the 5g products. we are shipping to them. so that's through the carrier channel and then through the channel pretty much most all the products we are pushing now with 5g has a cloud component to it. so it's looking really solid. it is still early days as you know, the motion of selling through the distribution is new in multiple regions, but our pipeline is extremely solid. and we now have first projects pretty much in all of these focus use where we are shipping product through the channel.
lance vitanza -- cowen & co. -- a
okay. and then actually with respect to fwa, obviously that's sort of central to the story and we've seen a lot of carriers locally making a lot of news about the pace at which they expect to be rolling out their fixed wireless. and obviously that's beneficial for inseego. is it safe to say that the carrier actions are reflection of a supply chain that is more than ample to support that growth? i mean, just-i'm just trying to sort of get a sense for what risk we could see from this point forward with respect to part shortages and so forth?
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
hey lance, it's dan. so good to speak with you again. thanks for question. well, we talked about our supply chain dynamics and a lot of credit goes to our team and what we're able to do. it cuts across both fixed wireless and mobile hotspots, no real fundamental difference given the commonality of the parts as we mentioned in our platform. but we are not-we can only speak for inseego. we're not constrained in our supply. we had significant orders for fixed wireless toward the end of this quarter as part of the t-mobile getting ready for their launch. so, we're very bullish on how that looks going forward in q4 and extremely bullish how we see fixed wireless accelerating in 2022.
lance vitanza -- cowen & co. -- a
okay. if i could squeeze one more question in about the margin improvement, is the way to think about that you had roughly, and this is just at iot mobility services, you had about 220 basis point improvement in gross margin year-over-year. if we adjust for the $1 million of higher freight costs, i don't know if that was all in iot, but then we'd be looking at more like a 420-basis point year-over-year improvement. and that's despite $20 million of lower revenues from camping off of the, sort of the covid surge if you will. so, whether we're talking 220 or 420, is that all just the benefit that you talked about earlier with respect to the mix shift to enterprise and software, or were there other factors that were influencing gross margin, especially to the extent that some of those might be reversing in fourth quarter of 2022?
ashish sharma -- president
yes, go ahead, bob.
bob barbieri -- chief financial officer
yes, sure. lance hi. yes, you are correct the approximate million dollars of costs associated with some of the freight charges that was about 160 basis points. looking forward, which is your question, we don't see anything kind of unusual happening. so, i think you should think about that in terms of kind of a steady type of outlook as we go forward if that's helpful to you. and again, the other thing to think about margin is as more of our mix moves to 5g, 5g brings with it software. now the software is ratable over 36 months, so you don't get an immediate impact in the period, but when you are as building up increasing layers of gross margin over time, which will bode well for the future.
lance vitanza -- cowen & co. -- a
that's really helpful. thanks guys. i'll pass the baton.
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
thank you, lance.

[operator instructions] our next question will come from scott searle with roth capital. please go ahead.
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
hey guys thanks for taking my questions. i apologize, i got a on the call a little bit late, so i apologize again if this is redundant. but i'm wondering what sort of call you provided in terms of the 5g mix in the quarter in terms of more consumer fixed wireless access versus enterprise or hotspot applications? and then also just to clarify, i think, the 60% figure in the release talking about 5g and cloud, i want to make sure i understand what's going into cloud. is that just the ctrack business that's remaining or there are some other components to that as well? just to calibrate me, then i had a couple of follows.
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. hey scott, i think, yes, we can run through those pretty quickly out of the remarks we made earlier. so, ashish, why don't you just recap?
ashish sharma -- president
yes. hey scott, good talking to you.
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
hey ashish.
ashish sharma -- president
yes, hey, so a couple of the questions you asked on the 5g side, pretty much most of the product is going into enterprise, both the mobile broadband product and the enterprise product through the carriers and through other different digital and large channels. so, there's some segments of consumers who might buy here and there, but majority of it is all toward the enterprise. fwa in particular, it is all enterprise. and we are seeing, as i described in my script, we are seeing some really good and cool use cases across the board from multiple different verticals within the enterprises. so that's on the 5g. and then your second question about cloud software, we've got multiple different cloud software we are now attaching to these devices. so, we've got the ctrack software, you talked about, that's one piece to it. second one is our cloud management software. and the third one is inseego subscribe which is a subscription management software that we attached to certain customers. so, it's a mix of multiple layers and we're building more and more layers as we move forward to create better value prop and better margins in our structure.
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
got you. and ashish maybe just to follow-up on the 5g enterprise front, coming out of mobile world congress americas last week, a lot of in terms of what's going on from a private network standpoint, et cetera. you guys certainly play into that. i'm wondering how aggressively are you seeing the adoption cycles there, because it seems like there's an interest, but the implementations and the trial periods, i'm wondering if you could provide some color on that in terms of the magnitude of the size of the deals that are starting to fill up in that pipeline, the timing and the pilot phase, if you will, and how big the magnitude of those deployments actually look like?
ashish sharma -- president
yes, good question, scott, first off, just tremendous progress there. like quarter-over-quarter, we see lot more activity and it's not just talk anymore, we are seeing new projects. we are seeing certain verticals, like school districts trying to adopt a private network for their use cases. and so, deployments are happening right now. they are starting small, but some of these school districts and private enterprises, they tend to have multisite in different places, which we are starting to see that eventually over next few quarters, there's got to be some scale to this. and this is a real, nice, new tam and sam developing for not just us, but for the 5g market.
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
okay. and, and less of a good, maybe two more the 25% growth, as you look out to next year, i'm kind of wondering what you see as the biggest driver in terms of pushing that forward over the next several quarters? and then also on the ctrack front, now that you've sold off the south african portion, it's a much smaller business, doesn't have as much scale there, but i think it's an overall attractive offering. strategically how does that fit into to the portfolio? is that an asset that you look to keep and build upon, or is that possible that you look to monetize that going forward? thanks guys.
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes, hey scott, thanks. let me just start off and i'll ask ashish to chime in. in terms of 2022, we certainly see fixed wireless, 5g fixed wireless as a major driver of that. there's obviously layers on the cake we're adding more carrier and enterprise customers. our enterprise business is relatively small, but it's on a high growth curve. we built a very impressive and growing pipeline, and it's kind of indicative with those, the various use cases that ashish ran through. those are real-life instances out of that enterprise pipeline. continuing the attach rates of cloud, that's continuing to grow and that's a layer. so, there's a combination of our international business, our growth in carriers, extra slots with carriers, now, t-mobile has taken our mobile hotspot as well as fixed wireless. cloud is a whole combination of things that are really our strong tailwinds, scott, as we go into 2022. and that gives us confidence in providing guidance. and i realize we've not done that for a long time. so, we wanted to start, now provide guidance and talk about full year 2022. so that's what we've done on this call.
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
hey dan, if i could just follow-up on that front, have you disclosed the number of carriers that you are coming virtually shipping to now for fwa solutions and what you would expect that to look like toward the middle of 2022? thanks.
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. thanks scott. no, we have not. we'll continue to make announcements. we obviously did a major one yesterday with t-mobile, fixed wireless for their enterprise business. but more to come and just the market can add now from the announcements, but we're not really breaking them out and reporting them per se. thanks you.
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
thanks.

[operator instructions] our next question will come from mike latimore with northland capital. pease go ahead.
unidentified participant
hi, this is aditya [phonetic] the on behalf of mike latimore. could you tell me how much did international revenue contribute as a percentage of overall revenue?
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
we do not break that out externally. so sorry about that. but as we go forward, certainly, we'll consider more and more color around some other breaks in our revenue stride, but right now we do not break that out.
unidentified participant
all right. could you tell me at least how many, ten percentage customers did you have in this quarter?
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
it would be reported in the queue.
bob barbieri -- chief financial officer
the two.
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes.
bob barbieri -- chief financial officer
yes. the answer is two.
unidentified participant
two. all right. all right, fine. and could we give some color on when could we start expecting the 5g sales to exceed the 4g sales? could we start seeing that from the 4q?
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
well, i'll start off ask ashish to comment. i mean, we're seeing rapid growth in 5g, as we talked about, it was 42% of our revenue this quarter as we reported a year ago, 9%. so clearly, it's growing. now having said that 4g business is a steady business and so what we're seeing is an additive effect. we eventually would see naturally through technology transition, 5g, overtake 4g. so, i would say, it's going to happen in the relatively near future, just as a function of 4g staying steady and 5g growing rapidly, of course. ashish if you want to...
ashish sharma -- president
yes, it's exactly what dan said. i think sometime next year that will happen. so, in not-too-distant future.
unidentified participant
all right. all right, fine. thank you.
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer

this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to dan mondor for closing remarks.
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
okay. well, thank you operator. so, thanks again, everyone for joining and for the great questions. as you heard, we are executing against our strategic plan and expanding our customer base and certainly rapidly expanding our product line. and also, i think it's important to note we're creating complete solutions by bundling our cloud software with our devices. so, what does that mean? that means improved margins and where you are sticking this. the other comment i think you've heard fixed wireless, or enterprise is taking off. and we absolutely believe we are seeing the point of inflection in fixed wireless, and that will continue to ramp up and be a major part of 2022. so that's why we see 2022 to be a real breakout year for inseego.
i'll just close by giving a huge shout out to our great, great employees, you folks absolutely rock. so, i'll close by saying i look forward to speaking with you again on the fourth quarter call. thanks again, everyone.

hello, and welcome to inseego corp's third quarter 2021 financial results conference call. please note, today's event is being recorded. [operator instructions] on the call today are dan mondor, chairman and ceo; ashish sharma, president; bob barbieri, interim chief financial officer and other members of the management team.
during this call, non-gaap financial measures will be discussed. a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures is included in the earnings release, which is available on the investors' section of the company's website. an audio replay of this call will also be archived there. please also be advised that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but are rather based on the company's current expectations and beliefs. for a discussion on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations, please refer to the risk factors described in our form 10-k, 10-q and other sec filings, which are available on our website. please also refer to the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements section contained in today's press release.
i would now like to turn the call over to dan mondor, chairman and ceo. please go ahead.
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
thank you, operator, and hello, everyone. thanks for joining the call today. i'm pleased to report a very strong third quarter results with revenue coming in at $66.2 million. this represents a sequential growth over last quarter of 9% after adjusting for the sale of ctrack south africa. the strong topline performance was driven by 5g with key customers, channel partners for our enterprise offerings and new international customers in both carrier and enterprise segments. we are seeing traction across our entire 5g portfolio, including our fixed wireless access products, which will be a major contributor to our growth in 2022. recent large customer traction with both carriers and enterprises is an important validation of our strategy to remake the company into the leader in 5g edge connectivity solutions.
as you saw on our press release, we are thrilled to announce an expanded relationship with t-mobile, who is now launching our indoor 5g fixed wireless access product as a stock product for its enterprise customers. this is the most significant fixed wireless deal in inseego's history and represents an exciting phase of our expanding relationship with t-mobile as it aims to sign up seven to eight million fixed wireless subscribers by 2025. this indoor rotor called the fx2000 is a perfect product for any carriers, small office home office, small medium business and enterprise customers, including companies with work-from-home employees. the investments we have made in new product innovation over the past few years are paying off. 5g revenue now comprises 42% of total revenue versus only 9% last year. and our other significant investment priority, our cloud software business now represents 20% of total revenue and is increased in impressive 25% year-over-year.
in aggregate our new next generation products defined as 5g and cloud software continue to grow rapidly. they are up 124% year-over-year. these products now represent 62% of total revenue up from 43% in the first quarter. this marks a significant progress as the company pushes to free cash flow positive. our fixed wireless access products are also gaining traction outside north america as we also sign deals with two international tier 1 wireless network operators, with launches scheduled this quarter, one with a mobile operator in the middle east and the other with telstra in australia.
as i've said in the past, we believe the international addressable market is significant. and our global platform approach is providing excellent product market fit and represents the largest addressable market expansion in our history. across every region we see enterprises taking a leadership role in developing and deploying 5g use cases, an accelerated rate and it's the primary reason why we launched our direct enterprise sales initiative last year. this quarter saw an increasing number of pilots and rfps entering the deployment phase. order flow from our expanding value-added resellers and distributor partners also continues to grow both domestically and abroad. in the end, our goal is to sell to the enterprises through both our carrier customers and through our growing channel distributors and resellers.
now ashish will provide additional color on the diverse use cases in which inseego's secure edge connectivity and device management solutions are being leveraged.
lastly, i'd like to touch on supply chain dynamics. as you know, this is a significant issue across many industries. doug kahn and his team are working tirelessly to secure key components in conjunction with our partner foxconn. they have done a fabulous job keeping products flowing. we expect supply constraints to remain the norm for the foreseeable future, but we are working every day to minimize the impact on our business and to continue to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis. that being said, we believe our supply chain capability is a source of competitive advantage. while we have seen elevated freight costs, we have not seen the major disruptions experienced by many of our competitors.
in closing, we are pleased with our continued strong growth in our 5g and cloud software businesses across carrier and enterprise markets. we are confident that 2022 will be the best year in inseego's long history. and we have a high degree of confidence that we are well positioned to achieve approximately 25% revenue growth as our customers accelerate their commercial 5g deployments in 2022 and beyond.
now, before i turn the call over to ashish, i want to say how delighted we are to welcome bob barbieri as our permanent cfo. since bob joined inseego as interim cfo in early april, he has demonstrated tremendous leadership and his extensive operating experience has proved invaluable. as we evaluated various cfo candidates it became obvious to us that bob is the ideal cfo to help us successfully execute on our strategic priorities.
with that, let me turn the call over to ashish, who will share more details regarding deals that have progressed beyond the pilot phase to actual deployments and are rapidly moving forward toward revenue generation for inseego.
ashish sharma -- president
thank you, dan. let me also join dan in recognizing the inseego team for delivering another solid quarter and achieving a major milestone in q3.
we had outstanding performance in the third quarter, driven by strength across our 5g and software portfolio. and as dan mentioned, it now represents 62% of our overall business. our product order growth was the highest we've seen in recent history and we are continuing to see strong customer deception of our 5g product innovations. notably, our 5g revenue surpassed $25 million during this quarter representing triple digit growth year-over-year. increased demand and accelerating digital transformation have increased the need for our 5g solutions. this great momentum is reaffirming our position as the worldwide leader in 5g technology that is enabling access to a new generation of broadband, now possible with legacy technologies.
as dan mentioned, let me spend a moment on the most important announcement so far in our 5g fwa efforts. i am thrilled that t-mobile for business is launching our compact indoor 5g solution for their enterprise customers. this achievement is a testament to the diligent efforts by the inseego team that has been working side by side with t-mobile and its customers for many months. we have a number of additional 5g fwa products certified by t-mobile. and we are incredibly excited about the pipeline of opportunities we with them. in addition to t-mobile, we also signed up new service provider customers in australia and the middle east. we recently shipped 5g middle east products to these customers to support launches in the fourth quarter.
as i think about the transformation of inseego over the past several quarters, three things give me confidence in our ability to achieve our financial goals. first is the validation of our significant fwa product investment over the past 24 months with important wins with multiple tier 1 carriers and fortune 500 enterprise accounts. given these recent wins, both announced and un announced, we expect to see material revenue contribution in 2022 with fwa driving a majority of our growth next year and beyond. i can see a time in the near future where fwa revenue exceeds our current hotspot revenue, given the significantly larger market these products address.
second, is the diversification of our revenue streams. there was a time in the not so distant past where majority of our revenue came from a single product the hotspot sold to a single carrier. everything we have done over the last three years has been to change that dynamic. as of today, we have two technology lines in 4g lte and 5g, which also includes our cloud technology for a complete solution. today we sell to virtually every carrier in north america, including the two largest 5g providers in the u.s. we also sell directly to a growing list of large enterprises, who are integrating 5g into their business. we are doing this not only in north america, but also in europe, the middle east and asia; this is no longer [indecipherable].
third is the important revenue mix shift underway. you've heard a stock in prior earning calls about the higher margins we are seeing with our 5g solutions. as the same engine that powers mobile hotspots is at the heart of all of our 5g solutions, including the 5g fwa solutions. the ability to use a common engine across all solutions allows for significant operating leverage. in addition, we are seeing a significant uptick of our cloud software alongside our fwa products. this adds both attractive, gross margins and an important recording revenue component to our business. on prior quarterly calls, i illustrated examples of customer pilots we've been conducting in order to give everyone a sense of the amazing opportunities ahead of us. this quarter i'm pleased to announce that we are beginning to see some of these trials go live and the momentum is accelerating across numerous verticals.
to start, we are seeing some interesting industry 4.0 use cases. one large systems integrator in europe that is a recognized global leader in the manufacturing vertical is testing our 5g fwa product line to enable high capacity, low latency data capabilities for the automotive manufacturing market. we are also working with a factory that manufactures telecom equipment. in this use case they're testing our industrial 5g cpe fw2000e to power automation and robotics with the goal to find new innovative ways to improve workplace safety and to create more agility on the production side.
in the education market kipp socal public schools is using our 5g indoor routers for in-classroom wi-fi, bringing high speed internet to charter public schools in underserved areas and connecting students to new ar/vr learning experiences. and in utah, two school districts are using our outdoor fwa solution in a cbrs private network to provide long distance connectivity for students who live in the remote areas. as mentioned on prior earning calls, cbrs and private networks are key focus areas for us. in addition to the u.s. case in utah, i just described a couple of other customers are using cloud managed 5g connectivity, including one of the top 25 business schools in the u.s. that university is testing our 5g solutions to provide on campus connectivity for their dorms and a collection of hotels in a large u.s. city is testing our solution with the goal to improve the quality of internet services for their guests.
in kentucky, our new industrial gateway is being deployed on downtown light poles and city parks to connect public wi-fi access points. similarly in australia, a manufacturer of solar powered street lights is using our 5g cpe to provide public wi-fi and connect surveillance cameras in areas where wire connections are impractical or impossible. the utility sector is another interest vertical point for inseego with needs to connect critical infrastructure in the remote areas. in europe for example, we are working with a large global systems integrator to enable real time monitoring of wind turbines. public safety is another market where we are seeing 5g use cases. a major city in arizona is using our outdoor 5g millimeter wave solution to provide high speed broadband for remote monitoring and high traffic areas. in the healthcare industry trecs university in tennessee is using our 5g solutions for low latency connections to enable virtual reality applications to help train medical professionals in operating procedures. and we are engaged in a trial with an integrated healthcare network to power their facilities across the u.s. these are just a few examples of the diverse and exciting use cases being powered by our 5g solutions.
lastly, we continue to make good progress with our cloud software business that is now 20% off our revenue. during this quarter, we signed large 5g fwa service provider customers who are attaching our cloud software solutions to their 5g offerings for multi-year terms. while these are still early days, it validates our strategy of investments and software to improve our value proposition, as well as improve our margins over the long-term.
and now i would like to turn the call over to bob.
bob barbieri -- chief financial officer
thank you, ashish. let me now review the results of our third quarter fiscal 2021. before i start, let me tell everyone how proud i am to have been named chief financial officer. i started this assignment as i would with any other client to enhance the financial function at inseego. additionally, i was very happy connecting with the financial and executive leadership team to improve and strengthen the processes that we have in running the business. i see this as critically important. as i spent the last several months with the team, i became impressed with the potential this organization holds, and i'm excited to stay on as the chief financial officer of inseego.
with that let me get to the financials. as a reminder to everyone please note that year-over-year comparisons will include the pandemic driven surge in sales of 4g hotspots, which began in the june quarter of last year and continue through the remainder of fiscal 2020. in addition, remember we close the sale of our ctrack south africa unit on july 30th of this year. i will be providing comparisons that reflect inseego's financial performance on a pro forma basis that excludes ctrack south africa. q3 revenue with $66.2 million, up 1% from last quarter, but down from the prior year period because of the covid related surge in demand for 4g products last year. adjusted before the sale of ctrack south africa, revenue was up a robust 9% from the last quarter. the strong sequential result was driven by accelerating demand for 5g and cloud software solutions whose revenue was up 124% from the prior year.
third quarter iot and mobile solutions revenue was approximately $57 million; up almost 10% quarter-over-quarter from what was a strong q2. this quarter-over-quarter growth was a result of accelerating self through 5g hotspots at both verizon and t-mobile, our international service provider expansion and the initial selling of our 5g fwa devices into t-mobile as a result of our expanded relationship. enterprise saas solutions revenue of $9.2 million, which included one-month of ctrack south africa revenue; after adjusting for the impact of the sale of ctrack south africa enterprise saas solutions revenue was up 9.9% year-over-year, driven by the growth in recurring subscription revenue and ctrack across the world over the past 12 months and down 1% quarter-over-quarter due to unfavorable foreign exchange movements and a seasonal increase in hardware sales.
cash at the end of q3 was $61.6 million and includes $36.6 million of cash we received as payment for the sale of ctrack south africa, which closed on july 30th. there will also be a favorable working capital adjustment of $2.6 million we expect to receive in q4. from this point forward, i will focus on non-gaap measures. a reconciliation from gaap to non-gaap is detailed in our earnings release and is available on our ir webpage. gross margin for the iot and mobile business was 24.4%, a slight improvement over the 24% last quarter and 30 basis points better than the 24.1% in q3 of 2020. as dan discussed earlier, gross margin in q3 was impacted by approximately $1 million in higher freight costs, but we were still able to improve the margin sequentially in year-over-year due to a favorable mix of higher asp devices, as well as our rapidly growing software business.
assuming similar trends in our product mix and absent any unforeseen factors we see potential for further improvement and gross margin going forward. our q3 operating expense was $25.8 million, down $2.2 million from q2, but up $1.2 million from prior year quarter. the increase in operating expense year-over-year reflects the investments made to take advantage of the 5g opportunities we are pursuing. q3 net loss was $8.2 million or $0.08 a share in line with the prior quarter, but down from the positive $1.4 million or $0.01 per share in the prior year. again last year's performance benefited significantly for what was the high water mark of the covid surge in demand for our 4g products. our ebitda loss of $773,000 was higher than the 51,000 loss in q2 and was down from the positive $7.4 million last year. the sequential decline was largely due to the sale of ctrack south africa and the $1 million of higher freight costs i discussed earlier. for additional details on non-gaap and adjusted ebitda results please refer to the reconciliation tables in our press release.
finally, some thoughts on the rest of 2021 and 2022. we continue to execute on our 5g cloud solutions and we're encouraged by strong current demand in our increasing opportunity pipeline as ashish and dan mentioned, we see the company entering the new phase of growth in 2022, as we benefit from fwa accelerating both in the u.s. and internationally. the growth and higher margin enterprise sales and uptake in cloud software, alongside device sales. given this, we are confident in our ability to achieve approximately 25% revenue growth in 2022 pro forma after taking into the account ctrack south africa business. we also plan on moderating operating expenses on a growth basis. on an as reported basis however, please note that fluctuations in our capitalized r&d costs may result in higher net operating expenses in any given quarter. from my analysis of the operating model, i believe there is significant capacity, and as we return to growth in 2022 we should begin to see improved operating leverage. this in turn should support adjusted ebida growth in excessive our revenue growth rate. in terms of our view of next year, the management team is comfortable with the current street consensus of $310 million of revenue. we will begin providing more detail guidance as we enter 2022.
lastly, given our revenue growth and margin improvement expectations, we're currently targeting the second half of 2022 to turn free cash positive. again, i want to thank dan and the board for giving me the opportunity to become inseego's new chief financial officer. i look forward to meeting all of our existing and prospective shareholders in the coming months.
with that, let turn it back to dan for his closing comments.
dan mondor -- chairman & chief executive officer
thank you, bob. and welcome again to the inseego team. i have some final comments before we turn it over to q&a. when we made the decision to accelerate our investments in nextgen, 5g and cloud, our primary goals were to check three boxes. first to ensure we would be first to market with highly differentiated 5g products. second, to create a common rf engine that could be used across all of our products sold to both carriers and enterprise markets that not only improves our time to market, but creates significant operating leverage. and third to build a scalable cloud software platform that in combination with our 5g products creates a complete solution for our customers. as we near the end of the year, i couldn't be more proud of all that we have accomplished. and our performance in the third quarter is clear evidence of that. as we look ahead, i am also optimistic that we will see significant growth driven by an acceleration in both carrier and enterprise deployments of our cloud managed 5g portfolio.

thank you. [operator instructions] and the first question will come from scott searle with roth capital. please go ahead.
scott searle -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. dan, ashish, congrats on new roles.
ashish sharma -- president
thank you.
scott searle -- roth capital partners -- analyst
just maybe quickly to dive in on the gross margin front. bob, i'm wondering if you could provide a little bit more color in terms of the gross margins being down, how much of that is coming from component, freight or otherwise? and then as we look forward into 2022, typical seasonality in the first quarter, i mean how much gross margin pressure do you expect to persist on mobile and iot solutions in the first half? and where do you think we exit the year in 2022?
bob barbieri -- chief financial officer
hey, scott, hi. good questions. let me start with this. i think overarching and important point is we don't expect q4 to reflect our margin expectations for all of '22.
so we faced three major headwinds. one was basically by divesting of our south african business. think of that as about a point and a half of margin compression because we did have the benefit of that in q3 sequentially. second, we didn't have logistics and freight costs.
no surprise, something we chatted about in the past and probably to a similar impact, but we do see stabilization there, and we're not expecting worsening of that. and also, one of the things we took advantage of is an education opportunity. we've managed our supply chain and our capacity quite well, and we had an opportunistic situation where we could take advantage of this opportunity that was in the mix at a slightly lower margin, still profitable, still a contributor and that also kind of affected q4. each of those three things, we do not see continuing as a drag.
so we're not giving outlook for the specific line of gross margin for this coming year as of yet. but we think q4 is not the barometer or the run rate that you'll expect to see from us. so we're feeling we also have some tailwinds that are merging. we see enterprise solutions kind of growing in mix and importance.
that will add to our margin mix. software also as we kind of keep build up and scott, as you know, most of our software is engaged in a 36-month saas type of model. so that is a gentle ramp up, including in the mix of our overall revenue stack. and that will also improve the mix inside of gross margin.
so with that that's the -- that summarize the guidance or the outlook we're ready to provide right now. but i think during the year, we're going to articulate maybe a bit deeper. but i don't want people to kind of miscalculate or miss-assume what's going on here. so we do see an upward trend in margin throughout this coming year.
scott searle -- roth capital partners -- analyst
perfect. bob, that's very helpful. ashish, if i could, in terms of the outlook and the guidance, reaffirming the 25% adjusted growth is encouraging. it really implies the continued inflection in the back half of the year.
you talked about the pipeline of opportunities growing from 30, 12 months ago to over 200 i think the number was you put out there. i was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the pipeline of deals, the size of the deals, the adoption cycle and sales cycle there? and what gives you the confidence really in terms of your visibility, where we stand today that we get to that inflection point in the second half of this year? thanks, and congrats again.
ashish sharma -- president
yeah. thanks, scott. yeah, so let me provide some comments there, right? so first off, those pipeline deals we've been already engaged with all of last year, right? so many of those are beyond the initial stage of just getting the hands on the product, all of those customers have now acquired the products. they're loving them.
they're going through their internal decision-making of how to roll out 5g from a couple of places to hundreds or thousands of locations in some cases. so it's a process that the end customer goes through on how to switch their legacy wan from either 4g or from fixed technologies that they were using in the past to 5g now, and we're super optimistic on how that process is rolling along right now. and in most cases, i also want you to know and the rest of the gang here to know that we're working with large carrier partners in pretty much all of these deals, right? so we're super optimistic of where that journey takes us and just a lot of excitement from the customer base on these opportunities to use 5g for these use cases.
scott searle -- roth capital partners -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question will come from mike walkley with canaccord genuity. please go ahead.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions. dan, congrats for the year accomplished [inaudible] and ceo, ashish also my congrats on the promotion, well deserved.
ashish sharma -- president
thank you, mike.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
my first question, just kind of building off scott's multiple part first question, i don't think you answered the second part. just in thinking about seasonality for the year with all the pipeline of deals, is it kind of a normal sequentially lower q1 of q4 and then a steady build or is there more like an inflection into that second half of the year based on the timing of some of the deals combined with maybe a supply chain improvement?
ashish sharma -- president
hey, mike, ashish here. yeah, so listen, we've got multiple growth drivers throughout 2022, right? so we've got our mobile business, which has been on growth path. so that goes on its own project pre with more customers who are winning as we just launched with zain recently. we've got our fwa business that we've signed up new fwa carriers globally in multiple markets.
then we've got the enterprise pipeline, which is what scott was asking about. so that's on a separate trajectory where we are working both with our carrier customers. in many cases, as a sell-with program, plus we are working through distribution channel in multiple markets in australia, middle east, europe, north america. so that's on its own trajectory.
in addition to that, we also are growing significantly in our software business, right? so you take a look at all of those growth drivers. and so it's less about the seasonality of one of those. it's all about the mix of how we model them together for the 25% growth outlook for the year.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
gotcha. that's fair. and just trying to delve into a little deeper, even though it's off a smaller base on an as-adjusted basis, does software grow faster than hardware to contribute to margins exiting the year or do they kind of grow in parallel? any comments on those two different business growth rates.
ashish sharma -- president
yeah. they grow in parallel, mike. they grow in parallel. i mean, as we're shipping more and more 5g product to enterprise, the attach rates are high and that part of the business is growing.
now it will start to contribute more as the time goes along because the software recognition for a lot of the attach rates works that way. but yeah, it's all happening in parallel.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
great. thanks. and then, bob, a question for me as software ramps, you had the sale of ctrack, so you get kind of that negative effect on revenue. but as software ramps, where does that gross margin get to over time as you ramp it [audio gap]
bob barbieri -- chief financial officer
i think, mike, we've internally have not decided to put a specific number rather than provide direction. so i don't want to frustrate you or anyone in the audience. with that, we may come out with additional forms of outlook. but directionally, we see a good, solid contribution.
we do believe 5g, especially in the enterprise, higher gross margin as that grows in mix that will bring up the gross margin. second, software as we continue with the 36-month per sale ramp, that will become a bigger and bigger mix over time. and all of that saas follows a more traditional saas type of gross margin. so that improves the mix as well.
so perhaps later in the year, we'll maybe get a little bit more granular, but we're not ready to kind of make that commitment. but the direction is up.
operator
thank you. and the next question will come from jonnathan navarrete with cowen. please go ahead.
jonnathan navarrete -- cowen and company -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, and congrats, dan and ashish. so my first question, so i see that t-mobile is now the largest customer in terms of 5g. just trying to get a feel how much of the 5g revenue just t-mobile account for or roughly like in percentages perhaps?
ashish sharma -- president
so jonnathan, we have not broken that out publicly.
jonnathan navarrete -- cowen and company -- analyst
all right. ok. so on the next -- on the third quarter, 5g accounted for 42% of revenue cloud for '20. now in the fourth quarter, you mentioned that both segments of both products now represent 58%.
could you maybe give us a little bit more detail into how that 58% breaks out for 5g and cloud?
ashish sharma -- president
yeah, jonnathan, i can add to that. so that's about 19% or close to, say, 20% of that is software revenue, and the rest is 5g, which is close to 39%, 40%. and it slightly declined from a percentage perspective because we shipped more 4g product in q4 than we did in q3. so 5g actually did decline.
4g was more, and that was because even though 4g is all running really steady in the market, but we had some seasonality in the inventory stock up in q4 that caused the 4g revenue to be more than q3.
jonnathan navarrete -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. the next one, just two more on my end. so the goal still stands that by the second half of '22, the company will be positive in terms of free cash flow. does that imply that maybe by the end of '22 will the companies sort of breakeven or is it like a good possibility that it will end '22 on a positive note in terms of free cash flow?
bob barbieri -- chief financial officer
the outlook and the guidance we presented said when we exit this year we're in, we will be cash flow positive upon exiting the year.
jonnathan navarrete -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. there was just a second half. ok. and my last one, what do you expect in terms of capex for '22?
bob barbieri -- chief financial officer
i think capex would parallel our opex. so we're not presuming any growth. i mean, we kind of look at the place, almost like a fixed cost absorption type of model where we think we have both capacity in the field, capacity in our -- among our teams, both go-to-market and r&d teams and so on to grow at both a faster rate and a much higher level of revenue. so i think the best way to assume is we're not going to grow the cost and the capex lines, we're going to grow revenue.
jonnathan navarrete -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. ok. thank you.
bob barbieri -- chief financial officer
welcome.
operator
[operator instructions] next question will be from mike latimore with northland capital markets. please go ahead.
mike latimore -- northland capital markets -- analyst
yeah, thank you. and congrats, ashish and dan. just on the enterprise solutions, you highlighted that as a gross margin tailwind. i guess can you provide a little more color as to what are you thinking enterprise solutions gets to this year? is it sort of mid-single-digit percent of revenue or just some ballpark there? and then you also highlighted that i think a few carrier customers are in late stages of doing data plans for these products.
maybe just a little more color on that would be great.
ashish sharma -- president
yeah, mike, ashish. i could take that. so the first question about enterprise pipeline and [inaudible] that was the discussion earlier that we're still sort of in the early stages of the customers starting to deploy these 5g wan connectivity solutions at scale. so that is still, from a ramp perspective, ahead of us.
and so how that ramps up, like we're monitoring, we're working closely with the customers, and we are seeing great performance from the 5g networks from all the carriers we work with here and in the focused regions. so all is looking positive. and so once those scalable deployments start to convert, we'll start to see that as becoming a meaningful part of our revenue in later in the year. so that's one.
and second question, you asked about the 5g plans and packages. so that is still a work in progress in multiple geographies. we are seeing that our carrier partners are getting extremely creative as they build out the coverage in their networks on the type of plans that would then drive a lot of these enterprise offerings in the marketplace. so i don't want to speak on behalf of a certain carrier, but a bunch of it is out in the news that you can read.
but that's all happening in parallel as we are making this push with enterprise in the market.
mike latimore -- northland capital markets -- analyst
makes sense. makes sense. can you talk a little bit about your r&d levels? are you going to -- sounds like you're going to hold these roughly constant throughout year or how should we think about just the r&d line this year?
bob barbieri -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean i think the best way to think about it is anticipate r&d to be relatively flat. and in some situations, we've already pre-invested in some r&d that will get us to the outlook that we talked about and beyond. so we're not anticipating growth in r&d.
mike, the other thing is, as you know, r&d is also -- when it hits the p&l, i should say, it's reflective of what gets capitalized in period, as well as kind of prior period spending that is amortized. each of those is stratified by the type of projects. so sometimes there's quarter-to-quarter ins and outs that are not aligned with cash. it's more of how it translates to the p&l.
but overall, if you're thinking of spending and much of this will align with the p&l, think of we've -- flat to absorbing that and then growing the top line off the back of the r&d we've already put in place.
mike latimore -- northland capital markets -- analyst
ok. got it. and then just lastly, i guess, on the ctrack business, now that we're sort of coming out of covid, is there going to be a tailwind to this business? or how should we think about that, i guess?
ashish sharma -- president
yes. so mike, that's what we had mentioned earlier in the script is let us come back and articulate where we are taking that business as we are integrating that business with our 5g business and we see great use cases, we can deliver with the technology we've got there. as a stand-alone business, there is growth in that business. we had some slowdown because of covid last year and year before, but things are back on track.
but there's a bigger vision that we've got on taking that business, and we'll talk about that in the future earnings calls.
mike latimore -- northland capital markets -- analyst
sounds good. best of luck.
ashish sharma -- president
thank you.

operator
hello, and welcome to inseego corp.'s fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results conference call. please note that today's event is being recorded. all participants will be in a listen mode. [operator instructions] on the call today are dan mondor, chairman and ceo; ashish sharma, president; and bob barbieri, chief financial officer; and other members of the management team.
during this call, non-gaap financial measures will be discussed. a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures is included in the earnings release, which is available on the investors section of the company's website. an audio replay of this call will also be archived there. please also be advised that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements.
these forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on the company's current expectations and beliefs. for a discussion on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations, please refer to the risk factors described in our form 10-k, 10-q and other sec filings, which are available on our website. please also refer to the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements section contained in today's press release. i would now like to turn the call over to dan mondor, chairman and ceo.
please go ahead.
dan mondor -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks for joining the call today. 2021 proved to be a transformative year for inseego. the investments we have made have resulted in a remarkable year and paved the way for a very bright future. we are better positioned today than we have ever been by nearly every measure.
i'd like to touch on the two most important takeaways for this call. first, we had a great quarter with revenue of $72.9 million, up 15% sequentially when adjusting for the sale of ctrack south africa last summer. we improved on almost all our important benchmarks, including 5g revenue, recurring software revenue and others. we launched new products, one important new customer, both in north america and abroad and benefited from our supply chain investments over the last three years.
you'll hear the details from ashish and bob on this and more. the second is the announcement that ashish will be taking over as ceo, and i will assume the role of executive chairman. there are a couple of reasons that the board and i thought this was the right time to make this transition. the company that i joined in 2017 was very different from where we are today.
we had essentially one large carrier customer, a single hotspot product based on 4g technology underpinning everything and a balance sheet that needed fixing. today, inseego is an entirely different place with an entirely different future than we had five years ago. and it has also not the inseego just a year ago either. the future of this company will be driven by multiple 5g products, including importantly, our fixed wireless lineup, sold increasingly into the enterprise, whether alongside carriers or through distribution partners.
inseego will be centered around 5g though 4g is proving to be resilient and a broad portfolio of software solutions driving recurring revenue. ashish, who i recruited to join me here in the beginning has been the architect of our product and go-to-market strategy, including our industry-leading 5g road map and global rollout. we see 5g mobile, fixed wireless and software solutions for enterprise as our future instead of hardware devices sold to carriers. i am immensely proud of all that we have accomplished at inseego thanks to the hard work by many dedicated inseego employees.
so with our business model clearly validated and our leadership in 5g, this is the right time for ashish to assume leadership of the company and preside over what i see as the single largest opportunity in inseego's history. with that, let me turn the call over to ashish. 
ashish sharma -- president
thank you, dan. i'm honored to be named the next ceo of inseego and appreciate the confidence that dan and the board have shown in me. i'm very excited for the future of inseego and hope to accomplish as much as a ceo as we did over the last five years. we closed the year with an outstanding fourth quarter.
revenue was $72.9 million, which is sequential growth of 15% after adjusting for the sale of ctrack south africa and 10% on an as-reported basis. the stellar revenue performance reflects strong demand for our 5g and cloud portfolio across carrier and enterprise in our target markets. our business grew sequentially in each quarter of 2021, driven by 5g and software solutions. for the full year, 5g revenue increased 132% year over year and grew quarter over quarter throughout 2021.
and together with cloud solutions grew 73% in the fourth quarter compared to the first quarter on a pro forma basis. importantly, we are making solid progress in our transformation into an enterprise company. our 5g fwa pipeline has grown from 30 enterprise customers in early 2021 to over 200 and continues to grow at a rapid pace. our success with initial deployments and trials with global fortune 500 companies points to significant expansion opportunities in 2022 it is important to note that 5g has the unique capability to be adopted as primary wan connectivity by enterprises.
this is in stark contrast to 4g, which was predominantly utilized as temporary backup when wired broadband service failed. this makes a huge difference in how 5g will be deployed and is the fundamental reason the enterprise 5g addressable market is four times as large as our current carrier market. in 2021, we launched a new family of 5g fwa solutions based on our leading high-performing 5g engine and kept expanding on our value-added cloud-delivered software portfolio. our 5g fwa enterprise solutions have high software attach rates and higher gross margins than our carrier hotspot business.
we grew our partner ecosystem by adding 79 new channel partners, including 39 internationally. these partners are critical in expanding our go-to-market reach to enterprises. our products are certified in several regions internationally. and all three tier 1 carriers in the u.s.
have certified our 5g fwa family of products. we expanded our strategic relationship with t-mobile to encompass 5g enterprise fixed wireless access products on both a sell-with and stock basis. and i'm pleased to say that in 2021, t-mobile became our largest 5g customer. we continue our expansion internationally, announcing our growing partnership with vodafone qatar, which began offering our 5g fwa devices in q4.
and most recently, we announced our first 5g launch in saudi arabia with zain ksa. zain is a member of one of the largest and most influential mobile network operators in the middle east with approximately 50 million subscribers. australia is another region where we are expanding. in q4, we launched our 5g fwa outdoor cpe with telstra in addition to the launch of our 5g mifi with optus at the end of the third quarter.
we've also ramped up our activity in washington, engaging with congress, cabinet departments and federal agencies that are shaping legislation, funding and standards to accelerate security and trustworthy 5g deployments. this includes our engagement with ntia on its domestic implementation of the broadband portion of the infrastructure bill, as well as partnering with departments and agencies on setting high standards globally that protect critical and emerging technologies and infrastructure, such as through our participation in the u.s. and eu trade and technology council. moreover, we are working with e-commerce and state departments, u.s.
exim bank and the u.s. international development finance corporation and u.s. investee officials to help level the playing field and promote our products in international markets. looking ahead to 2022, we see the enterprise 5g opportunity developing further and expect top and bottom line contribution from enterprise fixed wireless access to ramp as the year progresses.
this reinforces our robust outlook for 2022 of 25% year-over-year growth and free cash flow positive by year-end. finally, given how much of a strategic asset it is, i wanted to talk about our current supply chain dynamics. we've built an agile and flexible supply chain that has helped us avoid the major disruptions experienced by many of our competitors. that said the dramatic cost and lead time increase in components and freight we experienced in 2021 did impact our gross margins this quarter.
although we are starting to see some supply chain stabilization, we expect these conditions to persist throughout the year, and our financial outlook for 2022 takes these challenges into consideration. i'm therefore confident in our ability to execute our plan for the year and believe our supply chain will remain a source of competitive advantage for inseego. over the past year, we built a strong foundation to capitalize on the numerous opportunities enabled by 5g. i'd like to share our view on how these efforts will transform our business.
first, we continue to drive ahead with latest enhancements in 5g technology with support for 5g stand-alone cbrs and c-band technologies, placing inseego at the forefront of enabling the next wave of enterprise applications. these technologies expand the footprint of fwa broadband services and provide carriers with the opportunity to bring out the best of their networks. with stand-alone, carriers can separate broadband traffic from smartphone traffic to offer new dedicated service plans. with cbrs and c-band, carriers can offer even more services to their enterprise customers.
to that end, we successfully completed inseego's first 5g stand-alone tests with our devices on live networks in europe and north america. and i'm proud to say that five of our 5g solutions are now certified over t-mobile's 5g stand-alone network. in 2021, we achieved several key performance milestones and that we believe validate our leadership in 5g. most notably, we helped uscellular achieve world record-setting long-distance millimeter wave performance with a commercially available 5g fwa cpe that is greater than one gigabit per second or seven kilometers range.
this is just one example of how we demonstrate outstanding performance with solutions for our global carrier customers. we are delivering on the promise to bring out the best of our customers' networks. although we are still in the early innings of 5g adoption, we are encouraged by the pace at which our products are garnering acceptance across the globe, and the ever-expanding list of use cases being tested and deployed. in the middle east, which is one of the best 5g developed regions in the world with over 9 million 5g users and 900,000 5g fwa users we expanded our relationship with vodafone qatar, and they are now selling our 5g solutions.
we also recently announced that zain ksa is now selling our 5g mifi m2000 in saudi arabia. in addition to the middle east, we also shipped 5g fwa products to telstra in australia to support their launch in the fourth quarter. domestically, our 5g portfolio is now certified for use with all three tier 1 carriers in the u.s. perhaps the most important development over the past year was our expanded relationship with t-mobile for business, which significantly advances our 5g fwa efforts.
as we mentioned last quarter, we have a number of additional 5g fwa products certified by t-mobile, and we are incredibly excited about the pipeline of opportunities we are building with them. our expanded go-to-market strategy with both channel partners and carriers is opening up numerous opportunities with enterprise customers that are testing our cloud-managed 5g solutions. our commitment to designing the most robust, high-performance solutions on the markets is paying off. we are outperforming the competition in numerous instances, both in speed and importantly, sustained 5g connectivity.
early use cases are for primary and failover wireless wan connectivity. moreover, they are laying the foundation for future digital transformation efforts and adopting 5g sd enabling technology. and increasingly, we expect these customers to use our cloud management solutions to simplify their it operations. we are seeing strong demand for our 5g solutions in many verticals.
let me provide a few recent examples of our expanded customer use cases in the retail, logistics, manufacturing and construction sectors. in the retail sector, we are working with several fortune 500 retailers, including a leading grocery chain and apparel and a specialty equipment retailer and a discount fashion and home goods retailer. each of these companies was searching for a reliable cloud-managed 5g wan solution because in many areas cable and fiber are either too costly, not feasible or unreliable. cumulatively, they represent thousands of locations in north america.
in the logistics vertical, one of the top 10 food distributors in the u.s. has been testing our 5g cloud-managed solutions. in addition, we are expanding the scope of the dod smart warehouse project. we've been working closely with jma wireless on that initiative, and our partnership is now gaining momentum as we look to provide cloud-managed connectivity to other government private network installations.
in manufacturing, customers are testing our 5g fwa solutions to power applications that are essential to their digital transformation strategies. a leading automotive manufacturer in europe is preparing to test our 5g sa fixed wireless solution for their own industry 4.0 initiatives, which requires highly secure, ultra-reliable, low-latency connections. some use cases that they're investigating a wide-scale networking of machines, autonomous transport systems, robot to robot communications and augmented reality applications. in the construction sector, our solutions were recently selected by one of the largest self-storage companies in the united kingdom as the primary connectivity technology for new locations where 5g proved to be most cost-effective, quick-to-deploy option.
in addition to commercial and residential construction, we are looking to bring the power of 5g to the heavy civil construction vertical. we're working with two large construction and engineering companies. one company in the u.s. pacific northwest has integrated our 5g solutions to monitor on-site deliveries and inventory.
and one of the uk's largest construction and engineering companies is testing our 5g wireless edge solutions to power traffic monitoring and video ai in an effort to make roads safer. moving forward, our focus is on both growing the number of enterprise trials underway and converting these opportunities to broader deployments. we also expect 5g fwa revenue from carriers to build as the year progresses as several key partners are in the late stages of deploying new data plan packages and pricing. as our revenues from 5g fwa ramp, we believe our business model will be transformed due to the higher margins on our enterprise-grade solutions.
we are no longer the inseego of old. we are the leader in enterprise 5g fwa. and with that, i would like to turn the call over to bob.
bob barbieri -- chief financial officer
thank you, ashish. let me now review the results of our fourth quarter fiscal 2021. q4 revenue was $72.9 million, up 15% from the prior quarter, after adjusting for the divestiture of ctrack south africa and up 10% on an as-reported basis. our strong results reflect growing demand for our 5g mobile broadband and fixed wireless products and continued market momentum of our cloud solutions.
next-generation solutions, which are comprised of 5g devices and all of our cloud software assets increased 29% over q4 fiscal 2020 and represent 58% of total revenue in this quarter. full year fiscal 2021 5g device revenue was up 132% over 2020. fourth quarter iot & mobile solutions revenue was $66.2 million, up 16% from q3. the strong performance was fueled by improving demand for our mobile hotspots from our carrier partners who continue to expand their 5g footprint globally.
we also benefited from continued demand for our advanced lte hotspots. although sell-through of these products remained relatively stable, looking forward, we anticipate greater variability in 4g demand from our carriers as all of our partners shift their focus to driving adoption of 5g devices. enterprise saas solutions revenue was $6.7 million, which was flat on a sequential basis, excluding ctrack south africa. we are currently integrating and transforming all of our software assets into a new cloud-driven 5g enabling solution suite.
we will provide more information in the coming quarters, but needless to say, we believe this will be an important growth driver in the coming years. gross margin for the iot and mobile business was 22.2%, down from 24.4% last quarter. the gross margin decline reflects a product mix shift of lte device sales and higher freight costs. as ashish discussed earlier, while challenges continue in the supply chain and logistics, we have seen some stabilization in recent months in these areas.
that said we expect iot and mobile gross margin will improve in q1. we see potential for significant gross margin expansion over the long term as our enterprise initiatives and sales of next-generation solutions will comprise a greater mix of our revenue. our q4 operating expenses totaled $25.6 million, down slightly from $25.8 million in q3 despite lower levels of capitalized r&d. we expect total opex will not increase materially from these levels and expect to see improved operating leverage in 2022 as revenue growth accelerates.
q4 net loss was $8 million or $0.08 a share, in line with the prior quarter. we reported an ebitda loss of $1.2 million, compared to a $773,000 loss in q3. the sequential decline was largely due to the sale of ctrack south africa and the impacts of device mix and freight costs discussed earlier. for additional details on our non-gaap and adjusted ebitda results, please refer to the reconciliation tables in our press release.
cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at the end of q4 was $49.8 million, and our outstanding convertible debt remained unchanged at $157.9 million, net of the impact from fair value adjustment and amortization expenses related to debt discount and issuance costs. turning to 2022, we are reaffirming our outlook for pro forma revenue growth of 25% adjusted for the divestiture of ctrack south africa, and we are still targeting the second half of 2022 to turn free cash flow positive. between 5g technology leadership, strong demand for our next-generation products and our growing enterprise pipeline, we remain confident that the company is positioned well both strategically and financially. from a timing perspective, we expect some normal seasonality into q1, although we expect to see growth from the prior year normalized for the divestiture of ctrack south africa.
beyond q1, we expect our revenue to ramp driven by increased adoption of our cloud and 5g solutions in carrier and enterprise markets. as our product mix gradually shifts toward higher-end 5g enterprise solutions, we expect to see benefits in gross margin later this year. in the meantime, we are being conservative in assuming the challenging supply chain and logistics environment remains throughout 2022. we plan to remain disciplined with respect to our operating expenses, which will support improved operating leverage in 2022.
with that, let me turn it back to ashish for his closing comments.
ashish sharma -- president
thank you, bob. before we turn it over to q&a, i want to reiterate how excited i am about the remarkable transformation in all areas of inseego's business. as dan said in the beginning, not that long ago, we were dependent on selling one product to one large carrier verizon. the investments we've made have allowed us to enter 2022 as a leader in helping carriers and enterprises embrace the 5g future.
we've expanded our products beyond a single 4g mobile hotspot to a broad 5g mobile and fixed wireless portfolio of enterprise device to cloud solutions. we are expanding our go-to-market with channel partners in multiple regions and are engaging with enterprises to help them succeed in their 5g transformation. demand continues to be strong. and as 2021 demonstrated, we have an agile and flexible supply chain that has delivered despite the challenging environment.
that, along with the significant operating leverage in our model makes me confident in the saying 2022 will be the breakout year for inseego. thank you. let's go to q&a.

thank you. [operator instructions] today's first question comes from lance vitanza with cowen and company. please go ahead.
lance vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks, and congratulations on the nice quarter. i guess i had a couple of questions. the first is, ashish mentioned the china lockdowns could cause a bigger impact in to 2q, i think you mentioned in particular with respect to new product launches.
could you provide any more color on maybe the magnitude of the delay? and and is that revenue likely to-- i think you addressed this in terms of the months rather than quarters commentary. but specific to what you're seeing with those lockdowns, is this revenue that you think likely gets pushed into the second half? or is there some risk that this revenue is lost forever for whatever reason?
ashish sharma -- chief executive officer
hey, lance. nice talking to you. hope you're doing well. so, yes.
to answer your question. it really is a slight delay, is how i would say it. we're working through all of the partners out there in asia as they go to these lockdowns. it's just uncertainty.
that's all i would say at this point. we could -- we'll come back and provide more details as we see how things unfold. it could happen, i -- that's why i said that these delays could happen. but we are really tightly managing them right now.
but it's just the overall global uncertainty as that's kicked in through to what's happening with covid in asia. that's why we're just saying it's a little bit of a delay. but beyond that, i mean, we're working through all the challenges we are seeing out there.
lance vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
so, on the last quarter, i think maybe the last couple of quarters, you guys obviously had talked about a -- in outlook for 2022 of for 25% year-over-year growth. obviously, that's that pro forma for the ctrack south africa sale. and i think you'd also been expecting to be free cash flow positive by year end. i know that there's a lot of uncertainties here, but just in terms of thinking about how we model, the best that we can do at this point, -- would you be comfortable putting, is it -- should we be thinking more like a 15% year-over-year growth or or more or less than that? and could you help us think about that -- the magnitude of a potential when you finish the year, where do you think you'll be? burning -- 10 million a year, burning -- more or less than that? something that we can put some goalpost around those two things would be great.
and then i have one follow up for bob, if you don't mind.
ashish sharma -- chief executive officer
hey, lance. i will answer and then have bob provided the input. so as i said earlier, to me, this is more of delays than anything else. so what i would say is, is as things come back online quickly in china and as you know, the second point that that i mentioned earlier in the remarks was the 5g data plans get put in place by the leading carriers, we're really ready to go like we've got the portfolio, we've got the products, and we're super excited about all the pipeline of opportunities we are working through with lots of hundreds of enterprises right now.
so to me, this is more of a delay. and if i were to talk about how you model it, i was just say, you model it as a delay versus that demand leading those or anything like that. bob?
bob barbieri -- chief financial officer
yeah, lance. hopefully, that is helpful. two things on your previous question, i just wanted to reiterate, we don't see any demand going away. so everything is viewed as in the delay bucket.
not so --- and that's not -- it's not an [inaudible], it's a when. second, certainly and a lot of these are bigger than any company, including the largest companies, covid supply chain -- shocks and things like that. and some delays rolling out of 5g new plans. with those headwinds, we -- the way we think about it now is we're seeing q1 as a run rate, and we will create greater clarity as we see through what's going on in technology.
so all of our goals and aspirations, including the numbers you threw out, probably, look to be reaffirmed in our next quarterly call, and for that fiscal year, call it the end of q2 till you have a q2 next year. because we really do -- just due to these global things with some of the technology giants have come in and suspended, what they provided as guidance and -- we don't want to put ourselves ahead of that. that we know more than apple as a for instance.
lance vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
no, that's -- really helpful. --
bob barbieri -- chief financial officer
[inaudible] the markets there and the appetite we believe from our customers is there is just collate.
lance vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
that's really helpful. bob, just my last question before i turn it on to the next person. you mentioned the sequential improvement in gross margin, and i may have missed the commentary. i'm actually referring to the release where you talk about the improvement in gross margin.
presumably, you're referring to in the non-gaap basis versus q4, which i think, i went back and tried to do that calc., i think it was about a 200 basis point sequential improvement in gross margin on a non-gaap basis, is that correct?
bob barbieri -- chief financial officer
that is correct, yes. -- yeah. go ahead.
lance vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
and -- well, so my question is, presumably, that was entirely driven by mix shift with with supply chain offsetting what would otherwise have been an even bigger improvement. is that right? and if so, i'm wondering if you could maybe try to quantify for us how much the supply chain costs you, if it did cost you in terms of gross margin in the quarter?
bob barbieri -- chief financial officer
oh, i think about it this way. you are correct. we did have a really nice quarter with 5g products inside of the mix. so, we were up significantly and that helped.
second, i would say q4 to q1, our supply chain issues both with freight and material costs were relatively the same. so as that -- clears a bit, they'll be further improvement from the reduction of those effects. but the mix is the big driver and the sequential quarter.
lance vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
any ability to pass on price increases either well, either, did you do it in the quarter at hand? or is there a chance that you could do that going forward or no? is that really just going to show up as gross margins influence in the near-term?
ashish sharma -- chief executive officer
yeah, lance, we do that whenever possible, right. there are different segments of the markets you play in, and certain segments are more sensitive to price increases than the others, so i would say, we always try to take the opportunity particularly in this environment, to make those changes. but it's not always possible. not [inaudible] --
lance vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
right. ok. thanks, guys.
bob barbieri -- chief financial officer
well, let me just add one thing, because i think it's relevant to your question, lance, and thank you very, very good questions. the other way to get mix, what we've achieved is more 5g inside of our mix. the second thing we're looking forward to as a company is greater penetration into the enterprise space that we think will bring additional margin enhancement, including some greater software attach, which even though it's a saas basis over time, will bring certainly greater and higher margins over that extended rolling period of time.
lance vitanza -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks. thanks for your help, guys. appreciate it.

and the next question today comes from mike latimore at northland capital. please go --
aditya dagaonkar -- northland capital markets -- analyst
hi. this is aditya dagaonkar on behalf of mike latimore. could you give some commentary on if you expect the higher inflation to affect the consumer spending on your product areas?
ashish sharma -- chief executive officer
hey, adit. nice talking to you. so, look, first off, majority of our product goes into enterprises. so, we don't really, we're not really seeing any impacts of inflation at this point.
aditya dagaonkar -- northland capital markets -- analyst
all right. and do you have 2, 10 percentage customers again in this quarter?
bob barbieri -- chief financial officer
yes, that's correct.
aditya dagaonkar -- northland capital markets -- analyst
all right. also to add, what quarterly revenue you think you can achieve free cash flow positive?
bob barbieri -- chief financial officer
to be fair, with what we've presented in the past, we have not given that number out. what we would like to do, it's kind of builds on what lance asked earlier. it's come back in q2, with hopefully some version of a reaffirmation of what we were previously guiding. and we'd like to get clarity as to the whole technology space supply chain, covid lockdowns and those, and then come back in q2 and provide greater clarity for you.
aditya dagaonkar -- northland capital markets -- analyst
all right. thank you.

ashish sharma -- chief executive officer
thank you, operator, and welcome to inseego's first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. this is my first earnings call as the ceo, and i'm proud to be reporting a solid quarter of execution to start off 2022. before i get into the details, i want to take a step back and reflect on where we are as a company in terms of our strategy and execution, and share my vision for inseego's future. i will then provide a summary of our q1 progress.
let's start to those strategy. our objective is to position inseego as a key solutions provider for enterprises, which has taken a new sense of urgency in the last couple of years by the need for increasingly distributed enterprise workflows. we plan to address this through what we call a 5g edge cloud, which comprises three components; a highly flexible 5g lan connection anchored by inseego's world-class devices; a cloud networking software stack, allowing the creation of a 5g van; and a purpose built suite of enterprise applications. our approach to this very large market opportunity starts with first providing the best performing, highly flexible, and most secure 5g event access to the 5g networks powered by the carriers.
inseego now has the most extensive and highest performing 5g products, both mobile broadband and fixed wireless in the market today. in addition to being offered by leading carriers on the world, we have created a great pipeline of enterprise customers in multiple regions, we're starting to roll out our 5g event solutions for many different use cases. we've also integrated into these products, a comprehensive software platform to provide a unified view for our customers, allowing them to fully manage these 5g event solutions. the software is a key technology that is powering our 5g edge cloud where we are bringing all these pieces of our solutions together.
this critical layer of software is key to allowing enterprises to move the corporate lan into the inseego 5g cloud. let me introduce this to the market in the near future, our enterprise customers will be able to innovate at the edge, and empower a more secure distributed workforce or branch locations or a 5g network fabric for the first time. current enterprise van architectures are complex, highly fragmented, expensive to maintain, and dependent on costly on premise appliances and better third party integrations. they're also saddled with multiple management consoles and multiple policies.
this large attack surface area makes them rather vulnerable to cyber attacks. inseego plans on transforming the enterprise van market by offering the full stack of networking capabilities as a 5g cloud app. the cornerstone of the third part of our enterprise strategy is the ctrack application portfolio that currently serves thousands of enterprise and smb customers. we plan to offer this application suite as part of our 5g edge cloud, as it has great synergy with the other two solution portfolios i described earlier.
since the sale of ctrack south africa unit, we've been busy modernizing the architecture of this application, along with enabling 5g and integrating into our 5g edge cloud. you see a huge opportunity to utilize this technology, to digitize many facets of enterprise operations in verticals such as transportation, construction, logistics, supply chain, energy, utilities, services, local governments, and more. we will have more to say during our next call, but i'm really excited with the progress we've made and believe the improvements will help accelerate growth. note that our carrier customers are also a key partners in this new 5g enterprise journey.
in addition to selling our high performing hotspots and fwa devices, carriers are also an important go-to-market partners for our enterprise 5g solutions. t-mobile is a great example of this, where we have two ways to sell our products. first is what we call stark, where t-mobile buys our devices directly and sells them to their customers as part of our service package. the second is what we call [inaudible], where the t-mobile sales force brings us enterprise opportunities that we fulfill through the vr and distributor challenge.
we see similar arrangements developing in other global markets where we will sell both directly to the carrier and to its preferred channel partners. ultimately, our carrier relationships will be an important driver of growth and profitability as we look to take share in what is still a nascent and rapidly growing market. with that, let's dive into the first quarter. first, i am pleased to report that we are off to a good start in '22 with revenue growth of 23% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, excluding ctrack south africa.
and our gross margin rebounded from the prior quarter. had it not been for minor supply chain issues that affected our enterprise business late in the quarter? our revenue would have exceeded street consensus. reflecting our focus on next generation products and go to market expansion, 5g revenue was up 142% year-over-year and comprised 44% of total revenue. importantly, next generation software solutions represented 23% of total revenue in q1.
bob will go into more details in a moment. as i'm sure all of you are aware, covid related lockdowns were instituted in china late in q1. i'm very proud of how inseego has navigated the global supply chain challenges over the past year. and there are few companies, large or small, that have not been affected.
we continue to see lead times lengthening, and with limited availability of parts in the spot markets and rising shipping cost, especially for products with relatively short sales cycles. although, we were relatively unaffected in q1, a prolonged lockdown in china may have more of an impact in q2, particularly as it relates to our anticipated new product launches. i will now touch upon new customer expansions from this quarter, both on the carrier side and through our new enterprise initiatives. during the quarter, we launched a 5g solution with telus in canada, and you saw the us cellular fixed wireless announcement last week.
in north america, our 5g products are certified by all the major carriers, and we have a broad range of engagements with both carriers and enterprises, which we are very proud of. our investments in our targeted international markets of europe, middle east, and are fairly are beginning to pay off after a couple of years of investment. we have seen repeat orders from several international customers, which is encouraging. as a run rate business in new markets is starting to build up, and is expected to contribute more meaningfully to our growth in '22.
we also want a new carrier customer in the nordics and we shipped the initial quantity of product to them recently. on the enterprise side, we saw good progress with new customer engagements for our 5g solutions in multiple regions. as i've stated in prior calls, we're still in the early stages of 5g adoption for the enterprise. 5g networks are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and are evolving to meet the requirements for enterprise use.
while we may see the 5g icon on our mobile phones and to conclude coverage is sufficient, the underlying infrastructure is still evolving with new mid-band capacity, new 5g nsa core network, and carrier data plans to make 5g a prime event solution for the enterprises. we believe this is a large market in the making as the carriers will push hard to move, many enterprise use cases onto these newly built 5g networks. with our fwa portfolio, we are well-positioned to win in this market. speaking of fwa, we are encouraged by the continued growth in our pipeline.
but more importantly, we are seeing several customers move to deploy our products broadly across their organizations. these engagements follow a typical pattern where an enterprise will buy 3 to 5 first devices to test. thereafter, they ordered 30 to 50 devices for small scale deployment before rolling out company wide, which in many cases required thousands of inseego devices. these customers are also leveraging our cloud-based software to manage and secure the devices across their distributed workforce or branch locations.
let me provide a few examples. one example is an enterprise customer with over 27,000 employees. they were looking for a reliable 5g work-from-home solution to offer their remote employees to ensure a secure and consistent user experience no matter where they were -- they're located. to ensure security and consistency, the customer is now using our cloud management solution so that their it team can have visibility into the entire deployment, enabling them to manage, configure, and monitor the connections all from a single pane of glass.
in the retail sector, we have a couple of us based customers laying the foundation for their own digital transformation, leveraging our solutions for 5g connectivity across their stores to power a number of applications that require reliable, real time connections, such as surveillance. these customers want in initiative to supply a sector with approximately 2,000 stores, and a nationwide clothing retailer with 800 stores, respectively, have successfully completed our testing and are now starting widespread deployments. finally, we are seeing an accelerated drive to cross the digital divide, which is driven largely in part by the beauty of 5g being significantly easier and cheaper to deploy than fiber in many instances. in addition, boots ability to handle massive amounts of data.
most recently, we secured a deal with one of the top public libraries in the u.s., with over 90 branches serving a population of over 3.5 million. they are leveraging our 5g cloud managed solutions. as you can see, we are making significant progress against our key strategic objectives. i want to thank the employees of inseego for their tireless work and solid execution.
[inaudible] have a robust 5g product portfolio and growing enterprise pipeline, we remain confident that inseego is well-positioned to achieve our financial goals. however, there are a number of factors that cloud our near-term visibility. first is the plateauing of our 4g hotspot business. after setting records in 2020 and 2021, the first quarter reflected the normalization of 4g as 5g becomes more -- widespread.
this has always been expected, and as that portfolio carries over lowest gross margins, it is a positive transition. second is the evolution of enterprise 5g data plans that are key to broader adoption of the blue wave. these plans are now being released and our current expectation is for several key partners to begin ramping during the summer, which should position us for a strong finish to the year. we've always planned on a strong back half of the year, but we also projected those data plans to be released a few months ago.
and lastly, the supply chain, as you've said in previous quarters, you've not really experienced any meaningful supply chain issues on our existing products. this remains [inaudible] today. however, we remain very that ongoing supply chain challenges associated with covid related lockdowns in china could impact our new product launches later in 2022. once factories reopen, we will be able to fully gauge if our new roll out should be delayed or not.
all these factors together may push out our growth expectations for 2022 calendar year. note that we measure this as a delay by a matter of months as opposed to multiple quarters or more. we will update our thinking once we have greater certainty around the timing of carrier of fwa roll outs and the easing of covid restrictions in china. i would now like to turn the call over to bob, who will provide more details on our q1 results. 
bob barbieri -- chief financial officer
thank you, ashish. let me now review the results of our first quarter fiscal 2022. please note that all metrics and comparisons made are non-gaap on a pro forma basis. adjusted for the divestiture of ctrack south africa, which was completed in july 2021.
please refer to our earnings release for additional details on the gaap to non-gaap reconciliation. q1 revenue was $61.4 million, up 23% from the prior year. our strong growth reflects rising demand for our 5g mobile broadband and fixed wireless products and further uptake of our cloud solutions. next generation solutions, which are comprised of 5g devices and all of our cloud software assets, increased 68% over q1 fiscal 2021, and represented 67% of total revenue in this quarter as compared to 43% of revenue in the year ago quarter.
first quarter iot and mobile solution revenue was $54.5 million, up 27% from the same period last year. our strong performance was again driven by demand for our 5g mobile hotspots from both our carrier partners and enterprises, partially offset by a decline in the sales of 4g devices. enterprise saas solution revenue was $6.9 million, which was flat on a sequential and year-over-year basis. as ashish noted, we're currently modernizing the architecture of our software assets and integrating them into our 5g edge cloud.
consolidated gross margin was 27.3%, up from 25.4% in q4, but down from 31% in q1 last year. gross margin for the iot and mobile business was 24.1%, down from 26.1% in the year ago period, but up almost 200 basis points from 22.2% in the prior quarter. the gross margin decline from last year reflects higher freight costs, while the improvement on a sequential basis was driven by a more favorable mix of device sales. gross margin for the rnterprise saas segment was 53.3%, down sequentially from 58.2% and year-over-year from 62.5%.
q1 non-gaap net loss was $12.1 million, or $0.11 per share, down from $0.08 per share in both the prior and year ago quarters. we reported an adjusted ebitda loss of $3.3 million, which was down by $1.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively, compared to q1 last year and last quarter. the change was largely due to lower levels of capitalized r&d relative to what we expense. our overall cash spending on r&d remains consistent, and our investment in next generation solutions is calibrated to our vision to ramp-up the saas model over time.
for additional details on our non-gaap and adjusted results, please refer to the reconciliation tables in our press release. cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at the end of q1 was $45.2 million. we note that our cash position benefited from the timing of some larger collections, which we expect to normalize this quarter and therefore result in the uses of cash in q2 that is more consistent with our recent historical run rate. with that, let me turn it back to ashish for his closing comments.
ashish sharma -- chief executive officer
thank you, bob. since taking over as ceo last quarter, i've had numerous conversations with our shareholders and the investment community. there's one thing i've consistently heard. it is a desire to see us move beyond the narrative of investing in the opportunity offered by 5g, and to start executing consistently against our objectives for robust top line growth and improved profitability.
that is why we are being as, as transparent as possible and sharing with everyone the near-term challenges that face us. but as i said before, we believe these challenges will be measured in months, not quarters or years. i want to be clear on how excited i am about the opportunity that lies ahead in 5g for the enterprise. inseego has become the leader in 5g edge with our high performance mobile and fwa solutions.
in the coming months, the pieces will be put in place for mainstream adoption as the carriers evolves their 5g data plans, and we move beyond the renewed covid lockdowns. we believe these factors, combined with our growing pipeline, and expanding go to market will put us back on track to achieving our financial goals. thank you for your interest in inseego. now let's go to q&a.

we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] today's first question comes from tore svanberg with stifel. please proceed.
tore svanberg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yes. thank you. and congratulations on the continuous progress here. ashish, i know it's hard to quantify, obviously, the second half, but you referenced a very strong second half.
can you put some numbers or certain metrics around that? and maybe as related to that, what would be the breakeven point given the higher gross margin now?
ashish sharma -- chief executive officer
hey, tore. hope you're well. good talking to you. and look, this is the business transformation that we've all been waiting for, right? and this quarter, you start to see us move to the next phase of the company where you could see clearly the margin bump we got with our new enterprise business that we've been working for quite some time to stand up.
we've had the portfolio and the products all ready to go for quite some time. and now with the carrier push on the new 5g at the blair plants, particularly targeted toward enterprises, you start to see those results come through. and that's the main driver, along with the next-gen hotspot launches. that's making us so optimistic about the second half of this year.
so those are the two different engines that we did not have in the first half of the year, and that's what's changing here. i think your second question about at what levels we get to breakeven, i mean, i would say, tore, it's still a very early 5g market, right? so, we've got a lot of customer traction. enterprise customers are loving the product, but they're all individually still assessing and figuring out their own plans on how to roll out the deployment. we started to see some do it this quarter, and that shows in the results.
so, it's hard to pinpoint a fixed number. but directionally, what we see, what we saw this quarter, and if we stay with that same pace, then we're very comfortable that come the end of this year we'll be getting very close to breakeven on the positive cash flow.
tore svanberg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
very good. and as a follow-up, the iot and mobile business, about $55 million. can you give us a sense for the mix there now between both 4g versus 5g and also what the percentage is related to enterprise?
ashish sharma -- chief executive officer
yeah. i would say, tore, majority of the enterprise is on 5g. there's very small number in there for 4g. all of the enterprise is 5g, and the rest, all of the revenue there is really hotspot.
so, i would say that the growth that we are seeing is in the right areas. it is with 5g, and it is with and fwa and the hotspot, and in this quarter has been pretty steady with what we've seen in the previous quarters.
tore svanberg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
very good. just one last question for bob. bob, the inventory, obviously, was up quite a bit. you're at 98 days right now.
and i was just hoping you could talk about that particular build. is this in anticipation of the second half? or is there anything else sort of all the moving parts going on there?
bob barbieri -- chief financial officer
i think there's a couple of things, tore, and thank you. one is certainly we don't want to signal an anticipatory large ramp. certainly, we can't wait for that to happen. but we've moved a lot of our shipping to kind of manage our cost stack back to ocean.
and so, what that has done is kind of slowed the pace of the inventory coming in, but temporarily has raised the inventory balance, but we believe that cost trade-off is beneficial to our margins.
tore svanberg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thank you, very much.
ashish sharma -- chief executive officer
thank you, tore.
operator
our next question comes from scott searle with roth capital. please proceed.
scott searle -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. maybe to follow up on tore's question, ashish. in terms of the visibility in the outlook, is there anything that you could help us quantify in terms of what you're seeing in that backlog or that pipeline in terms of the size, magnitude, number of customers, maybe the size of deals, and particularly on the enterprise front? and then i had a couple of follow-ups.
ashish sharma -- chief executive officer
ok. hey, scott, good talking to you. so, a couple of data points i can point, right, the size of the pipeline through the three different routes to markets you've got, i would say the size of the pipeline is like triple quadruple since we last spoke, right? so, we're on a very fast pace of getting products out to a lot of customers and engaging them in trials, the pilots, and starting to now convert them into full deployments. so that's one number, i would say that the pipeline is super strong.
there is a lot of interest. and i would just say that the networks that we are seeing, right, the c-band network from verizon and at&t and then the mid-band network from t-mobile are incredible. i mean the performance is just simply incredible. so that gives us just a great view into what's to come here in the second half of the year and then move into next year.
and i would say, look, the opportunity size could go from small units for trials to a couple of hundred units for pilots to a few thousand units all the way up to -- i think i mentioned one large customer has got a workforce of over 100,000 employees, right? so, work from -- remote solution that could be pretty significant for us. so, i think the pipeline consists of all different sizes of these customers. and i would just say another data point is we closed some initial customers in q2 with very sizable opportunities where they're rolling out 5g fwa at thousands of their locations over the balance of this year.
scott searle -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. very helpful. and ashish, if i could follow up on that, just in terms of the sales cycle there and deployment cycle, could you help? it sounds like things are accelerating, but is there a timeline you put around that in terms of the digestion period now? is it 90 days? is it 180 days? is it compressing then going forward?
ashish sharma -- chief executive officer
yeah. i would say that the purchasing decision could be made anywhere from 30 days to several months. it really depends on the purpose of the rollouts, and there are different purposes each customer has. but in general, i would say, on average, the customers are going from pilots into full deployment between three to six months.
scott searle -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. great. and if i could, just on the financial front, bob. any 10% customers in the quarter? i know you typically had big numbers from verizon and t-mobile.
i'm wondering what the percentages were there. and on the opex front, r&d has come down. is that the sustained level that we should be assuming? or is there a bit of an inflection? because i think software capitalization has kind of bottomed out now at a lower level. i'm assuming that there are no changes on that front.
or how should we be thinking about r&d going forward into the second half? thanks.
bob barbieri -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, scott. and first, let me answer the second -- i'll just start with your first question. certainly, we had the same two customers.
you mentioned verizon and t-mobile, both over 10%, so not much different than what we've seen in the past. and those combined for generally over 50%. and that's been kind of a similar pattern, so no unique change there. with respect to r&d, yeah, we've kind of managed -- i think in prior calls and when you've been with us personally, we talked about a significant reinvestment for the 5g opportunity.
so, we've done that. and then so our new r&d spend rate is kind of enhancing that. and you're looking at what i would consider the new normal. so, we're not looking for any more inflections up.
if anything, perhaps slight moderation down as we kind of digest what we've already done. and so anyway, that's kind of the look of the opex. i just want to add one thing. that's also consistent with what we previously spoke of that, as the company grows, not a lot of new opex is required.
so we could see that kind of driving the bottom line and the cash generation.
scott searle -- roth capital partners -- analyst
great. thanks so much. i'll get back in the queue.
ashish sharma -- chief executive officer
thanks, scott.
operator
our next question comes from mike walkley with canaccord genuity. please proceed.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. good to see a little uptick on the gross margins with the mix. just building on that, longer term, where do you see maybe fixed wireless as a mix relative to hotspots versus where it is today? and how's that changes, where could gross margins trend to from the current business run rate?
ashish sharma -- chief executive officer
hey, mike, this is ashish. so let me take that. so obviously, we're just beginning with this, right? we've been primed up for this for the last couple of years. we made the investments.
we built a portfolio. we believe the size of the fwa market is significantly larger. and i'm talking particularly the enterprise market, not the consumer market. the fwa -- 5g fwa enterprise market is significantly larger than the market that we had access to before with the hotspots.
so, we believe, for us, as the market ramps up here, i mean, we just saw one large carrier pushing fwa hard. and then we got verizon is coming back strong here with c-band and the build-out they're doing and the plans they are coming out with. then we have international markets still tracking a little bit behind, but they're all going to come online over the next, whatever, 12 months or so. so, you start to see that fwa for us becomes a lot more meaningful.
and it's not just the size of the market from a hardware perspective. it's the ability to sell a complete stack up there. we're selling cloud on top of that. and then now we've got this 5g sd edge solution, which is a complete security and enterprise management solution on top of cloud management.
so, we get that opportunity to sell a lot more layers of solution on enterprise. so, for us, that's a great market, and it's not years out. it's starting to happen now. and we think over the next several quarters it's going to start to -- continues to steadily ramp up every quarter.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
great. thanks. and ashish, just on that, how do you view your competitors in that market? and you have cradlepoint who was bought by ericsson going after some of the same enterprise. you talked about wireless was a spot and they have a 5g router and gateway business.
so how do you view the competition? and what's the feedback on why you guys are differentiated and winning some early business?
ashish sharma -- chief executive officer
yeah. great question, mike. so first off, right, just by the virtue of a very sizable, very large market in the making here, there would be a lot of competition, and that's great. it's good to have a sizable market where you can play in.
i mean a couple of different competitors you mentioned have slightly different focus than the focus we provide and the approach we provide to those customers. our differentiation is a couple of things. one, you look at the best -- and we provide and build the best of the best of the modem in the industry, and we always have the latest 5g technology in the mix, right? and the most economical price point to those enterprises because we're not building the clunky old type of sd-wan boxes with heavy interprocesses and all that. we don't do that.
we build a very thin edge, which performs the best way. it gives you the access to the best pipe to the 5g networks. and on top of that, the solutions i'm talking about, in particular, the 5g sd edge solution, it's a major disruptor in the market because the economic value prop we are providing to the end customer with the ease of use is unparalleled in the market today. nobody has a security and a distributed networking solution like that in the industry.
that's our differentiation.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
that's great. and last question for me. you touched on it earlier with t-mobile on pricing. can you just talk about the carriers and what you're seeing in terms of how they're going to price it to the enterprise and that timing of when it might help the market even take off faster?
ashish sharma -- chief executive officer
hey, mike, that's already started, right? so, in q2, t-mobile already released multiple very compelling business plans, and that's been the catalyst for the progress we started to see this quarter. i understand the same. and then we're starting to see other carriers internationally and domestically all work through those plans, which are directly tied to the mid-band or upper band rollouts, right? so, they need more spectrum to be able to put better compelling plans, and that's what they're really working toward. and like i said, early days, but look, the opportunity is significant.
the performance of those networks on the mid-band is just incredible.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
ok. thanks. one last one, i'll pass on -- just any supply issues to worry about in the second half? or do you feel pretty good about component availability to meet your second-half potential ramp?
ashish sharma -- chief executive officer
no issues, mike. i mean the thing i would highlight is we still continue to operate in an elevated cost -- supply chain cost environment. but we've done a remarkable job, our ops team has done a remarkable job managing the supply. and that's one of the reasons a lot of our carrier customers love us because we've always been there.
we've had the product, and we've managed the supply chain really well going back to the beginning of the pandemic a couple of years ago.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions.
ashish sharma -- chief executive officer
thank you, mike.

[operator instructions] the next question comes from mike latimore with northland capital. please proceed.
unknown speaker -- northland capital markets -- analyst
hi. this is aditya on behalf of mike latimore. could you give some color on if the inflation, on the recessionary fear, are having any impact on your enterprise saas business?
ashish sharma -- chief executive officer
hey, aditya, this is ashish. let me try to address that. so first off, i would say that, yeah, we see the macroeconomic environment out there, a lot of fear of the inflation and what happens to the broader economy. i would say that we're really not seeing an impact of that on our business.
and perhaps the reason is look at the industries we are starting to serve now with the 5g fwa business. i talked about the education market. i talked about construction, healthcare, utilities, manufacturing. and you look at these industries we serve, these are all essential industries, right? so, we're bringing a very disruptive economical wan solution with complete security stack through 5g into those markets.
so, for these customers, this is a much better and economical way to deploy the wan services and the broadband services. so, to me, we're not seeing any impact of the macroeconomic environment on our business or on our customer pipeline.
unknown speaker -- northland capital markets -- analyst
all right. could you also tell me what the current headcount is and what do you expect it to be by the end of the year?
ashish sharma -- chief executive officer
i would say, aditya, the current headcount is we've got some offshore contractors and permanent headcount, but it's -- i would say it's in the range of a little north of 500 employees.
unknown speaker -- northland capital markets -- analyst
do you expect that to increase by the end of this year?
ashish sharma -- chief executive officer
no. no, we're managing our costs very well. and like bob said earlier, we've got the team in place, and we've got our channels in place. we don't expect to increase that.
unknown speaker -- northland capital markets -- analyst
all right. fine. thank you.

at this time, i would like to turn the call over to ashish sharma, ceo. please go ahead.
ashish sharma -- chief executive officer
thank you, operator, and welcome to inseego's second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. we had a solid quarter with revenue of $61.9 million and an adjusted ebitda loss of $1 million. importantly, we saw our gross margin improved to 29.5% in q2. this is a reflection of our long-standing focus on 5g products and improving our mix toward higher-margin recurring revenue.
from a business perspective, what we are most excited about is that we started to see several enterprise customers convert 5g pilots into full-fledged large multilocation deployments. this progress within our enterprise business and our growing pipeline of opportunities are a few of the key things that underpin our confidence in a strong second half of this year. before highlighting how our business is evolving, i want to touch on a few things. first is our drive to generate positive free cash flow.
we remain disciplined with respect to investments in our business and anticipate improved operating leverage now that we have a number of key product certifications behind us. further, between the growth in our higher-margin businesses and a keen eye on our costs, we can see inseego approaching free cash flow breakeven by the end of this year. second is the importance of the $50 million credit facility we just closed. this facility gives us ample capacity to fuel the growth we see later this year and into 2023.
bob will touch on both of these shortly. lastly, we believe 2022 represents a positive inflection point in our business. for the last few years, we've discussed the promise of 5g and the impact it will have on end customers. while it has taken longer than we would like, we are finally starting to see that promise become a reality.
how so? from two perspectives, from our carrier partners as their 5g network coverage improves dramatically and from end-user customers who can now benefit from these high-speed networks and are making purchase decisions for 5g deployments. our broad suite of 5g solutions positions us well to capitalize on the long-term trends we expect to play out over the next five years. so on to the exciting developments, we are seeing in our enterprise business. there are two key drivers.
first are the new c-band rollouts, which many believe creates an ideal balance of range, penetration, and speed for carriers and their customers. this allows 5g to solve last-mile issues with a lot more network capacity in areas where fiber just isn't feasible. this is critical for businesses with distributed sites and workforces. we are certified for the c-band rollouts with all the major carriers in the u.s., and we are working together to bring these services to enterprise customers.
second is the introduction of new cost-effective 5g data plans for businesses. as an example, we saw that t-mobile announced their new 5g for business data plans in may of this year. this is proving to be a significant catalyst for enterprise adoption of 5g for fixed wireless access. now let me outline the progress through the three different routes to markets we are pursuing.
first is our stock business. this is where t-mobile purchases our products directly and delivers to their customers. we are already seeing significant customer activity through this effort and continue to build a new pipeline of opportunities. as a reminder, our wavemaker 5g indoor router fx2000 has been stacked and available to t-mobile's business customers since november of last year.
recently, we have seen activity levels increase dramatically. also, we've had fortune 500 retail customers convert from pilots into full-scale deployments. moving forward, we expect our pipeline to continue to grow with improved sell-through as t-mobile sales teams reach more end customers. this will result in significant restocking of the fx2000 with t-mobile over the balance of the year.
second is what we call sell rate, where we jointly sell our entire 5g fwa portfolio alongside t-mobile sales force. we've sold our product to over 400 distinct new customers since the launch. i will provide some examples in a bit. as many of you are aware, our ability to capture new enterprise customers has the potential to completely transform our business.
how? simply put, these sales carry significantly higher product margins than when sold under the stock program. most importantly, these sales also have very high software attach rates. this means we can earn recurring revenue each month for every device over a multiyear contract period. capturing our fair share of this emerging enterprise 5g fwa market is one of the ways we see inseego delivering increased revenue growth, improved gross margins, and sustainable positive free cash flow.
and third is our var channel. as previously mentioned, c-band delivers much more capacity for bandwidth-intensive business applications. this makes the availability of c-band a key driver for fwa adoption here in the u.s. importantly, we now have multiple 5g fwa products certified with both at&t and verizon.
working with their top partners, we have started shipping initial orders and have already started to build a large pipeline of enterprise opportunities with both of these carrier customers. we believe we are the only company with such a broad portfolio of purpose-built 5g fwa products that are c-band certified. this places us in a very unique position in the market. so that's how we go to market.
now let me touch upon some examples of 5g enterprise fwa use cases so you can better understand the scope and scale of the opportunity. now, where are we seeing traction? it's in the verticals where there is a need for primary connectivity for remote workforce, branch office connectivity, distributed sites, and security and remote management. that means construction, retail, healthcare, education, utilities, manufacturing, and logistics. in the construction sector, for example, we are seeing interest from national homebuilders where our 5g fwa solutions are ideal for remote work sites and for development projects in the field where fiber just isn't available.
in the retail sector, a handful of nationwide and regional customers have trialed our products and are now commencing rollouts. these deployments can range in size from hundreds of locations to thousands. another prospective customer with an employee base of 120,000 is preparing to test our solutions for their remote workforce. then we have a large national retail chain and a leading car rental agency trialing our solutions for secure and reliable primary connectivity in both rural and urban settings.
in europe, we are now in pilot with a smart traffic light manufacturer, a leading gas supplier who is leveraging our solutions to manage remote sites, and a large paper and recycling company to enable their smart warehouse initiatives. let's turn our focus to our expanded software portfolio. building upon our best-in-class portfolio of 5g fixed wireless devices, we recently launched our 5g sd edge solution. this expands our software capabilities beyond cloud management to complete corporate it management.
with inseego's 5g sd edge, enterprises now have the tools to secure, automate and orchestrate the management of their wireless wide area networks, much like they do with their wide lan. while w-lan was primarily used for backup connectivity in the 4g world, 5g offers significantly more capacity, which, combined with an increasing need for segregated networks and workflows to combat security threats, will drive significant adoption of 5g w-lan for primary connectivity. we believe this solution will offer a much more simplified approach to enhance security and network policy management compared to traditional on-premise wan management solutions. we are already in pilots with multiple customers, and we expect our first launch customers this quarter, much like our other software offerings attaching 5g sd edge to our enterprise sales will further increase our subscription revenue streams, increase customer stickiness and expand our gross margin.
of course, we will have plenty more to talk about it as it leads to our software stack in time. this includes our ongoing efforts to enhance and integrate our existing ctrack applications into our 5g edge cloud. before i turn it over to bob, i just want to mention one more important launch. while our growth aspirations are clearly aligned with enterprise adoption of 5g fwa, we continue to deliver new innovation and best-in-class mobile connectivity products to market, as we've always done.
we are launching the mifi x pro. this marks the third generation of our 5g mobile hotspot and the company's 10th generation mifi since inception. a tier 1 carrier in north america will be the first customer to roll out this product in q3. i'm also very happy to report that another tier 1 carrier, telstra in australia, will be launching this solution soon as well.
our mobile hotspot product line continues to be the preferred choice for business customers looking to power their mobile workforce. this is primarily due to the industry's best performance and advanced security we provide in our hotspots. i want to thank our employees for their dedication and pursuit of our strategic imperatives. and i would now like to turn the call over to bob, who will provide more details on our q2 results.

thank you, ashish. let me now review the results of our second quarter fiscal 2022. please note that all metrics and comparisons made are non-gaap on a pro forma basis, adjusting for the divestiture of ctrack south africa, which was completed in july 2021. please refer to our earnings release for additional details on the gaap to non-gaap reconciliation.
q2 revenue was $61.9 million, up 6% from the prior year and up slightly on a sequential basis. our growth reflects continued strong demand for our 5g solutions and increasing traction with enterprises, particularly offset by anticipated declines in 4g products sold directly to our carriers. next-generation solutions, which are comprised of 5g devices and all of our cloud software assets, increased 25% over q2 fiscal 2021 and represented 66% of total revenue in this quarter as compared with 50% of revenue in the year-ago quarter. second quarter iot and mobile solutions revenue was $55.2 million, up 7% from the same period last year.
similar to q1, our growth was again driven by demand for our 5g mobile hotspots, further uptake of our solutions by enterprise customers, and steady growth in our attached software revenue, which partially offset by declines in our 4g product sales. enterprise saas solutions revenue was $6.7 million, which was relatively flat on a sequential and year-to-year basis. as noted last quarter, we're in the process of enhancing our software assets and integrating them into our 5g edge cloud. consolidated gross margin was 29.5%, up from 27.3% in q1 and 28% in q2 of last year.
gross margin for iot and mobile business was 27.4%, an increase of over 300 basis points from 23.9% in the prior period and 24% in the prior quarter. the gross margin improvement on both a sequential and year-over-year basis reflects a higher mix of enterprise sales. gross margin for the enterprise saas segment was 47.8%. q2 non-gaap net loss was $9.5 million or $0.09 per share, an improvement from a loss of $0.11 per share in the prior quarter and a loss of $0.08 per share in the year-ago quarter.
we reported an adjusted ebitda loss of $1 million, which was up from a loss of $3.3 million in q1 and $1.7 million loss in the year-ago period. the change was largely due to the combination of higher revenue and gross margin arising from our increasing mix of enterprise sales. for additional details on our non-gaap and adjusted ebitda results, please refer to the reconciliation tables in our press release. cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at the end of q2 was $24.4 million.
we note that our cash balance last quarter was bolstered by an early payment by a carrier customer. this quarter, our receivables return to a more normalized level, and we significantly reduced our accounts payable balance. for the balance of the year, we expect our quarterly cash usage to be significantly lower than in q2 as our revenue growth reaccelerates, and we remain disciplined with our investments in operating costs. as ashish mentioned, we're making significant strides toward our goal of being free cash flow positive and expect to approach breakeven by the end of 2022.
we believe our current cash position is sufficient to carry us through the transformation to an enterprise 5g company, but also want to ensure we have substantial financial flexibility. as announced today, we have closed on a working capital line of credit that provides us with up to $50 million in liquidity, of which $4.5 million was drawn at closing. this facility was available to us based on the nature of our receivables being largely from high-quality investment-grade customers with long tenures and with seller payment records, as well as the quality of our inventory. this line of credit provides us flexibility to support our customers and the growth we expect this year and into 2023.
with that, let me turn it back to ashish for his closing comments.
ashish sharma -- chief executive officer
and i hope you can see from our comments the promise of 5g is becoming a reality, and we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on its rollout years to come. we are focused on continuing to provide best-in-class solutions to our carrier partners and, increasingly, to enterprise customers through our 5g fwa and software solutions. we made continued progress against our key initiatives in q2 with our key carrier partners now starting to turn their attention to 5g enterprise fwa and the successful launch of our next generation of 5g products we are primed for a strong second half of 2022. as more and more of our enterprise pipeline move toward purchase and deployment in the coming quarters, we expect to benefit from a high attach rate of software sales, which will ultimately help us to continue to improve margins and profitability and to generate positive cash flow.
inseego is at an inflection point, and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress in future quarters. before we move on to the q&a, i'm very pleased to announce that jeffrey tuder has been elected chairman of the board. jeff's extensive industry knowledge, combined with his unwavering integrity and expert judgment, have been invaluable since he joined the inseego board in 2017. jeff is the perfect choice for chairman of the board, and i'm confident that he can help lead the company into the future.
now, let's go to q&a.
