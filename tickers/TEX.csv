thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from the line of jamie cook from credit suisse. your line is open.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
good morning. i guess a couple of questions.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, jamie.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
good morning. specifically on aerials, you talked about cutting production in the second quarter, i think 20%. what are your assumptions specifically in the back half of the year? and then if you could help us understand your assumptions to get to your margins in back half of the year, whether it's currency, price, cost, production mix, just so we get comfortable there. and then i guess my second question, in 2020, you talked about your ability to achieve your goals.
i mean, at this point, is it more driven by materials processing versus aerials? and can you grow your aerial margins in 2020, assuming a flat market? like what would be the terex-specific drivers behind that outside of the market? thank you.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, jamie. a couple of questions here, so we'll try to tick them off. let's start with, first, the margin and the margin guidance. as we indicated in our comments, we did see demand moderating.
but overall, demand in the awp and aerials remains at a healthy levels. but it's not growing at our previously anticipated rates. so we did make the decision to reduce production volumes to better align our inventory with global demand, which did contribute to our margin performance in the quarter, and on the positive side, did contribute to our positive cash flow for the quarter. in terms of production, i'll have duffy talk in greater detail on the margins.
but in terms of production, jamie, i think it's important to put it in context. just member, at the end of last year, q3 and q4, we did produce at a higher level, frankly, above global demand, say, roughly 10%. and that really was to maintain continuity in the tight labor market. and we did build up the inventory to prepare for what we expected to be modest growth rates this year.
this year, we made the decision in the quarter that we're going to under produce the global demand, again, roughly around 10%. and if you think about our normal production schedules, it's normally seasonal production is lower in the second half. so what we basically did is accelerated that lower production into the second quarter. and we will produce at lower levels in q3 and q4 than we did in 2019.
and again, our plan is to reduce inventory over the second half. and we expect it to be aligned with the demand by year-end. so john, can you cover in greater detail the margin guidance?
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
sure. thanks. so jamie, as it relates to the guidance and the awp assumptions, i mean the biggest impact -- the biggest headwind that we've been facing throughout 2019 for awp has been foreign currency rates, specifically the euro-dollar exchange rate. i talked in my comments about that we're seeing a $30 million impact versus our original guidance.
if you go back to when we prepared our annual plan during the fourth quarter of 2019 and looking at lowered currency rates at that time, the forward curve for the euro-dollar was in the $1.22 range. and we've seen a constant deterioration of that forward curve here over the last six, nine months. that has -- that caused us to move our assumption with respect to the euro-dollar exchange rate for the full-year 2019 down to $1.12, and that's what's driving the most significant impact to us. as i talked about in my remarks, we do ship a significant amount of our product for the european market from the united states and from china into the european union.
in terms of production volumes in the second half of 2019 for awp, as we continue to align our inventory with global demand, we would expect that the production levels in awp would be similar to what we saw -- year-over-year production levels for awp would be similar to what we saw for the second quarter of this year, and that is built into the guidance that we provided. we have been seeing a higher proportion of telehandler sales in our product mix for 2019. as you know, we've talked about the margin profile for telehandlers is different than for booms and scissors. and again, that higher telehandler sales is built into the guidance that we're providing.
and then lastly, we also talked about the strategic sourcing savings and with the production levels for awp being lower that we had reduced modestly from $35 million down to $30 million the amount of strategic sourcing savings that we would be realizing in 2019, and most of that savings is in the back half of 2019. so hopefully, that's a good run-through of the principal assumptions that go into the guidance that we're providing for awp today.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you. and sorry, just to follow up on 2020, i mean you guys sort of reiterated your confidence level in getting to the 10% or above. is that more driven by materials processing? and can aerials improve their margins in a flat market in 2020?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, jamie. yes. on the second part of the question, in terms of awp or aerials driving margin improvement on flat volume. yes, that would be our expectation, principally driven by our strategic sourcing savings.
again, we're anticipating about $30 million this year. again, that's back-end loaded that will run into next year. and then overall, we expect it in the $70 million to $75 million range for 2020 as we get full implementation of wave 1 and begin implementation of wave 2. so margin expansion on flat volumes would be our expectation when we execute our strategic sourcing savings.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. thank you.
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
i would just add, though, that -- just to the first part of your question, jamie, right, materials processing has been a consistently strong executor for us. you saw in the first half of the year their sales up 9% and the operating margin with a 220 bp improvement year over year. so mp is becoming an increasingly more important part of our overall portfolio and will also be a contributor to successful 2020.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, jamie.

our next question comes from the line of steven fisher from ubs. your line is open.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
thanks. good morning, guys.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, steven.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
i wonder if you could just offer a little bit more color on what really changed in your view of the market dynamics over the last three months because it was a fairly abrupt change to go from producing more to now underproducing. so was it more what you saw in europe? was it more in north america? i think you've cited industrial markets, but just talk a little bit about where deterioration was. was it how weather impacted? it would be helpful. thanks.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, steven, will do. so in terms of aerial, the north american rental channel outlook remains positive. customers believe that they've got good visibility as they go forward. they are being very disciplined in their capex and their capex plan, closely monitoring their utilization rates and rental rates.
so i would say, in north america, highly disciplined. and basically, it didn't grow at the rate but it's just a slight modest decline. and i would -- we're characterizing it, frankly, as relatively stable. but the customer base, which i think is going to be good for the industry, is being very disciplined around their capex.
we -- our drop-off was in europe. we did see a decline -- a moderation in western europe. and that is being impacted by cautious customer sentiment and principally what's transpiring on the continent and then brexit-related activity. so clearly for us, europe was a disappointment in terms of the volume in our expected forecast for the year.
offsetting that to some extent was we continue to see strong growth in asia pacific and china region, up almost 40%. and again, that secular growth trend of adoption. so we think that's intact. we continue to see strong growth.
and so if we look at the back half of this year, we expect it to kind of be similar to the back half of last year as we look for the second half of this year.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then cash flow has been one of the elements of your strategic plans where you feel you still had some work to do to achieve your goals. where do you stand on the operational elements of trying to improve your cash flow? obviously, we saw the results in the quarter, but maybe not from operational-type things.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
so i'll go ahead and have duffy respond on the free cash flow. again, we were pleased with our free cash flow generation in the quarter. with that said, i always believe there's obviously room to continuous improvement, which we will continue to do. and net working capital improvement is a focus that we have at the management team.
duffy, you want to comment on the cash flow?
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
sure. well, i guess i would tell you the following that when you look at the free cash flow generation in the quarter at $168 million, i would attribute that to be operationally driven, very strong collection of receivables in the quarter, as well as driving down the inventory levels in awp, which generated free cash flow. when you look at the reiteration or the reaffirming of our full-year guidance of free cash flow of $165 million for 2019, that means, steve, that we're going to generate $250 million of free cash flow in the second half of this year. that's really being driven by two operational factors.
first is that with the disposition of our mobile cranes businesses, which were a significant user of cash, we will see much greater -- much less cash usage from the mobile cranes businesses. and then no. 2, we will drive down operationally the inventory levels of awp significantly in the second half of the year and that will drive significant cash flow. so that -- we're fully committed to achieving $165 million of free cash flow in the -- in 2019.
and i would just add on top of that that -- as i talked about in my prepared remarks, that on top of that in the second half of the year, specifically in the third quarter, we'll generate $150 million of cash flow or liquidity from the sale of our demag business, as well as the sale of our shares of asv. so we have liquidity of $400 million coming in, in the second half of the year. so i want to assure you that we are absolutely focused as a leadership team and as a total company in the operational needs of generating free cash flow.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
got it. thanks a lot.
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, steven.

our next question comes from the line of ann duignan from jp morgan. your line is open.
ann duignan -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
that's the first time i heard that last name, but anyway...
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, ann.
ann duignan -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good morning. i just want to circle back on the free cash flow. i mean you generated $168 million in q2, but $165 million for the full year. what am i missing? am i missing q1 or something, just simply put?
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. sorry for interrupting, ann duignan.
ann duignan -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
all right.
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so we -- i'm just kidding. so we -- i hate to have to bring it up, but just a recollection that we had a significantly negative free cash flow in the first quarter as we were paying for inventories that we built during the fourth quarter and paid for in the very beginning parts of 2019. so our free cash flow generation for the first half of the year is a negative $88 million. and that's the -- that gets you to then the $250 million for the second half of the year to get to the full year of $165 million.
and we're absolutely committed to generating that $165 million plus the $150 million from the demag proceeds and sales of asv for $400 million of liquidity in the second half of this year.
ann duignan -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. thank you. i should have known that myself. i apologize.
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
no issue, ann.
ann duignan -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
and then secondly, my -- yes. my follow-up question is the mix on telehandlers. i mean why was that a surprise in the quarter? i mean you had a backlog coming into quarter. why wouldn't you have known that the mix was going to swing toward telehandlers in q2?
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i would say, ann, that we have seen a continued level of strength of telehandlers. we certainly did expect some level of elevated telehandler sales. i'd say, they're even more elevated than we had anticipated, and we've extended out through the year the period of time in which those elevated telehandler sales would continue.
so that's -- but as i think i talked about in relation to our guidance that when you look at the principal factors that are driving the guidance change, they're really the euro-dollar exchange rate headwind, the production volume reductions for manufacturing, and then lastly, the lower sales growth than we anticipated, the telehandler and the strategic sourcing points that i made are lesser factors.
ann duignan -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. i appreciate it. i'll leave it there. most of my other questions have been answered.
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, ann.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, ann.
ann duignan -- j.p. morgan -- analyst

our next question will come from the line of stephen volkmann from jefferies. your line is open.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, good morning, guys.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, steven.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
can i just -- maybe i have my numbers wrong, but it looked like you actually didn't change your full-year free cash flow expectations. i guess i would have assumed it be a little higher with the inventory reduction.
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
no. you are correct that we did not change our full-year free cash flow expectation. the -- when -- in our q1 call, we did talk about the fact that we expected to be free cash flow positive in the first -- the next three quarters of the year. and then we expected to be meaningful -- the word i used was meaningfully free cash flow positive in the second quarter.
so while -- certainly, i will give our team kudos for a really strong quarter in cash flow. i'd say it that it's not above the full-year expectation for what we expect to do. so at the moment, we're maintaining our commitment to $165 million of positive free cash flow for the year.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. all right. thanks. and then i guess just when you think about the liquidity that you just mentioned, it sounds like you're going to pay down some debt if you're going to have a better net debt-to-leverage ratio at year-end.
and i guess, it looks like your stock may break $30 today if the pre-market is correct. i guess i'm just curious why you wouldn't see that as maybe a better use of cash.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, steven. we will -- we've been rigorous and following our disciplined capital allocation strategy. so we will continue to do that. we do have $200 million remaining on our previously announced share repurchase program.
we did -- we do believe that share repurchase, especially at the levels you mentioned, is a good use of our cash and a good investment. and so we will give a consideration to that. but as duffy indicated, we do want to reduce our leverage with the initial proceeds. so we're committed to creating long-term shareholder value through our disciplined capital allocation strategy.
and again, we have room on our share repurchase program to purchase shares.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
ok, fair enough. i'll pass it on. thanks.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, steven.

our next question comes from the line of david raso from evercore isi. your line is open.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi, thank you. i'm just trying to drill down on the inventory reduction...
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, david.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi, good morning. i'm trying to drill down to the inventory reduction in awp for the year now. can you give us a better sense of the inventory drawdown expected from the end of '18 to the end of '19 now?
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so david, we would expect that the ending finished goods -- let me start a little differently, i apologize. so you recall that at the end of last year, we had built significant inventories in awp and that we had about $600 million of inventory at the end -- for awp at the end of 2018. and our plans would be that we would reduce that inventory by down to about $400 million or $200 million lower at the end of 2019 versus 2018.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
and has that number now changed? so basically, the inventory reduction is as previously explained?
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
we've achieved about half of that reduction already, david, through the first half of the year.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
i appreciate that. i was just trying to digest, have we looked at the market, thought about where the year could end or go into '20 and decided to take more inventory out. and is the issue in a way, maybe, the market weakened a bit so we're still at the $400 million target. it's just the market weakened a bit, right? so is that the way to think about it? there isn't a lower inventory target now.
it's just the adjustment for the end demand. is that a fair assessment?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i think, david, that's a fair assessment of -- again, slight weakening in north america. we did see a reduction in europe, strengthened asia pacific. but net-net, a moderation in demand, again, still at healthy levels.
and we believe, looking at our 2020 forecast and outlook, that historically, we've operated closer to that $400 million of inventory range. and we think that's a good place for us to be as we go forward. and again -- and i'd encourage investors to look. we did publish in august of last year kind of a long-term industry outlook, and it's on our investor website.
so i want to be clear. i'm not providing guidance dated for 2020 today. but when you look at what we said then, we anticipated 2019 to be up slightly. and it's turning out that it's flat is basically what we're calling now.
at that time, we said 2020 would be flat to slightly down. we're not going to change that at this point in time. and we said 2021 and beyond is the replacement cycle kicks in that you'd see potential substantial growth in replacement cycle coupled with what we expect to continue to see strong growth in the asia pacific, china region with adoptions. so we're not changing our longer-term outlook.
it's just with the level of inventory we had and slight moderation in demand and the fact that we did produce -- again, we produced at a higher level last year with a conscious decision to maintain continuity in a tight labor market, and we just decided we needed to adjust that. so unfortunately, we have to produce at lower than the demand forecast to bring our inventory levels down in line with what we're looking for.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. so as a framework then we can look at that $400 million as a number you're generally comfortable with, with a flattish environment in 2020? i assume that's...
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think that's -- right now, david, what i provided in 2020 guidance, i think that's a good assumption. it's a good operating assumption.
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
and it's totally fair.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
no, i appreciate that. really appreciate your help. thank you.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, david.

our next question comes from the line of seth weber from rbc capital markets. your line is open.
seth weber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
good morning.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, seth.
seth weber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
good morning. i just wanted to go back to the kind of slight moderation in north america rental comment for a second and try and better understand that. because in the first-quarter call, you talked about march orders actually being better. and so can you characterize what happened? was it the large nationals canceling or pushing orders out? or just you're not seeing the pickup from the independents or the smaller regional guys? is there any way you could frame kind of that softening for us?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i'll try to put it this way. i would say, the word that we used is being very disciplined around capex. the national accounts clearly are, but we're also seeing it in the independents, where they're paying very close attention to utilization and their rental rates.
and they're modifying their capex in the short term around how their utilization and rental rates are flowing. and so we have seen pushouts. we have not seen cancellations necessarily. but we have seen pushouts of demand and indications that their back-half expectations weren't as high as they originally started in the year.
so in our siop process -- the sales forecast, we fed that in. and then the team made the management decision that it was time to reduce our production levels given our growing in inventory position.
seth weber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. thank you. and then just can you give any more color on the -- you made a comment about some caution in the north america mp business.
i'm sorry if i missed how you characterized that. but is there anything else you can add as to what's driving that and how -- are you concerned about it? is that something we should be thinking about going into 2020? thanks.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks. again, we as we've said, mp has been a great consistent performer. we really like the fact that they've got good diversification, both geographically and across our portfolio of businesses. what we saw in north america, in the crushing and screening business, is we've seen dealer inventory.
and again, this isn't really a stocking level like a yellow iron dealer. they bring inventory and then it usually goes out on rent. the good news is, we're seeing high rent and utilization, but we haven't necessarily seen the conversion from rental to purchase. so that's what we'll be watching here in the last six months of -- the last five months or so of the year is what happens to the dealer inventory converting from the rental fleet into a sale.
overall market is still strong, being driven by aggregate consumption and construction spending. we did see some modification or some hesitation in europe as well, not that dissimilar to awp, given what's going on in the european continent. but again, offsetting that is the adoption in areas like india. now that the election is over in india, that's become a very important market for our overall mp business and we've seen good growth there.
and then finally, material handlers is in that segment, and we've seen really strong growth in material handlers over the course of the last year or so and they continue to execute well. what we will watch there as material handlers scrap, steal pricing will have an impact on that demand. so that will be something we're watching closely. but overall, we believe the mp -- material handler market looks good.
i discussed strength in the environmental. and then finally our concrete mixer business in the u.s. is relatively stable. so again, overall consistent performance, 9% growth year-to-date.
we increased the sales forecast slightly for the full year based on a strong first-half performance. but we're watching it. and again, good strong underlying demand, but there's things that we're watching closely to see what that leads to future demand. but again, they execute well.
and if there's opportunities in the marketplace, we'll be able to take advantage of them.
seth weber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thank you very much. i appreciate the comments.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks seth.

our next question comes from the line of courtney yakavonis from morgan stanley. your line is open.
courtney yakavonis -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks for the question. i guess i just wanted to understand kind of how your thought process progressed through the quarter. and when it was that you decided to make the reduction in production? was it something you saw early in the quarter? was it really a pretty significant drop-off in june? and maybe just how we should be thinking about orders trending quarter-to-date and july? and then secondly, how we should be thinking about pricing in this increasingly more cautious environment given that you were expecting to roll in some pretty significant pricing this year? thanks.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, courtney. a couple of questions here. i'm not sure i got them all but if i don't, you guys jump in. so on the first one, we have a monthly snop or siop process, and as we got into the quarter, seeing what our demand forecast looked like given our existing levels of inventory, that's when the team made the decision that it was time to reduce our production levels for the remainder of the year.
so it's a month-to-month process that we review looking at our demand and supply balance and forecast and they made the call -- i would say, pretty much in the middle of the quarter is when the decision was made. overall pricing. pricing in the marketplace is competitive. we are getting positive price in the year.
price is offsetting for the most part material cost increases. we are being very disciplined around our pricing with our commercial excellence and also around -- that also feeds into our inventory and inventory levels. we don't want to be in a position with more inventory than we need because that's a negative on overall pricing. so i think pricing in the marketplace is holding, and we are seeing positive year-over-year price.
but again, as we've said along, it's designed to help offset material cost increases that we've experienced here the last couple of years. did i get all your questions there, courtney?
courtney yakavonis -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes. and sorry, i just had one more. just on terex utilities, is that also a segment where you're seeing some caution right now? and are you producing production there? or should we expect that to be relatively in line with your expectations this year?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, courtney. no. terex utilities is really having a good year. they're in line with expectations.
we're not seeing -- given the electric grid and the needs in the electric grid in north america, some good international sales. so i would say utilities is performing in line with expectations. no changes to that environment. and as we've indicated, it's about $400 million.
so it's about 15% of our awp segment. operating margins about 9% to 10% and it's consistent. and the other thing about aerials -- i'm sorry, utilities is that $400 million, it's about $100 million, plus or minus, a quarter. so it's pretty consistent through the year.
it doesn't have the same seasonality factors that the aerial business does. so again, the team is executing their strategies around new product development. we're working hard on the new manufacturing facility. that's going to help us significantly simplify and drive some manufacturing productivity and give us some incremental capacity that we need going forward.
so no. i would say utilities is in line with expectations.
courtney yakavonis -- morgan stanley -- analyst
i'm sorry. i think i also just asked if you have any quarter-to-date trends on orders?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
no. we haven't commented on quarter-to-date trends on orders.
courtney yakavonis -- morgan stanley -- analyst

our final question today will come from the line of jerry revich from goldman sachs. your line is open.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. good morning, everyone.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, jerry.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
you folks have been really focused on making sure you can scale production up and down with the cycles. can you talk about where capacity utilization stands today in terms of number of shifts you folks are running and over time? and if in aerial platform demand is weaker in north america from here? what should we look for in terms of your ability to manage costs on a production cut, if we need a greater one for north america?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, jerry. so overall, i'd say, right now most of our assembly operations are operating on single shift. there are a couple of exceptions. some of the back shops paint, in some cases, is running on multiple shifts.
so we do have capacity. awp has historically dealt with seasonal productional swings and the ups and downs. so we'll continue to focus on the ability to execute production volume changes and doing it efficiently. so we have capacity.
and again, most of the issues that we're talking about now really are our north american plants, our european plants and our major facility in china. china is actually operating closer to two shifts. so it really is the issues that we're talking about are in the north american plant.
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
and greater than 80% of our cost of goods sold is variable. and so when there is a reduction in demand, we can take the cost structure out and the awp operational team knows how to do that. so we would -- in a reducing or declining production environment, awp operations will take cost out.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
and again, jerry, i just want to reiterate for subsequent years execution of the strategic sourcing is important to drive margin improvement.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. and then we've heard very good things about your product performance in china and your margin profile in china compared to the rest of the aerial platform business. can you just talk about what order cadence has been like in that part of the business? and are you considering plans for expansion? i believe the entire industry is approaching full capacity utilization, in china, specifically.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so we've seen good order rates, good strong demand for china. china itself. asia pacific region, it's become a more important manufacturing site for us globally in china.
and i'll be over there the first week of september. we are making an investment to expand our capacity in -- production capacity in china both for awp, our utilities business. and we believe there's going to be an opportunity to create a mobile mp business in china that virtually right now we don't have much of anything, but we're starting to see the mobile mp side of the adoption equation start to pick up in china. so we believe that that's a potential good trend for us longer term.
so yes, we -- china is important to us as a production site for global production for the chinese market, and we are planning an expansion in china.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
and are you willing to comment the order of magnitude of the expansion, john?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
from a capex standpoint, i'd say i'll hold that for right now. and -- we haven't finalized the approval of it, jerry. so let me hold off on that.
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
in terms of square footage increase, though, it is a really significant increase in our manufacturing capacity.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
right. i just don't want to say capex yet, jerry, until we sign off on things. don't want to put myself on the negative negotiating position.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
i appreciate that. thank you.

[operator instructions] brian henry, senior vice president of business development and investor relations, you may begin your conference.
brian henry -- senior vice president of business development and investor relations
good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in today's second-quarter 2019 financial results conference call. participating on today's call are john garrison, chairman and chief executive officer; and john sheehan, senior vice president and chief financial officer. following the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. we have reduced our second-quarter 2019 results, a copy of which is available on terex.com.
today's call is being webcast and is accompanied by a slide presentation, which includes a reconciliation of gaap to non-gaap financial measures that we will use during this call and is also available on our website. all adjusted per share amounts in the presentation are on a fully diluted basis. we will post a replay of this call on the terex website under events and presentations in the investor relations section. let me direct your attention to slide 2, which is our forward-looking statement and description of non-gaap financial measures.
we encourage you to read this, as well as other items in our disclosures because the information we will be discussing today does include forward-looking material. with that, please turn to slide 3, and i'll turn it over to john garrison. 
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, and thank you for joining us and for your interest in terex. first, i want to thank our global team for their intense focus on creating a zero-harm safety culture, delivering value for our customers and their commitment to implementing our strategy. terex continued to grow in the second quarter. global demand for our leading products and services remained stable, and we continued to meet the needs of our diverse customer base.
mp continued its excellent operating performance, increasing sales and expanding operating margins again in the second quarter. they achieved strong growth across their global portfolio. awp markets in north america have moderated slightly but remained at healthy levels. in europe, demand is being impacted by the overall economic environment leading to cautious customer sentiment.
we continue to see strong growth in the asia pacific region, including china. as john will discuss in more depth, awp operating margins in the quarter did not meet our expectations. margins were impacted by the weak euro, our decision to lower production volume to better align global inventory levels with demand and product mix. i was extremely pleased with our free cash flow performance as we generated $168 million in the quarter, more than double last year's q2 result.
this strong cash generation performance reflects our global team's continuing focus on improving working capital efficiency. our improving financial results with adjusted operating margins greater than 10% and adjusted eps increasing 23% from what we presented in our q2 earnings release in july 2018 demonstrates the financial improvements we are realizing by focusing our portfolio and implementing our strategy. turning to slide 4. we continue to implement our strategy to focus the portfolio on great businesses, simplify the organization and enhance the capabilities needed to win in the marketplace.
a foundational element of our execute-to-win business system is the annual business strategy we use. over the past several weeks, i've met with the leadership teams of each of our businesses for comprehensive, multi-day reviews on their strategic plans. these reviews ensure our investment priorities are aligned with the growth potential in our global markets. in developed markets, we expect industrial and nonresidential construction demand, including the need for infrastructure investment, and the size and age of the fleet to drive medium- and longer-term growth.
looking at the developing markets, we expect economic growth and adoption of more advanced mobile equipment to fuel growth over our planning horizon. we're making strategic investments in production capacity and product and service innovation to ensure we capitalize on broad-based growth potential. turning to slide 5. we continue to make progress implementing our strategy.
the sale of demag mobile cranes is expected to close in the coming days. we'll execute our plans to ensure a smooth transition for our customers and team members to tadano. we remain committed to the rough terrain and tower crane product lines in north america and around the world. we've implemented a new sales and service organization in north america and are investing in our capabilities to support our customers into the future.
we continue to simplify terex. the transition to a more focused two-segment structure, combined with the significant progress we made improving processes, tools and leadership talent in our priority areas enabled us to refine our corporate operating model. each functional area is implementing plans to continue to deliver essential services in an efficient and cost-effective manner that reduces operating expenses. implementation will continue into the second half of 2019.
we continue to execute the organic growth element of our disciplined capital allocation strategy by investing in innovative products and services and global manufacturing capability. the new utilities manufacturing facility in south dakota remains on schedule and within budget. mp's capacity expansions in india and northern ireland also remain on track. these investments enable simplification, improved manufacturing productivity and growth.
we continue to invest in our execute-to-win priority areas. our commercial organizations operate with more process discipline enabled by investments in training and systems. our life cycle solutions strategy is taking shape. we have a world-class leadership team in place, and we'll be making investments to dramatically increase our share in the growing markets of parts, services and related opportunities.
finally, on strategic sourcing, teams in each of our manufacturing facilities are implementing their wave 1 savings. wave 2 savings are starting to be realized as certain opportunities are being fast-tracked, while other savings plans are being developed. based upon awp's lower production levels and spend forecast, we expect savings of approximately $30 million this year. turning to slide 6.
based on our first-half performance and changes to the outlook in awp for the balance of 2019, including lower-than-previously expected sales growth, reduced production volume, adverse foreign exchange and product mix, we expect full-year eps to be between $3.40 and $3.80 on net sales of approximately $4.6 billion. we continue to focus on working capital and improving cash flow, and we are reaffirming our free cash flow guidance of approximately $165 million. with that, let me turn it over to john.
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, john. let me begin by reviewing our q2 segment highlights. awp sales totaled $870 million in the quarter, up about 5% on an fx-neutral basis. sales in north america were steady and volume in emea was down modestly.
we increased sales in asia, including china, driven by market growth and increased product adoption. awp's operating margin in the quarter was lower than we expected and impacted by several headwinds. first, a relatively weak euro, which declined 7% versus u.s. dollar compared to q2 last year, which translated to slightly over $6 million of operating profit headwind.
as we have discussed in the past, a weak euro pressured awp margins in europe as a large portion of the product sold in the region is produced in north america and china. margins were also impacted by lower factory overhead absorption, resulting from our decision to reduce production to better align global inventory levels with demand. global awp production volume in q2 2019 was approximately 20% lower than q2 2018. and lastly, while overall sales were steady compared to last year, the mix of sales was queued to telehandlers, which also impacted awp margins in the quarter.
backlog was stable at at approximately $750 million, and bookings were similar to last year, up modestly on an fx-neutral basis. materials processing continued its strong performance, achieving another excellent quarter. sales were $365 million, up 9% or up 13% on an fx-neutral basis, driven by continued strong global demand for crushing and screening products, material handlers and picking harry cranes. the mp team delivered a very strong operating margin of 15.4%, representing an expansion of 220 basis points, generating 27% more operating profit than the prior-year quarter.
these results were driven by improved operating performance across the portfolio and effective price cost management. the british pound to u.s. dollar exchange rate provided a modest tailwind to mp margins in the quarter. backlog of $364 million is consistent with our full-year outlook.
mp is well positioned across its portfolio of businesses to continue to deliver excellent results. the rough terrain and tower crane businesses that are reported in corporate continued to perform in line with expectations in q2. let's turn to slide 8 to review our consolidated results. total sales of $1.3 billion were up 4% or up approximately 8% on an fx-neutral basis.
the currency, production and mix headwinds that impacted awp margins were partially offset by the strong performance in mp and reductions in corporate expenses, leading to an overall adjusted operating margin of 10.1%. investment in our execute-to-win initiatives and restructuring-related charges were the primary differences between our as-reported and as-adjusted operating profits. net interest expense increased approximately $7 million year over year, resulting from increased borrowing and higher interest rates on floating rate facilities. on an adjusted basis, we generated earnings per share of $1.21.
while this quarter's eps was lower than the prior-year quarter on a comparative basis, the result is 23% better than the $0.98 per share as adjusted eps we presented in q2 2018, demonstrating the benefits of our strategy execution. turning to slide 9. we continue to deliver on our commitment to follow a disciplined capital allocation strategy. i was proud of our global team's focus on improving working capital and free cash flow performance in the second quarter.
we generated $168 million, more than double last year and more than double our net income in the quarter. we reduced inventory by $92 million since march. however, we continue to hold more than the prior year. as i mentioned earlier, we adjusted production rates down significantly in awp and expect inventory levels to continue to normalize during the second half of the year.
in addition to free cash flow, we are generating cash through our portfolio actions. the sales of demag mobile cranes and our shares of asv are expected to generate approximately $150 million in cash proceeds in q3. as of june 30, our net debt-to-adjusted ebitda ratio was a healthy 2.0 times, down from 2.4 times at march 31. we expect our net leverage ratio to decline further in the second half of the year.
we continue to invest in our execute-to-win priority areas, although the level of investment will taper off during the second half of 2019 as our internal capabilities continue to mature. looking at return on invested capital. for the second consecutive quarter, we achieved a greater than 20% return on invested capital. the terex team has and will continue to generate shareholder value through the execution of our disciplined capital allocation strategy.
turning to our full-year financial guidance, on page 10. based on our actual performance in the first two quarters and outlook for the second half of 2019, we are updating our guidance for the full year. we now expect full-year 2019 sales to grow between 1% and 3% to a midpoint of approximately $4.6 billion, our operating margin outlook is now 8.8% to 9.3%, and our eps guidance range has been updated to $3.40 to $3.80 per share. we are reaffirming our full-year free cash flow guidance of $165 million.
from a segment perspective, we expect overall awp performance in the second half of 2019 to be similar to the second half of last year from a revenue and margin perspective. the lower-than-previously expected sales and production volume and adverse foreign exchange rates and product mix implies a full-year outlook for a stable top line with operating margins between 9% and 9.5%. a significant driver of this operating performance update is the euro-dollar exchange rate, which is an approximately $30 million negative impact for the full-year 2019. we expect mp to continue its strong operating performance.
we are increasing full-year guidance to sales growth of between 4% and 7% and operating margin of 14% to 14.5%. mp operates several facilities in the u.k. our guidance range assumes there are no major disruptions associated with brexit. we continue to monitor events as the brexit process unfolds.
finally, we anticipate the distribution of the remainder of our 2019 earnings per share to be approximately 55% in q3 and 45% in q4. and with that, i'll turn it back to you, john.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, john. turning to slide 11. i'll review our segments, starting with awp. the overall global market for awp is moderating but remains at a healthy level.
the north american rental customers are maintaining a generally positive outlook and continue to be disciplined in their fleet management, based on utilization and rate expectations, and the north american utility market remained strong. we are seeing overall demand moderate in europe. awp continues to grow in the asia pacific region, fueled by increasing product adoption. we're providing asian customers with a winning value proposition, advanced products, lifecycle parts & service and tailored financing solutions.
we continue to expect strong, long-term growth in the, asia pacific region. overall bookings in the quarter were similar to last year, up slightly on an fx-neutral basis. a key to improving margins in awp is the execution of our strategic sourcing plans, including transitioning significant volume to new suppliers. we deployed wave 1 implementation teams in each of our manufacturing facilities, and this transition to new suppliers is going well.
wave 2 savings plans are also taking shape as the global demand and supply dynamics normalize. we're seeing more opportunities to fast-track savings. we're working with several incumbent suppliers to generate savings that we expect to ramp up in the fourth quarter of 2019 and into 2020. we'll change some suppliers in wave 2 but to a lesser extent than wave 1.
as i mentioned, our full-year 2019 savings is now expected to be approximately $30 million, given our lower production levels and spend forecast. most of these savings are in awp. the rollout of our genie lift connect telematics solutions is going well. using advanced diagnostics, this system can alert customers to performance issues, help optimize maintenance and increase our participation in the life cycle economics of the equipment.
from a customer's perspective, lift connect helps increase operator safety, improve rental revenue and reduce maintenance cost. genie has a robust product development pipeline and will continue to fill out our extra capacity line and launch a series of products over the coming months and years that address specific customer needs and differentiate genie in the markets around the world. turning to terex utilities. the team continues to execute well in a strong market.
construction of the new state-of-the-art production facility remains on track. this is an important investment for terex. it will improve our position in the utility equipment market that has considerable growth potential in north america and in developing markets. the new site will increase capacity and significantly improve productivity.
both our aerials and utilities businesses are well positioned in their respective markets and are implementing strategic plans to grow and expand margins over the medium- and longer-term planning horizons. turning to mp. materials processing is a high-performing segment that delivers strong results and consistently meets its commitments. global demand for crushing and screening equipment is generally stable at healthy levels.
construction activity, aggregate consumption and environmental regulatory change were the main drivers. the global market for material handlers remained supportive. however, we are seeing a degree of caution in the end markets in north america and europe for both of these product categories. our cement mixer truck business in the united states is stable, and our pick & carry crane business continues to execute well.
the value proposition of our material processing equipment extends beyond its traditional crushing and screening applications into environmental applications, and our global environmental business continues to grow. the picture on the slide shows an evoquip crusher processing material at our new mp site in the u.k. the material from the excavation was processed on site and is used as a base layer to expand and strengthen the local roads. not only this reduced the cost of excavation in road construction, but it kept 650 cubic meters of materials from being transported to a landfill.
during our strategy review, we discussed mp's significant growth potential in environmental and across this product range in developing markets as customers are just starting to appreciate the benefits of highly efficient mobile equipment. we will continue to make strategic investments enable growth in materials processing. mp also continues to make progress on the digital front. dealers from around the world recently attended the powerscreen's digital dealer forums in ireland and chicago.
the mp team showcased its vision for the full enabled dealer of the future. the emerging technology enabled best-in-class life cycle solutions, including closer connections to end customers to improve uptime and overall customer experience. reactions from the forums were quite positive and dealers believe these tools would differentiate us in the marketplace. i expect the global mp team to continue to execute at a high level and deliver on its plans again this year.
turning to slide 13. to wrap up our prepared remarks. our global team continues to work hard to improve execution and meet the needs of our customers. we are implementing our strategic plans, the focus the portfolio on high-performing businesses, simplify the organization and enhance capabilities in our execute-to-win priority areas.
we expect to significantly improve our financial performance again in 2019, including generating approximately $165 million of free cash flow. we are confident in achieving our 2020 objectives of 10% operating margin and greater than 20% roic. finally, we'll continue to follow our disciplined capital allocation strategy while investing in future growth and creating additional value for our shareholders. with that, let me turn it back to brian.
brian henry -- senior vice president of business development and investor relations
thanks, john. [operators instructions] with that, i'd like to open it up for questions. operator?
",2019-Q2,TEX
1.0,1.0,":
operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from jamie cook with credit suisse. your line is open.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. good morning. i guess a couple of questions. first, on the aerial side.
one, can you just help us understand what the production cuts are implied for the back half of the year versus when you guided last quarter, and the risk that the production cuts will have to continue into 2020? because obviously, that has implications on margins for 2020 given where we are in the back half. second, on the supply chain, it sounds like you're a little behind. because demand is lower, what are the new expectations in terms of what that will contribute in the back half of the year? or is this push to 2020, and it is a lower number. and then last, the 10% sort of 2020 top line on outlook, the down 10%.
understand you don't really want to give guidance, but with regards to aerial, should we assume you're someway -- somewhere in the range of what oshkosh guided to yesterday for 2020?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, jamie. jamie, several questions there. so let me start with the production changes, and then i'll have duffy speak to the -- to the margin impacts. i think we have to take us back to last year at this time in q3 and q4.
we made the decision to maintain a high level of production -- or higher level of production than normal in a tight labor market and built up the inventory in anticipation for a stronger 2019. as 2019 has turned out, it has not been as strong. i think our customers are being very disciplined in their capex plans, aggressively managing their utilization on rental rates and used equipment, which i think is going to be good for us as we move into '20 -- back half of 2020 and 2021. but in that environment, we made the decision to significantly reduce production volumes in q3, down about 30%.
and again, in q4, down about 45%. and again, we're going to be very disciplined to not overproduce to the global demand. and so with this lower production volume, it has clearly impacted our margins in q3 and q4. so duffy, would you like to comment on the margin impact?
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so i think, jamie, as it relates to your other questions on strategic sourcing, we did lower the savings for the year, for '19 as a result of the lower production that we're seeing in awp, that's buying down to $25 million. we still are very positive on our strategic sourcing initiative. the savings rates that we're getting are in line with our expectations, and we see that program continuing to contribute to our bottom-line profitability in 2020.
we've talked previously about a $70-ish million level of savings next year. and as you pointed out, we're not providing -- we will provide our financial guidance in february. and at that time, we'll update exactly where we'll be with respect to all of our financial performance for '20, including our strategic sourcing initiative. i would say as it relates to 2020 revenue outlook, as we indicated in our remarks, we are planning conservatively for revenue to be down 10%, and that's what we're using for our production planning purposes today.
when we provide financial guidance in february, we'll update exactly where we are from a financial perspective. because at that point, we'll have much better visibility to the results of our discussions with our customers that take place here over the course of q4 and into january.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
but duffy, to be clear, is the expectation for you to produce in line with retail demand in 2020, at least for aerial, given where we are today?
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
that is correct. i didn't make that point. but as i thought, it was inherent in john's response. that is correct.
the reduction of the 30% for awp production in q3, 45% year over year in q4 is intended to bring our inventories down, in awp down $200 million over the course of 2019, such that we are producing in line with retail demand or customer demand, let me say, in 2020.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. thanks. i'll let someone else get in.
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, jim.
operator
your next question comes from ann duignan with jp morgan. your line is open.
ann duignan -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
well, i can change my first name, but it is still me. most of my questions have been answered, but i will ask one perhaps on materials processing. that business has been just a great performer in the up cycle, and i'm assuming has pretty high fixed costs, given that nature of the equipment. so what should we consider would be normal decremental margins for that business? i'm assuming they're going to be on the high side, somewhere around the 30%.
is that correct? or am i missing anything?
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
no. so, ann, thanks for the question. and you are absolutely correct that the mp team has done a great job as they have increased their margins over the last several years, actually in excess of the 25% incremental margins that we have traditionally thought about for our businesses. on the downside in the decrementals, we would also expect that mp would be in the 25% range for their decremental margins.
i think that they have demonstrated that they are very cost-conscious on the upside and will be similarly cost-conscious on the downside. so say, 25% decremental margins is an appropriate place to think about for the mp business.
ann duignan -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. and just a quick follow-up. on the material handling side, is this the first quarter where you've noticed a slowdown in customer demand? or i -- did i just miss it in last quarter?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
no. on material handlers, we've had a good rise in sales on our material handlers looks business over the last several quarters. and so yes, this is the first time we've seen kind of the bookings in the backlog begin to come down. and again, that's principally being driven by scrap metal prices around the world.
as scrap metal prices have come down, that impacts the demand for that segment. but the team's done a good job on the upside. i'm confident they'll do a good job as the volume comes down. and that team's also working to expand our regional mix and our customer mix moving beyond scrap metal.
but clearly, scrap metal is impacting our material handling business and will impact it as we go into 2020.
ann duignan -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. thank you. i appreciate it. i'll get back in line.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from seth weber with rbc capital markets. your line is open.
seth weber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody. i wanted to ask about the awp. appreciate the color on the changing order cadence, but the -- but then you kind of called out, and i think it was 19% down kind of apples-to-apples. can you just give any color where that's coming from? is that spread pretty evenly, u.s., europe? or is there anything you would call out from that's contributing to that 19% delta?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
right. thanks, seth. yes. last year, in q3, we actually had three large customer orders that booked the apos in their annual plan in q3 last year.
one of which was a large u.s. customer, two of which were larger european customers, about equally split in terms of the amount, approximately $240 million. and i think that was the environment that we were in last year, as customers were looking to plan earlier in the cycle. we had longer lead times, other competitors that had longer lead times.
and as we move into this year, i'd say the team is saying, we're seeing a normal pattern. as we're moving into november and december and early january, we're starting those conversations or engage in those conversations with the larger national accounts. so we did want to call that out that, that did occur last year, and it did not reoccur in q3 of this year.
seth weber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
right, right. sorry, john. i thought i had heard that the -- excluding those three contracts, that the base business, the balance of the ordering was still down or almost 20%. that's what i thought i heard.
that -- was that not correct?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, that is correct, seth. it was down -- as we reported, it was down more. this explains that it wasn't down quite as dramatically as it seems.
seth weber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
right. so i was just trying to get some color on that 19% or 20%, if that's equally spread. is that europe? is it more u.s.?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. sorry, seth. sorry about that. so yes, let me just talk about the regional dynamics within the aerial work -- awp business.
in north america, we're seeing our customers and in europe to be very disciplined around their fleet and fleet utilization, aggressively managing the utilization, rental rates and used equipment. so we saw a very strong growth frankly in the -- on the '18 time frame and growth in our fleet. that's come down now. as we look into the back half of 2019 and into 2020, i will say the high utilization rates that our customers are experiencing will help as we move into the back half of 2020 and into 2021, with the replacement cycle that high utilization is clearly going to help in north america for the replacement cycle.
in europe, we are seeing the macroeconomic environment is more severe in europe. our sales in europe were -- in the quarter were down greater than 20%. our bookings are down as well. i think the global economic uncertainty in europe with brexit, the situation in germany, italy, what was going on in france is just caused a pause in the european market.
and so we did see a decline in europe. and obviously, we're monitoring that quite closely as we go forward to see how that business is going to perform going into 2020. but the macroenvironment in europe was more severe of the environment that we saw in north america. and then offsetting all that was dramatic growth in china.
with the adoption story, we've got a fantastic manufacturing facility in china that produces not only for china, but the asia pacific region and exports into europe. and so we continue to see strong growth in china, but ameliorating growth in europe and to a lesser extent, in north america.
seth weber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. that's super helpful, john. and just on china, is there any kind of -- are you banging up against capacity constraints? or how are you set up there? can you handle more demand on the current footprint?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so thank you, seth. i was in china earlier in the quarter. and two years ago, we implemented the phase two and grew our capacity in china, and we're already through that capacity in china.
so we're looking at a phase 3 expansion at our plant in china. we're excited about it. we've got a fully integrated team in china, a great management team, local management team, a great chinese cost structure. and so we will be expanding in 2020 in our chinese operations.
and again, it's to meet the capacity needs, both within china, but also to export out of china into asia pacific and other regions. this is a very effective place for us to manufacture.
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
i would just add that the expansion of our china manufacturing facility is a contributing factor for the $100 million capex amount for 2020 that we highlighted in the presentation. and that, that as we organically invest in our business, it's important to invest in our high-performing businesses, and china is certainly one of those.
seth weber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thank you very much, guys. i appreciate it.
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, seth.
operator
your next question comes from david raso with evercore isi. your line is open.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi. thank you. i was just curious -- i hopped on late, so apologize if i missed this, but the cash flow was a little disappointing to take it down in the guide, even more than the implied ebit was cut. so i'm thinking about the net debt to ebitda, it's improved, right, it went from 2.0 times to nearly 1.5 times at the end of the quarter.
when we think of anything to offset what appears to be a difficult cyclical situation for '20 on the down 10% sales, we can debate the decrementals. how should we expect the balance sheet usage to be utilized to push back against that operational downturn in 2020?
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so thanks, david. when you look at the free cash flow forecast that we provided today or guidance that we provided today at $110 million, the reduction is really attributable to the reduction in earnings. i think that the difference between the reduction in earnings and the reduction in the free cash flow is within the range of noise. we generated over $100 million of free cash flow in the third quarter.
that's after generating $168 million of free cash flow in q2. and the guidance we provided today implies about $100 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. so the business is clearly throwing off cash flow in -- even in this declining macroeconomic environment that we're operating in. i would say that the working capital, i would expect that in a declining revenue environment this year, that working capital will continue to be a source of cash.
we'll provide financial guidance specifically on 2020 free cash flow. but we do expect that free cash flow will continue to be strong, i would say, without providing guidance, at least as strong as 2019. and we'll finish this year with net debt-to-ebitda or net leverage below the -- based upon the free cash flow of $100 million in the fourth quarter, below the 1.5 that we're at here in the -- at september 30. so we think the balance sheet is very well positioned.
terex's balance sheet has never been stronger, and we are absolutely focused on managing and improving our working capital performance and increasing free cash flow.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
well, two things i'd say, though. one, when you cut your production that much at awp, as much as you lose some earnings, you would think the cash flow from working capital would be a bigger beneficiary than simply having to give away the cash flow equal to the ebit cut. so i would have thought the working capital offset where it may be.
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i think the --
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
well, at least it offsets some of the ebit. and if you can answer my question, i apologize. but my question was more about, ok, so the balance sheet can be an asset going into next year. how should we think about the management's decision to push back against the ebit declines? share repo, things lined up for m&a.
just wave some perspective.
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so i apologize, i guess i didn't pick up on the last point specifically. on -- so i do believe that net working capital will be a contributor to free cash flow, and that will be more so in the early 2020 time period than necessarily here as we close out 2019. that's why i do believe that our free cash flow in 2020 will be stronger than 2019. as it relates to whether -- to other actions we may take with the very strong balance sheet that we have will follow our disciplined capital allocation strategy, invest in or -- in the organic growth in the business.
and then we will potentially return cash to shareholders. we've returned $1.35 billion of cash to shareholders over the last two-plus years. we do view terex shares as a good investment, and we'll continue to strategically consider reinvestment back in our business. i'd say on the inorganic side, that certainly we'll continue to consider that.
but when we follow our disciplined capital allocation, right now, today, our focus is on organic investment in our business.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
and i guess a little more, if you could. i mean, i'm not trying to push here, but just a sense of what's the target, say, net debt-to-ebitda that you're comfortable with so we can at least think through whatever the ebitda decline is next year? what are you comfortable with on the leverage? again, this year, you're probably end a bit below 1.5. so if you can just --
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
no. so we've talked before, and really, nothing has changed that we're comfortable with net debt in the 2, 2.5 times. but i would also say that where we are in the industrial cycle right now, we're very pleased to have our net debt-to-ebitda, substantially below that in the 1.5 times net debt-to-ebitda at september 30, and we have over $1.1 billion of liquidity available to us as of today. and so we'll continue to consider how we use our balance sheet to drive shareholder value.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
i appreciate that. ok. thank you so much.
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, david.

your next question comes from jerry revich with goldman sachs. your line is open.
ben burud -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone. this is ben burud on for jerry revich. just want to start in aerials.
two years ago, your aerial work platforms business was about the same size as oshkosh is. and now you're, let's say, about 20% smaller. can you help us think about what's driving that difference? is this -- apparently, it could be a share loss? or are your production adjustments playing a role on a relative basis?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
so thanks, ben. obviously, as we spoke about, pretty significant production changes and reductions in 2019. as it pertains to the share based on aem data, our market share is consistent. north america is stable on a product-by-product basis.
we have a higher mix of booms and scissors. telehandlers are not as big a part of our overall business as other players in the industry. our european market share is relatively constant. booms are steady.
scissors, we did see a small -- low single-digit market share change over the course of the last 12 months or so, but we're seeing that rebound in europe. telehandlers are quite small. so we're really not a player in the european telehandler market. and as i've talked, china would see dramatic -- significant growth in china as the china adoption story really takes off in the market.
and i was there in september. we'll continue to grow as we spoke earlier to invest in our plant in china. from a market share standpoint, the market share is changing, but that's really a result of the number of chinese manufacturers that are reporting now in two things. so overall, we feel -- as we think about our commercial excellence, we're laser-focused on delivering value for customers, and that comes from product and service innovation.
if you look at our awp line, we got out ahead of the market with our booms or extra capacity booms launch, which are ansi-compliant, launched those in '18 and '19. the competitors are going to have to match an ansi-compliant boom as we go from december 10 onwards. our scissors, you see on the scissor side that we're investing in technology there. and we're also investing in telematics.
the -- all of the our machines are going out with telematics and telematics solutions. so we're providing a true value package for our customers, and our teams working hard on selling that value package so that we can continue to win in the marketplace. so -- and i might add, as we go through a challenging industry cycle, we will not be reducing our research and development spend across any of our businesses. we will continue to invest in new products and services.
these businesses are cyclical. we realize that. and -- but we're going to invest through the cycle to ensure that we've got the best products and services in the marketplace to win. and so that -- that's how i'd respond to that in terms of our relative position in the marketplace.
it's something, obviously, we pay very, very close attention to. and -- but again, we're focused on customers and how can we deliver customers value.
ben burud -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. got it. and i was hoping you could just provide a little more granularity regarding what's embedded in that 10% revenue outlook for 2020. i'm assuming we'll see a meaningfully larger decline in aerials relative to materials processing.
but just wanted to check given the uncharacteristic weakness we've seen in materials processing book-to-bill ratios over the last two quarters. and i just want to make sure we're properly aligned given the higher-margin performance in materials as well.
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so i think that number one is that the 10% that we're referencing today is what we're operationally planning for from a production perspective. and we will provide our financial guidance in february, just to reiterate that point. when you think about the production planning that we're doing right now, we're planning for about 10% down across our business lines or business segments.
so it's not one business planning for their production to be down significantly more than the other.
ben burud -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thank you.
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, ben.
operator
our next question comes from mircea dobre with baird. your line is open.
mircea dobre -- robert w. baird and co. -- analyst
good morning, everyone. just wanted to follow up on that last comment. so when you're sort of making this plan for a 10% production cut, is this a factor of the backlog erosion that you have seen in 2019? or does this embed already some kind of a view as to where your orders are going to be in 2020 based on what you know from your customers and end market?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, mig. it really is a combination of both. you've got a siop process that the teams run based on their sales forecast. usually, out in most cases, 18 months.
so you continue to update your sales forecast and your production plans based on that sales forecast. obviously, you are looking at orders in that case and backlog. so it is a combination, but really the biggest driver is looking out to the sales forecast as we go forward. and i might say in both awp and -- in mp and awp, we were at historically high levels of backlog in that '18 -- '17, '18 time period.
likewise, with our mp business, coming into this year, we had historically high backlog of almost $400 million. historically, that business is really not used to operating at that level of backlog. normally, it's with -- it's more of a shorter cycle book-to-bill business. that business is about 75% of their sales go through a distribution channel.
so the team's monitoring it. it's an ongoing active process of the sales forecast, adjusting your production schedules. and then sometimes, we have to step in, like matt and the team did at awp and make decisions that based on labor and things of that nature. so that's why i explained the changes that we made at awp.
and then mp, consistent process across their businesses, looking at what does that 12- to 18-month sales forecast look like and the production plans to that. obviously, an output is orders in backlog. so it's a combination, mig, of how you drive that forecast going forward.
mircea dobre -- robert w. baird and co. -- analyst
ok. then my follow-up is on mp. maybe a little more color on your aggregates business in there. you talked about conversion from rental slowing.
i heard one of your competitors say something similar recently. what's really going on in that market? and i guess my question is, now that we're fairly late in this current highway bill in the u.s., are you starting to see maybe some saturation of demand here? do we -- are we relined, if you would, on anything legislative happening in order to get a bit of a demand boost as we look at '20 or '21?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, mig. so if we look at our core crushing and screening business, and specific to your question, mig, around north america, as we have commented our dealers, on the positive side, our dealers are seeing very high utilization of their rental fleets, which is good news. i mean the underlying activity remains strong. there's a degree of uncertainty, which has caused them not to convert those rental machines, the customers to convert the rental machines into owner, which then allows the dealers to restock their rental fleet.
so we -- that trend has continued as we've gone through this year. again, the positive is very high utilization. in terms of the macro outlook, and specific to north america, any legislative action would be a positive. we're not counting on that in the underlying demand profile that we're looking at.
so if we were to get any major legislation on infrastructure, that will be a net positive. so as we look out -- and we're not assuming that in the forecast. our customers and dealers are not assuming that, that we're going to get any major legislative breakthrough on infrastructure. i think it's just the underlying need for infrastructure, specifically in north america is there, which, again, is showing up in the high utilization rates of the aggregate crushing and equipment.
what we need to see, mig, is does that then convert, and that's what we're going to be following quite closely over the coming months, does that -- does it -- the retail convert to ownership and then -- which allows us to -- our dealers to increase their rental fleet and purchase more machines from us. so that's what we'll be following quite closely, which we already do, but we'll continue to follow that as we go forward.
mircea dobre -- robert w. baird and co. -- analyst
i see. lastly, are you seeing any price pressure given this delayed conversion, if you would, to ownership? that's it for me.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
no. overall, i think the mp team -- again, it's a collection of businesses. across its businesses, with 75% of the business is going through a distribution channel. they manage the price cost ratio quite well.
and so we haven't necessarily seen anything significant in that. of course, mig, one-off deals here and there with a dealer to a customer always occur. but overall, i would say that the mp team has done a really great job managing price cost across their portfolio of businesses. and aggregate, crushing and screening is no difference.
there's no difference, i should say.
operator
thank you. your last question comes from andy casey with wells fargo securities. your line is open.
andy casey -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thanks. good morning, and good luck, brian, and thanks for the help. last and first, i guess. anyway, the clarification on slide 10.
comment about exclusion of future divestiture impact, among other things from guidance. i know it's kind of been on there. but are you looking at further portfolio actions beyond those already announced?
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
no. i'd say, andy, we're absolutely committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy, which -- looking for exactly the page number, but i believe it's right behind it. and so we're not trying to highlight anything with that. as i mentioned in response to a previous question, our disciplined capital allocation strategy is primarily focused on organic investment and then it starts with maximizing free cash flow.
and then from there, organically investing in the business, having the right capital structure and then returning capital to shareholders efficiently. and as we continue to operationally drive the performance of terex, we will consider changing that capital allocation strategy in the future and thinking about organic -- inorganic activity. but i'd say today, we're more focused on organic. and we -- just to close it out, we've never had a stronger balance sheet in the history of the company, leverage at 1 point -- at net leverage of 1.5 times.
we reduced our net debt by $250 million over the course of the quarter, $950 million down to $700 million. so that -- we like very much where the company is focused and the strength of our balance sheet. and we'll continue to evolve our capital allocation strategy as we move forward.
andy casey -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. i mean, just to go back to that, john. the question was more around, are we looking at a stable portfolio, forget about the acquisition potential?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. yes, andy, so this is john. so the focus element, focus, simplify, execute to win, the focus element of our strategy is -- virtually is complete. the remaining businesses that we have in the portfolio are all businesses that have historically been able to out earn their cost of capital through the cycle.
they have relative leadership market positions in the respective segments that they compete in. and so with the sale of our demag business that we completed in the quarter, that really completed the focus element of our strategy in terms of any further dispositions within the portfolio.
andy casey -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. and then two follow-ups, if i may. i know it's getting late, but there really follow-ups on a couple of mix questions. that when you're looking at the segment forecast for next year, particularly awp, you kind of commented about some forecasts from the second half of last year that turned out a bit optimistic, and you had to correct them this year.
should we expect that you're kind of discounting that segment forecast to be conservative?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
i would say, obviously, we've continue -- one of the things is continuous improvement, in trying to drive continuous improvement in all of our business processes. and so we want to learn from the previous forecast. we have systems to continue to improve the level of forecasting. one of the things i am excited about is we were able to put sales force now globally within that business.
so that'll give us a much better entirety in the sales opportunities as we go forward. so i just -- i'd answer that one, andy, saying that, obviously, our job is to drive continuous improvement in all of our business processes and outcome, and we anticipate to continue to do that.
andy casey -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. and then last one for me. when you look at the coincident backlog declines, awp and mp, and your -- in your discussions with customers outside of maybe folks in the pick and carry. this seems to be from your comments, mainly uncertainty driven.
and if so, what are you hearing from your customers that they may be looking for to reaccelerate investment?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think that's the broader geopolitical question, andy. and when you talk to customers, if you talk to european or u.k.-based customers, clearly, brexit is in the forefront. so driving clarity in brexit. trade policy, trade tensions, clarity in the trade, the global trade situation, especially as an equipment manufacturer and industrial equipment manufacturer will clearly help our customers and their insights.
so anything that helps to resolve some of the uncertainty on the trade side, on the brexit side, those are things that impact customers that are making capital decisions. so anything, any progress that can be made over the course of the coming months in that area being positive for the global equipment business, industrial equipment business that we compete in.
andy casey -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. thank you very much.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the terex corporation third-quarter 2019 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, brian henry, senior vice president of investor relations. sir, you may begin.
brian henry -- senior vice president of investor relations
good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in today's third-quarter 2019 financial results conference call. participating on today's call are john garrison, chairman and chief executive officer; and john sheehan, senior vice president and chief financial officer. following the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. we have released our third-quarter 2019 results, a copy of which is available on terex.com.
today's call is being webcast and is accompanied by a slide presentation, which includes a reconciliation of gaap to non-gaap financial measures that we will use during this call and is also available on our website. all adjusted per-share amounts in the presentation are on a fully diluted basis. we will post a replay of this call on the terex website under events & presentations in the investor relations section. let me direct your attention to slide 2, which is our forward-looking statement and description of non-gaap financial measures.
we encourage you to read this, as well as other items in our disclosures, because the information we will be discussing today does include forward-looking material. with that, please turn to slide 3, and i'll turn it over to john garrison. 
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, and thank you for joining us and for your interest in terex. first, i want to thank our global team for their intense focus on creating a zero-harm safety culture, delivering value for our customers and their commitment to implementing our strategy. looking at the global market environment, it became clear to us toward the end of the third quarter that we are in a softening environment for industrial equipment. demand in the major markets for aerial work platforms has declined, putting pressure on sales.
we lowered production in the third quarter and are reducing production in the fourth quarter to align with global demand, which is impacting margins. a bright spot for awp continues to be growth in china. in the quarter, materials processing continued its strong performance, increasing sales and generating over 15% operating margin again. however, booking and backlog levels are pointing to weaker demand in their global markets.
in this environment, i was very pleased with our free cash flow performance as we generated $104 million in the quarter, a significant improvement compared to last year. our global team continues to focus on generating cash and improving working capital efficiency. as we enter a more challenging macro environment for industrial equipment, we are intensely focused on maintaining a strong liquidity profile. we are well positioned, entering the fourth quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in available liquidity.
one of the commitments we made back in 2016 was to generate returns greater than our cost of capital throughout the cycle. by executing our strategy, focusing the portfolio on great businesses, dramatically improving our balance sheet, reducing corporate overhead and making significant improvements to our operations, we are well positioned to deliver on that commitment and have the ability to execute at a high level through the challenging phases of the equipment cycle. i acknowledge and the team understands that we have more work to do as a company to establish a consistent high level of execution across our businesses. turning to slide 4.
we continue to implement our strategy and enhance the capabilities needed to win in the marketplace. a core element of our execute to win business system is talent development. we recently completed our annual talent review process. this is a global activity that requires every leader in the company to evaluate his or her team, update development plans and address talent gaps.
as i travel to our sites around the world, i'm always encouraged when i meet emerging leaders. we have many high energy, passionate team members that are taking on more responsibility. to harness this talent, we're investing in companywide leadership development and mentoring programs and supporting local training initiatives. from a leadership perspective, we recently announced the three executives who i would describe as builders of terex.
eric cohen, kevin barr and brian henry will be leaving the company at the end of the year. eric led the legal function and providing counsel to the senior leaders of terex for 22 years. eric was instrumental on the company's acquisition and disposition strategy and building and improving the company, including establishing our corporate governance and ethics and compliance strategy. kevin joined terex 19 years ago to build the human resource function.
he was a leader in implementing the cornerstone of our culture, the terex way values. the fact that we have internally developed leaders taking on these executive roles going forward is a testament to the quality of the talent development structure that kevin put in place. finally, many of the folks on the call have worked with brian henry. over his 29-year career with the company, he has been a driving force in the strategic decisions, including the acquisitions and divestitures that shaped the terex of today.
i want to thank eric, kevin and brian for the many contributions they have made to terex over the course of their distinguished careers. i want to thank each of them for their insights and counsel. turning to slide 5. we continue to make progress implementing our strategy.
in august, we completed the sale of demag mobile cranes. team members from across terex worked incredibly hard to close the sale and ensure a smooth transition. in the remaining rough terrain and tower crane businesses, we rebuilt our commercial organization to position the businesses for success. we are committed to these businesses and investing to support our customers into the future.
we continue to simplify terex. we created a transition to a two-segment organization, a significant portion of the general and administrative costs associated with the former cranes segment has been eliminated. the simplified structure also allows us to reduce expenses in our corporate functions. our leadership team continues to scrutinize every expense to ensure our operating model is efficient and appropriate for the current structure and market environment.
we continue to execute the organic growth element of our disciplined capital allocation strategy by investing in innovative products and services and our global manufacturing capability. the new utilities manufacturing site in south dakota remains on schedule and within budget. mp's expansions in india and northern ireland are on track. the new campsie facility, pictured here, celebrated its official opening last month.
the new site manufactures mobile conveyors and ecotec waste management and recycling equipment. these investments enable simplification, improve manufacturing productivity and underpin our long-term growth. we also continue to invest in our execute to win priority areas. our commercial excellence team achieved a significant milestone in the quarter by completing the final deployment of sales force.
all of our businesses worldwide are now on the system. on lifecycle solutions, the leadership team is in place. we are investing in system infrastructure to enable longer-term growth. a high-performing parts and service business is important throughout the cycle as demand for new equipment moderates.
finally, we continue to implement our strategic sourcing program as we are moving significant volume to new suppliers. lower production volume, which is reducing spending levels, is impacting the overall savings. however, we are achieving good savings rates. based upon awp's lower production levels and spend forecast, we expect savings of approximately $25 million this year.
turning to slide 6. based on our year-to-date performance, the slowing global market environment, reduced friction volume and adverse foreign exchange rates, we now expect full-year eps to be between $3 and $3.20, and net sales of approximately $4.4 billion. while we continue to focus on working capital and improving cash flow, we are adjusting our free cash flow guidance for 2019 to approximately $110 million based on our updated earnings outlook. looking ahead to 2020.
while we're not providing financial guidance today, from an operational perspective, we are planning for sales to be potentially 10% lower than 2019 due to the softening macroenvironment for industrial equipment. we are planning conservatively, but are ready to react to the changing market conditions. with that, let me turn it over to john.
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, john. let me begin by reviewing our q3 segment highlights. awp sales totaled $628 million in the quarter, down about 14% versus the prior-year period. weakening demand in north america and emear led to sales declines in both markets in the quarter.
we increased sales in china, driven by market growth and increased product adoption. lower sales and reduced production volumes in the quarter resulted in lower margins for the segment. to align with customer demand and manage inventory levels, we reduced aerial production in the quarter by over 30% compared to last year. this resulted in lower manufacturing absorption and lower-than-expected material cost savings.
margins also continued to be impacted by a weaker euro, which declined 4% versus the u.s. dollar compared to q3 last year, leading to a $5 million operating profit headwind. a weak euro pressures awp margins in europe as a large portion of the products sold in the region is produced in north america and china. finally, the mix of sales were more skewed to telehandlers, which also impacted margins.
softening in the major markets led to lower bookings and backlog in the quarter. a portion of the year-over-year decline is attributable to the timing of annual purchase orders with three major customers. their 2019 orders were booked in q3 of last year. we are still negotiating their 2020 orders.
excluding these three large orders, bookings would be down 19%, and backlog would be flat to the prior year. materials processing continued its strong performance, achieving excellent financial results again in q3. sales were $339 million, up 8% or 12% on an fx-neutral basis on growth across the mp businesses. the mp team delivered a very strong operating margin of 15.6% on an adjusted basis, representing an expansion of 240 basis points.
these results were driven by improved operating performance across the portfolio and effective price cost management. the british pound to u.s. dollar exchange rate provided a modest tailwind to mp. mp is seeing lower backlog and booking levels as the global macro environment for industrial equipment is slowing.
that said, the mp team is diligent in their production planning and will manage the businesses appropriately. the rough terrain and tower cranes businesses that are reported in corporate continued to perform in line with expectations in q3, although these businesses also experienced weakening demand in the quarter. let's turn to slide 8 to review our consolidated results. total revenue of $1 billion was down 7% or approximately 5% on an fx-neutral basis.
the currency, volume and lower production headwinds that impacted awp margins were partially offset by the strong performance in mp and reductions in corporate expenses, leading to an overall adjusted operating margin of 8.8%. investment in our execute to win initiatives and restructuring-related charges were the primary difference between our as-reported and as adjusted operating profit. on an as-adjusted basis, total interest and other expense increased approximately $2 million year over year, resulting from increased borrowings offset by nonoperating fx gains. for the quarter, we generated earnings per share of $0.82 on an as-adjusted basis.
while this quarter's eps was lower than the prior year's quarter on a comparative basis, the result is 21% better than the $0.68 as-adjusted eps we presented in q3 2018, demonstrating the benefits of our strategy execution. turning to slide 9. we are delivering on our commitment to follow a disciplined capital allocation strategy. our global team continued to focus on improving working capital and free cash flow performance.
during the third quarter, we generated $104 million of free cash flow, a significant improvement compared to the third quarter of last year. we have reduced inventory slightly since the end of q2. however, we continue to hold more inventory than last year. to better align with market conditions, we continue to scale back production levels, particularly in awp.
we will continue to reduce inventory as we diligently manage working capital through the cycle. in addition to free cash flow, we are generating cash by executing our portfolio strategy. the sales of demag mobile cranes and our shares of asv generated approximately $150 million in cash proceeds in q3. as of september 30, our net debt-to-adjusted ebitda ratio was a healthy 1.5 times, down from 2 times at june 30.
while we continue to invest in our execute to win priority areas, the level of investment has been reduced as our internal capabilities are maturing. we are investing in our global manufacturing capabilities, with capital expenditures of approximately $120 million in 2019 and planning for approximately $100 million in 2020. turning to our full-year financial guidance on page 10. based on year-to-date performance and outlook for q4, we are updating our full-year 2019 guidance.
we now expect revenue for 2019 to be approximately 3% lower than 2018. the decline is driven by softening demand in our major awp markets. our operating margin outlook is now approximately 8.4%, and our eps guidance range has been updated to $3 to $3.20 per share. we have lowered our expected full-year effective tax rate to 20%.
as a result of our updated earnings outlook, we are adjusting our full-year free cash flow guidance to approximately $110 million. from a segment perspective, we expect awp performance in q4 to continue to be impacted by the market downturn in north america and europe, resulting in an expected full-year sales decline of approximately 7%. we are reducing production dramatically in the fourth quarter compared to last year, which will lead to substantially lower factory absorption. in addition, lower volume, adverse foreign exchange rates and product mix will continue to impact margins as we close out the year, leading to an expected full-year operating margin of between 7.25% and 7.75%.
the euro-dollar exchange rate will have an unfavorable full-year impact on awp margin of approximately $30 million. we expect mp to deliver solid operating performance in the fourth quarter. we are updating full-year guidance. the sales growth of between 3% and 5%, and operating margin of 14% to 14.5%.
mp operates several facilities in the u.k. our guidance range assumes there are no major disruptions associated with brexit. we continue to monitor events as the brexit process unfolds. and with that, i'll turn it back to john.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, john. turning to slide 11. i'll review our segments, starting with awp. the overall global market for the aerial work platforms is clearly softening.
frankly, we expected a longer period of market stability, however, geopolitical and macroeconomic dynamics have led to a market downturn. looking ahead to 2020, we are planning for demand in north america and europe to be lower than 2019 and are working closely with our customers to align with their requirements. looking beyond 2020, we expect growth in the developed markets to be driven by the replacement cycle, which we expect to kick in, in the 2021 time frame. we continue to be encouraged by growth in the developing markets.
customers are seeing the benefits of adopting genie equipment to safely and efficiently work at height. we expect strong long-term growth in the asia-pacific region. turning to utilities. the north american market continues to grow, and the utilities team continues to deliver strong performance.
our key to improving margins in awp is the execution of our strategic sourcing strategy, including transitioning significant volume to new suppliers. through the end of september, the awp team has transitioned over 2,200 parts to new suppliers. we are encouraged by the saving rates we are achieving. however, lower spend levels are impacting the total value of savings in 2019.
looking ahead and through the cycle, improving our supply base will mitigate some of the margin compression on lower volumes and will support margin expansion when markets improve. we continued to invest in growth in emerging markets and product innovation. the genie team recently launched a new electric scissor lift, pictured here, featuring e-drive technology. the new model was designed as a global product to reach high locations in tight spaces, adhering to the new ansi standards, as well as european and other requirements.
it's another great example of genie innovation. i recently attended a utilities equipment show in louisville, kentucky. this is a major event for the utilities industry, and terex had a strong presence. we are growing and gaining share in the utilities market by focusing on what's important to our customers: safety and innovation.
at the show, we introduced a new innovative tl series for the transmission lines segment. this enables us to compete in a new market segment with a cost-effective solution for doing higher level work on transmission lines. the utilities business will benefit from the new manufacturing facility we are building in watertown, south dakota. the new site will increase capacity and significantly improve productivity.
this is an important investment for terex as the utilities equipment market has considerable growth potential in north america and in developing markets. overall, for awp, the investments we are making in our execute to win priorities, new product development and strengthening our global footprint will improve performance throughout the cycle. turning to mp. materials processing is a high-performing segment that delivers strong results.
although sales grew across the mp portfolio in q3, we are seeing signs that the market conditions are softening. utilization of crushing and screening equipment remains high. however, conversion from rental to sales is slowing as uncertainty in both the united states and the european markets is impacting capital spending decisions. the global market for material handlers have softened, and our q3 bookings were down sharply from last year.
we are monitoring scrap steel prices, an important driver for this business and working closely with our customers to align with the demand outlook. our cement mixer truck business in the united states was relatively stable, and our pick and carry crane business continues to execute well, although demand is softening in australia. we continue to invest in new products. the recently launched powerscreen jaw crusher, pictured here, is the latest useful innovation in the crushing and screening business.
the lightweight machine is designed to maximize throughput at an aggressively low cost per ton, setting it apart from the competition. mp has a history of success developing new products and new markets, and our business in india is a great example. our hosur, india, plant celebrated an important milestone in august, achieving 10 years of growth in india. with hosur as the cornerstone, terex has established itself as the clear market leader in mobile crushing and screening in india.
in addition to the tremendous job the team has done, growing the business, i'm also proud of their safety record, achieving over 4.5 years with no lost time injuries. we are making investments to expand our capacity in hosur, and we will capitalize on the dramatic growth potential in india and the surrounding market. in summary, for mp, great performance again in q3. we are seeing signs that the u.s.
and european markets are softening, and we're evaluating production plans for every business. as mp has demonstrated, the team will continue to execute at a high level. turning to slide 13. to wrap up our prepared remarks, our global team continues to work hard to improve execution and meet the needs of our customers.
we have made considerable progress implementing our strategic plan, focusing the portfolio on high-performing businesses and simplifying the organization to make our cost structure more agile. we enhanced our capabilities in execute to win priority areas. we implemented our disciplined capital allocation strategy, returning capital to shareholders and dramatically strengthening our balance sheet. with our current portfolio of businesses and strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to generate cash and significantly out earn our cost of capital throughout the cycle.
finally, we will continue to follow our disciplined capital allocation strategy, while investing in future growth and creating additional value for our shareholders. with that, let me turn it back to brian.
brian henry -- senior vice president of investor relations
thank you, john. as this is my last earnings call, i would also like to thank the members of the analyst and investor community that i have had the pleasure to work with over the past several years. i will continue to be your contact through the end of the year, at which time randy williamson, who i have worked with extensively over the past year, will assume the role of director of investor relations. now let's get the q&a started.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from jerry revich with goldman sachs.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. hi. good morning everyone.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning jerry.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
can you expand more on your outlook for the second quarter, for earnings to hit the level, let's call it, $0.95 at the midpoint of guidance? i think essentially, you'd be within 100 basis points of your aerials margins in second quarter of '19. can you just fact-check that for me and just step through the moving pieces in terms of why the second quarter this year is expected to be disproportionately significant compared to prior years? 
duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, jerry. i'll take that question. and when you look at the dispersion of our eps guidance for the year, it reflects that -- the challenging q1 we'll have with our expectation that awp revenue would be down year over year by 25% in q1.
and that we would have almost 25% lower production on a global basis for awp also in the first quarter, and then the impact of the coronavirus. in the second quarter, it is, as you certainly know, our seasonally adjusted best quarter of the year. and both the -- for both the aerials business as well as our utilities business. and so we are expecting a strong q2.
production will be coming more in line with retail demand in the second quarter after a down q1. and so we are expecting both our aerials and utilities businesses to perform which would drive strong operating performance for terex as a whole.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
and john, maybe expand on that point. so how sure you expecting production to be up sequentially in the second quarter versus the first quarter compared to normal seasonality to get that big margin ramp that you're looking for? just correct me if i'm wrong, but you're embedding about, i don't know, 800, 900 basis points sequential improvement in awp 2q versus 1q? so if you wouldn't mind just building our comfort level around that. that would be helpful. 
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. no problem at all. i don't disagree with the range in which you're estimating the margin improvement in awp from q1 to q2, and that would be on the production would increase. as i said a few moments ago, production down year over year in q1 by 24%, 25%, and production from q2 of '19 to q2 of '20 would be down in the 10-ish percent range which would be in line with where revenue was.
so that would be -- you'd see a sequential improvement by 10%. 10% to 15%, actually.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
so we're done with destock as of q1, essentially? 
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
the biggest portion of it. that is absolutely correct.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. thank you.
randy wilson -- director of investor relations
thank you jerry.

next question comes from ann duignan with jp morgan.
ann duignan -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. good morning. 
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning ann.
ann duignan -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good morning. i'm a little concerned about the backlog and the outlook for materials processing. i mean, as we look in the united states and in europe, i mean, the fundamentals are not that bad, particularly in the u.s. for infrastructure investment is booming.
can you just talk about your outlook for materials processing, leaving out the cranes businesses? and what's going on regionally with that business? what are you seeing out there? is there any -- should we be worried that you're losing market share somewhere? 
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks ann. thanks for the question about mp. we're excited about our mp business. it's been a very strong consistent performer and has done well over the course of the last couple of years.
and we think it will continue to do well. but the global macroeconomic environment is impacting demand, but different dynamics ann, driving for each business. as we look at backlog, we had a historically high backlog going into 2019. and historically, the business did not operate at that level of backlog.
normally, it's a much shorter cycle of book to business type of business. so if you look going into '19, our backlog was almost 50% higher than it had been in the previous three years. so i would say the backlog -- obviously, we'd like to have higher backlog. but i would say the backlog now is along a more normal pattern, historical pattern.
when we went into '19, when it was tight, we did strongly encourage our dealer network around the world to get their orders in for the full-year demand. and with our lead times being shorter this year, there's not that need for the dealers to place that level of demand this early in the year. so that is a key dynamic that is impacting the overall backlog. and if we look at the businesses, as you asked, ann, so if you look at crushing and screening, in north america, the retail utilization rate of the dealers' rental equipment is stable.
they're seeing good utilization, but there's a hesitancy, a caution on the customers to convert the rental to ownership which is delaying the restocking of the network. so overall, the market is still good. utilization is still good. there's just -- customers are being generally cautious on the crushing and screening side.
now material handlers. ann, our fuchs business, team's executed well. but with scrap steel prices coming down pretty significantly, specifically in north america, but really around the world, that has impacted the fuchs business. now they've done a good job expanding their distribution channels, expanding the offering they're coming into.
but scrap steel prices still drive the fuchs. so if i look at the businesses within mp, the fuchs business from a backlog standpoint is actually off the most. offsetting that is our environmental businesses. kieran and the team have done a good job bringing some new products to the marketplace.
so we're continuing to see growth, really globally, across our environmental portfolio like our ecotec brands. when we look at the concrete mixer business, again, for us, that's principally a regional north american business, u.s. north american business. that was relatively stable, and we're looking at it to be relatively stable year over year.
and then the pick and carrybusiness that was in the mp throughout all of last year operates well down in australia. again, relatively stable, up a little bit, down a little bit. so that's how i'd characterize it, is customers are being -- they're being cautious, but the markets are still strong. but dealers, customers are cautious in seeing how the year is going to play out.
and i'm confident that the team will capitalize on the opportunities in the markets as we head into 2020. and i'm not concerned at all about any share erosion associated with the backlog or the revenue outlook.
ann duignan -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. that's helpful color. did you quantify the impact of coronavirus on your q1 eps or can you?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
so let me -- if you don't mind, duffy, before you quantify, just a broader comment on the coronavirus. i want to say, first, our priority is to our team members, and we have been fortunate that none of our team members have been reported with the virus. we do have a world-class manufacturing facility for our awp segment in changzhou. due to the virus, we did delay opening of the plant, like most companies in china.
our plant did open this week on february 11, but the ramp has been slowed because the only key members that are allowed to come back to the plant are the team members that did not travel out of the city during the lunar new year holiday. so it's going to be a slow ramp because they have to self-quarantine for 14 days. so we're working that with our awp team. we're working that with our suppliers.
and as duffy said in the guidance, we have incorporated the impact of the coronavirus. we believe in our q1 and q2 performance and our guidance does assume that we will make up the q1 and q2 shortcoming as we move through q3 and q4. duff, do you want to add anything there? 
duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
no. i would say that from a revenue perspective, since the situation is still evolving, we -- for purposes of guidance anyway, at the moment, there is a, say, $25 million to $30 million revenue impact built into the guidance for q1, a negative $25 million to $30 million revenue impact and a $5 million to $10 million op impact that's been built into that.
ann duignan -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. that's very helpful. thank you. i appreciate that.
i'll get back in line.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you ann.

next question comes from jamie cook with credit suisse.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. good morning.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning jamie.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
just another question on aerials. i understand the...
can you hear me?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. we can jamie.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
sorry, just another question on the aerial business for the first quarter, understanding we're down 25%. i'm assuming we're losing money again in the first quarter, if there's any way you could sort of handicap how much we lose in the first quarter? and then we're underproducing again in the first quarter. is that just the coronavirus? because the sales assumption doesn't seem too materially different from what we said before. and then just my last question.
did i miss what you guys said on supply chain benefits in the -- in what's implied in the guidance and the cadence of that for the year? thank you.
duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so let me start.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeeah, if you would.
duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
is that when you look at our aerial work platforms segment, the aerial work platforms business did have positive operating margin in q4 2019 and we'll have positive operating margin in q1 2020. so the segment isn't losing money. the revenue is certainly ahead the market environment resulting in 25% lower revenue is certainly a headwind. and our bringing inventory levels down, and therefore, producing significantly below retail demand has been challenging the profitability of the business.
and once we get ourselves past both of those impacts, we do expect the margins to improve. do you want to go to supply chain? 
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. so jamie, and i think your last question was around supply chain and specific to strategic sourcing. is that your question, jamie? 
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
yeah, that was my question. the supply chain assumption in the 2020 guidance.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so thank you. so in our 2020 guidance, we're anticipating a full-year impact of about $50 million. as i said in my opening comments, we're experiencing good savings rates on what we're doing, but the lower production volumes is taking longer to consume the raw and whip inventory in the pipeline.
so we've built that in. i will say the teams are really doing a good job. we literally changed thousands of parts over the course of '19, and we were able to do that with limited to no disruption to our manufacturing facility. so the teams who've internalized these processes, developing the ssi capability is critical to us, and we're going to continue to drive improvements in strategic sourcing.
and i think you see that clearly show up as we go through the year, and the incremental or decremental margins we'll enjoy. and i will say that the largest percentage of savings that we're seeing in strategic sourcing is associated with our awp segment.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. thanks. i appreciate the color.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you jamie.

next question comes from david raso with evercore isi.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi. good morning.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning david.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
my question is on the cash flow guidance. when you adjust for the lower capex year over year but also absorb the extra $25 million for the retirement obligation, it implies the free cash flow you think is going to grow $60 million, $70 million, and that's despite ebit being down $95 million, g&a is going to be down about $6 million, $7 million. just trying to get comfortable with why do we expect such a strong working capital performance throughout the year, especially if it's very concentrated in the first part of the year and then production ramps back up? just trying to gain comfort with that. 
duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so david, i'll take that. and in the down revenue environment, the headwind market environment that we anticipate for 2020 and that will result in a shrinking of the balance sheet, so that we do expect that accounts receivable will be a source of cash as we bring our inventory levels down and don't restock them that the level of accounts payable will also result in a source of cash. so it's really about the dynamics associated with the reductions in the inventories, the collection of the receivables that result in working capital being a source of cash.
so i can assure you that our team is absolutely focused on the working capital generation and free cash flow generation, and that i acknowledge that our free cash flow generation has got to improve. and john and i have been all over our teams on that subject and you will see us achieve the $140 million free cash flow performance in 2020.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
i appreciate that. i mean, i'm just -- last year, we spoke to being very committed to the free cash flow and it's still proved elusive. and i'm just trying to understand, has anything changed with how people are being compensated? anything -- john, how you're thinking about being willing to give up sales to make sure that the cash flow is there? i'm just trying to understand why should we believe the guidance this year when last year, in a big under production year, where you would have thought it would generate some decent working capital inflows, it didn't materialized.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
right. thanks david. so yes, for the management team, net working capital is part of our incentive compensation plan, it was significantly below target in 2019. obviously, we want to drive to that target in 2020.
so from a compensation standpoint, i can assure you that the management team is focused on driving the net working capital. and one of the things, david, is we're being very disciplined on production. and even in the fourth quarter, the revenue was down a little bit more than we had forecasted. and so we're still trying to ensure that we're producing below retail demand to bring our inventories in line, and we're going to be very disciplined.
i think it's important in these types of businesses in these markets to be very disciplined on your production because it doesn't help anybody to overproduce and build inventory and put yourself in a position where you may have to do some things on pricing that you don't want to do. so we're going to attack inventory, we're going to attack our production schedules and we're going to adjust our production schedules based on the revenue level to drive that net working capital, as duffy said, into free cash flow for the year. and as you mentioned, we're continuing to spend -- we have sizable investments, great organic growth. our capex remains elevated.
we think that's in the best long-term interest of our shareholders. so it has intense focus. it is part of our incentive compensation plan, highly disappointed in our performance this year, and it was reflective in the mib payments of our leadership team. and we've got to turn that around in 2020.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
well lastly, related to that. let's say, if you did do the free cash flow of $140 million, the dividend is probably only, call it, $35 million. the excess $105 million roughly, how should we expect the use of that if you do hit those free cash flow targets? 
duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so we'll follow our disciplined capital allocation strategy, david, and that will include returning capital to shareholders. during this market headwind portion of the economic cycle, we have been preserving liquidity through the downturn. we ended 2019 with $1.1 billion of liquidity on the balance sheet between our cash on the balance sheet and available revolving credit facility borrowings.
we think that's a good place to be, net debt-to-ebitda 1.6 times. so we will continue to consider what the right level of liquidity is, and to make sure that we are following the disciplined capital allocation strategy including the efficient return of capital to shareholders.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
so just making it clear here. i mean, it's the start of the year. so probably the easier time to ask. but any commitment from management on where that would be utilized? again, if everything played out as you thought, that excess $105 million, are you comfortable with the leverage? i mean, obviously, ebitda will be down a bit this year, so the leverage naturally goes up if you maintain at the debt level.
but would you look at this as a share repo opportunity or are you more sensitive to keeping the leverage down as the ebitda drops? 
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
david, we had a through-cycle ebitda target, net debt-to-ebitda target of two and a half. we like the position we're going into the year. we have an outstanding share repurchase authorization outstanding that the board has approved, and we will be opportunistic in the market against that outstanding share repurchase authorization. but we will manage our liquidity to ensure that we don't create any liquidity issues for ourselves.
but we like the position we're in now david, going into a softer year.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
i appreciate the time. thank you. 
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks david.
operator
next question comes from mig dobre with baird.
mig dobre -- baird -- analyst
good morning everyone.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning. 
mig dobre -- baird -- analyst
good morning. i want to dig in a little more on awp, just to understand the moving pieces there. so can you talk a little bit about the utility business in 2019? so on that $2.7 billion of revenue, how much of that was associated with the utility business? and can you maybe give us a little clarity as to how you're thinking about that portion of the business as far as the 2020 guidance for the segment is concerned? 
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, mig. yes, utilities is part of our awp segment. it's a really solid business.
and what's different about the utilities business is it doesn't experience the same seasonality and cyclicality of our aerials business. so it's a little bit more constant as we go through the course of the year. as we've said, it was about $400 million. so you can plan between $400 million and $450 million of revenue, reasonably split equally across the quarter.
q1 is a little lower. q2 picks up, but relatively consistent across the year. and as we've said, generating 9% to 10% level operating margins. q3 is going to be a bit challenging for the team this year.
we're -- we've anticipated that in our guide as we move from our manufacturing facilities into our state-of-the-art facility. that will occur in q3. so as we move -- as we get into the new facility, we expect two things to occur. one, increase capacity to take advantage of a growing market.
the electrical grid market is a good space to be. there's a lot of infrastructure investment required for that. and we think that's going to give us increased capacity. because right now, we are capacity constrained and have lead times that are extended in our utilities business.
and then, we also believe it's going to improve and drive efficiency for us as we go forward. but if you think about $400 million to $450 million, reasonably spread across the year, 9% to 10% operating margin. that's a good way to think about that business in 2020.
mig dobre -- baird -- analyst
so it's fair to say that this business is -- you expect it to be up some in 2020? 
duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
slightly, yes.
mig dobre -- baird -- analyst
slight. ok. so then if i look at the low end of your guidance, i mean, that implies your awp business to be below $2 billion in revenue. can you frame this number for us, historically? because there's been so much noise in the segment with stuff kind of going in and coming out, where would that revenue be versus, say, 2016 coming out of the industrial recession? and how should we think about that level of revenue versus all the modeling that you've done historically as far as replacement demand is concerned? are we back to replacement demand levels? really help us out with a framework here. 
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
right. so let me -- i don't have '16 in front of me, so we'll have to get back to you on that, mig. sorry, about that. we'll have that for the next time.
but let me frame the replacement cycle commentary. as we go into 2020, is, again, i think customers are being highly disciplined in their capex plans. i was at ara this week and talked to multiple customers across the customer spectrum. they're being disciplined.
they do say as we move in the back half of 2020 and into 2021, the replacement cycle in the aerials business should begin to kick in. they're already talking about it as they look at their longer range of capital plans. and that's a result of the products that were purchased seven to eight years ago because, in general, the equipment maintains its first life in the rental channel for seven to eight years. so the replacement cycle was a topic of conversation with customers just even this week, and we do think as we move into the 2021 time period that the replacement cycle in the aerial business will kick in going forward and help to build demand as we move from 2020 into 2021.
obviously, it's only february of 2020, but long -- looking longer term or intermediate term, we clearly would expect the replacement cycle to kick in, in north america and also in europe. europe is on a very similar cycle to north america.
duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, mig. as john said a moment ago, we don't have 2016 with us here in the room. so apologies for that. i would say that the aerials or genie portion of our business in the guidance we've provided today, with the information john gave you, is still above revenue of $2 billion and is in the same area that it was in 2017.
so i would say it's up versus 2016 because obviously '16 was lower. 
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
right.
mig dobre -- baird -- analyst
all right. that's helpful. thank you.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
absolutely.
operator
next question comes from stephen volkmann with jefferies.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey stephen.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning guys. i just had a quick follow-up on this utilities thing as well. so once we consolidate these plants into the new one, do we still think about this as a 9% to 10% ebit business john? 
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
we're challenging the team to do better than that, stephen. and if i look at production efficiency, the number that we've kind of put out there is around 20% improvement in production efficiency associated with the move to the new facility. now we'll take time to ramp. it's not going to occur on day 1, but i would be disappointed if we didn't see an improvement of around 20% in our production efficiency within the plant.
duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, i think it would be fair to say the business case certainly did anticipate growth in the top line for the business as the utilities business continues to take market share. and then, secondly, that the manufacturing efficiency drives stronger gross margin.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
that's correct.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. and then i think in the past, you've said that there might be some other things you could do in that facility as well. so is there any sort of positive benefit anywhere else in the company? 
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
no. this facility is a special purpose facility for our utilities product lines for both our installs and what we manufacture on the boom side. so we're not currently anticipating using that facility for any other product lines. what we are doing is we have 19 service centers in our utilities business.
and those 19 service centers are working very closely with our aerial customers, and we've seen a very nice growth in parts and service revenue associated with the service centers, focusing more on the aerial customers. and so having the utilities business underneath awp as a segment has helped to drive some of that synergy, and we did see growth in that -- in '19 and would anticipate that to continue in '20 and beyond. that was more of the synergy, not necessarily manufacturing synergy in the watertown plant.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. got it. ok, thanks. and then finally, does capex go back to kind of maintenance after this is done or is there more to do? 
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
stephen, we're not going to -- i don't think it goes all the way back to $40 million of maintenance capex as we continue to look at the opportunities for organic growth in our business, the opportunities to invest in some of our systems and processes. so we think it's going to come down from $100 million, but i don't want to put out there that it's going to go all the way down to maintenance capital levels in 2021.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. thank you guys. appreciate it.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you stephen.
operator
next question comes from steven fisher with ubs.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
thanks. good morning. just wondering within the mp segment, what degree of revenue decline do you assume for the rough terrains and towers for 2020? i'm not sure if that was included in the answer to ann's question. and then how are the decrementals you assumed in the crane component of materials processing versus the legacy materials processing component? 
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so i would say really no difference with the rts and the towers in terms of the top level revenue guide. so somewhere in that 10% down range is what we're assuming for that business. and from a margin standpoint, pretty consistent with actually a little lower, actually call that 9% to 10%.
we did have a good guide in 2019, but 9% to 10% operating margins associated with the crane business and down at the same revenue proportion as the overall segment. i think that's a reasonable assessment.
duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. that's correct.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. then just over on the awp side, thinking about the order patterns for the year. i think you mentioned that some of the annual purchase orders didn't get finalized in q1.
really, just kind of thinking about how the order pattern is now set up for both the rest of the first half and into the second half? i'm curious how does conexpo fit into the ordering plans for the year? is it too early for the customers to kind of be definitive about the second half at this point? so maybe if you can just kind of walk us through the order pattern you expect here for the rest of the year? 
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. so thank you. and specific to awp and the backlog dynamics, really, what impacted this year was timing of negotiations with the national accounts. and the other dynamic was the percentage of their full-year capex that they were willing to put on advanced purchase orders.
so as i've said, the national accounts being very disciplined with their plans. our lead times, industry lead times were much shorter. so our national account negotiations flowed into january and into early february. those negotiations now are principally complete.
and you can argue that it's a bit more of a more normal pattern. and if you go back to '16, '17, then it was as we ended '18 going into '19. so that's where we stand now. in terms of conexpo, from an aerials perspective, conexpo was not as big a selling show as perhaps cranes and some other mp businesses.
as i said, i was just at ara this week, you do sell a little bit at ara. i think it will be too early in the year, given that it's the second week of march that conexpo would have a significant impact on awp customers. we would expect mp to see some pickup with some of the dealers and customers. so that's how i'd look at conexpo.
i would put it in a shameless plug for everyone to come visit us at conexpo. we've got some incredibly new exciting innovative products across our portfolio of product lines that demonstrate the technology that we're investing, the telematics that we're investing in and positioning the business for longer-term growth. so i hope that answers your question in terms of the flow. but conexpo is not going to be a big, big selling show for our awp segment. 
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
i guess, just wondering if we should be anticipating any particularly big q1 swing in orders year over year or is it more starting to neutralize? 
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'd say it's -- given the demand is -- i'd use the word more neutralized. obviously, where we're going to record some that flowed into the first quarter, but it's still going to be difficult comps year over year until we get to the back half of the year.
duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
that's right.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. and welcome to the terex corporation q4 2019 earnings call. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to mr. randy wilson, director of investor relations.
please go ahead.
randy wilson -- director of investor relations
good morning everyone. and thank you for participating in today's fourth-quarter 2019 financial results conference call. participating on today's call are john garrison, chairman and chief executive officer; and john duffy sheehan, senior vice president and chief financial officer. following the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.
we have released our fourth-quarter 2019 results, a copy which is available on terex.com. today's call is being webcast and is accompanied by a slide presentation which includes a reconciliation of gaap to non-gaap financial measures that we will use during this call, and it's also available on our website. all adjusted per share amounts in the presentation are on a fully diluted basis. we will post a replay of this call on the terex investor relations website, under events and presentations.
let me direct your attention to slide 2 which is our forward-looking statement and description of non-gaap financial measures. we encourage you to read this as well as other items in our disclosures because the information we will be discussing today does include forward-looking material. with that, please turn to slide 3 and i will turn it over to john garrison. 
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning. and thank you for joining us and for your interest in terex. for terex, operating within a zero harm environmental, health and safety culture is an absolute way of life. i am proud of our team's dedication, commitment and focus on a zero-harm safety culture.
the global team made great progress during the year, reducing our recordable injuries by 39%, a significant accomplishment. but we realize we can and will continue to make further progress in our zero harm culture. the fourth quarter completed a year where we faced considerable market-driven and operational headwinds, principally within our awp segment. our q4 results reflect the headwinds of the challenging global industrial equipment market.
and our operating results were generally in line with our expectations on lower revenue. awp's fourth-quarter revenue was down 21% from q4 2018. this demonstrates the cautious customer sentiment and our largest markets in north america and europe. awp's revenue decline, coupled with the need to produce below retail demand to reduce inventories, adversely impacted operating margins.
our mp team continued to execute well, maintaining 12% operating margins despite q4 revenues being down 10% in the quarter. driving parts and service growth is one key element of our execute to win initiative. despite the challenging global equipment markets, our parts and services teams drove 7% sales growth on a currency-neutral basis. over time, continued growth from this initiative will help reduce our cyclicality.
given the environment in which we are operating, we have maintained our absolute focus on our disciplined capital allocation strategy. we generated positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter, and generated $86 million of positive free cash flow during 2019. combined with the $106 million of cash proceeds from dispositions, terex ended 2019 with a strong balance sheet including over $1.1 billion of liquidity. our global team continues to be committed to generating cash and improving our working capital efficiency.
turning to slide 4. terex remains committed to its goal of establishing a corporate culture based on process discipline and accountability that will consistently deliver high performance in all phases of the business cycle. turning to slide 5. now let me share some 2019 highlights that continue to move terex forward.
we essentially completed the focus element of our strategy by finalizing two significant portfolio actions in our former cranes segment. the remaining businesses in our portfolio have industry-leading competitive positions. they have also demonstrated their ability to consistently outearn their cost of capital over the course of multiple cycles. at the start of this year, we moved the tower and rough terrain crane businesses to the material processing segment.
these moves complete the transformation of terex into a two segment organization. we have brought online new manufacturing capabilities including our campsie facility in northern ireland and expanded our hosur, india mp facility, allowing terex to be even more responsive to global demand. our new utilities facility will consolidate multiple production buildings into one state-of-the-art, world-class manufacturing engineering facility. commercial excellence begins and ends with the customer.
we completed our global rollout of sales force, increasing process discipline throughout the entire sales process. technology is a critical part of our global parts and services business. to deliver industry-leading customer service, we are providing our distribution partners easy-to-use digital tools that help them to service their customers more efficiently, maximizing their opportunity to win business. this is allowing terex to build a competitive advantage and accelerate parts growth.
strategic sourcing finished 2019 with strong momentum, as the team continues to implement waves 1 and 2 and launching a new round of strategic projects. with our high-quality portfolio of specialized equipment businesses, our strong financial position and the investments in our facilities and systems, we are well positioned to perform throughout the cycles. looking ahead to 2020. we recognize that we must drive improvement in our operational excellence so that we can consistently deliver on our commitments to our team members, customers and shareholders.
at terex, we are driving toward a zero harm safety culture. we are doing this with open communication, reporting and putting our team members first. terex is also committed to a responsible environmental stewardship through energy and water conservation efforts in our facilities, and by developing innovative products that reduce emissions. turning to innovation.
we are continuing to invest in innovative products to serve our specialized markets. a few examples are: the terex ecotec shredder, expands our offering in recycling markets; also the terex advance mixer truck, reflects improved performance, value and entry into new markets. in addition to expanding our product offerings, we are investing in our manufacturing capabilities which leads to future growth. the new utilities manufacturing facility in south dakota remains on schedule and within budget.
another important facility for terex's future global growth is our changzhou, china facility which will undergo an expansion in 2020 to accommodate the market growth in china for aerial products. in addition, mp and utility product lines will be added. we are localizing manufacturing to take advantage of increasing adoption of these products. our parts and services team is focused on growth by delivering a best-in-class experience for our customers.
these investments enable improved manufacturing productivity, industry-leading customer offerings and growth. as we communicated during our q3 earnings call, we expect the global industrial markets to remain challenging in 2020. we expect sales to be down 8% to 11% from 2019 to a midpoint of $3.9 billion. the lower anticipated sales will result in lower production levels which will have an adverse effect on operating margins.
based upon this current outlook for 2020, and we are anticipating full-year earnings of $1.85 to $2.35 per share. we will continue to enhance shareholder value by executing our disciplined capital allocation strategy which includes dividend increases in each of the last four years. with that, let me turn it over to duffy.
duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks john. turning to page 8. let me begin by reviewing our q4 segment highlights. awp sales of $500 million contracted by 21% compared to last year driven by continued challenging markets in north america and europe.
during the fourth quarter, we saw a 55% increase in china sales, where the aerial market continues to grow through increased product adoption. overall, lower sales and significantly reduced production levels challenged awp's operating margins in the quarter. as we discussed last quarter, to align customer demand and to manage inventory we have been significantly reducing production. during q4, we reduced production levels 45% compared to q4 2018.
this resulted in lower manufacturing absorption and lower material cost savings.  awp fourth-quarter bookings of $755 million were 22% lower than q4 2018, but the book-to-bill ratio did improve sequentially. backlog at year-end was $753 million, down 31% from the prior year. however, awp's year-end 2019 backlog is not fully comparable to the prior year, as not all 2020 advanced purchase orders from our national account customers were completed by december 31, 2019. additionally, national account customers placed a smaller percentage of their planned 2020 capex on advanced purchase orders.
when adjusted for these year-over-year customer ordering patterns, our backlog supports our awp revenue guidance. materials processing closed out the year with another solid quarter, achieving 12% operating margin despite challenging markets. sales were $321 million, down 10% from the fourth-quarter 2018 driven by cautious customer sentiment, delaying capital purchases of crushing and screening products, material handlers and environmental equipment. operating margins decreased off the levels we experienced during the first three quarters of the year, but were still double digits as the mp team has been aggressively managing all elements of cost in a challenging market environment.
backlog of $295 million was 42% lower than last year. however, mp's year-end 2018 backlog was an anomaly. in the fourth quarter of 2018, dealers ordered a much higher percentage of their 2019 full-year equipment requirements due to extended lead time. as we enter 2020, dealer ordering patterns have returned to historically normalized levels as lead times are shorter.
within corporate and other, we saw lower rough terrain and tower crane sales. operating margins for tower cranes were modestly impacted by the lower sales, but rough terrain's operating margins performed in line with expectation. turning to slide 9 to review our q4 consolidated results. total sales decreased by approximately 16%.
mp's operating margin and lower corporate expenses partially offset the volume and lower production headwinds that impacted awp margin, leading to an overall contraction of operating margin. restructuring-related charges and, to a lesser extent, investment in our execute to win priority areas where the primary differences between our as reported and as adjusted operating profit. our full-year 2019 tax rate came in lower than we had previously anticipated, as a result of a more favorable jurisdictional mix of sales and pre-tax income, combined with favorable adjustments between our tax provisions and tax returns. these adjustments resulted in our recording a tax benefit in q4 of $8.8 million to adjust our full-year 2019 tax rate to approximately 16%.
on an adjusted basis, we generated quarterly earnings per share of $0.36. turning to slide 10 to review our full-year consolidated results. overall, of 2019 was a challenging year for terex. net sales for the year contracted 3.6% to approximately $4.4 billion.
this revenue decline was attributable to awp, whose sales declined almost 8% for the year. awp's revenue declines were greatest in north america and western europe as concerns over the global market for industrial equipment caused rental customers to reduce their capital equipment purchases. partially offsetting awp's revenue decline, mp's revenue increased almost 4%, in line with our expectations from the beginning of the year to nearly $1.4 billion. awp's lower sales and significantly reduced production levels challenged total company operating margins for the year.
mp had a strong 2019, with a full-year adjusted operating margin over 14%, up 130 basis points from 2018. turning to slide 11. our 2020 guidance is based on our two segment operating model, awp and mp. the rough terrain and tower crane businesses are reflected in mp.
to assist your modeling of our business, we have recast our segment results for the full-years 2018 and 2019 including 2019 by quarter. these analyses are included in the appendices to our q4 earnings presentation and posted to our investor relations website. today's guidance includes all currently anticipated expenses as we simplify our financial reporting to the investment community and have completed investments in our transformation program. in 2020, we currently expect our operating margins to decrease by approximately 150 basis points to between 6.3% and 7.3% on approximately 8% to 11% lower sales.
reduced operating leverage on the lower sales volumes, both in our awp and mp segments, are partially offset by ongoing operational improvement. with respect to the coronavirus, while we are not currently anticipating any material impact on our full-year results, we do expect to have lower sales and earnings from our awp china facility in the first half of the year which will be made up in the second half. we expect 2020 earnings between $1.85 and $2.35 per share. this eps guidance assumes a full-year 2020 expected tax rate of 19%, but excludes any benefit associated with our existing share repurchase authorization.
this guidance also assumes extension of our existing 301 tariff exclusion for machines and components that are reported into the u.s. from china. from a quarterly perspective, we expect a normal historical sales pattern. however, on a year-over-year basis, revenue in the first half of the year will be down approximately 15% and flat in the second half of the year.
we expect our eps to be generated roughly 5% in q1, 45% in q2 and 25% each in q3 and q4. the abnormally low level of profitability in q1 is driven by awp revenues being down 25% year over year combined with unabsorbed overhead on production below retail demand; and finally, the impact of the coronavirus on our china operation. for the full year, we are estimating free cash flow of approximately $140 million reflecting a strong year of positive cash generation. we expect to improve first quarter year-over-year cash flow performance.
however, we do expect q1 cash flow to be negative, consistent with historical pattern. we also estimate capital expenditures will be approximately $100 million. this level of capex reflects continued investment in initiatives designed to drive long-term earnings growth and shareholder return. turning to our segment guidance.
we expect precaution being exhibited by our genie rental customers during 2019 to continue into 2020, resulting in awp sales being down 7% to 10% and operating margin of 6% to 7%. we expect materials processing revenues including our towers and rough terrain cranes businesses, to be down 8% to 11% which will result in mp's operating margins being approximately 12% to 13%. while we continue to monitor developments associated with the u.k.'s exit from the european union, we do not anticipate any material impact to terex in 2020 associated with the brexit process. we are guiding for our corporate expenses to be approximately $80 million during 2020, up $10 million from 2019.
the increase is due to planning for 2020 incentive compensation at target payout and lower gains on sales of financing receivables. overall, we have been managing our corporate cost structure aggressively, and we'll continue to do so in 2020. turning to slide 12 to review our disciplined capital allocation strategy. since we introduced our disciplined capital allocation strategy at our analyst day in 2016, we have made tremendous progress in strengthening our balance sheet, reducing our cost of capital and reducing our debt by over $500 million.
as a result, our 2019 year-end net leverage which is net debt divided by adjusted ebitda, was less than 1.6 times nearly a full turn better than our targeted 2.5 times through the cycle. additionally, we reduced our pension obligation by more than $300 million over this period. during the last three years, we have made substantial investments in terex. in fact, we have invested almost $0.25 billion into our businesses over the last three years which is significantly higher than our annual maintenance capex of $45 million.
these investments demonstrate our commitment to long-term growth. we are excited by the portfolio of businesses we have, each of which outearns their cost of capital. we have deployed the proceeds from the sales of businesses to return capital to shareholders. first, we have approximately 34% fewer shares now than were outstanding at our 2016 analyst day.
second, we have increased our quarterly dividend by 71% to $0.12 per share. as i have said consistently, the terex team has and will continue to generate shareholder value through the execution of our disciplined capital allocation strategy. with that, i'll turn it back to you john.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you duffy. i'll review our segments, starting with awp. the north american and european markets for aerial work platforms are challenging. however, the north american utilities market remains strong.
our north american rental customers continue to be cautious in their capital expenditure decisions. they are prudently managing their fleet utilization. as we move into the latter half of the year and into 2021, we expect the replacement cycle in north america and europe to increase. finally, the ongoing adoption of aerial work platforms in china is fueling growth.
to improve margins, the awp team is fully committed to executing their strategic sourcing plan including transitioning significant volume to new suppliers. we are seeing savings rates consistent with our expectations. however, the lower production levels have impacted the total value of savings realized to date. in the aerials market, the genie brand is synonymous with technological leadership and innovation.
in 2020, we will continue to add more fuel efficient, hybrid products and fill out the extra capacity line which will be on display at conexpo. the xc line is important for genie as the new ansi standards governing load levels are currently due to take effect in march. the utilities team will transition to their new manufacturing and engineering facility during the summer. this new facility will improve efficiency and increase capacity which together with new products and services, will enable terex utilities to continue to grow.
for example, the terex utilities tl-80, pictured on the slide, is a new product serving the transmission line distribution market. the electric grid requires significant continued investment to support the electrification and innovation that is occurring around the world. we invite you to visit us at our conexpo at our terex booths to see our exciting new product and service offerings. turning to mp on slide 14.
materials processing is a high-performing segment that consistently delivers strong results and meets its commitment. mp is well positioned heading into 2020 with their new product offerings. the mp team continues to innovate. the evoquip colt screen, pictured here, will launch in q1 2020.
it delivers higher capacity, telematics and value to our customers. the mp team continues to expand its penetration into emerging markets for environmental and mobile crushing and screening equipment. mp's innovation was recognized in q4 2019, with three separate industry awards. omni by terex is a new, first-of-its-kind innovation that improves efficiency and reduces the risk of injury on crushing and screening sites.
omni and all of mp's industry-leading innovation will be on display at conexpo. i expect our mp team to continue to execute at a high level and deliver on its plans again this year. to wrap up our prepared remarks, in a challenging global environment, our global terex team continues to focus on meeting commitments to our customers and shareholders. despite the near-term market conditions, we will continue to invest in innovative products and services to win and grow in the marketplace.
we will continue to invest in the initiatives that improve our operating and commercial capabilities. we will also continue to follow our disciplined capital allocation strategy and create additional value for our shareholders. and finally, we are confident in achieving our 2020 objectives. with that, let me turn it back to randy.
randy wilson -- director of investor relations
thanks, john. as a reminder during the question and answer session we ask you to limit your questions to one in a follow up to ensure we have time to get to everyone. with that, i'd like to open up for questions. operator? 
",2019-Q4,TEX

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] your first question comes from stephen volkmann of jefferies. your line is open.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, steve. hopefully, you're healthy?
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
yes. thank you for asking, and same to everybody there. so maybe, john, we could just start by talking about the trends you're seeing in awp. thank you for the information around the cancellations.
but i guess i'm trying to -- i was a little bit surprised that the net orders were actually -- looked better than i expected. so what did you see in april? and just maybe broadly, are you expecting much of any production in the second quarter there off of that backlog or is that mostly for kind of later in the year?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, steve. so as you recall, we came into 2020, and we were planning on our awp markets to be down in that 7% to 9% area. and in january and february, we were actually performing at that expectation and slightly better. and then when covid hit, it created as the world now knows a significant amount of uncertainty.
and we saw that the -- and so our teams worked with our customers to basically scrub the order book globally. to ensure that the orders that were in there, we had cancellations. we did have some push-outs as well. and when we look at it, it really -- i think it's illustrative to think about the markets the way the pandemic spread around the world.
and we saw in china very, very -- almost 0 utilization of our equipment in the month of february, began to increase that in march. and then in april, we saw utilization rates begin to get back up into that 60-plus percent range. we also saw commensurate with that order and order activity increase in china. so as we said in our opening comments, china was down for most of the first quarter, but we did begin to see our production increase and the market increase.
if you then go to where the pandemic went, for us, we've got our awp site in uberti, italy, north central italy. when the pandemic hit here in europe, we saw the same phenomenon in that, utilization fell dramatically, and it moved kind of from southern europe up to the north. and what we saw was utilization rates come down pretty dramatically and the market basically went into a shutdown, not to the same extent that we saw in china. china was rally an absolute lockdown.
and then from europe, then we saw the pandemic move here into the united states and that -- some of us were together in conexpo in the middle of march. and what we saw there is it was this -- the market was actually pretty solid. but in the -- from the middle of march, early to middle of march, then utilization started to fall pretty significantly and then customers began to either cancel or delay, push out their orders. so our teams worked with the customers to understand what's in the order book.
and to be honest with you, if they couldn't give us a ship to date or location, we moved it out and/or canceled it. and as we've seen april, and i think you've heard several of the publicly traded companies that i can also confirm in my conversations with our customers in the awp space, both the national accounts and the major independents, they saw utilization plummet really from the third week of march into the middle of april and have stabilized now in the middle of april at that level. and it really -- in the united states, it really is dependent on where they're located. so an independent in an area that's not dramatically impacted is actually having a pretty good business right now.
if you're an independent in the northeast or the northwest, the market conditions are very, very difficult for them. so i think as we think about it, it's really how the pandemic has flowed around the world, and that's impacted customer demand, customer order behavior and what we're doing, and we'll talk about it as we go forward is we're matching our growth production around the world to that demand and trying to be as flexible as possible, realizing that all of us are trying to figure out what's the near-term and intermediate future look like in a very -- in an unprecedented time. so that's how i would say it unfolded as from kind of march into where we are now. and our approach is we're going to be in constant contact, constant communication with our customers to understand their needs and to meet our needs.
and as duffy said in our comments, and i'm going to reiterate this, we are really not going to overproduce. we are not going to produce inventory. we're going to keep production to match the retail demand or actually below retail demand because we think in this unprecedented time, that's the best approach that we can think of as a company. and so that's the dynamic that we're seeing, steve, a long answer, but it's been an unprecedented time.
so, as a global company, we see that impacts as this pandemic has moved around the world globally. and we're learning from it and applying lessons learned up from one region to the next as we move forward.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
great. ok. that's actually helpful. thank you.
and then as a quick follow-up, you mentioned cost actions, sg&a declining, although you didn't say how much. i guess i'm just trying to think about how we should broadly think about the incremental margins. i assume they get worse because production goes down more, but whatever bookends around that would be great.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. and i'm going to let duffy take that call and this is unique and unprecedented times. duffy and i are not only not in the same room, we're actually not in the same state. as you know, our region of the country has been a really significant hot bed for the coronavirus so we thought it was prudent for us to separate.
so, duffy, would you go ahead and take that question on decremental margins?
john duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
sure. thanks very much, steve. and so when you look certainly at our q1 financial results, the impact on q1 from the covid-19 pandemic with a very fast fall off in revenues and as well as the stopping of production, especially during the month of march, that did have an impact on the decremental margin for the first quarter. we continue to target with all of our businesses, the 25% incremental or decremental margins.
and we do believe that we can operate to that level. cost savings that we laid out in our prepared remarks and are described in the earnings presentation take effect really from q2 onwards. as we developed them, we started to implement them during the month of march. so those are impacts, which actually begin immediately in q2 or have begun immediately in q2 and will continue throughout the year as we adjust our demand, our production to the customer demand environment.
and so we do continue to target the 25% decremental margin. the cost reductions we're taking will support our getting to that or to working to achieve those targets.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thanks, duffy and john. i'll pass it on.
john duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks. thanks, steve.
operator
your next question comes from mig dobre of baird. your line is open.
mig dobre -- baird -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everyone, and i also want to kind of stick with this discussion on cost savings. is there a way maybe to help us understand how you're thinking about these savings at segment level? and maybe related to this, when i'm looking at your unallocated corporate expense line item, this one has remained pretty robust. and i mean, i dare say, based on what i recall our discussion to be last quarter that the expenses here in q1 have been running a little bit ahead of where you are guiding the full year on a full run rate basis.
so how do we think about corporate expenses? and then maybe some color the $100 million breakdown at segment level?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, mig. i'm going to ask duffy to respond to that question.
john duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
sure. so when you look at the $100 million of cost reduction of -- as i said a few moments ago, the $100 million really is q2 through the remainder of 2020. and $100 million began immediately at the beginning of q2. the $100 million is spread across our business -- both of our segments as both of our segments are taking similar cost reduction actions.
and so while we haven't specifically provided information with respect to the allocation of the $100 million across the businesses, i think it would be fair to think about those cost savings in proportion to the contribution of the businesses to overall tariffs. on the cost savings side -- sorry, on the corporate side, when you look at our corporate, unallocated corporate costs in the first quarter of 2020 of $26 million, that compares to corporate costs in the first quarter of 2019 of $15 million. and really there's two factors that are leading to the increase year over year. first is, in the first quarter of 2019, we did record a $6 million positive healthcare expense credit as a result of lower healthcare expenses than had been anticipated, and we did not have a similar repeat of that credit in 2020.
so that is a year-over-year impact. and then no. 2, we did record, as i discussed in my prepared remarks, we did record a reserve in q1 of 2020 for a specific financing receivable. net charge was as a result of the covid-19 and the impacts of covid-19 on this customer as -- this financing receivable from a customer there and the question of recoverability.
so those two impacts, which really account for the full difference year over year is what's driving the increase in corporate and other in q1 of 2020.
mig dobre -- baird -- analyst
and how are you thinking for the year? i mean you used to think $80 million for this line item. is that still the number that you're using or is it something different?
john duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
well, look, mig, as you know, we're not providing guidance for 2020. but i guess what i would like to try to bring across with -- what i was trying to bring across with my comments is that there were specific factors, covid-19 or otherwise associated with the credit last year that caused differential. we're continuing to focus on controlling our overhead costs and delivering our -- all of our services to the segments from the corporate in the most efficient manner. and we have not increased the cost structure of our corporate team.
so maybe that's another way of answering your question is we haven't added and any cost to the corporate segment.
mig dobre -- baird -- analyst
i see. last question from me is on working capital. it would continue to be a source of liquidity. i'm wondering if we can get more color on that.
and in your slides, you talked about working capital as a percentage of sales, running at 22%. is there a view as to where you might be exiting the year? thank you.
john duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
i'll also take that one. and you know that -- so just a couple of points there, right, is our free cash flow in the first quarter of this year improved by $145 million. in my prepared remarks, i talked about the fact that when you look at our continuing operations, they -- the reduction in the comp -- operating income and higher capital expenditures that we saw was more than offset by lower net working capital in those businesses and led to a $40 million increase in the cash flow from operations for us -- from continuing operations. we will be continuing -- as john talked a few minutes ago, that we're only producing to customer demand.
and so we will be bringing down our inventories over the course of the year. and as i said, net working capital will be a source of cash. for the same reason, we talked about a few moments ago related to corporate, and i can't say specifically what the going forward, working capital as a percent of sales is going to be in future quarters. but what i can tell you is that net working capital will be a source of cash.
this company has more than -- has ample liquidity to operate throughout 2020 and 2021, even with this uncertainty associated with the covid-19 pandemic.
mig dobre -- baird -- analyst
all right. thanks for the color. good luck, guys.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, mig. stay healthy.

your next call comes from ann duignan of jp morgan. your line is open.
ann duignan -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. good morning, everybody.
john duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, ann.
ann duignan -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good morning. a couple of questions, more clarifications, i think. could you give us more details on the $5 million charge on the customer receivables? what happened there? how can you give us confidence that that's one-off and that we don't start to see more of these? what region was it in? what segment are you -- that there aren't going to be more of these going forward?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. i'm going to have duffy cover that as well.
john duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so, ann, and it's a follow-on to the point that mig was asking a moment ago. so the particular customer situation is one associated with our terex financial services business. and actually, it's a customer that we had -- have extended on book financing too, to support the customers' purchases of the equipment.
it's a customer which was financially challenged even before the covid-19 prices. and as a result of august '19, we believe that the prudent thing to do was to take the reserve that we did in the first quarter. what i can also assure you of is that in conjunction with our q1 financial close, so we did do a full review of all of our on book terex financial services receivables as well as for that financing receivables as well as all of our open account receivables. there were just no other charges which we took or that we, at the current time, anticipate that we will be taking.
ann duignan -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. thank you. appreciate the color on that.
and then just more strategically, i think you said that dealers canceled orders in materials processing. so i'm curious whether there are any financial ramifications for dealers canceling orders. i know some of your competitors, maybe not competitors but peers do not allow dealers to cancel orders and particularly for large ticket items like equipment and material processing. so can you talk a little bit more about what happened there and what's going on there? and are there any financial ramifications, any costs associated for dealers to cancel orders like that?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
ann, so overall, if you look at the backlog in mp, there's a couple of dynamics. last q1, we still had the dealers placing really their full year demand, especially on our core aggregate crushing and screening business. and this year, that was not the case, obviously, given the level of uncertainty on the core crushing and screening business. in our material handling business, that business we did see some lower ordering, and some slight cancellations as well as the market changed.
and then on our concrete business in the united states, our truck business, we saw some mortar cancellations. but i'll also comment on our concrete business. that occurred in march, ann. and then two weeks later, in april, the specific customer came back with some -- another the -- with an order to replenish some of the orders that they had canceled.
in terms of penalties, there's not significant penalties, ann, for us. we work with the dealers. and basically, in this environment and what we did -- one of the lessons learned from prior crisis is that you really want to scrub the order book. and when a dealer says, hey, i'd like to delay that, then you'd really -- red flag's got to go up.
so we basically said to dealers, if you can't give us where you want us to ship to and a delivery date, we're going to go ahead and cancel that order and you reenter the order when you actually can have this much clarity of where that demand is going to. i would also say, ann, in our mp business, so about 75% of the business goes through distribution dealer channels. but it's not what i would call traditional yellow iron distribution. these are specialized dealers and distributors.
and in many, many cases, their inventory is really a rental fleet. and they're putting it out on rental for rpo-type activities and that then converts to a sale. so their inventory levels are in good shape. we don't believe there's excess inventory in that channel.
we have seen the dealer utilization come down. but again, new equipment, new technology that we've invested in that we think over time is going to help is our telematics in that distribution channel, especially around our core crushing and screening. and what's interesting is we've actually seen the number of machines on work be relatively constant, especially in the month of april in north america, in europe. but the hours have come down around 15% to 20%.
and so we're going to continue to work with the dealer organization, watch it. but again, it's not a -- our dealers are highly specialized in their market segments. it's not a traditional, what i call yellow iron distribution channel. and so that's how we've managed it.
it was a lesson learned from the prior crisis to really understand that order book in detail and a bit [inaudible] a good job at it [inaudible].
ann duignan -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. just can you quantify the amount of cancellations in npe?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
we didn't quantify that, ann. i don't have that right here, but it did lead to some of the backlog reduction that we saw.
ann duignan -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yes, that's what i was hoping to understand is how much of the backlog reduction was cancellations. ok. well, i can follow-up offline. i appreciate.
then i'll get back in queue.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes.
john duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, ann.

your next question comes from jerry revich of goldman sachs. your line is open.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. hi. good morning, everyone. and i'm glad to hear you're all doing well.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
glad to hear from you, jerry. it seems like the last time we were together was a real, real long time ago, and it was about only seven, eight -- eight weeks ago. so glad you're doing well as well.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
a long seven weeks. i'm wondering if we could continue the discussion that you just started on telematics [inaudible] operating hours for the mp business and joined taking that conversation over to aerial platforms and giving us an idea of how trends evolved over the course of april by region, specifically. and so we've -- one of your customers nice pickup in utilization over the course of april. i'm wondering if your data shows that as well, and any color by region you'd be willing to share would be helpful.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. and again, we've invested heavily in telematics across our genie business. and in general, again, kind of going back to my earlier comments, china, the market stopped for the month. there was virtually no utilization in the month of february.
utilization rates in march kind of climbed from 0 in february to around 40% based on our best estimates. and then jerry, by april, utilization had climbed into the 60% mark. in north europe, and i'll go there from pandemic, a similar story. utilization, there was still some activity because the rules weren't as clear.
in china, they locked it down. in other parts of the world, we are essential services, and our customers have been able to operate. so utilization fell dramatically, stayed down and began to increase in that middle of april time frame. we began to see utilization increase.
and kind of stabilize and stop falling about our second week of april, and it stabilized at a lower level. and then in north america, very similar story overall. and i think the rental companies have been pretty clear that they saw a pretty significant decline from the second -- third week of march really down to about the second week of april, stabilizing around that second week of april and trending slightly up, but still no big dramatic moves. and again, the other comment i would say is it really does depend on what specific states you're in, does impact the level of utilization based on local government regulations and rules as it also pertains to construction sites, maintenance, maintenance sites and the like.
so i would say the telematics data that we have is very consistent with what rental companies now have been saying publicly. and i can say in conversations with independents, very similar. but again, the independents, it really depends on what markets they're in as to their level of business based on the opening of the markets.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
i really appreciate the color. and then in terms of the new products that you focus rolled out over the past couple of years and the telematic features have been able to focus to realize pricing over the past couple of years. i'm wondering in this environment, are you getting any pushback on pricing, given the change in the demand environment? and what do you think of the pricing discipline that you're seeing among your competitors?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks. it's a great question. and we're really focused on the value-based pricing that we've been working on here for the last couple of years and really being disciplined with our commercial excellence tools to remain disciplined in pricing and provide value to our customers, either feature benefit set. if you think about our ge bloom line, our xc line, that's done really well.
our z or hybrid fe line. and then we also have introduced the new j series, which is anti-compliant to a 660-pound range. so we are being disciplined on pricing. we've been transparent with customers as it pertain to the anti-standard increases and what those costs were.
and we're going to be -- we have been, and we will remain disciplined around pricing. in the awp segment, you're hearing that the pricing discipline with rental companies has improved over time. they're being very disciplined about pricing, and we're going to be very disciplined about pricing. and the biggest thing that we can do to be disciplined about our pricing is not overproducing and building a lot of excess inventory and feel compelled the need to take action.
so right now, jerry, i'd say i think the market is being disciplined. i think we all recognize that this is a situation we're going to the price lever is not the appropriate lever in this dynamic. so we provide tremendous value over the life cycle of this equipment for our customers, and that is in -- that's awp and mp. and over the life cycle of the equipment, we provide tremendous value.
so discounting the upfront purchase price is not something we're looking to do so to stimulate demand. so we're going to remain disciplined in the team and the tools that we've put in place over the last couple of years, give us that visibility that we are in control of the pricing and can see very clearly the pricing waterfall. so it's going to -- it's always a challenging market, of course, when volume declines but we're going to focus on the value that we're creating over the life cycle of those products and remain disciplined on the pricing in this environment.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. appreciate the discussion, john. stay well and best of luck. thanks.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
likewise, jerry. stay healthy.
operator
your next question comes from david raso of evercore isi. your line is open.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you very much. so my question focuses on thinking about how do we get awp back to profitability. could you help us think about where do you see the revenue breakeven point, especially in light of your peers there's about $60 million to $65 million of savings that should be earmarked toward awp, the rest of the year? and i have a related question to that thinking through your revenue answer.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
so i'm going to let duffy take the first part, and i'll follow-up on the second part of that question, david.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you.
john duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so david, when you think about awp and the results that they had for the first quarter, like revenue was approximately $500 million and a small loss in the quarter. and i think there's a couple of factors that went into that q1 result by awp. first of all, it's important to recognize that the production volumes that genie was planning for going into the quarter were going to be down 25% year over year and lower production in the manufacturing facility does drive inefficiency in their cost structure.
then as a result of the covid-19, genie reduced their production volumes even further. when you look by the end of the quarter, genie's production volume year over year for the first quarter was down 47% as they were producing below retail demand. so that creates -- we've definitely created a fair bit of inefficiency in their manufacturing, unabsorbed in the overhead that was reflected in the financial results, the operating losses that genie reflected in the first quarter. on top of that, genie did record about a $4.5 million charge associated with the government receivable that they reserved associated with reduced expectation or duty drawback recoveries, that also contributed to the first-quarter results.
and so if i think about those factors, while i can't give you specifically what the breakeven point it would be, i would say that it's definitely less than $500 million.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
so then when we think about the usual pattern, 2q revenues would be higher than 1q. all else equal, you would normally return to profitability for awp in 2q. so, needless to say, it's not as per usual. so i assume it's fair to say that revenues take a step down 1q to 2q and maybe let me know if you think that the savings are enough to offset that, that even 2q might be breakeven.
but my -- i'm really trying to think about normally your backlog at the end of 1q, there's a certain percentage that ships 2q and a certain percentage that ships 3q at the bulk of when your customers take machines. i'm curious how much those percentages have changed given your commentary and what we know in the channel about your customers pushing 2q into 3q. so i guess that's a two-part question, and i'll leave it there. the 2qs comment about breakeven and how much of the revenues you believe got shifted from 2q to 3q versus normal for your backlog? thank you.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thank you, david. i'll take that first part. clearly, q2 is going to be a very challenging quarter.
as we've discussed, with the economy basically globally being shut down. so there is no normal revenue flow in these unprecedented times. so i would just say that q2 is going to be a very challenging quarter for us and many companies, given the dynamics that covid-19 has created. duffy, did you want to comment at all about the breakeven comment?
john duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
well, i think that to the point that you just made, when revenue is going to be challenged in q2, and that is going to certainly be a dynamic for the second quarter, which is why it's -- going to be why we are implementing the cost savings, the $100 million across the total company with those actions. so we're going to be -- we are taking actions to reduce our overall cost structure in line with the customer demand environment that we're experiencing. i can't sit here on this call and say what q2 results are going to be. but what i can say is that revenue is going to be a real challenge in q2, and we're taking action to match our cost structure to the revenue environment and which we will be operating.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
and i'm sorry to interject, but my question was -- we know 2q is going to be a loss. i'm just trying to figure out. we have an abnormal awp revenue decline sequentially. how much can we think about 3q being abnormal that the revenue might go up from 2q to 3q in awp? now we could get cancellations, no doubt.
but i'm just trying to think about the backlog, what percent usually ships in 2q and what percent 3q, and now is it a lot heavier, 2q -- not 2q, it's now 3q. and we can debate cancellations and how the rental companies might come back to in a month and change their mind. but again, as we sit here today, how abnormal is the backlog shipping dates versus normal? how much now 3q versus what it normally would be?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
david, as a result of the covid crisis, everything has been pushed out. the uncertainty is created, so there's been a push out. so there is no normal cycle right now in awp in terms of the orders. what -- there has been orders pushed out and what customers are looking for is what happens to their utilization rates, and they've been very straight with us, and we've been very straight with them.
they're going to give us as much of an indication as they can in terms of what their needs are, and we're going to adjust our production to match those needs. and that's why part of what -- in my opening comments, especially around awp, we're taking a unique step to actually produce partial. we're opening up plants partially. and we've posted this on our website, so everybody can see, that's an unusual step to take.
but we're going to build to the retail demand. so we may bring in a plant, start-up a plant and only run it at 25% or 50% for the lines that we have, customer demand and keep the other team members out on the unemployment benefits. one of the benefits of where we are in washington state is quite flexible. and so we can bring our team members in and out of the plant as needed to match the retail demand.
but david, i think it's fair to say, and i think we all understand this. there is no normal right now in the middle of this crisis. so we're going to do things that, under normal circumstances, you wouldn't run a plant partially like that because it would be inefficient. but under these circumstances, i'll work the team to be more efficient.
but under these circumstances, we're willing to take the inefficiency to just meet the needs of the customer and their actual demand and not build a lot of excess inventory. so that's the approach that we've taken, having gone through these crisis now, david, for many crisis over -- i told the team is probably my fifth one. each crisis is somewhat unique and different. so -- but one thing for sure is you got to get on top of it quick, and you've got to adjust to that situation.
and this situation is we don't -- do not have a lot of forward visibility. and so we're going to be as flexible as possible to adjust to the actual customer demand. and just summing it up, david, you're right. there is no normal and customers have pushed what was the second quarter into the third quarter, third quarter into the fourth.
and then again, they're looking for stabilization as they see stabilization, as they see the economy increase, as they see their utilizations pick up, they're going to need equipment. we're going to be there to match that need. but we do not have -- david, the simple truth is, and we don't have the visibility that we normally have, and that's because our customers don't have the visibility that they normally have.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's completely fair, yes. i mean, it's all about the 3q. it's really a pushed-out backlog. the backlog number is actually not that low, but the question is, how much is it still going to be there for 3q to maybe even try to get yourself moving back toward profitability.
lastly, sorry, real quick. the backlog at the end of april versus the end of march. any color at all would be helpful just to get some sense of the vitality of that backlog thinking about 3q, 4q would be great, and that's it for me. thank you for the time.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, david. i will say this. we track the orders bookings backlog every day. and what we can say is that cancellations basically have stopped, push-outs had stopped, the backlog has stabilized as we've moved through the month of april is what i can say.
john duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, david.

and your final question for today comes from jamie cook of credit suisse. your line is open.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. good morning. i hope everyone is well.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, jamie.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
i guess my first question, can you just provide an update on the strategic sourcing initiatives, understanding we want to reduce the number of suppliers that we use that could be challenging in covid when people are having component shortages. so what you're seeing there and what the risk is there? so that's my first question. and then second question, any color just sort of on the crane business, how that performed and just sort of trends you're seeing there. thanks.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, jamie. in terms of the strategic sourcing initiative, we remain committed to it. and i will tell you the work that we have done leading up to this crisis has really helped us because in the product lines or the commodities that we've put through the process, we're dealing with upwards of 80% fewer suppliers, which dramatically improves the level of communication and partnership, if you will, with the supply base. so to think our team has done a really great job ensuring that we have the materials that we need at the quantities we need.
and then maintaining continuity of supply, it has been a challenge, as it has been for supply chains all over the world. but i think the team has done a great job. in terms of, obviously, the savings that we have anticipated, they're going to be lower based on the volume, the actual rates that we're seeing, and we still are seeing the rates that we had anticipated going into the year. and i'm sorry, jamie, what was your second question?
john duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
cranes, john -- just cranes.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
yes, just cranes.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
ok. yes. thank you, jamie. so cranes is obviously now reporting inside our mp business.
on the tower side, it did meet with some -- with construction headwinds, but they are -- have been deemed essential. and so they have been able to operate on and off through the crisis. we did take some decent orders for the tower business in -- at conexpo. so i was pleased with that.
on the rt side, principally european business, and it has slowed as well as the european markets have slowed, and the middle east markets have slowed. but i would say, jamie, just basically in line with our other businesses, rt is off a little bit more, tower's held in a bit better but still under pressure.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst

i'm joined by john garrison, chairman and chief executive officer; and john duffy sheehan, senior vice president and chief financial officer. their prepared remarks will be followed by q&a. please turn to slide 2 of the presentation, which reflects our complete safe harbor statement. there are a few items that i'd like to cover.
first, today's conference call, including our remarks and answers to your questions, contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks that cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied. in addition, we'll be discussing non-gaap information that we believe is useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. reconciliations for these non-gaap measures can be found in the conference call materials. please turn to slide 3, and i'll turn it to john garrison. 
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, randy. good morning and thank you for joining us and for your interest in terex. first, our thoughts go out to all who have been affected by covid-19 as well as the dedicated health workers, first responders, and volunteers who are on the front lines all over the world battling this pandemic. the terex way values, along with our commitment to safety, gives us strength to face this pandemic together.
i am proud of and want to thank all of our team members for their dedication, commitment and focus on our zero harm safety culture. i am pleased with their attention and focus on adhering to the covid-19 protocols. we have operations in china, italy, washington state and our connecticut corporate office near new york city, all hot zones for the coronavirus. that said, most of our terex global parts in the service and logistics teams have remained open to service the needs of our customers.
it is a testimony to our zero harm culture that we have only had seven confirmed cases. although we suspect we may have more. by practicing and rigorously following the covid-19 protocols, we are helping to keep team members and families, customers and communities safe. at terex, we have confidence in our sales and in our purpose that as a team, we have quickly taken action to address the current situation, and we will rapidly respond to market conditions.
we are focused on controlling what we can control. we're in constant communication with our customers, safely meeting their needs, producing to the actual customer demand, and providing essential equipment parts and services. we are proactively maintaining our financial flexibility. we're a highly experienced management team, and we will successfully navigate this crisis.
and our terex team members are resilient and are facing this pandemic by demonstrating the terex way values. please turn to slide 4. business and ship, which is one of our values, helps us navigate this crisis and improve the lives of people around the world. in redmond, our awp teams brainstormed on how to help the community after their region endured our first major covid-19 outbreak in the united states.
the genie team produced and donated 4,500 protective face shields for local medical professionals. in watertown, tariffs utilities received a request for the local vocational college to use our 3d printer to help make parts needed for face shields. thanks to the efforts of our utilities team and approximately 1,000 shields were distributed to healthcare providers in south dakota and minnesota. our china and in northern ireland teams donated over 5,000 masks to our covid-19 community group that is supporting local hospitals and care workers with ppe supplies.
in india, terex team members have voluntarily contributed a full-day salary to purchase almost 20,000 pounds of food for a community kitchen in delhi. i want to thank all of our team members who are assisting others and exhibiting our value of citizenship. turning to slide 5, safety is and will remain the top priority of the company. we have response plans in place, following guidelines from governmental authorities that are intended to slow the virus spread.
team members who can work remotely are doing so. given the lessons learned from changzhou, the company is implementing protocols to further safeguard team members who perform jobs that must be done at our facilities or customer sites. we've launched daily and weekly communications to stay in close contact with the status of each of our sites. we will continue to educate our team members and share best practices across the company.
safety and the well-being of our team members is our first priority, followed by the company's financial health. turning to slide 6, as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, awp and mp saw a significant number of customer cancellations and requested delivery delays in the second half of march. in response to this unprecedented situation, we took swift action. we have now implemented a comprehensive cost reduction program that includes salary reductions, prolonging of team members and reductions in force, temporarily suspending manufacturing operations to align with customer demand and partnering with suppliers to limit the incoming supply of materials, receiving only what is needed to support current production schedules.
while the environment continues to be somewhat uncertain, we are implementing cost savings in excess of $100 million. the terex team is committed to taking the proper steps to protect the financial well-being of the company. please turn to slide 7. in addition to cost savings, we are focused on having ample liquidity to run the business.
as of march 31st, we had $945 million in available liquidity. we are participating in tax and other government relief programs. we're also utilizing worker assistance programs in the united states u.k., germany, australia and other countries to help keep our talented workforce in place while easing the financial burning to terex. we've begun a global effort to reduce indirect expenses.
in short, we're asking all our team members to look for opportunities to reduce the company's cost. we have taken 35% out of our capex budget for 2020. however, we are investing in the future on a more targeted basis. we are still funding the completion of our watertown, south dakota manufacturing facility, and the expansion of our changzhou, china facility.
changzhou is an important manufacturing facility for us. the china market is growing, and it is essential to have the capacity for future demand. working with our banks, we successfully extended and amended our revolving credit facility. additionally, we suspended our dividend and share repurchases for the remainder of 2020.
as a result of these actions, i am confident we will have more than sufficient liquidity through the downturn and that we will be able to grow when we get to the other side of this pandemic. with that, i want to turn it over to duffy.
john duffy sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, john. turning to slide 8. let me begin by reviewing our recently completed credit amendment. we are pleased with the support demonstrated by our bank group regarding the amendment and extension of our revolving credit facility.
the amendment addresses the short-term concern with our financial covenants and provides the flexibility needed to manage the company during these challenging times. the company amendment provides us an extra layer of comfort during this period of uncertainty. it is important that terex' stakeholders have confidence that terex has the operational and financial strength to manage successfully through the current environment. let me walk you through some of the highlights.
the one-year extension of the existing revolver from january 2022 to january 2023 is part of our broader amendment and liquidity enhancement objectives. lending ahead, we did not want to be in a position in early 2021 where the revolver was considered a current liability instead of long-term debt. during 2020, as a result of the amendment, we are only subject to a minimum liquidity covenant, then during 2021, we are subject to a maximum secured leverage covenant that is only applicable at 30% or more of revolver utilization. this credit agreement does revert to the existing financial covenants on january 1, 2022.
it is important that terex's stakeholders, including customers suppliers, team members and both credit and equity investors have confidence that terex has the operational and financial strength to manage successfully through this period of uncertainty. that is exactly what this amendment provides us. turning to slide 9 to review our q1 consolidated results. i will call your attention to our financial reporting structure.
as you will notice, we did not report adjusted q1 2020 financial results. instead, we called specific financial impacts from covid-19. we have also sought to provide information that will help the investment community more easily compare our year-over-year results going forward. looking at our first-quarter financial results.
revenue of $834 million was down 27% year over year. we were operationally planning for first-quarter revenue to be lower than the prior year. and during the months of january and february, our sales were tracking in line or slightly above our expectation but the market go up dramatically in march. also, as discussed during our q4 earnings call in february, we were planning to make strategic investments in 2020, which we started in january and february.
however, we have since taken substantial steps to cut back on our investment and to reduce our overall cost structure, and those reductions in sg&a will show up from april onwards. company growth profit was impacted by $8 million due to several covid-19 related impacts. first, reserves were established against u.s. government tariff recoveries as a result of the anticipated lower product exports qualifying for duty drawback recoveries.
second, we were required to record charges associated with the cost for the temporary closure of manufacturing facilities. also, sg&a was adversely impacted by $5 million, primarily due to a reserve on a customer financing receivable and other items resulting from covid-19. for the quarter, we recorded an operating loss of $7 million compared to adjusted operating income of $106 million in the first quarter last year. the operating loss resulted from $300 million of revenues versus q1 2019 as well as the covid-19-related charges in the quarter.
other income was impacted by $2 million related to the marking to market of a publicly traded holding. it is really important to note, despite the challenging month of march, a q1 free cash flow use of approximately $110 million improved on a year-over-year basis from a free cash flow use of approximately $255 million in q1 2019. the year-over-year improvement in free cash flow of approximately $145 million resulted from 3 factors. first, free cash flow from continuing operations increased approximately $40 million as lower earnings but higher capital expenditures were more than offset by lower net working capital.
second, cash payments for interest, taxes and other operating costs, decreased approximately $35 million. and third, as a result of the sale of our mobile cranes businesses, we did not repeat the cash used in these businesses in q1 2019 of approximately $70 million. during q1 2020, our continuing operations free cash flow benefited from our producing below retail demand. as a result of the covid-19 impact on commercial demand in march, we have aggressively reduced manufacturing production further, especially within our awp segment, which further benefited our q1 free cash flow.
we expect net working capital will be a source of liquidity for the remainder of 2020. turning to slide 10, and starting with awp. awp sales of $512 million contracted by 30% compared to last year, driven by continued challenging global markets. end markets in the u.s.
and europe sharply contracted in march and despite starting the year in line with expectations. we aggressively responded to customer cancellations and delays by reducing or stopping our production to ensure we were not building excess inventory. our changzhou, china facility was shut down for operating at a reduced level for most of the quarter. however, when starting in march, the china business has gradually ramped up production.
utilities market softened in the quarter, but not at the same rate that we experienced in our areas of business. awp first-quarter bookings of $498 million were 29% lower than q1 2019. the bookings in the quarter are net of approximately $175 million of orders, which were canceled by customers. backlog at quarter end was $717 million, down 34% from the prior year.
during the quarter, we experienced a shifting of customer orders from q2 to the second half of 2020. the reduction in machine utilization by our customers provides an opportunity for increasing our parts and services offering as customers are using this downtime of machines to perform maintenance to be ready when the construction markets normalize. now turning to materials processing. mp started the year with another solid quarter, achieving 8% operating margin despite challenging markets.
it is a testament to the strength of this segment as the team delivered relatively strong positive operating margins on lower revenues. sales were $316 million, down 23% from the first quarter 2019, driven by extremely cautious customer sentiment resulting in delaying capital purchases of crushing and screening products, material handlers, and the environmental equipment. the mp team has been aggressively managing all elements of costs in a challenging market environment. backlog of $272 million was 52% lower than last year, including order cancellations from the dealer network.
however, customers in both segments continue to operate through this covid-19 crisis, and existing equipment is being utilized. both our awp and mp businesses are industry-leading in their respective segments with very strong brands. we will be well positioned as we come out of this current downturn to grow in our respective markets. and with that, i'll turn it back to you, john.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, duffy. turning to slide 11. in both awp and mp, our teams are aggressively managing their production operations by accelerating their siop cycle. we are bringing in partial staff for certain product lines where we have demand.
partial operations adversely impact our decremental margins. and under normal times, this would not be an efficient way to operate our facilities. the benefit is we can produce to actual customer demand thereby minimizing our cash burn. a benefit of our strategic sourcing initiative is we have reduced the number of our suppliers.
as a result, we have closer relationships and have been able to work collectively to reduce the amount of material coming into the plants. our teams are doing a good job of managing material flow while also ensuring we have continuity of supply. we are responding to short-term customer demand, but we're also focused on the longer-term market dynamics, whether it's our new facility in watertown, expanding our china facility, digital innovation in parts and services, our new product development. these are important investments to position terex for the growth as business conditions improve.
turning to slide 12, free cash flow execution is our principal financial objective in 2020. as duffy discussed in detail, we took decisive action with our banks to ensure we have ample liquidity to manage the business. we also reduced capex by 35%, but we continue to fund the investments important for future growth. as business conditions improve, we will reinstitute returns of capital to shareholders.
and turning to slide 13, to wrap up, our terex team continues to live our zero harm culture in a challenging global environment. we are intensely focused on meeting commitments to our customers and supporting them during these difficult times. our businesses have a strong future, so we will continue to invest in innovative products and services, to be as prepared as market demand returns. our management team is highly experienced and cycle-tested, and we will navigate through this crisis by aggressively managing cost and liquidity.
and with that, let me turn it back to randy.

certainly. [operator instructions] our first question is from stephen volkmann with jefferies. your line is open.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive
good morning, steve.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
so, lots of moving pieces here. so maybe not surprisingly i'll start with awp. maybe first, can you just remind us how much you actually under-produced retail in total for 2020?
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive
thanks, steve. in general, say, right around 80% we produced to the end market demand, if you will. and obviously you see that in the significant reduction in inventory that we had throughout the course of the year.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
right. yeah. that was strong inventory reduction. but i'm just thinking ahead now to 2021 where you won't be doing that, i guess. so, in light of that, i guess i'm struggling to think about what the end market growth that you're thinking about is because it feels like you can kind of hit your revenue target just by producing back to retailers even if things were kind of flat.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive
we are -- as you see, we are anticipating growth in that 12%, 12.5% range, steve. we did see the global end markets improve as we went through the quarter. and in north america, we saw the utilization improve. it's an important time of the year. so our negotiations with our customers in terms of their needs for 2020. so we saw some strengthening of orders there. i would also say, we are encouraged by the mix. we saw the independents come back into the market. so, in north america, we think the market is going to rebound off some very low levels, as you see. but again, as now customers are being cautious, they're managing their utilization, they're managing their fleets. and we are anticipating growth. we'll see how it plays out. but right now, we're optimistic we're going to experience some growth as we move into 2021 as the fleet customers manage their inventory -- i'm sorry, their capital.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
so, steve, let me just jump in for a second, if i could though. because i think it's also important is that our genie team is selling product directly to the rental customers. there is no, if you will, dealer network in between. so production doesn't really equate to sales. when we produce product, it goes into inventory. and so, the revenue is really going to be driven by the rental channel demand, and to produce it, when we produce in line with retail demand. that will help our cost of goods sold because we'll be more efficient from a manufacturing perspective, but it doesn't increase revenue.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. all right. i understand that. and duffy, well, i have you, the flipside of this is your incremental margin forecast for awp is actually quite robust. and so, i guess, i'm wondering if you can just give us some buckets of sort of what really drives that margin higher, significantly above your incremental targets for 2021. and then i'll pass it on. thanks.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
sure. so, first and foremost is what i was just referring to, which is that during the course of 2021, we do anticipate that we will manufacture in line with the customer demand or the sales whereas in 2020, as john indicated, we were manufacturing at about 80% of revenue for genie. so, as a result, the fixed costs of the business was being spread over a much smaller base of manufacturing than they're going to be over the course of 2021. so, manufacturing efficiency first. second, john has been doing an excellent job of making the manufacturing operations -- and the genie team, not just john, but john and the genie team have been doing an excellent job of taking manufacturing cost out of the genie manufacturing. so, that cost, whether it be in the indirect side or the direct side is going to make us more efficient.
our sg&a cost reduction initiative, which was companywide, is also supporting the growth in the awp margins or the genie margins for 2021. and then, obviously, the higher volumes that they're anticipating for 2021, all of those are driving the margin improvements that you see for our awp segment, principally the genie business.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you, guys. well done, john.

your next question is from mig dobre with baird. your line is open.
mig dobre -- baird -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
good morning, mig.
mig dobre -- baird -- analyst
good morning. my first question is really on your ability to ramp production going forward, things are getting better, right. so, i'm wondering how you're managing the supply chain if you're seeing any disruptions there. and as far as your comments on field, i appreciated that color. but i guess what i'm wondering is, if you seeing incoming orders, right, in your order book, sales relative to your plan and to the guidance that you have provided, how flexible is your pricing going forward? will your pricing be able to adjust to reflect these higher material costs above and beyond maybe what you bought forward at this point.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive
i'll take -- let me start with the first one, mig, on the supplier continuity and then we'll also cover just in general the pricing strategy that we are executing for 2021. so, on the supplier continuity side, you're correct that the opportunity this year and challenge last year was a problem. we didn't have demand. this year, it's an opportunity and the challenge to meet the demand as it increases. a lot of the hard work that our strategic sourcing teams and purchasing teams have done over the last couple of years has helped. we have improved our overall supply base.
with that said, like many manufacturers, we are seeing delays in inbound material. principally, mig, that's global logistics starting in shipping, shipping starting to free up right now. but containers remain an issue. and depending on which ports you're going into can then delay the offloading of the materials. so, the team is managing that disruption day to day.
from a covid standpoint, mig, in the fourth quarter we did see disruption with certain suppliers that had covid-related impacts. that's improved as we move through the quarter. but again, covid is still out there. so the team is doing a great job managing that. and again, as a result of strategic sourcing initiatives, one other thing that we did was our global logistics suppliers. and so, we believe we have the best in the world to help us manage through this period of time. it is creating disruption but the team is doing a really good job managing that disruption day-to-day. and that will be the key as we move through the year.
my personal view is, as we move through the year, it will improve. all of us are highly motivated suppliers and everyone to produce and get out of what we experienced in 2020. but the team is managing day-to-day disruptions. and that will be important for us to continue to do so as we go forward. so that's the supply side of the equation.
on the pricing side, our pricing strategy this year in the environment is really priced to offset material cost inflation that we're seeing. so, i'd say, price cost neutrality. so we're trying to get pricing from our customers to reflect the material cost environment that we're realizing that we have to control a great deal of it. but overall, that's what we're striving for in 2021 is price cost neutrality so that we can at least offset some of the material cost increases that we're seeing around the globe.
mig dobre -- baird -- analyst
okay. i see. and then, my follow-up is on materials processing. looking at the orders you booked in the quarter, quite impressive. i've not quite seen orders like this before i don't think. can you give us a sense for some of the moving parts here. i know you've got quite a few verticals within this segment nowadays. i'm also wondering if there's anything happening with the channel in terms of potential repass from europe from your deals? thank you.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
thank you. so, yes, mp had a very strong quarter and we saw the global end markets. and the encouraging thing with mp is, it is truly global and it is across the verticals that we operate in. our crushing and screening business saw good order activity. we saw that as the year progress, we saw utilization through our telematics continue to indicate good utilization of the equipment.
you're right, mig, about 70% of that business goes to dealers. but this isn't the model as the dealers really have inventory that's out in a rental purchase option type environment. and so what we saw was good utilization by end customers and then conversion of those rental contracts into ownership which then enabled the dealer organizations to order back. and that's what we saw in terms of the order activity. and i would say was broad brushed our crushing and screening business, in the us our mixer truck business with strengthened residential area, we saw really good growth there. we saw recovery in our material handling business, which was a very challenging year in 2020 for folks. but one of the benefits of rising steel prices is rising scrap prices. so we saw recovery there in the fourth quarter and orders in that business. our environmental businesses and new business that kieran and the team have built over the last couple of years, again, good global growth across our biomass and our recycling side in that segment.
and last but not least, our lifting businesses, our pick and carry business down in australia had a good year. australia weathered the covid storm a lot better than other places. and they had a good year. and then we saw some improvement in orders in our towers business. and finally, we saw improvement in india. india was hit very hard by the covid in the second quarter. and as we moved through the year, we did see some improvement in india. so what's encouraging for us about the mp side is, it truly is global and it is across the verticals that we compete in. so it was encouraging to see those results and we're looking forward to 2021 on both businesses, but mp is in a very good position starting the year.

your next question is from ann duignan with jpmorgan. your line is open.
ann duignan -- jpmorgan -- analyst
yeah, hi. good morning.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive
good morning, ann.
ann duignan -- jpmorgan -- analyst
could you just address the margins in material processing in the fourth quarter? how much of the margin increase or the margins delivered was driven by the lower cost base in northern ireland and the cost base being in pounds rather than euro? and is that a competitive advantage going forward versus your competitors who would probably be mostly cost base euros?
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive
you want to go ahead and cover the margin aspect, duffy?
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
sure. so, i would say, ann, that principal benefit we saw in the fourth quarter for the mp margins was really the mix of product sales that they had both regionally and by business. we saw particular strength in the fourth quarter in our crushing and screening business and concrete businesses, and regionally both in north america. we certainly -- our mp team is really strong operationally and they have a tremendous cost focus. they're able to adjust their production and their cost structure to the industry environment. so you are absolutely correct that northern ireland is a very advantageous cost structure for manufacturing for us. i would not say that fdx, whether it be the british pound or any other currency, was a significant driver of the margin performance in the quarter, but rather mix of businesses, strong north american sales and finally strong cost control by the mp team.
ann duignan -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. i appreciate that color, particularly on the mix in q4. and then, on awp on orders, is there any concern or can you quantify at all any impact particularly from the independents who might be pulling forward orders ahead of anticipated price increases? i mean, everybody's watching steel prices and i'm assuming all your customers are looking at that. and we've been through this show before. so, can you tell how much of your strong orders in q4 might have been pull forward of demand ahead of anticipated price increases?
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive
ann, we did take price increase as part of the orders that we booked in q4 anticipating that the cost increases in 2021. so i don't think we saw any ""pull forward."" i think it really was the independents coming back into the market to replenish their fleets because they liked the large nationals did manage their fleets over the course of 2020 in response to the market demand. so i think it's more about just response to the opportunities they see in the marketplace and their aggressive fleet management that they had in 2020.
ann duignan -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. i appreciate that. i'll get back in queue and take my other questions offline. thanks.

your next question is from jamie cook with credit suisse. your line is open.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. good morning.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive
good morning, jamie.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
a nice quarter. i guess, my first question. can you just talk to order trends that you've seen so far in january and february with some of the rental companies coming out with fairly robust capex numbers. so i'm wondering if your orders have had started to accelerate relative to what we sort of saw in the fourth quarter. and then, i guess, my second question is, john, just because you've been wearing two hats for a while now, as you think about the progress that you've made in aerial work platform, what inning of the ballgame are you in, in terms of sort of restructuring and thinking about your ability to get margins back to sort of where your competitors are or prior peak levels? thank you.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive
so -- thanks, jamie. in terms of trying to provide in-quarter guidance, i would say that from a customer standpoint, we've progressed from an order standpoint several large national accounts completed the water activity at the end of december. several large national accounts are continuing their dialogues with us as we progress through the quarter. so that activity is ongoing. and i would say, we're optimistic based on what we're seeing based on how the rental customers manage their fleet in 2020. they do need equipment in 2021. so i would say, that's what we've seen from a customer standpoint.
and then, on your second question, jamie, could you repeat that please?
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
yeah. my second question just was -- just on the aerial work platform side. you've done a lot to restructure the business. you're seeing that margin improvement in 2021. but i guess, my question is, what more needs to be done from your perspective? what inning of the ballgame are you in, in terms of what needs to happen to get the margins over time back to prior peak or more comparable to your peer levels? thank you.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive
thank you. i will say this, jamie, i'm not necessarily going to speak to what inning but the management team, so we have a strong management team in our genie business and they are absolutely focused on driving margin improvement in the business. i was proud of our -- we've talked about commercial excellence over the course of the last couple of years. really proud of the commercial teams and how they stayed in close contact with customers through these challenging times. driving some process discipline there, improving our siop process, so more to come there. we have to invest a little bit more on our technology and our systems, but the team made good progress.
on the development side, genie has been known for strong product development with the product offerings that we have, we're going to continue to bring innovative products to the marketplace, purposeful innovation of products that are more cost effective for us to manufacture and more cost effective for our customers to operate. so you can expect us to continue that activity going forward.
on the manufacturing footprint, we took action with some of our manufacturing footprint in the fourth quarter. the team will continue, as duffy said, to manage all elements of costs, material costs, direct labor costs, indirect labor costs and we'll leverage the volume that we get as we see the improvement as we go forward. the team has done a really -- it's always difficult on the sg&a side but the team has done a great job managing our sg&a and positioning the for success as we go forward.
and then, we've continued to invest in our technology and our processes and our systems, our parts and service. and so that investment, we mitigated or we ameliorated that, i should say, slightly in 2020. you'll see us continue to make the investments on the parts and service side of the business because we think there's still continued opportunity for us to drive improvement. so, overall, the team made a lot of progress but we know, as you mentioned, our margins are not where they need to be relative to competitors. and the team and i understand that's not acceptable. and so, we're going to continue to drive the actions necessary to close that gap as we move forward.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst

your next question is from david raso with evercore. your line is open.
david raso -- evercore -- analyst
hi. thank you. within the awp outlook the utilities business i was interested in your comments about the key part of the growth story. can you give us a sense of the non-awp growth you expect in that awp segment?
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive
yeah. thanks, david. and you're right with the utility segment. and let me just talk a little bit about what we saw in 2020 and then what we're anticipating for 2021. one of the things we do like about this business, david, is the demand is more stable. so we saw stable demand in 2020 for the investor-owned utilities, the co-ops and vegetation care part of the business. so that was reasonably consistent in 2020. what we did see fall off in 2020 and come back from an order standpoint here at the end of the year was the specialized rental channel that really focuses on the contractors, the specialized contractors in that business. and like many of the rental channels, we did see their demand fall off as we went through the course of the year, but we did see that respond nicely here in november and december on the rental contractor side.
so, we're encouraged by the demand environment there. we do think we're going to see substantial growth. the team did a great job, david, opening a plant in the middle of a pandemic. so now we have the capacity available to meet the higher demand that we're seeing and again a much more steady stream of revenue in the utilities side versus some of the other elements of awp. so, again, the team had a good year challenging year, but did a great job getting a new plant up and operating. we're seeing good order activity. and so, we like our position and opportunity to grow that business as we go forward, david.
david raso -- evercore -- analyst
but just unclear, do you think utility is above segment average growth or the segment's being guided at 12% and use the word substantial. i just want to make sure it's really...
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive
call it in the same ballpark, david, same ballpark.
david raso -- evercore -- analyst
and then awps, the rental customer conversations i assume at least give you some look into, on a multi-year view, how do they think of their needs, where the fleet age is and nothing really matters until they sit down and put an order and they get it. but when we think about the conversations you're having today and we've all been to this stands without infrastructure bills and then they don't show up but they don't show up the way you would have thought. but given what's happening in washington with an infrastructure bill, are you starting to have conversations with these customers at least giving you some insight on what '22 and '23 could be, what their needs could be if there is an infrastructure bill? is that even part of the dialogue at all yet?
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive
david, i'll answer it this way. the replacement cycle in the aerial business, principally in north america and europe, and we've talked about it, but there is a replacement cycle given the age of the equipment coming up as we move into '22 and '23. and that's just based on how they manage their fleets. they understand the optimal time to sell their equipment into the used market. i might say they had a really good year in 2020. they got good used equipment sales and used equipment values. so we are unequivocally going to see a replacement cycle as we move into '22 into '23 just associated with the age of the fleets in north america and europe.
in terms of infrastructure, david, i'm more encouraged than i have been historically about the potential for infrastructure. clearly infrastructure will help our business. as duffy said in his comments, we're not planning on it in 2021 but if we take a step back we're advocating strongly in my ceo role. we're advocating very strongly as part of am around infrastructure.
there is an absolute need and there's the potential opportunity for bipartisanship on one issue that being infrastructure. so, i think it's too early to call the ball, david, but you and i've been around a long time. i think it's setting up further, may actually get something done but that's going to be a '22-'23 type time frame. and again, we'll see how that plays out. but we're absolutely confident there's a need now that the issue is, can we get the political will and political action to make it happen.

your next question is from jerry revich from goldman sachs. your line is open.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive
good morning, jerry.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
john and duffy, i wonder if you just talk about your awp sales outlet comments within the context of rental capex budgets that are essentially doubling for some of your bigger customers just as they go from shrinking their fleets in '20 to not shrinking their fleets in '21. so i understand desire to be conservative coming out of the pandemic, but that's up 10%, then up 100%, it's a pretty wide gap. so can you just expand on that? and if you do need to produce for the up 50% plus base level, do you think the supply chain can deliver if you have to flex up toward the higher end of your scenario planning for '21?
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. so, in terms of -- our conversations have gone well with the large rental companies. and as i said in my earlier comments, jerry, they're continuing for several of them. yes, their capex is off a very low level. so the percentages are impressive but we have to look at the base in terms of what they did or did not spend in 2020. but again, it's encouraging to see that they're managing their fleets and that they need equipment. we're getting their best look at how they're anticipating their years unfolding and we need to be in a position to meet that potential opportunities i spoke.
we are seeing disruption in the supply chains, but the teams are doing a good job managing that. historically, our genie business has done a good job of ramping up and down unfortunately to demand. so, what i can say is, we're staying in very close contact with our customers. they're giving us their best look at what their requirements are for 2021 and we're setting up to meet those requirements. so, again, it's encouraging that we're talking about growth. and the absolute amount of growth, we'll see how the year unfolds.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. and then, john, if demand does surprise to the upside relative to your sales guidance in awp, how should we think about incremental operating leverage on the incremental sales? is there upside versus the 25% target that you have simply because of really attractive absorption rates off of a low base as you pointed out?
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. i think you can see our current outlook calls for substantially above the 25% target in our incremental margins in 2021. and so that's what we're planning on if we get we get the volume, it will definitely substantiate that margin outlook as we go forward. over time, again as duffy indicated, we are getting the leverage in 2021 from the increased production level. so we are anticipating substantially better than our 25% target in 2021.

your next question is from ross gilardi with bank of america. your line is open.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive
good morning, ross.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
good morning, ross.
randy wilson -- director, investor relations
hey, ross.
ross gilardi -- bank of america -- analyst
hey, duffy. i was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your mp business, which is obviously doing very well. i mean, within mp, you've got some quarry and aggregate exposure. you saw orders pick up strongly in the second half. the industry bellwether has been blaming quarry aggregates for softness in their mining segment for the last six quarters and i was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your mobile crushing and screening business? from a top-line perspective did it outperform the broader mp segment in 2020? how fast we think it grows to the cycle? and is it at all disruptive to the workings of a traditional rock quarry or mine to the extent that just wider penetration of mobile crushing or equipment could be displace an equipment for demand for traditional pieces of equipment, including trucks?
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
so, a lot there, ross. i think, in terms of what was seen over time, you're absolutely right. the adoption of mobile crushing and screening technology has continued to increase. and that principally is because you can move the equipment to the quarry. in terms of our business in terms of mining, we work really -- we're not necessarily at the mine face. we're downstream from that. but there's no doubt, the adoption of mobile crushing and screening equipment is providing operators the flexibility that they need. and we've seen that adoption in the more mature markets so-called at north america and europe, but we're also beginning to see the adoption of this technology in places like india and it's just starting.
i mean, it's just starting in china. so we do think the trend of mobile crushing and screening equipment will continue because it does drive efficiency for operators -- quarry operators and customers. so that's a trend that we think will continue and we like our leadership position in that mobile crushing and screening segment. and we're expanding in places like india and china to take advantage of those adoption trends.
ross gilardi -- bank of america -- analyst
thanks, john. would you call quarry and aggregate like one of your softer end markets this year or has it actually been an end market that kind of outperformed to the downside through the pandemic?
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
i would say, it's a consistent performer and it was consistent through the pandemic. and then, from an order activity, we did see good order activity as we got into the fourth quarter. as i said, the model for that distribution channel is dealers really have the equipment out with contractors on rpo type of contracts. we saw utilization stay high. and those contracts got converted, which enabled the dealer organization to then order back. and so, we did see that activity through the course of the year, especially the second half of the year.

your next question is from steven fisher with ubs. your line is open.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
greats. thanks. good morning. i wanted to just follow up on the discussion on materials processing because it was a really solid quarter. and you mentioned the broad strength, particularly looking at the backlog being up close to 60% but the revenue growth target still really only down at around 12%. so just curious what the disconnect is there between that backlog growth and the revenue target because i think over the last few years that backlog has been a pretty good indicator of where the revenue growth could be. is there something -- is it just sort of one or two quarter replenishment of that channel and then the back half will be weaker, what's the reconciliation there? thank you.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive
yeah. thanks, steven. just from the way that business works, it's a shorter cycle business for the dealer channel. so, shorter cycle distribution channel ordered back, we see it in backlogs. they will turn that backlog quicker. and then we'll see -- again, the model is, do the dealers they put it out principally on rental type of contracts? does that rental convert to ownership? if it converts to ownership then the dealers are ordering back. they're not ordering equipment in this channel to put on a lot. and so, we'll see how the year progresses. we're encouraged by the backlog and the early indications of the performance of the business as we move to 2021.

thanks. i'll answer the last question first, rob. there is not a lot going on right now in latin america. that market has been soft and we're not anticipating significant recovery in latin america in 2021. in terms of the china development, from an aerial's perspective, the china market recovered significantly after the second quarter. and the growth of aerial equipment in china has increased substantially. so the china market rebounded frankly as strong as any other market frankly stronger than any other market.
again, the adoption of aerial equipment and working safely at height continues in china. so we saw the overall market grow substantially and we did see growth in 2020 and we're anticipating continued growth in 2021 in the aerial's market.
as it pertains to the other businesses within china within mp that's in the infant stages. we are doing some utilities within our awp segment in china. we think that's a growth opportunity. and mobile crushing and screening equipment, we're importing into china now and that's not a long-term strategy. so we'll be looking for localized manufacturing of our equipment in mp and our changzhou facility will help us with that.
so, we do think there will be growth. it's very small right now in china, but we do believe over time we'll experience good growth in the mp -- certain mp verticals within china as we move forward.

operator
greetings and welcome to the terex corporation's fourth quarter and year end 2020 results conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
it is now my pleasure to introduce your host, randy wilson, director of investor relations for terex corporation. thank you. sir, you may begin.
randy wilson -- director, investor relations
good morning and welcome to the terex fourth quarter and year-end 2020 earnings conference call. a copy of the press release and presentation slides are posted on our investor relations website at investors.terex.com. in addition, the replay and slide presentation will be available on our website.
i'm joined by john garrison, chairman and chief executive officer; and john duffy sheehan, senior vice president and chief financial officer. their prepared remarks will be followed by q&a. please turn to slide 2 of the presentation, which reflects our safe harbor statement.
today's conference call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied. in addition, we will be discussing non-gaap information that we believe is useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. reconciliations for these non-gaap measures can be found in the conference call materials.
please turn to slide 3, and i'll turn it over to john garrison.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive
good morning and thank you for joining us and for your interest in terex. most importantly, i hope you and your families are remaining safe and healthy. throughout these challenging times, we are proud of all terex team members, who are keeping themselves and others safe, meeting the needs of customers and helping our communities. i'd like to recognize and thank our team members around the world for their continued commitment toward zero harm safety culture and terex way values.
safety remains the top priority of the company, driven by think safe, work safe, home safe. our team members remain vigilant by carefully following the covid-19 safety protocols and continuing to keep their guard up. despite a challenging year, we delivered results for all stakeholders. we prioritize their health and safety while maintaining our terex way values. globally, team members gave back to their communities with their time and donations.
for our customers, they are the center of our recovery and we have continued to maintain the highest levels of safety and our sales and service operations. and finally, for our shareholders, we minimize the operational and financial impacts related to the pandemic.
please turn to slide 4. despite the challenging markets during the fourth quarter, our team continued to meet customer demand, tightly managed all cost, aggressively reduced networking capital, especially awp inventories, and delivered outstanding free cash flow.
q4 revenue improved sequentially as end markets continued to recover despite the fourth quarter normally being seasonally slower. the sequential improvement in revenues was driven by mp whose revenues improved approximately 18%. customer bookings in q4 represented a continued strong improvement from q3. sequentially awp and mp bookings were up dramatically. in addition to sequential strength in bookings, awp bookings were flat with last year's pre-covid levels and mp's bookings were up 53%. year-end customer backlogs increased 25% over prior year pre-covid levels.
our stringent cost control and producing the customer demand helped us deliver operating margins in line with prior year on 11% lower revenues, even with $18 million of restructuring and related charges. awp recorded near breakeven operating margins, including $11 million of restructuring charges and revenue down 18% from the prior year, representing a decremental margin of 7% or an incremental margin of 3% when excluding restructuring and related charges. we are driving improvement in awp's profitability to restore the segment to industry competitive margins and we will continue to take the actions necessary to deliver on that improvement.
our mp segment achieved outstanding financial results, reporting a 15 % operating margin while revenues were down slightly year-over-year reporting an 82% incremental margin. throughout 2020, we right-sized our inventory levels to the customer demand environment, especially in our genie business. their inventory levels remained consistent with 2016, which was the last time there was an industrial downturn.
in 2021, aerial products will manufacturer to customer demand. our intense focus on networking capital management drove a $129 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, delivering excellent full year cash flow generation. overall, our q4 financial performance demonstrated strong execution by our global team. we are committed to improving these results in 2021.
please turn to slide 5. in 2020, we evolved from our focus, simplify, execute to win strategy to execute, innovate and grow. this transition and strategic priorities has strengthened our business operations. strategy requires action. so we took swift and decisive measures in 2020 to improve, strengthen and position terex for growth.
on the cost side, we looked at every aspect of the business to ensure we maximize our ability to be globally cost competitive. we aggressively took out cost, not just manufacturing cost, we also executed on an sg&a cost reduction initiative with a target of sg&a percent of sales for 2021 of approximately 12.5%.
turning to innovation. we listen to customers to ensure our products and services offer the features and benefits that provide value. we also invested in our connected assets and digital capabilities across the enterprise to better serve customers. we continue to drive global adoption of our products, genie scissors and booms for working safely at height and mobile crushing and screening products for aggregate production. finally, we maintain our resolve to invest in the business for future growth.
please turn to slide 6. looking ahead to 2021, we recognize that execution is the foundation to deliver on our commitments to team members, customers and shareholders. the hard work to rescale the company's cost structure will be aggressively managed to achieve our strategy of being globally cost competitive. we'll continue to invest in innovative products and services to serve our specialized markets. terex is well positioned for growth in 2021 because we have strong businesses, strong brands and strong market positions upon which we can grow. we will continue to invest, including investing in new products and manufacturing capacity where demand calls for it and we're a more focused organization. i'm confident this will result in terex being an even stronger company.
with that, let me turn it over to duffy.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, john. turning to slide 7. let me begin by reviewing our q4 financial results. i would like to call your attention to our financial reporting structure as you will notice consistently throughout 2020, we did not report adjusted financial results. instead, we are identifying specific financial callouts, which impacted our q4 reported results. looking at the fourth quarter, we achieved net sales slightly higher than our outlook from the beginning of the quarter. throughout the quarter, we saw our end markets continue to stabilize and improve. overall revenue of $787 million was down 11% year-over-year.
for the quarter, we recorded an operating profit of $32 million compared to adjusted operating profit of $36 million in the fourth quarter of last year. the overall operating profit resulted from revenues being down, combined with $18 million of severance and restructuring charges primarily in our awp segment. we achieved this positive operating result through disciplined cost control and adapting to the market environment.
while lower revenues impacted our gross margins and resulted in elevated sg&a as a percentage of sales, our aggressive cost reduction actions allowed terex to achieve an approximately 5% decremental margin in q4. this decremental margin was achieved despite $5 million of gross profit charges primarily due to restructuring. in addition, sg&a was adversely impacted by $13 million primarily due to team members' severance and restructuring. excluding these charges, operating profit was $49 million and terex achieved an incremental margin of 13% in the quarter.
the low operating income, interest and other expense was almost $10 million lower than q4 of 2019 because of several factors, including: first, lower interest rates versus a year ago; second, $4 million of investment income; and third, non-recurrence of $2 million in fx losses recognized in the prior year.
our 2020 global effective tax rate was approximately 18% compared to our previous estimate of 52%. during the fourth quarter, there were a few discrete items benefiting our q4 tax rate. finally, our reported eps of $0.21 per share includes the adverse operating impact on gross profit and sg&a, offset by the favorable benefits in other income that i just discussed.
turning to slide 8 and our segments' financial results. awp sales of $412 million contracted by 18% compared to last year, driven by end markets in north america and europe due to the impacts from the pandemic. the aerial products market and our sales in china remain robust. the utilities market remained stable and improved during the quarter across end markets. we continue to aggressively manage production levels in aerial products to ensure that we are not building excess inventory. during q4, our aerial products production was 16% lower than q4 2019. this continued aggressive production control allowed us to achieve almost $180 million reduction in aerial products inventory levels year-over-year.
awp delivered flat operating margin in the quarter, driven by aggressively rightsizing production and cost to align with end market demand. awp achieved strong decremental margin performance of 7% in the quarter, which includes $11 million of charges for severance and restructuring. awp fourth quarter bookings of $753 million were flat with pre-covid q4 2019 levels, while backlog at quarter end was $826 million, up 10% from the prior year.
now turning to materials processing. mp had another solid quarter achieving 15% operating margins as markets continue to improve. it is a testament to the mp team's operational strength to deliver these positive operating margins and revenues down 3%. sales were lower at $366 million, driven by cautious yet improving customer sentiment.
the mp team has been aggressively managing all elements of cost in a challenging market environment, resulting in incremental margin performance of 82%. backlog of $523 million was 59% higher than last year and up 81% sequentially. mp saw its businesses strengthen through the quarter with bookings up 53% year-over-year and up 76% sequentially. customers sentiment in both segments continues to improve as equipment is being utilized and ordered for 2021.
turning to slide 9. overall, 2020 demonstrated the resilience of our business and team members to deliver these results against a very challenging backdrop. significant cost actions reducing sg&a by $82 million from 2019 helped deliver 21% decremental margin and beat our 25% target. in addition, strong positive cash flow generation was helped by tightly managing net working capital and aligning production to demand.
turning to slide 10. when the pandemic arose during the first quarter, we quickly refocused our investment initiatives and took decisive action to reduce our overall cost structure through temporary and permanent actions. and over the course of 2020, we instituted an sg&a cost reduction initiative, not just in corporate but across the entire company. we always had an sg&a target going back to our 2016 analyst day of 12.5% of sales.
as detailed on this slide, we took a variety of actions to reduce our cost base. whether it was moving our corporate headquarters, improving productivity and selectively rescaling investments, we scrutinized every possible expense. the results of these actions is that we were able to reduce our sg&a cost structure by more than $100 million for 2021 versus 2019 and delivered the improved results detailed in my earlier comments. these actions have enabled terex to come into 2021 well-positioned to meet the 12.5% target.
turning to slide 11. now i would like to update you on how we currently anticipate 2021 to develop financially. it is important to realize we are operating in an unprecedented period and results could change negatively or positively. disruptions associated with covid, whether it is team member absenteeism or supply chain disruptions, could impact our outlook. with that said, this outlook represents our best estimate as of today. also, consistent with 2020, we do not plan to report adjusted financial results in 2021. the outlook included on this chart includes all known income and cost but does exclude the impact of potential future acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring transformation or other unusual items. as we identify currently unknown income or costs, we will identify them in our reported results.
as for commercial demand, we have seen our markets stabilize and improve over the course of 2020. all other things being equal, we do expect to see markets improve due to the global deployment of covid-19 vaccine and awp customers' fleet replenishment. however, our guidance does not include any benefit from potential infrastructure legislation.
we anticipate eps of $1.95 to $2.35 per share based on sales of approximately $3.45 billion. from a quarterly perspective, we expect revenues for the full year to be relatively evenly split between the first and second half of the year, with the second quarter being the strongest of the year. we look forward to returning to year-over-year sales growth in the second quarter this year. operationally, the absolute amounts of operating profit and operating margins are expected to increase each quarter year-over-year with slightly more operating profit in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year.
importantly, we are planning for and look forward to reporting incremental, rather than decremental margins, which meet or exceed our 25% target for full year 2021. quarterly earnings per share are expected to be generally consistent with the development of operating profits during the year. based upon global tax laws, we expect a 2021 tax rate of 19%. we are monitoring potential changes to tax laws in the united states and around the globe and we will adjust our operational and tax strategies as required.
for full year 2021, we are estimating free cash flow of approximately $100 million, reflecting another year of positive cash generation. we do expect q1 cash flow to be negative, which is consistent with historical patterns. we also estimate capital expenditures, net of asset dispositions, will be approximately $9 million. corporate and other costs are planned to occur relatively evenly throughout the year, although q1 is expected to be slightly lower and q2 slightly higher than the average. we continue to monitor developments associated with the uk's exit from the european union and do not expect any material impact.
now, let me turn your attention to the operating margin bridge on the slide. we believe it is important that the investment community understand the key elements of our operating margin improvement in 2021. first, cost reinstatements represent the restoration of team members' compensation after the reductions we enacted in 2020. it is important to pay team members competitively to retain our talent.
next, i would point out that positive volume and improved manufacturing efficiency would drive much of our margin improvement. additionally, our sg&a cost reduction effort also provides significant improvement in our 2021 operating margin.
finally, we did have severance, restructuring and other charges in 2020 that are not expected to reoccur in 2021. taking together, these operational improvements drive our 2021 operating margin guidance of approximately 7%.
turning to slide 12. now i'll review our segment guidance. we expect the improved customer sentiments demonstrated by our genie and utility customers to continue into 2021. awp margins are expected to be positive each quarter of 2021 with incremental margins well above our targeted 25%. materials processing is expected to continue its consistent operating performance delivering double-digit operating margins each quarter throughout 2021.
following the run up in steel prices in 2018, we implemented a steel hedging program with respect to our aerial's north american hot rolled coil, or hrc, steel consumption. approximately two-thirds of our aerial's steel consumption is hrc. you may be aware that there is not presently any forward market for hedging plate steel. during 2020, we purchased hedges for the predominant amount of our anticipated 2021 north american aerial hrc requirements.
the guidance we are providing today takes into account the steel hedging actions we took in 2020 as well as current steel prices for the remainder of our global steel requirements. overall, our 2021 guidance represents a dramatic improvement in operating performance when compared to 2020. the swift and decisive actions taken in 2020 enabled this effort and we will continue to aggressively manage costs of positioning the business for growth.
turning to page 13. i'll review our disciplined capital allocation strategy. we introduced our strategy back at our 2016 analyst day. it has served the company well during the pandemic and will enable us to grow in 2021. our team members remain vigilant and will continue to aggressively manage production, especially within our awp segment, and scrutinize every expenditure, so we continue to generate strong positive free cash flow. we have ample liquidity with greater than $1 billion available to us. with no near-term debt maturities, we can manage and grow the business.
in 2021, we have entered into a partnership with a us bank to provide financing solutions to our genie customers. in connection with this arrangement, last week, the bank purchased approximately $100 million of our terex financial services portfolio of receivables. as a result of our strong liquidity position, including the proceeds from the sale of the tfs on-book portfolio, we initiated this week the repayment of approximately $200 million of term loans, reducing outstanding debt and lowering leverage.
in q1, we will recognize the corporate and other operating gain of $7 million in connection with the tfs sale and interest and other charge of $2 million related to the repayment of the term loans. neither this gain or the charge is included in the financial guidance we are providing today.
turning to growth. we continue to invest in the business in 2020 at reduced levels and we'll continue to invest in 2021 with capital spending, net of assets disposition, of approximately $90 million. in 2020, we executed a strong and swift actions to rightsize the business so tariffs can profitably grow in the future. we remain resolute in tightly managing production and sg&a.
our strong balance sheet and expected 2021 free cash flow generation allowed our board of directors to reinstate our quarterly dividend for 2021. the board has approved a q1 dividend of $0.12 per share as we return cash to shareholders. our earnings power and healthy capital position provides a strong foundation for us to manage and grow terex.
and with that, i'll turn it back to you, john.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive
thanks, duffy. turning to slide 14. this quarter's results demonstrated progress, but we have more work to do. our aerial team has stayed in close contact with our customers during this critically important part of the year when customers are planning their 2021 requirements.
being customer-centric also means developing products that add value for customers at the appropriate price. we are delivering a new electric drive, or e-drive scissor, and just recently announced a brand-new telehandler. these products demonstrate genie's strength in listening to customers and responding with innovative industry-leading products.
during 2020, we invested in the expansion of our world-class manufacturing facility in changzhou, china and completed our watertown, south dakota utilities facility. the utilities businesses in very important growth area for awp. the tl shown at the top of the page is a new product to take advantage of the adoption of transmission line work in china. at the bottom of the page, the photo shows a customer delivery from our watertown facility. terex utilities is well positioned to participate in the increased investment in electrical grid infrastructure.
from an operational perspective, the awp team executed in q4 by delivering breakeven operating margins despite $15 million of restructuring charges, aggressively taking cost out of the business to improve the ability to deliver future industry competitive margins and innovating by continuing to bring new products to market. it is a competitive industry. so we are controlling what we can control, superior execution and aggressively reducing cost to improve margins and win in the global marketplace.
turning to slide 15. once again, materials processing demonstrate a strong operating performance and positioned the business to benefit from improving market conditions. mp is a diversified, high performing portfolio of businesses, which continues to invest for future growth. the investment in our campsie, northern ireland facility, will enable our ecotec business to grow in waste recycling. shown on the slide is the new ecotec metal shredder, which supports recovery applications for the recycling and waste industries. it's a new and unique offering demonstrating mp's continued investment in new products and adjacent markets.
in addition, the adoption of mp's innovative products, whether it's mobile crushing and screening in china or franna pick and carry cranes in india is just starting. the financial performance of mp relative to market conditions by achieving an operating margin of 15% in q4 demonstrates the mp team's strong execution. mp's bookings improved and increased throughout the fourth quarter, resulting in bookings being up 53% year-over-year. mp benefits from customer, product and geographical diversity and strong execution to consistently deliver outstanding results.
turning to slide 16. to wrap up our remarks, terex team members around the world are focused on the right things, safety, health, customers and improved productivity. we are reducing cost to improve margins, especially within awp. we are driving positive free cash flow by reducing working capital. our businesses have a strong future. so we are continuing to invest in innovative products and services to be prepared as market demand returns. as a result of these actions, terex is well-positioned for an improved 2021.
and with that, let me turn it back over to randy.
randy wilson -- director, investor relations
thanks, john. as a reminder, during the question-and-answer session, we ask you to limit your questions to one and a follow-up to ensure we answer as many questions as possible this morning.
with that, i'd like to open up for questions. operator?

thank you. [operator instructions] your first question comes from steven volkmann with jefferies. your line is open.
steven volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
great. good morning, everybody.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, steven.
steven volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
gosh, at the risk of sounding ungrateful, i wanted to just look into your kind of guidance in awp a little bit. so, your revised revenue guidance still on the up almost 20% year-over-year, if my math is right, and it just seems like the demand side of the equation is much stronger than that. so, i guess, maybe the difference is concerns around supply chain. maybe the question is to sort of dig a little bit deeper into that topic -- and i guess i'm just trying to figure out what's holding those revenues back relative to some of the capex budgets we're seeing from your customers.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, steven. and first let me say, we did significantly increase our bookings and backlog literally around the world in awp. so, we were pleased with that. if you look at our outlook for the rest of the year q2 to q4, you're talking about a 30% year-over-year growth in our awp segment. so, we are seeing substantial growth in this segment. the team continues to work. we -- as we like many manufacturers are seeing supply chain constraints.
so, we're working through those supply chain constraints. but right now, we are seeing strong growth around the world for the remainder of the year. and we're executing on our supply chain, but we are seeing disruptions in the supply chain that's impacting our production levels. but overall really pleased with the back -- the backlog, the bookings and what we're seeing -- the strength that we're seeing in that marketplace.
steven volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. right. yeah. demand doesn't seem to be the factor here, the gating factor. maybe a little bit longer term or broader term, and then i'll pass it on. how are you feeling about margins in that business? i know that's kind of been your focus over the past several quarters, couple of years and 7% is not bad, but it's obviously still a ways to go to get back to kind of where you were a couple of years ago. so, what does that trajectory look like in your mind?
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, thanks, steve. well, first of all, we've got a great management team at genie and in our utilities business, and they are intensely focused on driving margin improvement. as you saw, we draw -- a 680 basis point improvement on a year-over-year basis on lower sales in the first quarter, we anticipate as with indicated sales fit to be improving. so, the team is focused on driving margin improvement. we are seeing headwinds like most manufacturers on material costs. we're offsetting that action with pricing. we're continuing to be resolute in our sg&a costs. the team's done a great job managing our sg&a and we're continuing to address our global cost competitiveness, with the announcement like we made in our oklahoma city plants.
so, the team understands that we need to be globally cost competitive. we've made great progress, but unequivocally there's more progress to be made there, steve.
steven volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
but your conviction that you can get back to those double-digit levels is unchanged, i assume.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
the team is focused on getting us back to those double-digits levels, absolutely. it will take time, but unequivocally we believe that that is absolutely an achievable target for us and the team.
steven volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
super. thank you.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer

operator
your next question comes from the line of mig dobre with baird. your line is open.
mig dobre -- baird -- analyst
thank you. good morning. maybe i'm just going to pick up on this line of questioning here, as well. if i'm looking at your guidance, a little over $2 billion of revenue in awp. just a couple of years ago, this business was -- or generating more than $2.7 billion of revenue. so, i guess, i'm wondering how you sort of see the path going forward in terms of the recovery, getting back to those kinds of revenue levels, is that feasible? do you think you can actually do better than this in this upcoming cycle? and to ask the question once more, given that you're already guidance margin, it's 7%, which is basically where you are in 2019 on a much higher revenue base. if we were to get back to those kinds of prior peak levels, what would be the right sort of margin framework for us to kind of consider?
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks. thanks, mig. so, let me just take a step back. we -- we're encouraged by the awp business. i mean, if you take a step back and if you look at just -- as i said in my opening comments, the secular trends in the rental industry is definitely going to be a tailwind. we think the replacement cycle is definitely starting and coming up for the next couple of years. so, from a volume standpoint, we're encouraged by what we're seeing, and we think we can significantly increase the volumes over time, as that replacement cycle and growth continues. as we see that growth in volumes, then we need to convert that at more historical levels of operating margin. and that's what the team is focused on is driving that margin improvement.
so, as the volume returns, as we've taken the aggressive cost actions that we've taken, we should expect to see over time continued margin improvement in that business, as we move forward. so, that's what the team's focused on, every single day. and we're going to continue to drive execution and improvement. no doubt in the current environment mig, we are seeing a significant material cost increases. we've had to offset some of those material cost increases with pricing activity, so that -- that's obviously a factor, but we're going to continue to work with our customers and offset material increases with pricing. right now, in this environment, as you saw on our outlook, we weren't able to do that. longer term, we're going to strive to offset material cost increases, with pricing. so, that will also help as we go forward. so, again, we -- the genie business has historically been a great business. it's got an incredibly strong brand. management team is absolutely focused on meeting the needs of the customer and driving margin improvement. and i can assure you every single day, that's the focus of the team.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
mig, if i was just to add to john's comment and to build on the second part of your question, right? as you pointed out in 2018, our awp business, our awp segment was about $2.9 billion of revenue and double-digit margins. and our guidance here today is $2.1 billion, 7% margin. if you just look at that additional $800 million of revenue, and that we target a 25% incremental margin, i think you would find that to get to a double-digit margin again, wouldn't require the 25% incremental margin on that $800 million of revenue. so, we definitely see that the genie brand, the genie business, the awp segment is a double-digit margin business.
mig dobre -- baird -- analyst
that's great color. thank you for that. and then, my follow-up is, it's on mp and i'm going to -- want to talk about margin there as well. the implied incremental margin here is a little bit lower. i think, it's something like 20% in the guidance this year. i'm just looking for a little more context on this. does this particular segment see more pressure on a cost side, or is this a factor makes pricing? what are all the moving pieces here? thank you.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
so, on the mp side, i think we take a step back and you look at just continued strong execution with the margin generation, with the top line sales growth. and they aggressively managed costs throughout their business through the multiple businesses that we have. and again, we target the 25% incremental margins. the team's done a good job of delivering on that as we go forward. they also are seeing a material cost headwinds that we're having to offset with pricing as well. and again, not necessarily setting off -- offsetting all material costs headwinds associated with the pricing. but over time they will be able to do that as well. so, again, if i just take a step back and look at the mp business and the execution across the businesses, across the globe, they've done a fantastic job, delivering margin improvement on the growth. and i'm absolutely confident and the team will deliver on the volume that's there in the marketplace.
randy wilson -- director-investor relations

steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
just in -- good morning. just in terms of execution, q1 looked very good. i guess, looking out to the next couple of years, john, you mentioned you're going to drive execution. if you are revenues in the awp segment were to get back to that prior peak, what would you need to do to handle that kind of revenue? is your business peak ready today? just kind of trying to make sure we don't run into any execution challenges.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks. yes. i mean, we have the global footprint around the globe for the genie business in china, in north america, in europe. our capacity actually will expand. we did close our oklahoma city facility where -- let me say that we will be closing it in the first quarter of 2022, and moving that operation to monterrey, mexico. that will also give us incremental capacity, but we'll produce in both locations over the transition period of time. so, the genie team -- in their history, if you look at their ability to ramp up and to ramp down, they've been quite successful in doing that. and so, we have the capacity to meet the needs of a growing market. and again, that's a -- it's a great opportunity for us, as we move forward. and frankly, we're excited about that opportunity to meet the higher demand, as the market improves.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
great. and so, you mentioned the inorganic growth plans. can you just talk about what you're thinking about on m&a, anything inorganic these days?
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you. well, first, it starts with the ability of our discipline capital allocation and strategy, and the team's done a really nice job driving free cash flow improvement. as duffy indicated in our opening comments, really done a great job, strengthening our balance sheet. so, now we believe we have the opportunity to look at inorganic growth. and our principal focus really is in and around our mp businesses. specialized equipment markets, we have leadership positions in those markets, and it still remains a relatively fragmented in the segments that we compete within mp. and so, our initial focus is we're building. our m&a pipeline is in and around our mp business and our lifecycle businesses. and we're building that pipeline, and we do believe that inorganic growth can now be part of our overall growth strategy for terex. so, the team is working on that, and we're excited about the potential and the opportunities that we're seeing for m&a activities. but again, we'll be very disciplined in our approach to m&a, but we absolutely are looking at m&a opportunities for us going forward.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of ann duignan with jpmorgan. your line is open.
ann duignan -- jpmorgan -- analyst
yeah. thank you and good morning.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, ann.
ann duignan -- jpmorgan -- analyst
good morning. when we were sitting here at the end of q4, you had talked about hedging program that was in place for almost all of genie's north america still needs. and so, what's happened there? has demand come in stronger than expected, and any incremental demand is not hedged and subject to higher costs, or a little bit more color. and actually what's happened in the quarter in terms of input costs or/and is it just raw materials, or is it other things too? just little more quantification of actually what's happened during the quarter?
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
sure. maybe john, i'll start on the steel side and then you can add. so, as you pointed out and we did talk about our steel hedging program and that we had hedged the predominant amount of our steel hot-rolled coil needs for the north american market for 2021. we have not entered into additional hedges for steel for 2021 during the course of the first quarter. as you certainly know steel prices including in the futures market has increased significantly and therefore, utilizing our hedging program would not have financially beneficial transaction for us.
so, the additional volume over and above, i would say our initial guidance this year, we procure that as part of our normal steel purchasing program with our -- from our steel suppliers. john -- in terms of input costs, i'll just say, obviously, not just simply steel, but other materials such as resin logistics costs, etc, have definitely increased over the course of the quarter. and those cost increases are built into the updated guidance -- updated outlook that we're providing here today.
ann duignan -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. thank you. i appreciate the color on that. that's what i suspected. and then on mp, can you give us a little bit more color in terms of the regional demand? i know you said, demand improved through the quarter across all regions and all segments. but any favorable product mix this quarter, or in the outlook and any favorable regional or not favorable. but i think last quarter, again, you talked about favorable product mix, as well as favorable regional mix. so, an update there will be great. thank you. i'll leave it there.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, ann. and again, very encouraged about the broad-based demand picture that we're seeing across our businesses and really across multiple regions. if we look at our crushing and screening business, we saw end market strengths in europe, north america, in the apac across our product line. if we look at concrete or mixture, truck business, specific in north america, we saw substantial growth in orders in that business really -- and we think that's associated as much with the residential construction market, but again, substantial increases in terex advance. we were just talking about materials. if there's one positive of high steel costs, it's scrap metal prices are going up, and that is really helping our material handling business, our fuchs business. and again, ann, we're seeing that really around the globe, europe, north america, substantially up for our fuchs business.
our environmental business is relatively new business with mp. so, we're seeing good market demand, but it's also a great example of product line extensions growing that business for us. and again, a similar story, we're seeing that growth both in north america and in europe and beginning to see some growth in that area in apac. one business that we don't talk a lot about is our pick and carry business, down in australia. australia weathered the pandemic reasonably well. and we're seeing strength in orders in that business, both from the mining sector, as well as infrastructure down there. so, that business, we saw some good year-over-year growth and strength as well. and ann, we did see some improvement, not to the same level that we've seen in the other parts of the business, but we actually saw some recovery in our tower cranes and our key business.
and finally, india, we were seeing -- we saw order strength in india. obviously, we're all concerned about the current covid situation in india. our team members are doing a great job, navigating that, following the protocols and keeping production running safely in india. but again, just encouraged by the broad level of demand across the globe, across our product offerings, within our mp segment. again, the team continues to do a great job in a challenging market, executing on that demand.

your next question comes from the line of david raso with evercore isi. your line is open.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi, good morning. thank you for the time. i was...
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, david.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
i was kind of looking the relationship of your awp backlog at the end of the first quarter to the full year. i mean, historically that backlog is 30% to 40% of the full year rev. more recently what's called closer to 40%. if that relationship held, i mean, it would imply revenues should be north of $3 billion this year and awp not 2.1 and change. so, can you help us bucket why the weaker conversion of backlog to revenue at that magnitude? i mean, it's not even close.
i mean, is it -- the backlog is starting to have orders extending into the following year more than normal, is that -- your customers ordered that much earlier. so then naturally we'll see a little less sequential order -- orders than normal. how much is it the logistical shipping issues? and i guess for the question would be, is it also just -- how conservative is that guide just given the starting point with that backlog?
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
so, thanks, david. and again, encouraged by the increase in customer demand after last year. so, there were a lot of orders placed up early this year from -- early -- obviously in q1, as you see the backlog go up significantly. and again, we saw that, david, around the globe. in terms of the ability to increase production, we are limited right now by the supply chain. we're working with our supply chain to ensure that we can meet the customer demand, but the limiting factor in the near term to call that q2, q3, is the supply base and the supply basis ability to ramp to the levels that we're at. so that -- the supply base is unequivocally a limiting factor in the demand that we can deliver for our awp segment. and to some extent, not to the same extent, but there's some extent, the same thing in mp.
so, in the current environment, david, ramping up the supply chain is the limiting factor and our ability to meet the increased demand. the good news is the demand is there and the team's working hard to secure the materials to be able to achieve the higher production rate. so, that's basically what's driving this year thus far, is material supply -- material constraints, and the team's doing a heck of a job overcoming that, so we can meet the needs of our customers.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
so, there is no...
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
and david, i would just say that when you think about the guide, when we thought about the guidance, we took that into consideration and to the extent that we -- it's early in the year right now, and as we work through the supply chain and the opportunity to increase production, we would factor that into our guidance also.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
and david, the second part of your question was in terms of -- is the backlog for -- beyond 2020, a very small percentage of the backlog is for 2022 deliveries. and that's really more in our utilities business and the custom truck side. and so, some of that backlog has moved into 2022, but there's not a significant portion of our 2021 backlog that we're showing that's for delivery in 22. there is some, but it's not a significant portion, david.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
i appreciate that. i mean to say it's a positive that had that much backlog. i'm just trying to level set. if the gatekeeper is the ability to ramp up the orders that would normally show up in 2q, 3q because of the early ordering, maybe the inability to serve new demand. i suspect that would suggest the orders, sequentially drop a little more than normal. and i'm curious, given the seasonality of taking iron and usually right -- you want it before september, august, even earlier, how do we -- i'm just trying to level set the idea of the orders could look a little weak going forward? or do you think your customers, given the supply constraints, might start putting orders in for 2022 earlier, meaning not worrying about, hey, if you can't get it to me this year, i know i'm going to need it in the spring. so, i'm just trying to level set how we interpret the orders going forward.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think david...
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
... had conversations on 2022 already saying, well, we'll start putting orders in for 2022 earlier.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
i will say this, david, there's an awareness that, in general, the supply chain is tight. and obviously, not just for us and not just for the aerial equipment for rental companies. so, they're cognizant that the supply environment is tight. we're having conversations, but i can't tell you at this time, david, this early in the year that it's going to fundamentally alter how they think about order and order placement as we go forward. so, i think we're going to have to be responsive and react to the situation. i can't tell you right now at this point in time of the year, though, that we're going to see a significant change in terms of order pattern and order flow. although, backlogs are up across the industry and that may lead to behavior change, and we'll be prepared for that.
randy wilson -- director-investor relations

your next question comes from jamie cook with credit suisse. your line is open.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, good morning. nice quarter. i guess, two questions. the first one, can you just help us understand your approach to pricing when you put in incremental price increases? i think your peers talked about putting in a 3% in march. and just wondering if yours just comparable and is it a surcharge or an actual list price increase, and have orders change since that price increase. and then my second question, duffy, everyone's sort of asking questions around this, but is there any way for 2021 holistically, we can think about the incremental costs associated with whether it's supply chain inefficiencies, covid, that cost. i'm just trying to understand what costs could be sort of incremental on 2021 that aren't necessarily there in 2022 and set terex up for a potentially good incremental margin in 2022. if the volumes are still there. thanks.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'll take the first part, duffy. and if you'll take the second part. so, on the pricing and price costs strategy, what we're doing is being very transparent with our customers and being very clear in terms of the cost increases that we're seeing. our normal pattern is that we have a price increase for the upcoming year. so that would have been in q4 of last year for 2021 deliveries. when we saw the substantial increase in material costs, especially around steel, we did implement an incremental price increase in march, that went into effect for orders that were placed after -- for the most part, it very bad business, but for the most part orders placed after the end of march. that incurred the higher price that we're seeing.
the range of price that you indicated is relevant. it was in that ballpark, low single digits. it does vary across businesses. the level of increase that we're asking for, again, being transparent with customers on the cost increases that we're seeing. in terms of the price cost relationship, as you saw in our outlook guide, this year, because we had so much in backlog, we chose not to -- in general, we chose not to reprice the backlog. there are some specific situations where we had to. and so, the price cost is a negative this year as a result of that backlog, but the pricing did go into effect, or right at the end of the first quarter and the orders and equipment that we deliver, that's not in backlog. going forward, we'll be at the higher price level, and we'll continue to monitor this and continued to address adjust price based on the material cost inputs that we're seeing. and again, being very transparent with the customer. duffy, you want to follow up on the second piece of the question?
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so, jamie, we look -- we included the eps walk from our previous guide to our updated outlook in the earnings presentation today. and where you see there is, is that we included a line for $0.55 eps reduction from the previous guide as a result of cost pressure. and i think that's probably a good marker for you of what the impact has been from our -- from the start of the year in terms of the impact to us, in terms of the increases, whether it be, field, residents, logistics, etc, and that we -- with the reason why we increased prices. and we are only partially offsetting it as john -- offsetting those costs increases as john said. but i think $0.55 would be a good number to think off.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, jamie.
randy wilson -- director-investor relations

your next question comes from the line of tim thein with citigroup. your line is open.
tim thein -- citigroup -- analyst
great. thanks. just -- i wanted to circle back on the earlier theme on order timing, but the specifically on mp and if -- obviously very strong bookings for the segment as a whole. but i'm just curious within that on crushing and screening, typically the order growth tends to start out the year strong based on -- ahead of the construction season and dealers and customers want to have delivery ahead of that.
but i'm curious if you think that there may have been within that 1q bookings number, there may have been some kind of preordering given concerns about longer lead times. so, effectively some pull ahead of orders that may have come -- subsequent orders that may have come later in the year. did they get potentially pulled into the first quarter?
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, thanks. and again, on the mp side, tim, we actually saw order activity begin to improve really in the fourth quarter of last year. so, this is the continued momentum on orders within the mp segment. again, across all the businesses within mp, we have seen significant order activity increase. we've got a very rigorous process of looking at the dealer orders. is there some ordering activity as a result of seeing lead times expand? yes. that's a natural reaction that a distribution channel would have, about 70% of the business in mp goes through a distribution channel. so, there may be some of that. but i think the biggest driver in the order activity is what our dealers are seeing in their end markets. based on our telematics data, we're seeing increased utilization. we've seen significant conversion from rent to own. there's a lot of that in that channel, that's enabled the dealers to order back. so, when we look at our dealer inventory levels, even with the increased sales, dealer inventory levels are down.
so, all-in-all, we feel very strong about where we are in that business. and yes, there may be some preordering, because they want to get slots, but they're only doing it because they see the demand in front of them. and we're seeing, especially in the -- all of our businesses, but this whole concept of infrastructure that's driving demand around the world and it's not even in place yet, but it's the attitude. it's the expectation. and globally, we have seen infrastructure investment, and that clearly has helped our mp business around the world. so, there may be some, but the market demand -- the underlying fundamentals are strong. and frankly, we believe they're going to continue to be strong and frankly increase as we go around the world. so, mp team has done a great job and that business is performing. it performed in a down cycle, and i guess it's going to perform incredibly well in the up cycle.
tim thein -- citigroup -- analyst
okay. got it. thank you.

ross gilardi -- bank of america -- analyst
thanks. good morning, guys.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
hey, ross.
ross gilardi -- bank of america -- analyst
could you guys just talk about some of the things you did and are still doing with your global sourcing strategy and how those -- how some of the critical elements of -- those things just sort of enabled terex, or should enable terex to cope better in this environment where we've got widespread shortages and more localization and just everything that's going on right now with supply chain tightness. what have you done to better equip the company for the next cycle?
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
great. well, one of the major initiatives that we've had over the last couple of years, and i'm very thankful that we did with our strategic sourcing initiative. and what that able -- enabled us to do is really strengthen our relationships with our supply base. and when things get challenged, those relationships become very important. and there's much more engagement at senior executive levels. we're more and more important customer to our suppliers.
and so, the hard work that the team has put in place on our strategic sourcing initiative has really positioned us well with our primary suppliers, also setting up secondary and alternate suppliers is helped overcome the challenges that we've had. so, the strategic sourcing initiative, the discipline, the process that we put in place is really helping in this environment. and i think it will continue to assist us, as we go forward.
and i do want to hats off to our -- all of our operations team, but especially our strategic sourcing teams and our logistics teams. it has been a challenging environment, like all industrial companies right now, and they're doing a great job managing our supply chain, focusing on continuity and the strategic sourcing initiatives that we've implemented over the last couple of years, have really served us well in this challenging environment and are going to serve as well as we move forward.
ross gilardi -- bank of america -- analyst
john, just a quick one to follow-up on that.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah.
ross gilardi -- bank of america -- analyst
so, would you say that you've -- have you moved to more toward single sourcing of critical components to enhance those relationships, or have you moved more toward dual triple, quadruple sourcing, in general.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. so, it's hard to say in general, because it really depends on which specific commodity of that you're looking at. from a general statement, we look to reduce our single source, if it made economic sense to do that. so, we have increased the number of alternative sources. we have absolutely had to go to those alternative sources in this environment. and so, i don't want to make a general statement, because it truly does matter and what type of component, what type of commodity that we're dealing with. but i will say it's a strategic decision by commodity what is our strategy for that respective commodity as we go forward.
ross gilardi -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. thanks so much.

brett linzey -- vertical research partners -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, brett.
brett linzey -- vertical research partners -- analyst
hey. wanted to come back to some of the cost initiatives and really thinking outside sg&a, you had pointed to the manufacturing example in telehandlers, localization of production in china. are you able to quantify what the savings you think those actions are yielding outside some of the sg&a stuff. and then, have you identified additional repositioning opportunities on the footprint?
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you. a lot of the activity was in our awp segment, specifically genie. the team's done a great job, as we mentioned on the sg&a side as you acknowledged. and that focus and discipline will continue.
on the manufacturing footprint, we've taken action. we closed our rock hill facility. we're moving our telehandler production from oklahoma city to mexico, which is going to give us a cost advantage as well.
and then also within our manufacturing facilities, our teams have done a great job, really driving productivity and leverage within direct manufacturing spend. and as we -- as the volumes come back, we would anticipate that that leverage on the indirect side of the manufacturing spend will also be helpful to drive margin improvement as volumes return.
so, it's been a multi-pronged approach by the team, looking at every element of the cost structure, and ensuring that we're globally cost competitive in every activity. and i might also add that every activity within the company. so, it's also functional activities, work in that be done in the most cost effective area around the world. so, the team has a comprehensive plan. we're implementing the comprehensive plan to drive the margin improvement. and over time, we are going to drive the genie business back to double-digit historical levels of margin activity, and the team is committed to doing that.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
and brett, while i don't think we can put a specific dollar number on the cost savings and what they contributed. when you look at just some metrics, right, is the awp segment q1 improved 680 basis points year-over-year, the incremental margin for the full year 44% on the outlook we provided today and a 7% operating margin. so, i think, those are some of the metrics that demonstrate the cost -- the hard work on cost improvement that the awp team has executed on.
brett linzey -- vertical research partners -- analyst
no doubt. very strong start. want to come back to the order book, is the uptake you're seeing driven by existing customers replacing equipment, or are you seeing new customer engagements driven by products or some of the front end commercial processes? thanks.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
it's a combination -- new customer acquisition, but also the replacement cycle, especially in the awp segment. there was a deep reading last year, utilizations improving. they're beginning to build back their fleets. and we think -- if you just look at the replacement cycle for the genie business for what's coming forward, there's a strong run ahead for that business. we're going to have to end it at this time. so, we can stop right at the top of the hour. we know you all have other calls this afternoon. so, i would just want to say thank you for your interest in terex.
and a public announcement, covid-19 safety remains a priority for us here at terex. we're continuing to follow the safety protocols. and i would strongly encourage all of us to be vaccinated when the opportunity presents itself. we no longer have a supply issue. we have a demand issue with the vaccine. so, we're working hard to convince our team members to receive the vaccine, so we can move to the other side of this pandemic

greetings and welcome to the terex corporation first quarter 2021 results conference call. a brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [operator instructions]
it is now my pleasure to introduce your host randy wilson, director of investor relations for terex corporation. thank you, sir. you may begin.
randy wilson -- director-investor relations
good morning, and welcome to the terex first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. a copy of the press release and presentation slides are posted on our investor relations website at investors.terex.com. in addition, the replay and slide presentation will be available on our website. i'm joined by john garrison, chairman and chief executive officer; and john duffy sheehan, senior vice president and chief financial officer. their prepared remarks will be followed by q&a.
please turn to slide two of the presentation, which reflects our safe harbor statement. today's conference call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied. in addition, we will be discussing non-gaap information that we believe is useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. reconciliations for these non-gaap measures can be found in the conference call materials.
please turn to slide three, and i'll turn it over to john garrison.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning and thank you for joining us and for your interest in terex. most importantly, i hope you and your families are remaining safe and healthy. throughout these challenging times, we are proud of all terex team members who are keeping themselves and others safe, meeting the needs of customers and helping our communities. i would like to recognize and thank our team members around the world for their continued commitment toward zero harm safety culture and terex way values. safety remains a top priority in the company, driven by think safe, work safe, home safe. all terex team members have contributed to our effort to continue to produce for our customers, while following the protocols and maintaining a safe working environment.
please turn to slide four. before i discuss our q1 results, i would like to review our commitment to esg. environment, social and governance is not a new concept at terex. it has been front and center for many years through our zero harm safety program and our commitment to maintaining a vibrant and supportive working environment. esg is foundational to the terex culture. our company purpose is to help improve people's lives. through our terex way values, we are focused on strong governance, a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion at every level and supporting the communities where we live and work, including being responsible, environmental stewards. first, strong governance and leadership. our independent and engaged board with diverse backgrounds, perspectives and experience adds value for all stakeholders. second, we've enhanced our de&i governance and we are energized by the engagement of our team members. and third, electrification, by interview using sustainable products, such as our new genie electric drive scissors.
we've made good progress in our sustainability program, including publishing our first annual esg report, which enhances our esg communications. we're working on standard reporting frameworks, which a group of company senior leaders are charged with implementing. we will keep stakeholders apprised through our investor conferences and quarterly earnings calls. we believe companies that recognize the importance of esg are better able to identify strategic opportunities and meet competitive challenges. turning to slide five. we're off to a very strong start to 2021. customer demand continued to increase during the quarter, resulting in revenues exceeding our expectations. we increased operating margins and backlog in awp and mp year-over-year. we significantly improved our first quarter earnings per share compared to last year, and we are increasing our full year sales, operating profit, cash flow and eps outlook. despite having to address supply chain challenges, awp delivered improved margins in q1. materials process continued its strong execution by overcoming supply disruptions and delivering increased sales and profitability. as a result of the improved execution in both segments, year-over-year operating margins of the company improved by 800 basis points. our intense focus on net working capital management and improved profitability drove $40 million of positive free cash flow in the quarter, which is an excellent start to the year.
during the first quarter, our team continued to meet increased customer demand, tightly managed all costs and delivered outstanding positive free cash flow. overall, our q1 financial performance demonstrated strong execution by our global team in the face of increasing supply chain challenges. please turn to slide six. we continue to improve terex's global cost competitiveness. our sg&a cost reduction initiative, with a target of full year 2021 of approximately 12.5% or better sg&a to sales remains on track. we are maintaining strict cost discipline. in addition, during the quarter, we announced the plan move of our oklahoma city telehandler production to monterrey, mexico. this action will position us with cost competitive telehandler products to the north american market. the team is addressing increasing supply chain disruptions. our operations team are demonstrating adaptability and flexibility to overcome the dynamic supply chain environment. turning to innovation. we continue to listen to our customers, ensuring our products and services offer the features and benefits that provide value. we'll also invest in our connected assets and digital capabilities to better serve customers.
for example, our new genie e-drive scissors are designed to offer significant performance improvement and reduce maintenance cost by 35% over the life of the machine. customer and dealer integration, or cdi, is a global initiative spearheaded by our parts and service organization. dealers are sharing their data, which allows the team to better serve customers. finally, we continue to invest for future growth. our mp team is in the process of executing a localization plans in china to meet growing demand for industry-leading crushing and screening products, as it is the world's largest aggregate market. terex is well-positioned for growth in 2021 and beyond, because we have strong businesses, strong brands and strong market positions. we continue to invest including a new products, digital capabilities and manufacturing capacity.
turning to slide seven. i'll provide some comments about our end markets and what we are seeing today. in our genie business, in north america, fleet utilization continues to improve, rental rates are improving, used equipment pricing is strong, which are all positive signs of a recovering and growing rental industry. in europe, the market continues to demonstrate improvement, and in china, adoption of working safely at height with genie equipment is driving significant growth. globally, the secular trend toward rental continues. turning to our utilities business. demand is strong across its end markets of tree care, rental and investor owned utilities. next, the materials processing. we expect global demand for crushing and screening equipment to continue to grow. broad-based economic growth, construction activity, and aggregates consumption are the primary market drivers. we're seeing continued improvement in our cement mixer, material handler and environmental businesses. overall, we're seeing improved market conditions around the world for our industry-leading products and solutions.
and with that, let me turn it over to duffy.

thanks, john. turning to slide eight. looking at the first quarter, we achieved net sales higher than our expectations. throughout the quarter, we saw our end markets continue to strengthen. overall, revenues of $864 million were up 4% year-over-year. notably, our materials processing segment's revenues were up almost 20% year-over-year. for the quarter, we recorded an operating profit of $62 million compared to an operating loss of $7 million in the first quarter of last year. we achieved an operating margin of over 7% through disciplined cost control and meeting strengthening customer demand. the first quarter operating profit includes severance and charges associated with the closure of our oklahoma city manufacturing facility, which were offset by the gain on the sale of our tfs on book financing portfolio. improved gross margins and lower sg&a as a percent of sales allow terex to expand operating margin by 800 basis points year-over-year. interest and other expense was approximately $4 million lower than q1 of last year, because of several factors, including lower interest expense and a $3 million mark-to-market gain recognized in other income.
our first quarter 2021 global effective tax rate was approximately 16%, driven by two favorable discrete items in the quarter. our tax rates estimate for the remainder of the year remains 19%, consistent with our previous outlook. finally, our reported eps of $0.56 per share includes the nearly offsetting operating impact and the favorable benefits in other income that i just discussed turning to slide nine, and our awp segment financial results. awp sales of $477 million were down 7% compared to last year, driven by a decline in north america, offset by improvement in europe and asia-pacific. the utilities market improved significantly evidenced by strong customer bookings. awp delivered significantly improved operating margins in the quarter, driven by increased production and aggressively managing all costs. awp delivered 680 basis points improvement in operating margin, which includes $3 million of severance and charges for the closure of our oklahoma city facility. first quarter bookings of $961 million were up to dramatically compared to q1 2020, while backlog at quarter-end was $1.3 billion, up 82% from the prior year.
now, turning to slide 10, and materials processing's q1 financial results. mp had another strong quarter, achieving 13% operating margins, as end markets are strengthening is a testament to the mp team's operational strength to deliver these consistent positive operating margins. sales were higher at $378 million, driven by improving customer sentiment across all end markets and geographies. the mp team has been aggressively managing all elements of cost, as end markets improve resulting in incremental margin performance of 38%. backlog of $713 million more than doubled from last year and was up 36% sequentially. mp saw its businesses strengthened through the quarter, with bookings up more than 100% year-over-year. customer sentiment in both segments continues to dramatically improve, as equipment is being utilized and ordered as end market demand strengthens turning to slide 11. i'd like to update you on how we currently anticipate the full year to develop financially. it's important to realize that while the end market demand environment has improved significantly, increasing supply chain headwinds are impacting results. we have taken these factors into consideration in the outlook we're providing today.
as for commercial demand, we have seen our end markets improved dramatically over the course of the first quarter. although, there are things being equal, we do expect continued and market improvement in both segments and increasing levels of awp customer's fleet replenishment. from a quarterly perspective, we expect revenues for the full year to be slightly higher in the first half than the second half of the year, with the second quarter being the strongest of the year. operationally, the absolute amounts of operating profit and operating margins are expected to increase each quarter year-over-year, with operating profit relatively evenly split between the first half of the year versus the second half of the year. we continue to plan for incremental margins, which meet or exceed our 25% target for the full year 2021. corporate and other costs will occur relatively evenly throughout the remainder of the year. on april 1st, we completed the refinancing of our revolving credit facility and unsecured bond. these transactions will result in q2 charges of $25 million, which were not previously included in our 2021 financial outlook. including $0.30 per share of costs for refinancing of our capital structure, our eps outlook is increased to $2.35 to $2.55 per share, based on sales of approximately $3.7 billion. quarterly earnings per share are expected to be generally consistent with the development of operating profits during the year. for the full year 2021, we are estimating free cash flow of approximately $150 million, reflecting another year of positive cash generation. we continue to plan for capital expenditures, net of asset dispositions of approximately $90 million. the largest project included in capital expenditures is for the genie mexico manufacturing facility john referenced earlier.
turning to slide 12, and i'll summarize our updated 2021 eps outlook. we expect the strong customer sentiment demonstrated in q1 by our awp and mp customers to continue throughout 2021. our 2021 full year eps outlook comprehends, first, our q1 outperformance. second, the operating profit contribution on additional revenue for q2 through q4. third, price and manufacturing efficiency, which is only partially offsetting increasing supply chain headwinds. and finally, reduced interest expense and one-time capital structure charges of approximately $27 million, representing $0.30 per share. overall, our 2021 outlook represents a significant improvement in operating performance when compared to 2020. we will continue to aggressively manage costs, while positioning the business for growth. turning to page 13, and i'll review our disciplined capital allocation strategy. our team members remain vigilant and will continue to aggressively manage production, especially within our awp segment and scrutinize every expenditure. the strong positive free cash flow of $40 million in the quarter demonstrates the hard work of our team members to tightly manage net working capital.
terex has ample liquidity of approximately $1.2 billion available to us, with no near term debt maturities. so, we can manage and grow the business. as discussed during the q1 earnings call, the proceeds from the sale of the tfs on book portfolio and our strong liquidity position allowed us to prepay $196 million of term loans in early february. this prepayment resulted in reducing outstanding debt, lowering, leverage, and saving annual cash interest expense of approximately $7 million. this deleveraging action resulted in a rating agency upgrading terex's outlook and providing positive momentum for refinancing our capital structure. our refinancing included successfully renewing our $600 million revolving credit facility and placing 600 million of new bonds with a 5% coupon. these new bonds replaced our 5.625% bonds due to mature in 2025 and reduce annual cash interest expense by approximately $4 million. importantly, terex obtained lower costs, unsecured funding for the remainder of this decade. this strong action demonstrates our commitment to improving terex balance sheet, while maintaining flexibility to execute on our organic and inorganic growth plans. finally, we would like to thank our bank group, which supported terex during this successful refinancing.
and with that, i'll turn it back to you, john.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, duffy. turning to slide 14, to wrap up our remarks. terex team members around the world are focused on the right things, safety, health, customers, and improve productivity. end markets are strong, and the team is managing the increasing supply chain headwinds. we're driving positive free cash flow. we're continuing to invest in innovative products to meet increased customer demand. we are focused on both organic and inorganic growth. as a result of these actions, terex is well-positioned to deliver strong 2021 results.
and with that, let me turn it back to randy.
randy wilson -- director-investor relations
thanks, john. as a reminder, during the question-and-answer session, we ask you to limit your questions to one and a follow-up to ensure we answer as many questions as possible this morning.
with that, i'd like to open it up for questions. operator?
",2021-Q1,TEX
1.0,,":
operator
your first question comes from mig dobre with baird.
mircea dobre -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
yes, thank you. thanks for taking my question. good morning.
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development & chief strategy officer
good morning, mig.
mircea dobre -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
so, i guess, where i'd like to start, in awp, the good order intake, you got about $1.4 billion of backlog, but obviously based on your updated guidance here, sales in the back half, expected to be only about $1.1 billion. you talked about the supply chain being challenging obviously and having some issues with parts availability, we heard back from one of your competitors as well. i guess, i'm wondering how much of this discrepancy backlog versus second half revenue is driven by this element as opposed to just customer deliveries being scheduled into '22 and showing up in the backlog at this point?
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development & chief strategy officer
yeah, thanks mig, for the question. i would say almost all of the deliveries for -- in the awp group, now specifically genie, really are our result of the supply chain disruptions that we're seeing in production schedules sliding as a result of the disruptions that we are seeing. our teams staying in very close contact and we can talk more about that on the supply side and with customers, but i would say most of that is a result of the supply chain disruptions and sliding up production schedules, as it pertains specifically to the genie business.
mircea dobre -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
i see, ok. and then looking at slide 11, you detailed $0.10 of cost pressure there. by my math, this is what we call it $8 million, $9 million of pressure. to me, at least that seems like a relatively low number, given your revenue base and all the things that are happening out there. can you give us a sense for what's behind it in terms of how you came up with this figure? and is this sort of a number that we can carry into next year, or are there things that can mitigate this cost pressure if we think about '22? thank you.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
so i'll start there mig, it's duffy, and we certainly have mounting inflationary material cost pressures over the course of this year. if you go back to q1 and our updated outlook at the end of q1, we had included about $0.55 of cost pressure at that time. and since then -- and that was really mostly steel related, but we've seen the inflationary cost pressure expand to other products such as resin based products, freight, other commodities and so we're as a team, we're working hard to mitigate those price increases by suppliers and so the $0.10 a share that you see outlined on chart 11 represents our best estimate at this point in time of the amount that would be -- need to be absorbed in order to meet production in the second half of the year.
to your, the second part of your question about 2022. certainly we talked in q1, and it certainly continues to be true here at the end of q2, is that where our price cost for 2021 is not level, is negative. we didn't reprice the backlog when we increased prices in the first quarter of the year. and so as we go into 2022, it certainly would be our objective to be price cost neutral. and that will of course depend upon what develops with respect to material cost during the second half of 2021.
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development & chief strategy officer
thanks mig. operator, next question.
operator
your next question comes from the line of nicole deblase with deutsche bank.
nicole deblase -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yeah, thanks, good morning, guys.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi. good morning nicole.
nicole deblase -- deutsche bank -- analyst
can we just talk a little bit about more -- a little more about the supply chain constraints? so what i'm curious about is, has this actually caused production stoppages whether it's rolling like days where you have to send people home or have you guys been able to produce? and maybe similar question, like do you have excess equipment kind of sitting on the line in sort of finish mode waiting for like a few components that comes through before it can be shipped?
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development & chief strategy officer
thank you, nicole, and great question. so the supply chain disruption that we're experiencing, and again we're not unique as a global manufacturer, as demand is dramatically increased, a year ago we were staring at it the best, and now we're -- now we get some questions about the market, but the market demand has been quite strong. what is happened is a global integrated supply chain, there has been disruptions rolling in that supply chain as a result of covid, that coupled with disruptions in global logistics, both sea mains, airfreight and ground freight have created deliberately challenges for us.
so what our teams have to do is they have to decide what parts are going to be available and then make the schedule. in many cases, exactly as you indicated, nicole, we will build a unit and put it out, what we call it into the hospital and then bring the unit back in when the parts arrive.in terms of absolute plant shutdowns, we have not experienced that. the team has done a great job of managing this, but we have had to shut value streams down for a couple of days, awaiting parts, a lot of overtime, as you can imagine, on the rework and it impacts our productivity, but the team is focused on meeting the needs of the customer, overcoming this disruption and the supply chain will continue to improve.
but as we look forward over the next 2 quarters, quarter to 2, we are seeing this level of disruption on a day-to-day basis. but our team is doing a masterful job of overcoming, but it does impact our ability to ship and it does impact of our cost position in terms of our labor productivity. so yes, we are doing that literally around the globe. the team can figure out what we can build, we build it, and sometimes we build it partially and have to bring it back into the shop, back into the line, put on the parts and then ship it. and again, the team did a great job in the second quarter. over time we think this is going to improve, but that is the world that we're operating in today from a supplier disruption and supplier uncertainty standpoint.
nicole deblase -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. thanks, john. that was really helpful. and maybe just as a follow-up on the sg&a guidance, taking it down to 11.75%. i guess, what is the biggest driver of that, is that anything to do with the temporary cost cuts not coming back as quickly or maybe just return to work happening slower, just trying to get a sense of -- if we should be expecting a return to the 12.5% target as we move into 2022?
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
so, thanks nicole. and i think there's two factors that go into the sg&a, i think movement versus our guidance since the beginning of the year. the first is, obviously in the top line revenue that is the denominator and the calculation has increased, which brings the percentage down. that said, as we went into the year, the incentive compensation was planned at 100% of achievement, or let's call it target, and with the increase in our outlook for the year, we are accruing incentive compensation for the team at above target levels, which increases the amount of sg&a. in fact, the absolute increase in sg&a is virtually 100% attributable to increased incentive compensation. and i think that's important to note because we're really treating sg&a for this year as a fixed cost. and irrespective of the revenue increasing other than the incentive compensation, which we would owe under the plan, we're not the -- the team is maintaining really strict, quite disciplined. out in future periods, to your point about in the future, in future periods, i do believe that there will be investment that will be required to grow our business and to maintain the customer relationships, to invest in systems, but our objective is to continue to be at 12.5% sg&a or lower. and i would expect that if we are looking at a positive commercial environment, demand environment again in 2022 that we would be on the lower end of our target.
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development & chief strategy officer
thanks, nicole. operator, next question.

next question comes from the line of david raso with evercore isi.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi, thank you for taking the time. john, for you to pass the baton on to simon at awp, obviously in the second quarter margins are pretty strong. you obviously had gained comped time for you, to sort of back away from that role and obviously confidence in simon to move forward but curious given how big the backlog is right now, extending into '22 more than we normally would see right now? if you have to frame, how you think about, what you know from visibility, but also how you left the business the condition it was in. if we had to think about incremental margins for awp next year, how should we think about that?
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development & chief strategy officer
thanks, david. well, first, the entire genie team have done an incredible job. actually across terex, the team has done an incredible job dealing with the uncertainty and the challenges associated with the pandemic. and so, simon is the right leader, as i said in my prepared comments, got a great team at genie and they have got a strategy in place to drive improved operating performance in our genie business. to expect that at the macro level, the secular trends, david, as you know, in the rental industry are positive, and we can talk about the positive nature of the replacement cycle that's forthcoming. so we think there's a strong market environment coming forward with the awp team, simon and the team are implementing a strategy to continue to drive improvement so that we're globally cost competitive as we compete in a global marketplace for the aerial business. and we're going to continue to drive margin improvement in our operations, in our sales and marketing and our product development offerings, all driving toward david, we're not going to back away from at least a 25% incremental margin improvement in the business. and it's a business that can continue to drive over time, can continue to drive margin improvements, so that we consistently deliver double-digit operating margins in the business. we are not there right now, as you look through the quarter, the seasonality is not going to change, but over time, that's what we're focused on as a team is to drive the margin in that business consistently to the double-digit range.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
and regarding the increased visibility on '22, just trying to quantify that a bit. and of course if you can give us any insights on the mix geographically pricing on the new equipment, the product type, i just feel the backlog is huge. i mean normally this time of year, the backlog for awp is anywhere from 40% to say 60% of the second half awp revs, right now, it's a 130% of what you're guiding. so obviously that's a huge incremental visibility for the following year. so again, hoping, if you have any color you can give us on that extra visibility of what it looks like?
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development & chief strategy officer
thanks, david. and you're right, i mean the -- we are absolutely encouraged by the strength that we are seeing across our awp business utilities, for that matter as well david. but if you look at north america, you asked about customer mix, we're seeing strength across our business utilities for that matter as well, david. but if you look at north america, you asked about customer mix, we're seeing strength across our independents and the national accounts product mix. we're not seeing any fundamental change in the product mix and growth that we've seen in terms of our backlog and orders in north america.likewise, david, in western europe, we've seen a nice strong recovery there from an order standpoint. again, nothing is substantially different in terms of customer or product mix, china didn't get like the western part of the world did and so we'll continue to experience growth in china. and china for us it's primarily a blue market, so that's what we're seeing there.
and in terms of the visibility david, yes, the backlog is great. as we go into 2022 and we're having those conversations now. i mean, customers are buoyant, they're seeing strong utilization, they're seeing improving rates, they're seeing strong used equipment values and more engaging in the conversations for 2022 and we're starting to have the pricing conversation in the -- and our price cost of the year, hasn't been what we would like to have and we're going to -- need to get an improved price cost ratio given the material increases that we're seeing as we are moving forward to 2022. now david, the backlogs are huge because we couldn't produce, that will be a '21 pricing, the commitment to deliver '22 products will be at 2022 pricing and that work is underway. operator, next question.

your next question comes from the line of stephen volkmann with jefferies.
steve volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
can you hear me ok?
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, we can hear you fine. okay, sorry, my stand line. so question on mp actually. can you just provide a little more color on sort of specifically which of your mp product lines are strongest and where the demand was robust there? and then, i have a quick follow-up on margin. sure, i'll take the demand and duffy, you can comment on the margin side as we go. but stephen, the good news is, we're seeing strong global momentum really across our businesses, our product lines, within the mp business and really across the globe. on the core crushing and screening business, we saw significant growth in orders, our dealers, our inventory levels are low, there is high utilization on their rental fleets and they are ordering back and again across our product portfolio and aggregates and again across the globe, we've seen strong orders. in our concrete business, which is our terex advanced concrete trucks, very strong growth in that segment associated with the residential construction that we're seeing in the u.s. so that business has rebounded quite strongly.our materials handling business, our fuchs business. so one of the only positives of high steel prices is that we're seeing high scrap steel prices. a big part of that business services that market. and we've seen that globally recover in terms of orders in backlog. we're also investing in new products and capacity expansion to branch out into other segments. but again, the fuchs business has recovered quite nicely. our environmental business within mp, that's a newer business for us. and again, we're seeing really strong growth there. again, western europe, north america, asia pacific, where we're seeing growth across that business. our pick & carry business down in australia and australia really weathered the pandemic pretty well. and we're seeing strong order activity and consistent order activity through the pandemic in our pick & carry business. and last but not least, our rts and tower business, especially in the european area, we saw some good recovery in strength with orders. and last but not least, despite the significant covid challenges in india, we've seen strong orders and strong bookings in india as they come out of the depth of the pandemic. so as we look at the mp business, stephen, we see strong growth across the product portfolio and literally across the globe. so we're pleased with what we're seeing on the demand side for the mp. you had a question about the margin?
steve volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
just a follow-up.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, go ahead.
steve volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
yeah. so obviously very big margin in the second quarter, but then it's a step down, i guess, in the second half. just with the right way longer term, is this a mid double-digit kind of margin, is this going forward? or was there something special in the second quarter?
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
no, i think that if you look back over the last 4 quarters for our materials processing segment, they demonstrated maybe not full mid-double -- mid-teens margins, but certainly, let us call it in the 13% to 15% range. i think that as you noted the second half of the year does reflect the uncertainties surrounding supply chain disruption and material costs that is bringing it slightly down below the 13%, i just referenced. but still there are consistent double-digit margin, consistent in the teams performer and we would expect that to continue in 2022 and beyond.
steve volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
all right. thank you.
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development & chief strategy officer

your next question comes from the line of jerry revich with goldman sachs.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes, hi, good morning, everyone.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
john now that the turnaround of awp is complete, can you just talk about your strategic priorities from here and if the answers capital deployment toward m&a, maybe just give us a bit more on the parameters that you're looking at and the pipeline if about -- if that's the biggest focus from here?
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks jerry. well, again the team, we have work to be done at our genie business and i'm confident in our genie team to continue to execute the strategy that we have going forward. but your broader question is a really good one, as we look at our disciplined capital allocation, that we've been focused on the last several years. one was to improve the cash flow capabilities of the business and we've done that. second was to improve our balance sheet, we paid further pay down debt this quarter after paying down debt in the first quarter as well. so our balance sheet is in really good shape, good cash flow generation.
so now we're looking at how do we grow the business via inorganic activities. we do believe that there will be opportunity in that area, to deploy capital to grow. specifically, we're looking in and around our mp businesses, jerry, if you look at the market verticals that we compete in, there is still a pretty high degree of fragmentation in those specialized equipment and specialized markets around the mp segment. so we're building a pipeline there. we believe in the utilities area given what's needed around the world for electrification, that there is opportunities in the utility space and then also on lifecycle solutions. so we are building a pipeline as, again we did two transactions here in the second quarter. so we're standing up the pipeline to deploy capital for inorganic growth. we think the business is positioned now for us to be able to do that and we're actively pursuing things in those three areas that i just spoke, and i will say we're going to be very disciplined about it, but we absolutely believe there's going to be opportunities for growth via inorganic.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. and separately, in the last steel inflation cycle, one steel inflation slowed, you folks essentially wound up getting pricing that made you whole on the cycle. so can you talk about the plan here? so as we think about what '22 pricing actions will look like, will you look to fully recap the price cost headwinds from this year in your initial '22 pricing? or anything that's changed in the industry structure or otherwise that would prevent you from doing what you did in the last cycle?
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, across all the businesses, we're being transparent with our customers and our distributors about the input costs we're seeing. we did, as duffy said, take some pricing action, continue to take pricing action. we will work to offset the material cost increases that we're seeing to include steel in our 2022 pricing and at least the price cost neutrality, whereas this year was -- as duffy said, we're a bit upside down in price cost. so as we go forward, we will look to offset those cost increases with pricing actions.
and again it will vary, jerry by business, by region around the world. but the strategy is we provide value-added products that provide significant value over a duration of a lifetime for our customers and we do have to pass on the cost that we cannot absorb and that's what we're going to be working on. very difficult conversations, i know that, but that's what we need to do going forward because we're having those same difficult conversations with our suppliers and we're pushing back hard on their cost increases that they trying to pass on to us. some of them them we're going to have to accept and we're going to have to pass that through to our customers and they're going to have to pass it to their customers. that's just the nature of the cycle, i think, that we're in right now and it's not going to be easy, but that's what we need to do.

your next question comes from steven fisher with ubs.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
great, thanks. hi, good afternoon. just on the supply chain.
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development & chief strategy officer
good afternoon, steven.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
hey guys. i know there is a real high degree of uncertainty here on the supply chain, but john, do you have any thoughts on when is really the kind of peak pain point for this? and when we could start to see some improvements there? i couldn't tell from your earlier comments, if you're already seeing signs that it's getting better or if it's just an expectation that at some point it will get better.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
so that's a great question. i'm chuckling, peak pain, it just depends on what day and what product or what supplier, but no, it is going to get better. i mean if the system gets back in sync, the logistics system is creating a big disruption right now and that's going to work itself out. we ended up with containers in the wrong place, ships in a wrong place, no ability to air freight, that's starting to improve, so on the logistic side, it's going to take some time to get everything back in balance. so that is going to improve.
every supplier in the chain is doing the same thing, we're trying to do, which is they are highly motivated to meet our needs, so that we can meet our customer needs. i've been personally engaged with ceos in the supply chain, tier 1 down to tier 4, we're all working on the same thing. our teams are working hard to mitigate the disruption, to produce what we can produce and get back to what i would call, normal operations.
in terms of when that exactly happens, i think we're going to be in this challenging period of time for the next couple of quarters, because the other thing is, we're a manufacturer. we need a 100%, one part missing, we can't ship. so even though if i improve to 99, i need that final part before i can ship and that's where we're focused on as a team. so it is going to get better. everybody in the system is highly motivated to continue to drive the improvement, it's just going to take time as this global integrated supply chain, its was like a swiss watch, it got stopped, and now its starting back up and we're experiencing disruptions, our suppliers are working hard. our teams are doing incredible work to build what we can build as efficiently as we can build it and it is going to get better, when exactly? i don't know, but i'm absolutely confident that it will get better over the next couple of quarters.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
steve, if i was to just give you a couple of data points. the supply chain is getting better and if you just measure it in terms of production for example at our genie business, the production in q2 of this year was more than double q2 of last year and increased every quarter between q2 of last year and q2 of '21. but when you look at the production we had in the second quarter, it was still only say 60% of the production we had in quarter -- the mid quarters of q2 and q3 of 2018, and our backlog is higher than we had in 2018. so demand increased exponentially overnight and our ability to ramp up production from components, from suppliers to be able to ramp up our production, to meet that overnight demand, has been what the challenge is.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
very helpful. and then just a follow-up in terms of the size of acquisitions, you guys have done a great job with cash flow and the balance sheet and you'll have flexibility on doing some bigger deals if you wanted to. so can you maybe just give us any color on the range of sizes of deals you consider? or are the things available in your sites more just smaller bolt-ons?
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development & chief strategy officer
yeah. so thanks for the question and given our improved balance sheet and our low leverage, especially as we continue to drive free cash flow and debt down, we will look at transactions and really look at our, where does our endpoint leverage end up and we haven't changed, we're consistent in that 2.5 times net debt-ebitda, kind of through the cycle. so that would be the gauge that could give an indication of what we would be willing to or are comfortable taking on more debt for the size of this transaction. so it does give us some flexibility in terms of size. and we will, again, we're going to be very disciplined, but i feel good about our capabilities, our balance sheet capabilities, cash flow capabilities to do things larger than the 2 small transactions that we've done. but think about the 2.5x net debt through ebitda through the cycle, and that will give you a range to think about. that's how we're thinking about it. thanks, steve. operator, next question.

hi, good morning. most of my questions have been answered, just one. can you just talk to within the aerial work platform side just with all the material costs and pricing that we're trying to get through? can you talk about the competitive environment and whether you're seeing everyone sort of act rationally so that or are we trying to go for potentially market share? and then, just one quick follow-up on the backlog for awp, what is the dollar amount associated with backlog going into 2022? thanks.

yeah. thanks, jamie. so the pricing dynamics in the industry, especially in the western part, north america and europe, the pricing dynamics, i believe are rational in that we are all experiencing material cost inflations and we're all having those challenging conversations with customers about the need to seek pricing. the only potential exception to that jamie, i will say the pricing dynamics inside of china are quite aggressive and sometimes there is some pricing dynamics there that frankly we just won't participate in. and so i would say rational reasonable competition is what we're experiencing in the western part of the world, north america and europe, asia as well. within the confines of china, we're seeing some pricing at times that you would have to say that's not rational. and so that's the pricing dynamics as of now. duffy?
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
in terms of awp backlog at the end of q2, the total segment backlog was about $1.4 billion. i would say that $200 to $300 million of that represents amounts that would be for deliveries. based upon the second half outlook that we provided would be deliveries in 2022 and i would say most of that represents carry over from 2021. we will certainly be seeking to increase our production throughout the second half of this year and accelerate the delivery to customers into 2021, if at all possible.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
the only thing, i would add on that jamie, is that it does include our utilities business and some of the utilities business is actually called it out in 2022, but that would be at 2022 pricing that's not unnatural for the utilities business, there are some longer lead vehicles in that segment, within awp.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay, thank you.
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development & chief strategy officer
thanks. operator, next question.
operator
your next question comes the line of ross gilardi with bank of america.
ross gilardi -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning, guys. good afternoon.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, ross.
ross gilardi -- bank of america -- analyst
thanks. you guys have done a great job of turnaround the free cash flow. i mean it looks like your conversion this year from ebitda that your mid-point of the guidance is going to be a little bit, a bit above 50%. do you think that's a reasonable way to look at it going forward? or is there another sort of conversion metric that you think might be appropriate, more appropriate?
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. so thanks for recognizing our our free cash flow generation, ross and you in particular has been a proponent for us, getting better in that area. and so, quite honestly, making me better. i think it's important when you -- in the comments i provided prepared remarks, i provided right of $200 million, there is a free cash flow outlook for the year. there is $75 million that represents our recovery of amounts -- tax amounts from prior years that amount that we had hit from europe that had been outstanding for some time, as well as income tax refunds, carrybacks in the united states as a result of tax losses in the u.s. last year that we were able to carry back, those 2 combined are about $75 million of the $200 million. we're going to continue to have maximize free cash flow every single year and so ostensibly our free cash flow target for the business is over the cycle is a 100% of net income and in some years, we've done better than that, like last year, for example, but we are absolutely i assure you focused on free cash flow generation, which allows us then to use that free cash flow to grow the business organically and organically.
ross gilardi -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, thanks. that was helpful. and then can you talk a little bit more about this utilities business and the drivers there? and if you've been in the business for a while and it's done well by you. but can you give us a sense of how big it is within awp? and just how sustainable those growth drivers are? randy, you talked about ev infrastructure and so forth, but just really more like the every day drivers of the business more like utility maintenance type activity for?
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development & chief strategy officer
so, thanks. utilities is about 400 million and we think it's a business that can grow part of the reason we made a substantial investment in watertown was to have the capacity to grow. the underlying fundamentals and dynamics, especially in north america, but it really expands beyond north america, the utility sectors are our strong. the reality of it is there needs to be investment in the electric grid to accomplish any of the electrification that we're talking about, and that electric grid is distribution to the house as well as clients transmission. and so there is substantial investment required in one, maintaining the electric grid and two, building out the electric grid.
the other thing that's helped with the unfortunate situation out in california, is that the -- what we call as the maintenance side free care, vegetation management that has really caused utilities and regulators to ensure that they're making the appropriate investment in vegetation management and the appropriate investment in the grid, so that you don't end up with a situation like they have had it in pg&e. and so the underlying fundamentals of the utility business we think are quite strong and are going to be quite strong for some period of time.
that also coupled with the 5g investment level. if you put a 5g repeating tower and they -- and especially in rural america, that's going to have to go most likely on top of electrical poles. if it has to go on top of an electric, pole has to be an insulated system, that's what we specialize in it at terex utilities. so we think that gives us an opportunity for growth and then we also are -- we've been in china. we've had some success which with china grid, we're localizing some of our production for the china market.
so the utilities area, we think is a strong area that we can grow organically. but we also think there's going to be some opportunities especially as we work globally around the world because it is not dissimilar in other parts of the world as it is in north america that that business a segment that we want to be in that can provide excellent growth and excellent returns going forward. so again, we've made a sizable investment in our utilities business and the team is working hard to ensure we get return with the capacity out there we need going forward in that business. so it is a business we like, it's a business we have been best and if opportunity presents itself, it will be a business that we continue to invest in. thanks, ross. operator, last question.
operator
will be from steve barger with keybanc capital markets.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets. -- analyst
hey, thanks guys for squeezing me in. with 3q being the strongest revenue quarter, should we think that both segments will see sequential increases from 2q? or will regional shutdowns or anything else cause that not to happen for one segment?
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
sequential increase in regional revenue, right?
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets. -- analyst
right.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yes, yes and the answer to that question is generally yes, probably more so in the awp segment than the mp segment.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets. -- analyst
got it. and, and the outlook suggest the margin steps down in both segments in the back half. are the supply chain impacts or parts availability issues evenly distributed across the 2 segments or is one more effective than the other?
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
i would say more evenly the genie businesses is a faster cycle time business, higher volume. and so if we do have a disruption there, it does impact it, but across the globe in our mp business, they are experiencing disruption as well, again, doing a great job overcoming it, but little bit slower tat time on those. so they have the opportunity to make it up a little bit better than genie just given the tat time of the 2 assembly operations.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets. -- analyst
got it, thanks for the time.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
absolutely, thanks, steven.
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development & chief strategy officer
thank you. if you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to randy. thank you for your interest in terex and i sign off with all my team members to be safe and stay healthy. thank you.

operator
greetings and welcome to the terex corporation second quarter 2021 results conference call. [operator instructions] a brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
it is now my pleasure to introduce your host, randy wilson, director of investor relations for terex corporation. thank you sir, you may begin.
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development & chief strategy officer
good morning, and welcome to the terex second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. a copy of the press release and presentation slides are posted on our investor relations website at investors.terex.com. in addition, the replay and slide presentation will be available on our website. i'm joined by john garrison, chairman and chief executive officer; and john duffy sheehan, senior vice president and chief financial officer. their prepared remarks will be followed by q&a.
please turn to slide 2 of the presentation, which reflects our safe harbor statement. today's conference call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied. in addition, we will be discussing non-gaap information that we believe is useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. reconciliations for these non-gaap measures can be found in the conference call materials.
please turn to slide 3, and i'll turn it over to john garrison. good morning and thank you for joining us and for your interest in terex. i will take a moment and emphasize once again the terex' actions are always guided by our values. we consistently act with integrity, operate with excellence and care for our team members, customers and communities. that is true every quarter, but it has been especially important in the past 18 months as the world have dealt with the unprecedented challenges brought on by the covid-19 pandemic. while risks remain many of the world's economies are moving forward. i would like to thank our team members around the world for their continued commitment toward zero harm safety culture and terex way values. safety remains the top priority in the company, driven by think safe, work safe, home safe. all terex team members have contributed to our effort to continue to produce and service equivalent for our customers, while following the protocols and maintaining a safe working environment.
i would like to offer my gratitude to our team members and distributors that worked through so many unique circumstances over the last year. we owe our results to the incredible efforts of our operations and parts team members, who kept our facilities running. our sales and service team members, along with our distributors have also gone above and beyond to meet the needs of our customers.
finally, we are proud to be a values based company with process leadership in environmental, social and governance practices. this past quarter we spend time speaking to some of our investors regarding esg. if you'd like to learn more about our initiatives, please see our investor relations website. we'd welcome the opportunity to speak with you regarding our esg program.
please turn to slide 4. now let me recap some of our results, which duffy will describe in greater detail. we continue to deliver positive results as the customer demand remained strong during the quarter. while revenues were below our expectations, due to supply chain challenges, limited production output, we increased operating margins and bookings in both awp and mp dramatically year-over-year. we significantly improved our second quarter earnings per share, compared to last year and we are increasing our earnings and free cash flow outlook for full year 2021.
awp and mp continue to effectively manage supply chain disruptions. as a result of the strong execution in both segments, second quarter 2021, operating margins, improved dramatically to 11.8% for the company, with both segments, delivering double-digit operating margins. this represents a 170 basis point adjusted operating margin improvement on revenues, 20% lower than the second quarter of 2019. our intense focus on networking capital management and improved profitability drove $101 million of positive free cash flow in the quarter. and more than $140 million of free cash flow year-to-date.
during the second quarter, our team continued to respond to increased customer demand. effectively manage supply chain and logistics disruptions, tightly managed all cost and delivered improved margins, and outstanding positive free cash flow. our financial results demonstrate that our strategic priorities are working to improve the company and deliver positive financial results for shareholders.
please turn to slide 5. we delivered strong financial results as our strategic, operational priorities, of execute, innovate and grow, continue to make excellent progress. first we continue to improve terex' global cost competitiveness. we expect our sg&a as a percentage of sales to be below our target of 12.5% for the full year 2021. we are maintaining strict cost discipline while recognizing that growth in the business will necessitate investment spending.
in the first quarter, we announced the planned move of our oklahoma city telehandler production to monterrey, mexico. this action is on track and will reduce the cost of manufacturing of telehandler products for the north american market. the team is addressing continued supply chain disruptions, across various supply inputs and product lines. suppliers and logistics providers are currently working hard to ramp up and meet our production requirements and we are committed to meeting customer demand. our team members in both segments have worked hard to adapt and maintain production schedules.
turning to innovation. we continue to listen to our customers, ensuring our products and services at the features and benefits that provide value. we have also invested in our connected assets and digital capabilities to better serve customers. for example our new genie micro scissors increases on the job productivity. terex utilities recently introduced a new bigger gear for construction and maintenance of the electric grid and mp continues to develop, implement and rollout digital solutions, such as connected dealer inventory, telematics and e-commerce.
finally we are investing in inorganic opportunities for future growth. we recently completed two actions. first, we acquired a facility in china to localize production to meet increasing demand for our industry-leading mobile crushing and screening products and we are excited about the growth prospects in china. second, we completed a bolt-on acquisition, purchasing mds international, which is a well-established business of heavy duty aggregate trommels that broadens our product offerings. while this was not financially significant investment, it demonstrates our progress with inorganic growth, via bolt-on acquisitions, as we previously communicated. terex is well positioned for growth in 2021 and beyond because we have strong businesses, strong brands and strong market positions. we continue to invest, including a new innovative products, digital capabilities and manufacturing capacity.
turning to slide 6. the awp and mp segments continue to perform well, allowing us to capture the benefits from the positive market fundamentals that we are seeing. first in genie, the current market dynamics point to a multi-year replacement cycle for access equipment. the average age of fleet globally is increasing and customers need to replenish their fleets, so the replacement cycle is kicking in. we are beginning to see positive indicators for nonresidential investment as well as continued strong order activity. before wrapping up my comments regarding genie, i am pleased that we announced earlier this week that simon meester, was named president of genie. i thoroughly enjoyed working with simon and the genie team over the past year. simon is the right leader for the genie business.
turning to our utilities business. demand is strong across its end markets of tree care, rental and investor-owned utilities. in addition, we are experiencing strong growth in our utilities parts and service business.
next on materials processing. we expect global demand for crushing and screening equipment to continue to grow. broad-based economic growth, construction activity and aggregates consumption, are the primary market drivers. we are seeing strong markets for the cement mixer, material handling and environmental businesses. in addition, global monetary and fiscal stimulus programs has supported stronger demand in our end markets. overall, we are seeing robust market conditions around the world for our industry leading products and solutions.
with that, let me turn it over to duffy.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
thanks john. turning to slide 7. let's look at our second quarter results. overall revenues of $1 billion were up 50% year-over-year with both of our operating segments revenues up significantly. for the quarter, we recorded an operating profit of $123 million compared to only $7 million in the second quarter of last year. we achieved an operating margin of approximately 12% from disciplined cost control and fulfilling as much customer demand as possible, given the realities of the global supply chain during the quarter.
the second quarter operating profit does include $4 million of benefits from the release of a financing receivable reserve and the recording about that receivable related to prior years, offset by a $1 million charge for business impairment and restructuring. improved gross margins and lower sg&a as a percent to sales allowed terex to expand operating margin significantly year-over-year. interest and other expense was approximately $22 million higher than q2 of last year driven by $26 million of costs in connection with the refinancing of a significant portion of our capital structure, offset by $4 million in interest savings.
our second quarter 2021 global effective tax rate was approximately 17% driven by a mix of discrete items in the quarter. our tax rate estimate for the full year remains 19% consistent with our previous outlook. finally, our reported eps of $1.02 per share includes $23 million of interest charges and other callouts that i just discussed had amounted to $0.26 per share reduction in eps in the quarter.
turning to slide 8, and our awp segment financial results. awp sales of $595 million were up 44% compared to last year, driven by a dramatic improvement in all our global markets. the utilities market improved significantly as evidenced by strong customer bookings. awp delivered double-digit operating margins in the quarter, driven by increased production and aggressively managing all costs. second quarter bookings of $747 million were up dramatically compared to q2 2020 while backlog at quarter end was $1.4 billion, close to 3 times the prior year.
now turning to slide 9 and material processing's q2 financial results. mp had another great quarter. sales of $441 million were up 67% compared to last year, driven by strong customer sentiment across all end markets and geographies. the mp team has been aggressively managing all elements of cost as end markets improve, resulting in an operating margin above 15%. it is a testament to the mp team's operational strength to deliver these robust operating margins. backlog of $868 million more than tripled from last year and was up 22% sequentially. mp saw its business has strengthened through the quarter with bookings up approximately 160% year-over-year. customer demand in both segments is very positive. equipment is being ordered, utilized and serviced as end market demand continues to remain strong.
turning to slide 10. i will now review our updated financial outlook for the full year. this outlook takes into consideration the current end market demand environment as well as the supply chain headwinds that we have discussed today. as for commercial demand, we have seen our end markets remain robust over the course of the second quarter. all other things being equal, we expect continued end market strength in both segments over the remainder of the year and increasing levels of awps customer fleet replenishment. our full year revenue outlook is limited though as a result of the availability of components from our supply chain. from a quarterly perspective, we now expect revenues for the full year to be slightly higher in the second half than the first half of the year with the third quarter being the strongest of the year.
we continue to expect both our operating profits, and margins to increase each quarter year-over-year in 2021. however, as a result of commodity cost increases, outpacing, customer price increases, the absolute amount of operating profit in the second half of 2021 is expected to be lower than the actual operating profit achieved in the first half 2021. we continue to plan for total company incremental margins for the full year 2021, which meet or exceed our 25% target. as a result of positive first half callouts, corporate and other costs are expected to be slightly higher in the second half versus the first half of the year, including $0.26 per share of cost for refinancing of our capital structure and the other callouts in q2. our full year eps outlook is increased to $2.85 to $3.05 per share based on sales of approximately $3.9 billion.
quarterly earnings per share are expected to be generally consistent with the development of operating profits during the year. for the full year 2021, we are estimating free cash flow of approximately $200 million, reflecting a strong year on positive cash generation. full year free cash flow includes approximately $75 million from income and vat tax refunds, which are not expected to reoccur. during the first half of 2021, we received approximately $35 million of these refunds. we continue to plan for capital expenditures, net of asset disposition of approximately $90 million. the largest project, including capital expenditures is for the genie mexico manufacturing facility.
turning to slide 11. i will now summarize our updated 2021 eps outlook. we expect the strong customer sentiments demonstrated in q2 by our awp and mp customers to continue throughout 2021. our 2021 full-year eps outlook reflects first, our outperformance over the first half of the year. second, the operating profit contribution on additional revenue for q3 and q4. and third, net cost pressures from material cost headwinds. overall, our 2021 outlook represents a significant improvement in operating performance when compared to 2020. we will continue to aggressively manage costs while positioning our businesses for growth.
turning to slide 12. and i will review our disciplined capital allocation strategy. our team members remain vigilant and will continue to efficiently manage production and scrutinize every expenditure. the strong, positive free cash flow of $101 million in the quarter demonstrates the focus and discipline our team members continue to demonstrate to tightly manage net working capital. terex has ample of liquidity. we have over $1.1 billion available to us with no near-term debt maturities, so we can manage and grow the business. our strong liquidity position and cash generation allowed us to prepay $83 million of term loans during q2, which is in addition to the $196 million of term loans prepaid in early february. in addition, we continue to pay our quarterly dividend. we are committed to strengthen terex's balance sheet while maintaining flexibility to execute on our organic and inorganic growth plan.
and with that, john, i'll turn it back to you.
john l. garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, duffy. turning to slide 13, to wrap up our remarks. terex team members around the world are focused on the right things, safety, health, customers and improved productivity. end markets are strong and the team is managing supply chain headwinds. we are driving positive free cash flow, we are continuing to invest in innovative products to meet increased customer demand. we are focused on both organic and inorganic growth. as a result of these actions, terex is well positioned to deliver strong 2021 results.
with that, let me turn it back over to randy.
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development & chief strategy officer
thanks, john. as a reminder, during the question-and-answer session, we ask you to limit your question to one and a follow up, to ensure we answer as many questions as possible this morning. with that, i'd like to open up for questions. operator?
",2021-Q2,TEX
1.0,1.0,":
operator
thank you. your first question comes from david raso with evercore isi. please go ahead.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi. good morning congrats duffy.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
good morning david.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
my question is on the first half margins for awp. i know you don't want to give exact guidance. but just trying to think through i mean to be fair that your third quarter awp margins held up pretty well. you're implying the fourth quarter awp still is solidly profitable at 3.7. obviously we heard from a main competitor where maybe their margins are under a little more pressure than that. so i'll leave it open ended. can you at least help us how you're thinking about first year-over-year margins for awp when you think through what's in the backlog what you already have lined up your still cost anything from accounting you're of more fifo they're more lifo. just help us i think that's kind of the key people are just trying to figure out how much of a whole is the first half in awp earnings and how much the second half where it'll make sense that the price cost is better. but maybe your still cost depending how you purchased up or down year-over-year as well in the second half. so a lot in that question i'll let you answer that as you will?
john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks. thanks for the question david. and i'll start well first let's start at the top which is we are in a strong demand environment across the business that is especially within the awp segment as you see the rental companies are doing well. their techniques are increasing. we're entering into the -- we are under replacement cycle. we think that's going to be an extended cycle as we go forward. so the good news in the aerial business and i would say globally is that we are in a strong demand environment. so that is the good news. the challenge is like most manufacturers were experiencing input costs increases. we have been taking price actions and throughout 2021 but those those price actions were overtaken by material cost increase we've had. so in 2021 we've been price costs a negative in our awp segment. as we look to go into 2022 and we're in discussions with customers right now we're being very transparent with customer in terms of what we are seeing in terms of our input cost. the fact that we have not covered our input cost in our business in 2021. so we are taking price actions and what we believe david is from a price cost neutral standpoint that through the first half of the year we're still going to be underwater from price cost point and that's given the backlog that we have. we've had backlog that priced at 2021 was supposed to deliver in 2021 did not move into 2022 now.
so that backlog is at 2021 pricing. all other backlog will be 2022 pricing. so as we move through the year we believe that we're going to be a price cost negative in the first half of the year making progress but in the second half of the year and for the full year 2022 in our awp segment that includes both genie in our utilities business. we believe we can get to price cost neutral for the full year in that segment. and so that's what the teams focused on and that's what we need to do to drive continues to do customers and drive the margin improvements that u.s. investors expect us to deliver.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
i guess i would also just add david that i do -- i think john would agree with me that we do expect our awp segment to be solidly profitable in the first half of next year for sure. we're also going to continue to be very disciplined in the sg&a area as we've seen me here through the course of 2021. and so that i think the awp segment our leadership team there is extremely focused on continuing to bring the segment back to double-digit margins. i'm not saying in the first half of next year just in general they are very focused on restoring the business back to historical margin levels.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
yes. i think we're just trying to figure if you could maybe give a sense of should we expect sales up year-over-year but margins down because when you look at the fourth quarter even if you add back some fourth quarter 2020 the $11 million of onetime cost you still have margins that are 150 bits higher year-over-year implied for fourth quarter year-over-year. and i think people are just trying to understand should we think of the first half as at least hey the price cost is challenging enough and you don't have maybe the same year-over-year cost structure just as t&e comes back and a variety of things come back. that should we just think of it as probably down margins and high margins...
john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks david. there's a lot in there. and we're right in the middle obviously the planning cycle for 2022 and we don't want to give guidance for 2022 but again we believe the demand environment is going to be strong. and so it's not a demand issue at all. the ability to meet the demand will be a supply chain related and supply chain constraint related activity that that we're going to have to manage too. so that if you will will be the governor for 2022 and the team continues to focus on all aspects of cost to continue to drive margin improvement in all environments. and so the team is i can assure you they are laser focused on how do we drive margin improvement in that business going forward. and i'm confident that we can do that even in a challenging market environment like we saw this year.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
great.
john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
operator next question please.
operator
your next question comes from steve volkmann from jefferies. please go ahead.
steve volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
great. good morning everybody. duffy i'm tearing up a little bit here so all the best and thanks for putting up with us over the years here. and just to end on a great note i'm going to of pile on to david's question and see if i can ask you the different way. it feels like the major kind of swing factor for the first half in awp are going to be how much of the deliveries have 2021 versus 2022 pricing on one side and on the other side sort of how much have you been able to lock in costs like you did early in 2021? so maybe to ask this is sequentially i would assume some portion of first quarter deliveries have 2022 pricing in them. so sequentially is it reasonable to think that you'd have some modest amount of margin improvement pick 1q over 4q in awp?
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so thanks for that steve. and as john was explaining a few moments ago the supply chain is a very dynamic situation right at the moment. and so yes that's why you feel our reluctance to be really out with an outlook guidance with respect to q1 of 2022. we're really living quarter-to-quarter rate at the moment with the supply chain. john would tell you quite honestly that we're living week-to-week or day-to-day with suppliers. i do think that the that when you look at q4 to q1 that we expect is the business our awp segment which is where your focus is to remain solidly profitable and that would drive -- continue to seek to drive margin improvement. is exactly where the revenue will be to be able to say whether it will be higher or lower in terms of the margin in q1 of next year i think it's premature to say that?
john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
and again steve it's just a challenge right now but the great news is the demand environments there. it will really be driven by supply chain availability and as we continue to navigate through that there's an opportunity for good growth as we go into 2022.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
right. and i would encourage not to be just focused on one quarter to be very honest with you. we're playing for the long game here at terex and what we have said today and we are absolutely committed to not just john and i but the entire leadership team is being price cost neutral for the full year 2021 -- 2022 excuse me 2022. and i think that's what the important thing is. it's not about q1 it's about the full year.
steve volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
right? yes totally understand because as you know we're fans of the long game but you sort of have to figure out where the inflection is to get people comfortable with the longer game. so i understood around the supplier issues and we'll stay tuned there. just a quick follow up though on sg&a. john it felt like you were sort of saying something there about continued investments. do we continue to target that below 12.5%? is there some trend there that we should be aware of?
john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. no i think that this company will continue to take advantage of the growth in the top line while maintaining discipline in sg&a. we're very proud of being meaningfully below 12.5% sg&a to sales this year and i'm fairly confident that that will be the case maybe more than fairly i am confident that will be the case in 2022 also.

switching gears a little bit if we could just compare and contrast what's going on in material processing versus awps. you didn't have to take down your guidance for revenue. you're not talking about price cost in that segment. is that primarily because of where that business is geographic located or is there something more structural going on with the components of supply for aerials versus material processing? if you could help just break that the two businesses down and whether it's geographic or structural that'll be helpful?
john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks ann. and our mp segment as we indicated in our prepared remarks really had another strong quarter and they are very close to being price cost neutral in 2021. and we anticipate them the remaining price cost neutral for 2022. that's really driven by a couple of factors. i think the biggest factor ann is that about 75% of our mp business. and again mp is a collection of specialized equipment businesses goes through distribution channels. and so from the price cost endpoint with distribution we've been able to be more price dynamic if you will given the cost inputs that we've seen through the distribution channel. and that has clearly helped that business in 2021 and will continue to help that business in 2022. i would also say ann and one of the great things about the mp business is the diversification geographically. we've got a good geographical split in our mp segment and we've got a good diversification of businesses within the mp segment. and we're seeing some real strength in some of those businesses are aggregates. our business has been quite strong again globally our material handling business and one of the good things about high steel prices frankly the only thing is scrap steel prices are up which has really helped our material handling books business. so it is a diversified portfolio geographically by business while 75% going through the distribution channel and so that's a very different dynamic especially through the distribution channel when it's as compared to our awp segment.
ann duignan -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay. thank you. i appreciate that. and then just to pile on to backup the other questions maybe the question steve didn't get answered was what percent of your backlog for awps has 2021 pricing?
john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
so we talked about the overall percentage of backlog that was in that is at the end of september for awp. 70% of that backlog will be for delivery in 2022. but we have not broken out how much of that is with 20 -- of that 70% how much of it has 2021 pricing associated with it.
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development and chief strategy officer
great. thanks ann. operator next question.
operator
your next question comes from mig dobre from baird. please go ahead.
mig dobre -- baird -- analyst
good morning. congrats pretty sure you're going to miss these calls. so the way i would ask the same sort of questions that you've been asked as far as i just look at the orders that you've taken in the third quarter in awp so $981 million. clearly these are not for delivery in 2021. so is it fair to assume that they carry 2022 pricing?
john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. mig it's fair to assume that the majority of that backlog will carry 2022 pricing? it's just...
mig dobre -- baird -- analyst
i am kind of asking about the backlog i'm asking about the orders that you've taken in just to be clear?
john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. yes. that's a fair relationship. yes that's fair.
mig dobre -- baird -- analyst
okay. and then my recollection is that last quarter you had $300 million of backlog -- a backlog that you had in the second quarter that was going it get converted and delivered into the first 0.2. it looks like that number went up maybe another $50 million. how should we think about the sort of cost pressures that have developed here few months for disproportion of delivery? is it that we should be thinking that these deliveries are potentially approaching breakeven type margin as we are framing q1 or is it maybe a little bit better than that. and i'll end there. sorry for beating up this topic.
john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. the only thing i guess i say mig is when you look at our awp segment here in the third quarter or even the implied guidance for the fourth quarter. the business is solidly; the segment is set provably profitable and so is at the current level of cost inputs that especially like fourth quarter. if you look at the fourth quarter the business is solidly profitable and so we're going to continue to be solidly profitable. i don't think we're prepared to take today to say whether that's solidly profitable means 3% 5% 9% segment margin. but what i can tell you is the segment is going to continue to be solidly profitable and over the long run over the entire year we're going to be price cost neutral. and so our leadership team is driving hard for improving the price in the business to offset the inflationary cost inputs that we're experiencing.
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development and chief strategy officer
mig thank you. operator next question.

your next question comes from stanley elliott from stifel. please go ahead.
stanley elliott -- stifel -- analyst
good morning everyone. thank you for taking the question and duffy congratulations and best wishes.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks stanley.
stanley elliott -- stifel -- analyst
guys when you're thinking about the mp business you have done a nice job of driving that is still an incredibly highly fragmented industry. are there larger chunkier deals out there where you could pursue or would it be more of a bolt-on sort of focus as you're looking to expand that business?
john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. as we look if you look at the structure of our mp businesses and the businesses within mp it still remains fragmented. and so as we look to grow the business and the good news is with our free cash flow generation strengthening of the balance sheet we continue to invest organically in our mp business. in our campsie facility we did two small acquisitions in the quarter. we do believe that there are opportunities in the businesses within our mp segment that we can do some m&a activity. and bolt-on near adjacencies the funnel does have companies that are larger than the first two that we've done. and so as we look to grow the business we believe we can grow inorganically. and our initial focus really is in and around our mp businesses given the fragmentation in the businesses and given the opportunities we believe to grow that business especially around near adjacencies that we can utilize some of our existing distribution manufacturing to get some real operational synergies in that business. and so the two acquisitions are small the mds acquisition is small but we're already seeing the benefits of being able to put that product line through our global distribution channel. so we're excited about the growth opportunities that we have. would we like for larger ones so we can see some more meaningful growth? absolutely. and we're looking and our funnel is in terms of where we can invest that's an ongoing process as we go forward. so you could look for us to do some more things in and around that mp space when it comes to m&a. and the good news is we've got the cash flow; we've got the balance sheet now to do that.
stanley elliott -- stifel -- analyst
well actually you are right; you've done a nice job of improving the return on invested capital. how do you balance kind of the m&a versus maybe buying your shares back? i'm just curious how you think about that high level?
john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
right? so just from a macro level obviously would strengthen the balance sheet paid down another 150 million a debt here in october. continuing to -- capital we are investing organically in our business and we still believe we have the opportunity to invest via m&a activities. so we're deemphasizing share purchases over the last five six years will significantly reduce the amount of float outstanding. so from a share repurchase standpoint would deemphasize that looking more to the m&a but let me be clear we're going to be very disciplined in the m&a environment that we're in right now and valuations are to some extent elevated. and so what we disciplined there share repurchase we'll look to offset any incentive comp dilution with that and take advantage of market dislocations that occur through time. but again the good news is that a strong balancing strong cash flow it gives us optionality now on capital allocation and we reinstituted the dividend which for our investors is also important.
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development and chief strategy officer
thanks stanley. operator next question.
operator
your next question comes from nicole deblase from deutsche bank. please go ahead.
nicole deblase -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yes. thanks good morning and conga duffy.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you nicole.
nicole deblase -- deutsche bank -- analyst
maybe just starting with free cash flow kind of piggybacking off the last question that was something i was really impressed with this quarter especially since a number of your machinery peers have had weaker free cash flow as they've been holding excess inventory and response to the supply chain situation. so can you talk a little bit about the inventory position and to the extent what -- to what extent are you guys holding a lot of wip inventory and facility that's missing a couple components and waiting to go out to customers?
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. thanks nicole for recognizing the free cash flow. as john mentioned in our remarks right we've been free cash flow positive now six quarters in a row and we expect to be free cash flow positive in the fourth quarter. so our teams are really focused on disciplined management of networking capital. i probably to be honest would say that they would want more inventory available to them to be able to produce more products. but we have been managing the inventories the accounts receivables is quite honestly our past dues have never been lower than they are. over the last five years they have never been lower. so we're pleased with the networking capital management that we've had. we've also looked to make sure we're monetizing opportunities on our balance sheet. and that included for example the liquidation of our tfs portfolio and working with a third-party service provider there. so we've also collected a substantial amount of tax receivables that were outstanding. so team has just done a really good job of making sure that we're monetizing our balance sheet. and to the last question what that does is it drives up our return on invested capital. and that's what we're really focused on.
john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
and then just on the inventory side as duffy said given the demand environment we frankly want to have more inventory. our raw and whip inventory has increased and finished goods inventory has gone down. nicole just as you indicated we call them the hospital units. and those are the units that we partially complete we have to move off the line wait for the components to arrive bring them back on the line complete and then shift to our customers. and so that's part of the adaptability and the flexibility now that our supply chain teams are having to exhibit given the dynamic environment that we're in when it comes to the supply chain. so as duffy said frankly right now we would enjoy more raw whip and finished goods. the mix right now is a little bit too high to raw and whip because of the hospital inventory and would really like to have to be finished goods that we could shift immediately to customers. we don't have a lot of finished goods waiting for customers. when we complete it it's being shipped as soon as we can arrange the shipment and logistics.
nicole deblase -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. okay. thanks. that was really helpful. and just from a demand perspective i think we all know that the environment in north america for awp is super super strong. we can see the capex forecast that your customers have but can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing from europe and china?
john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so great question. and from a europe standpoint i would say it's very similar to the north american market. we're seeing really good order activity we're seeing backlog increase. so the european market is very similar to the north american market in terms of what we're seeing. china we had dramatic growth last year in china. so china i would say is a little bit flat year-over-year. again adoption continues but it had a pretty difficult cop compared to last year because that was the one market last year that we did see substantial year-over-year growth. so it's continuing in china but we have seen the growth slow again against the pretty difficult comp in china. and then the asia-pacific region we saw good growth. we're seeing growth pick up there as well. so really nicole it's strong global growth it's just not north american growth. and really that's across the portfolio. it's not just awp but it's also mp. and that's what's encouraging is the demand environment it's quite strong and as we work through these supply chain issues it's going to be a good environment. so the challenge is it's dynamic right now as it pertains to the supply chain.
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development and chief strategy officer
great. operator thank you. next question
operator
and your next question comes from steven fisher from ubs. please go ahead.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
thanks. good morning. so you guys talked about the pricing contribution for the second half of 2022 the improvement there and the price cost equation. what do you assume for the cost side in the second half there? mainly steel prices i presume. are you assuming that that they will be coming down or is just they are sort of going to be staying at a steady level based on some of your accounting treatment and you just get the price to cover it?
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes so we're obviously cognizant at the moment that steel prices have started to decline some. i'd say that as we go through the fourth quarter here we will finalize our plans. but at the moment we're assuming steel prices really in the hot roll coil in the $1800 range which is really where it was during the course of q3 and then coming down somewhat in the second half of 2022.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
okay. that's very helpful. and i guess you've done a lot of work on the supply chain already over the last few years. i'm wondering to what extent you think you need to redouble your efforts there expand the number of suppliers? and if you are do you think there is going to be any sort of quality issues coming out of the combination of new suppliers rushing production to get units out? are we going to need to be aware of higher warranty reserves you might be taking over the next few quarters?
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so as of now we're not seeing that obviously we have as part of our strategic sourcing initiative we have been changing suppliers and actually throughout the course of this year our supply chain teams have implemented supplier change over's in new suppliers which frankly has helped mitigate some of the significant increase in material costs that we're seeing. we're going to continue to do that. as i mentioned in my earlier comments our engineering teams are working with suppliers around electronic components. we're adjusting production schedules but in no way we have the same quality standards. and so it does not shift until it meets our quality standards. if you look at our genie quality by design that's key to the brand. and so there's no shortcuts on quality standards.now if there are quality issues does it create further disruption to your operation? yes it does. with no inventory in a channel if we end up with a quality issue on the line from a supplier that does impact us and we have to correct it but in terms of shipping out the answer is no we have a rigorous quality process throughout the businesses and it has to meet our quality standards before we shift to our customers.
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development and chief strategy officer
thanks steve. operator next question.

your next question comes from tim thein with citi group. please go ahead.
tim thein -- citi group -- analyst
great. thank you. good morning. hey all the best duffy. it's nice of you to hand over the keys to julie with the balance sheet like it is today versus one year inherited.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
tim thein -- citi group -- analyst
just first question is on the footprint moves that have been made in awp in terms of the telehandler's production moving to monterrey and closure of rock hill and i maybe leaving others out. should we think about that as i mean are those savings meaningful as we think about kind of a run rate into 2022 or is that not the case? just maybe help us on that in terms of potential savings?
john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so from a timing standpoint really we're in a temporary facility now as i indicated the team has done a good job and built our first telehandler we're actually in the construction phase of the plant. and so from a phasing limited impact frankly in 2022 of the operations we'll get some benefit but it really begins to kick-in 2023 and 2024 as we ramp up full production if you will of the facility in monterey and then continues as we go forward. so that's how i would think about it in terms of the flow of margin improvement. not a lot in 2022 but begin to pick up at 2023 and definitely into 2024. you want to comment duffy?
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes i just think that one of the things that john has really john garrison has really emphasized is the importance of our being globally cost competitive. and that's what that mexico facility is going to provide for us is a very competitive global cost footprint. and so as that facility ramps up 2023 2024 and beyond we do believe that it will be a contributor a substantial contributor to the continued improvement in our awp segment margins.
tim thein -- citi group -- analyst
got it. okay. and sticking with awp i'm curious as you think about that business in a given year maybe you have 1% 2% 3% pricing in a big year. and if you look at kind of the cumulative pricing actions from you and some of your peers we may be approaching double digit in some cases in some products. i'm curious have you encountered any -- what has been the feedback as you think about customer reactions and not so much demand destruction per se but maybe do you anticipate maybe some down scaling or maybe some of the features that you would have expected in the past maybe the economics we're given the severity and the magnitude of these price increases? maybe it's early days on that i'm just curious should we be thinking about a potential mix impact in 2022? thank you.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks. on the broadest level we talk about purposeful innovation and purposeful innovation is really the find at reducing the lifecycle cost for our customers and reducing the cost for us to manufacture and service the equipment through that life cycle. so as we look and bring new products to marketplace we try to bring more value-add for the customers. there is no doubt it is difficult right now engaging in conversations with customers but we're being very transparent with customers in terms of the actual cost increases we're seeing and the need for pricing actions to offset that. it's never easy. but in this environment i think most people understand that for the first time in many many years we are in an inflationary environment and we can't be the shock absorber between material input cost increases and the end customer. we all have to pass it on through the channel. our job is to get efficient to be effective to negotiate effectively with our suppliers but doing all of those things in this environment still needs the input costs and we have to share those input costs with our customers. difficult conversations but we are being transparent with our customers.
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development and chief strategy officer
thanks tim operator. next question.

your next question comes from jamie cook from credit suisse. please go ahead.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi good morning. and congrats duffy. so duffy i'll ask you another question on access and you can really miss us retire. just one i understand what you said about the full year and being price cost [indecipherable] in the first half second half. if volumes are up next year do you think for the full year we can hold at least the 25% incremental margin? and then my second question is back to the mixed sort of a backlog can help us understand with in the backlog is it bigger booms is it telehandlers is it pretty broad-base? i'm just wondering if we have a positive negative or neutral mix issue for next year. thanks.
john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
jamie i'll answer the first question i'll let duffy answer -- i'll answer the second question i'll let duffy answer the first question. in terms of a mix both a product mix customer mix right now we're not seeing any significant difference in product mix and/or customer. duffy you want to handle the first part.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so i'm going to use a term that john uses quite often and that is is that the team is laser-focused on achieving 25% incremental margins next year. and while we're not providing an outlook or guidance today i can tell you our team is absolutely committed to it. and yes i expect we would achieve those.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. thank you. and congrats again. thanks for all your help.
john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes.
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development and chief strategy officer

okay next question comes from ross gilardi from bank of america. please go ahead.
ross gilardi -- bank of america -- analyst
great thanks for squeezing me in duffy all the best to you on your next steps.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
absolutely thanks.
ross gilardi -- bank of america -- analyst
all my questions have been answered really at this point but i just had a couple ones i'll try to squeeze in. so in terms of mp adjacency that you might look to acquire do they generally sell it a meaningful multiple premiums to your own stock pricing? and what's the max you would take leverage to? and i just had a quick follow-up on spare parts.
john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
some great questions there. so as you look at some of the transactions within the mp space i would say they're more normalized valuation levels in multiples perhaps not as elevated as other areas at this point in time. and we also believe there's real opportunity these for synergies so that you can actually capture some value through the synergies that we can create given the types of businesses we're in operationally distribution channels. and so we do think there are good value opportunities where we can be disciplined about valuation while at the same time creating shareholder value especially as we look around return on the vested capital and from that perspective. so that -- and again time will tell valuations in this world right now are elevated. but we're going to be disciplined.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. and i just would add on ross that we'll end 2021 with our you net leverage at below one time. so we have plenty of capacity to add to our mp portfolio and to drive inorganic growth for that segment. to the specific question surrounding what would we be willing to take leverage to we talked about that targeting a net debt to ebitda leverage three cycle of 2.5 times. i think you've seen john and i being somewhat on the more conservative side of that 2.5. so and not to say that for the absolute right transaction that john wouldn't take the leverage above 2.5 but i think we're generally trying to be on the lower side or take the under on the 2.5.
ross gilardi -- bank of america -- analyst
all right. thanks so much. can i just squeeze one more last one?
john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes go ahead. go ahead. sure go ahead.
ross gilardi -- bank of america -- analyst
what portion of revenue these days comes from spare parts? and i know the spare parts intensity and awp isn't as large as it is in a lot of other businesses. but i would think spare parts demand right now would be booming with all the constraint on new equipment production. i'm wondering if that's actually the case and if it's meaningful?
john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so our parts and service teams lifecycle solutions team has really done a nice job. and you are right; we have seen good growth in that business. you are also correct the intensity of repair parts around booms and scissors isn't what it is in mp or on the telehandler side. but the team has done a good job growing of that business good strong margin support. and roughly we're in the 15% range plus or minus in any given quarter. we think there is opportunity to continue to grow that as we go forward. and again the team has done a nice job in that space. we are investing in that area especially around technology to improve our offering and our interface to customers. and again we think there is opportunity to continue to grow the parts and service and clearly it helps with our cyclicality. and so we like the counter cyclical nature of the parts and service business.

john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
do we still have you jerry?
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development and chief strategy officer
operator?
john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
let the record show we tried to get jerry in.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
can you hear me now?
john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes.
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development and chief strategy officer
jerry there you go.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
all right. thanks. duffy congratulations. and we'll miss working with you. i just want to ask you folks obviously made the smart move to lock in the cost structure early heading into 2021. how does that impact the way you think about structurally setting up the business? will you be in a position to lock in cost structures early on a sustained basis and any other differences in terms of how you're managing the supply chain going forward?
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so we utilize a steel hedging program in order to provide us with certainty with respect to our cost structure. and the reason for it or objective with it when we are having discussions with customers about price for the following year we have greater insight into what our cost structure would be. we did enter into some steel hedges in 2020 for 2022 much less volume than we had for 2021. and we've done some limited amount of steel hedging here in 2021. but quite honestly given the elevated level of the forward contracts we have not done as much of it as we did in the prior or year. and we are very focused on being and committed to being price cost neutral for 2022. so to the extent that -- and i mentioned earlier the planning levels with respect to steel prices. and we will be price cost neutral by making sure that at those elevated steel levels and other component cost increases that we're able to pass those on to our customers.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay great. and lastly with your telematics you have great insights on where utilization levels are. can you talk about in north america and europe in the third quarter was utilization for your customers all the way back through prior cycle highs or is there room for utilization to add higher versus very good third quarter historically?
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes i would say utilization improved time new improved for the customers. it varies by country in terms of where if it was back to 2019 levels. but broad-based comment utilization across our portfolio of businesses continue to improve as we went through the quarter.
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development and chief strategy officer
thanks jerry. operator?
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer

operator
greetings and welcome to the terex corporation's third quarter 2021 results conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder this conference is being recorded. it is now my pleasure to introduce your host randy wilson director of investor relations for terex corporation. thank you. sir you may begin.
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development and chief strategy officer
good morning and welcome to the terex third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. a copy of the press release and presentation slides are posted on our investor relations website at investors.terex.com. in addition the replay and slide presentation will be available on our website. i'm joined by john garrison chairman and chief executive officer; and john duffy sheehan senior vice president and chief financial officer. their prepared remarks will be followed by q&a. please turn to slide two of the presentation which reflects our safe harbor statement. today's conference call contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied. in addition we'll be discussing non-gaap information that we believe is useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. reconciliations for these non-gaap measures can be found in the conference call materials. please turn to slide three and i'll turn it over to john garrison.
john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning. and thank you for joining us and for your interest in terex. i want to take a moment to emphasize once again that terex actions are always guided by our values. we consistently act with integrity operate with excellence and care for our team members customers and communities. i would like to thank our team around the world for their continued commitment toward zero-harm safety culture and terex way values. safety remains the top priority in the company driven by think safe work safe home safe. all terex team members have contributed to our effort to continue to produce some service equipment for our customers while maintaining a safe working environment. please turn the slide four. the team is built on the strong foundation for long-term success with our environmental social and governance or esg efforts. a few key points that i would like to highlight as we progress on this journey. leading with strong governance our esg efforts are led by senior management with oversight from our board of directors. turning to social diversity equity and inclusion is being embraced and driven by our senior leaders as we increase the dialogue and training around this important topic. on the environmental front you'll hear more later about how our teams continue to deliver sustainable and innovative products which our customers are demanding. finally we continue to communicate with stakeholders about our esg journey. we recently released our second esg report which can be found in our investor relations website. the team support is continuing to engage with investors about esg matters. i am pleased with our efforts to date but the team recognizes there is more work to do around this important topic and we will drive execution of our esg priorities.
please turn to slide five. now let me highlight some of our third quarter results which duffy will describe in greater detail. during the quarter we continued to deliver strong year-over-year top-line revenue growth. we were impacted by supply chain challenges limiting our production output especially within our awp segment. as a result of the supply chain challenges revenues were approximately 9% below our expectations from the beginning of the quarter. global end market demand remained very robust as demonstrated by our quarterly bookings and q3 being double the prior year. even when compared to historically good end market demand environment such as q3 2019 our bookings were up approximately 140%. we do expect end market demand to remain strong to the remainder of this year and into 2022. our operating margins in earnings per share in the quarter improved significantly versus the third quarter of last year but were lower than our prior expectations because of the revenue shortfall supply chain challenges impacting the efficiency of our manufacturing operations and inflationary cost pressures which we are only partially offset by our pricing actions. we expect the supply chain environment we experienced in q3 to continue through the fourth quarter and into 2022. today's updated financial outlet for 2021 reflects this expectation. i'm extremely proud of our team's management of working capital and free cash flow generation. with $43 million of positive free cash flow in the quarter we posted our sixth consecutive quarter of positive free cash. year-to-date we have now generated more than $180 million of free cash. this strong performance allowed us to use available cash to prepay another $150 million of debt in october. today terex enjoys one of the strongest balance sheets it has ever had.
during the third quarter our team worked tirelessly to manage supply chain and logistics disruptions by delivering for our customers. tightly managed all costs and delivered improved margins and positive free cash flow. our financial results demonstrates that our strategic priorities are working to improve the company and to deliver positive financial results for shareholders. please turn to slide six. we continue to improve terex's global cost competitiveness. for the full year 2021 our sg&a as a percent of sales will be substantially below our target of 12.5%. during 2021 we have been treating nearly all sg&a costs as fixed taking advantage of higher revenue to leverage the cost structure. we will continue to maintain strict cost discipline while recognizing that growth in the business will necessitate some investment spending. in the third quarter we started production of our telehandlers in monterrey mexico. this action is on track and will reduce the cost of manufacturing our telehandler products for the north american market. turning to innovation we remain focused on purposeful innovation delivering electrification digital and other offering enhancements that provide value to our customers. in utilities we've rolled out our high-power solution which operates the boom electrically and eliminates noise and emissions. and genie is producing e-drive scissor which addresses the need for hybrid and fuel electric product offerings. approximately two thirds of genie's scissors and one third of genie booms are offered with hybrid and electric technology. mp has launched 28 new products in 2021. the segment also continues to develop and deploy digital offerings for dealers and customers. more than 7000 units in the installed base are now fitted with telematics hardware that is enabling these offerings. mp is also implementing digital dealer solutions including connected dealer inventory or cdi. the number of active dealers using cdi doubled in 2021 and more growth is anticipating.
finally we are investing for growth. in china we're increasing production in both segments. we produced our first genie in our recently expanded changzhou facility and our mp production is progressing according to plan. we launch a new product line in waste and recycling called terex recycling systems or trs. the new product line will lead modular offerings for stationary systems. the trs offering compliments our ecotech and [indecipherable] businesses which offer mobile waste and recycling equipment. turning to slide seven our awp and mp segments continue to demonstrate resiliency and flexibility to capture the benefits from the positive market fundamentals that we are seeing. first in genie the current market dynamics points our multiyear replacement cycle for genie equipment. the average age of fleets globally is increasing and customers need to replenish their fleets. so the replacement cycle is here. adoption is taking place in emerging markets such as china non-residential investment indicate are positive. these factors are leading to strong order activity. material processes we expect global demand for crushing and screening equipment to continue to grow. broad-based economic growth construction activity and aggregates consumption are the primary market drivers. we are seeing strong markets for our concrete mixer truck material handling and environmental businesses. overall we are seeing robust market conditions around the world for our industry-leading products and solutions. however while demand remained strong we anticipate ongoing supply chain disruptions to persist throughout the fourth quarter and into 2022. it is a dynamic situation which is constantly changing and we're not expecting significant improvement in the near-term. freight and logistics have also been a growing issue with delays and increased cost. the availability of containers ships and increasing offload times are impacting our production and delivery schedules.
our production and supply chain team members are doing a remarkable job demonstrating resilience and flexibility to maximize the number of machines we can ship to our customers. our strategic sourcing initiative has produced strong relationships with suppliers resulting in more impact in transparency and communication. this has helped our teams work with suppliers to ensure we are receiving a higher allocation of components. our engineering teams are working with suppliers to redesign components to maximize availability of critical electronic subsystems. these are dynamic times and i am confident that terex will deliver continued operational progress due to the tireless efforts of our team members. with that i'll turn it over to duffy.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks john. turning to slide eight let's look at our third quarter results. overall revenues of almost $1 billion were up nearly 30% year-over-year with both of our operating segments revenues up more than 25%. as john mentioned earlier revenues were lower than our expectations going into the quarter. as a result of the higher revenues our absolute amount of gross profit in the quarter increased 22%. the current global supply chain dynamics materially increased the cost of our operations for both segments through reduced efficiency in our manufacturing facilities and higher material logistics and labor costs. in the short-run given previously committed customer purchase orders especially in our awp segment we have been unable to pass all of these increased costs onto our customers. as a result gross margins contracted year-over-year in the third quarter. to mitigate the negative impacts of the operating environment our teams have been maintaining strict discipline in our sg&a spending. despite this quarter's revenue being 30% higher than the same quarter last year sg&a was $6 million lower than the prior year. for the quarter we recorded an operating profit of $74 million compared to $37 million in the third quarter of last year achieving an operating margin of 7.5%. interest and other expenses was approximately $3 million lower than q3 of last year resulting from lower outstanding borrowings combined with reduced rates on the debt we financed earlier this year. our third quarter 2021 global effective tax rate was approximately 23% driven by a mix of discrete items in the quarter. our tax rate estimate for the full year remains 19% consistent with our previous look. finally our reported eps of $0.67 per share more than doubled year-over-year.
turn into slide nine and our awp segment financial results. sales of $573 million were up 29% compared to last year driven by continued strong demand in all global markets. awp delivered improved operating margins in the quarter driven by increased production and aggressively managing all costs. third quarter bookings of $981 million were up dramatically compared to q3 2020 while backlog at quarter end was $1.7 billion almost four times the prior year. approximately 70% of awps september 30th backlog is scheduled for delivery in 2022. a portion of this backlog represents orders with 2021 pricing that were scheduled for delivery in 2021 that have now over into 2022. as a result we expect the first half of next year to be price cost negative. however we do expect awp to be price cost neutral for the full year 2022. now turning to slide 10 a material processing's q3 financial results. mp had another excellent quarter. sales of $419 million were up 35% compared to last year driven by strong customer demand across all end markets and geographies. the mp team has been aggressively managing all elements of cost as end markets improve resulting in an operating margin of almost 14%. it is a testament to the mp team's operational strength to deliver these robust operating margins. mp saw its businesses strengthen through the quarter with bookings up approximately 62% year-over-year. backlog of $1 billion is more than 3.5 times higher than last year and was up 18% sequentially.
turning to slide 11 and i'll now review our updated financial outlook for the full year. this outlook takes into consideration the current end market demand environment as well as the increased supply chain and input cost headwinds that we have discussed today. as for commercial demand we have seen our end markets remain robust over the course of the third quarter. we expect continued global end market strength over the remainder of the year and into 2022. our full year revenue outlook for the company as a whole and both segments is limited due to the availability of components from our supply chain. we now expect our awp segment revenues for the full year to be slightly lower than our previous sales outlook communicated in july. in addition we are expecting our operations to be impacted over the remainder of this year and into 2022 by accelerating cost increases. as we've already contracted with customers for nearly all of our remaining 2021 revenue most of the benefit of price increases which we have been implementing to offset inflationary pressures will not be realized until 2022 especially in our awp segment. we have slightly lowered our total company outlook for operating margins as a of lower awp margins partially offset by improving mp margins. as a result of positive first half callouts corporate and other costs continue to be expected to be slightly higher in the second half versus the first half of the year. finally we continue to plan the total company incremental margins for the full year 2021 which exceed our 25% target.
our full year eps outlook including charges of $0.27 per share for the refinancing of our capital structure and other year-to-date callouts has been revised to $2.75 to $2.85 per share based on sales of approximately $3.85 billion. for the full year 2021 we are estimating free cash flow in excess of $200 million reflecting a strong year of positive cash generation. the year free cash flow continues to include approximately $75 million from income and back tax refunds which are not expected to reoccur. we now plan for cash capital expenditures of approximately $80 million. the largest project included in capital expenditures is for the genie mexico manufacturing facility. turning to slide 12 our updated 2021 full year eps outlook takes into consideration. first the small reduction in our full year outlook for awp segment revenues. second the inflationary cost pressures we are experiencing in most areas of our businesses. third the benefit of price increases we have been implementing which is only partially offsetting these cost increases and finally the operational efficiency and sg&a cost mitigation actions we have been taking to improve the business. overall our 2021 outlook continues to represent a significant improvement in operating performance when compared to 2020. we will continue to aggressively manage costs while positioning our businesses for growth.
turning to slide 13 and i'll review our discipline capital allocation strategy. our team members remain vigilant and will continue to efficiently manage production and scrutinize every expenditure. the positive free cash flow of $43 million in the quarter demonstrates the focus and discipline of our team members who have tightly managed networking capital. terex has ample liquidity. at the end of the quarter we had approximately $1.2 billion available to us with no near-term debt maturities so we can manage and grow the business. our strong liquidity position and cash generation allowed us to prepay $150 million of term loans in october which is in addition to the $279 million prepaid earlier this year all this while the company continues to pay our quarterly dividend. we are committed to continuing to strengthen terex's balance sheet while maintaining flexibility to execute our growth plans. and with that back to you john.
john l. garrison, jr. -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks duffy. before we go to your questions i would like to acknowledge that this will be duffy's last conference call with terex. as announced a few weeks ago the entire team is excited to welcome julie beck who will be joining us next week and you will meet julie at our upcoming conferences in november and december. on behalf of the board of directors the executive leadership team and all terex team numbers we want to thank duffy as he will be retiring after five years of exceptional service and leadership at terex. he has been a great leader mentor and teammate and he has created tremendous value for our company. in his five years as cfo duffy's guidance has been especially important to me as he has helped lead our transformation journey and position terex for a strong future.
john d. sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks for that john. i'd like to take a moment to thank each terex team member for their support. i know you will continue to do the same for julie. i also want to thank you the analyst and investment community whom i've interacted with on these calls and at conferences. your pushing and prodding made me a better cfo for terex and most importantly to you john for giving me this opportunity. we are a great team and good friends. and with that let me turn it back to you randy.
randy s. williamson -- vice president, corporate development and chief strategy officer
thanks duffy. as a reminder during the question-and-answer session we ask you to limit your questions to one and follow-up to ensure we answer as many questions as possible this morning. with that i'd like to open up for questions operator?
",2021-Q3,TEX
0.9998,1.0,":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions]. your first question comes from stephen volkmann from jefferies. please go ahead.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
we talked about sort of more demand in 2022, if you could get more out the door. so i guess my question is, it looks like things did improve a little bit in the fourth quarter from a supply chain perspective, and we're kind of hearing that from other companies. so can you just maybe take us through what you're actually seeing in the supply chain? and i'm curious if your revenue guidance is kind of backed up by kind of firm commitments from suppliers? or are you being kind of conservative about how this plays out through '22?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, stephen. good morning. so if we just take a step back and look at the supply chain, we're not in the demand outpaced production really across the supply chain. so similar to other companies, we'll continue to see persistent disruptions in our plants, either component shortages and logistics-related delays.
the reality was, stephen, in the fourth quarter, we actually didn't see an improvement. we saw a modest decrease, frankly, in key metrics like supplier on-time deliveries, number of parts. and so that did impact our output, and it continues to impact us going forward. now what are we doing about this is, first, everybody in the organization is engaged.
we have an escalation process and frankly, all the way up to my level. i've spent more time over the last year on supply chain-related issues than, frankly, i have on dealing with customer-related issues because that's what we are. we've done a lot of engineering redesigns, and that's really helped, especially around our electronic components, working with our suppliers to make availability -- or use what is available in the marketplace. as a result of our strategic sourcing initiatives, we did expand our supply base.
so we know where to go now for secondary and third suppliers for parts. so we continue to execute that. and then our teams are just really doing a heck of a job being adaptable in modifying schedules. the number of schedule changes that we have to implement is, frankly, daily.
and so the teams become pretty confident in modifying schedules to get as much out as we can for our customers. and so we're staying very close with our suppliers. we're communicating with our customers in terms of where we are. our outlook, steve, is guided by supply chain constraints.
we -- i would say we are hedging, if you will, what suppliers are telling us. because based on their previous performance, we are hedging to some extent. the material plan that we have is higher than our current outlook, if you will, but we've factored that into our outlook, steve. so this is our best look that we have as of today in terms of what we believe the supply chain is going to be able to deliver.
and again, if the supply chain is able to deliver more, we will be able to deliver more for our customers because this is really -- it's a supply chain-driven situation. i think the other important comment around the supply chain and working with our supply chain teams and my interaction with ceos is we're driving not just to drive improvement in our supply chain in 2022. we believe we're setting up for a pretty extended strong demand environment across our businesses. and so it's not just 2022 that we need to increase the availability of supply, it's for '23 and beyond.
and so this is an incredibly focused effort on the team. we believe we're going to see improvement as we go through the year. and -- but we didn't see that improvement in q4, so we have to be prepared for it. and again, the team has done a heck of a job being adaptable and resilient to the significant changes they've had to absorb on a day-to-day basis.
so that's how i'd describe the situation again, steve. i don't think it's that much different than most industrial manufacturing companies around the world today.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. great. that's helpful color. and then for the quick follow-up, i'm just curious on steel specifically.
how much of your '22 steel is kind of protected as it were? and obviously, as steel prices kind of go down, i'm trying to get a sense of how long it would be until you see that benefit?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks. so we have a steel hedging program. but again, stephen, it really is just for hrc, or hot-rolled coil. for the u.s., our awp business, specifically genie, uses about 60% of that.
there's not a hedge market for plate. so we have been hedged. we continue to hedge. we hedge to have price visibility, not to speculate.
and the good news is, is that steel was, especially in north america and europe in the middle of the year and into the fourth quarter, was an incredible high, $1,800 to $2,000. we are seeing the steel indices and markets come off of that high, thankfully, and we're anticipating that continues as we go into 2022.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks, team. appreciate it. we'll talk to you soon.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you. operator, next question.
operator
your next question comes from mig dobre with baird. please go ahead.
mig dobre -- baird -- analyst
thank you, and good morning everyone.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, mig.
mig dobre -- baird -- analyst
so i guess -- good morning. my question is on slide 17. i appreciate that break in all the details here. the -- so two things.
the $2.30 worth of cost pressure, i'm curious if there's any way to sort of delineate the major buckets in here in terms of what's raw materials versus freight? it would just be helpful for us to kind of -- we can make our own assumptions in terms of where things go from here. and then i guess the second part of the question is as we're thinking beyond 2022, the price and efficiency component that you have here, $2.55, do you think that it's something that you can hang on to beyond 2022? or will you have to sort of get back some of the gains that you've got on the slide?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, mig. i'll try to take them in sequence. and if i don't, please jump back in. in terms of the cost elements, it is both -- cost pressure is included both in materials, components, and freight.
and we've seen substantial increases, especially in the back half of 2021, and that's what our current outlook reflects and it does reflect looking at forward indices, which, again, we do believe in that case, we are going to see some abatement of the rapid increase that we're seeing in the material costs. and as you look to our pricing actions and this pricing action continues. so if you just take a step back, our pricing actions have really been designed across our global businesses to offset our material and logistics cost increases. mig, we have taken pricing actions throughout '21, and now obviously taking pricing action into 2022.
these are not easy conversations with customers, but we've been very transparent with our customers and distribution partners on the level of inflation that we're seeing, basically showing -- all the way down to showing invoices. and so that's the action we've taken. if you look at our respective businesses, mig, on the awp side, we've instituted a combination of pricing and surcharges. if you look at the results in 2021, those pricing actions did not offset all the material and freight cost increases that we had.
and we saw an acceleration of inflation in the back half. in 2022, with further increased pricing, we believe that price realization improves throughout the year as we ship some of the backlog that -- with that '21 -- we're supposed to deliver in '21, we didn't, and then with that '21 pricing. so we believe price realization will improve. if you look at our mp business, they've really done a good job offsetting most of the material and logistics inflation that we've seen globally.
with the nature of their business, they've been able to be more dynamic in updating their pricing on an ongoing basis. and if you look at their results, they were pretty close to price cost neutral in '21, and we expect they will be price cost neutral in 2022. and so that -- with that said, they've got the challenge of the inflation spiking in the second half of the year. so the first half of the year is going to be a little bit more of a challenge, and we think that improves in the back half of the year.
now your -- the other good question is, are these prices going to stick? and i think the answer is yes, mig. and why do we believe that? well, first, we're seeing broad-based inflation across multiple industries. so our customers are not just seeing price increases from us, they're seeing price increases across the spectrum. and so we've been very transparent.
our pricing actions again are designed to offset significant material cost increases that we're seeing and trading cost -- freight increases that we're seeing. thus far, mig, i would say, especially across the line of mp businesses, we've seen good pricing discipline in the industry. and i would say, in the awp business, i would say with reasonable pricing discipline, reflecting the dynamic environment in north america, a little less in europe. frankly, the only place we're not seeing strong price discipline is in china.
chinese competitors are very aggressive on price. but if we look around the world and across the business, i would say we're seeing good price discipline now. and given that everyone is seeing inflation, i do believe going forward that these prices are going to be able to stay.
mig dobre -- baird -- analyst
got it. that's helpful color. and then my follow-up is on materials processing, maybe get a little more color on how you see demand progressing here. just optically looking at the orders, a little bit softer this quarter.
i'm wondering kind of what drove that and the outlook going forward.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, mig. i'm going to be a little -- i'm going to take some time on this one, too, because -- yes, we did see a little softening on the orders, but that's really timing. we're seeing strong global markets and strong customer demand across our mp portfolio.
actually, we have record backlog. frankly, our backlog is too high. we want to ship more product to our customer. if we look at our crushing and screening business, our backlog more than doubled versus the prior year, and we're seeing good growth around the world.
in our concrete business, backlog is up tremendously. a year ago, we had several large orders that did not repeat at the end of the year. and so that was a partial reason for the bookings falling off slightly. our materials handling business will be called fuchs.
you've heard me say that the only benefit of high steel prices is scrap metal prices are up, and that backlog is up almost fourfold. and so we're seeing great demand literally around the world with our fuchs product. in our environmental business, the investments we've made there, we're seeing our backlog up significantly. we believe we're going to continue to be able to grow that business.
and then our lifting businesses, our pick and carry franna business down in australia, it's been strong throughout the pandemic. and we actually saw a rebound in our rts and our power businesses from an order rate and a backlog standpoint. so overall, we're seeing strength. we did see some -- and again, it's just timing, we believe, with the bookings decline.
the backlog is exceptionally strong. and we're not seeing any weakness, frankly, across any of those businesses around the world.
randy wilson -- director of investor relations
thanks, mig. operator, next question.
operator
your next question comes from stan elliott with stifel. please go ahead.
stan elliott -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hey, good morning everyone. thank you all for taking the question. welcome, julie. a quick question for you.
when you think about the two businesses performing from a margin perspective, i mean, it looks like the incremental margins are about the same for both the awp and the materials processing business. could you help us a little bit kind of understand what's happening and the dynamics between the two?
julie beck -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
ok. sure. thanks, stan. just as we think about our incremental margins, obviously, we had some really strong performance in 2021 with 32% incremental margin, particularly strong in the awp business.
and the mp business has been strong in terms of absolute margin performance. so i just want to emphasize that our target remains at 25% incremental margin. and what you saw in 2021 was higher incremental margins in the first half and then lower in the second half as we started to experience increased material costs. so when you look at the year-over-year comparison, and we talk about going forward into 2020, '22, the framework is challenged in the first half of 2022 as accelerating inflation happened in the back half and it continues into the first half of 2022.
so that's a summary of where we're at. if we look at awp, we're looking for our awp business in 2022 to improve by 110 basis points year over year. again, as a result of the price cost in the first half, we'll see incremental margins substantially below our target in the first half of 2022 and substantially above our target in the second half of 2022. for the mp business, we're continuing to invest in new products like [inaudible], environmental, and recycling as well as manufacturing capacity, such as in places in northern ireland and china and india.
we're pleased with mp's absolute level of performance at about 14% operating margin, and we're making growth investments in the business. this business has been offsetting inflationary pressures. it's done a really nice job, and they're maintaining strong operating margins. but again, they, too will be a little bit pressed in the first half of the year.
so the team understands our 25% incremental margin framework. we're working hard to achieve those long-term goals. and as the new cfo, i fully support the target of 25% incremental margins going forward.
stan elliott -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
perfect. and thanks for hashing that out because i was really getting around the level of investment on the mp side given the comments of it being more price cost favorable or neutral. and then along those lines, there's lots of talk about growth kind of as we go into the next year. how do we balance kind of some of the growth investments you've got on the mp side? could we look at a sizable sort of an m&a deal? or what's the temperature there?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thanks. and in terms of -- on the first place, the good news is the very strong cash flow generation, strong balance sheet. so we have balance sheet capacity to do m&a-related activities.
our focus is in and around the mp business. if you look at the structure of the different markets and different verticals that we compete in, there's still a pretty high degree of fragmentation. so as we build out our pipeline, our pipeline looks to in and around the mp space. we did two smaller acquisitions in 2021.
the mds international is a great example. it's near to our plant in northern ireland, which is good. it's in southern island, but it's also a near-adjacency in terms of products. so we're able to put that product line through our existing distribution and really get a substantial increase in the sale.
so we would look to do m&a. we do -- we're going to drive organic growth across both businesses, awp and mp, and we're looking for inorganic growth. and right now, we're looking more around the pipeline associated with our mp business and perhaps our parts & services business because we think there may be some opportunities there.
randy wilson -- director of investor relations
great. thanks, stan. operator, next question, please.
operator
your next question comes from david raso with evercore isi. please go ahead.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi. good morning. thank you for taking the question. my question is related to how you're thinking about the awp cycle.
by my math, the north american awp business ended '21, still not even within 25, 30% of where you were back in 2018. so when i think about inflation, obviously, where the backlog is versus your sales guide for this year, you seemed relatively locked and loaded for '22, it's just about execution on the factory floor and price cost. but when you're thinking of investing in mexico, when you think of the capacity that you're going to need, i mean, it looks like at the end of '22, your north american business, which is not just aerials, right, it's utilities as well, but you're still going to be almost 20% below where you were in '18. so i'm just curious, your confidence in the cycle beyond '22, and not just qualitatively, but how are we thinking about the capacity exiting '22 with these investments in mexico? we're just trying to get a flavor for how much are you thinking about growth in '23 and '24 with some quantification? and obviously, your willingness to invest in capacity is -- actions not just qualitative description?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
so thank you for that question, david. and i'll speak within awp, both genie and utilities. as you clearly indicated, we are substantially below our demonstrated capacity in those businesses based on -- just go back to 2018. as a result, now -- and we have increased our capacity since 2018.
we've expanded our changzhou, china facility, for example. now as you rightly call out, we're investing in mexico. so installed capacity, we believe we're going to be appropriately sized for installed capacity going forward. we're not anywhere near where we were in 2018, and we've adding capacity since then.
why are we doing that? because we do believe the awp business, i'll talk specifically genie and then i'll talk utilities, is going to grow. if you just look at the replacement cycle, david, for the awp business and genie business and specifically, u.s., north america, and europe, the replacement cycle, frankly, was delayed by the pandemic, and now it's being delayed somewhat by constraints across the industry. if you look at the rental companies, they're growing. they need their fleets to grow.
their fleets are aging. rental rates are doing great. used equipment values are doing great. and so we believe that we're in the beginning of that replacement cycle.
it's a seven- to eight-year replacement cycle. it's always difficult, as you know, david, we've been doing this a long time, to predict exactly what quarter or what half of the year. but the economics in that industry are such that we are entering a pretty strong growth period in the replacement cycle, coupled with growth in other markets, in the genie business. so we do believe we're in a growth phase in that business.
and the replacement cycle, with a little bit of growth, is going to give us a really strong tailwind for the next several years. that, coupled with, david, the other investment we made, was in our utilities business. we have a brand-new facility there. we went from 11 buildings to one.
so we've increased our installed capacity there as well. now we've got the same supply chain issue so we've got to break through those constraints. but if you look at the utilities business and the growth prospects of the utilities business, the infrastructure bill. even without the infrastructure bill, there's significant investment required in the electrical grid transmission, distribution, and maintenance.
and so we think we're in a strong growth period as well in the utilities business. so we've committed capital over the last three to five years to improve our manufacturing capability, improve our manufacturing capacity, because we do believe we're entering a good tailwind period of time for the next couple of years in that awp segment. and i might add, we're also bullish on our mp business. we've made capacity expansions in northern ireland.
we've made capacity expansions in india. and so we're investing in our mp business for growth because we also believe those macro trends are going to continue in a positive fashion for the mp business. and as a result, we had a fairly substantial capex budget the last couple of years. it's going to extend into 2022 with our mexico investment.
and we're doing that because we believe there's good growth opportunities in both segments going forward.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
and trying to quantify it a little bit, right? i know some of these moves were not just incremental capacity, they were a more efficient, lower cost manufacturing. but can you help us with -- if my numbers are right and by the end of '22, we're still almost 20% below where we were in '18 on revenues? where is your capacity at the end of this year? like watertown's already built, essentially it's up and running. mexico, i assume, up and running fully by the end of this year. where is your capacity exiting '22 versus '18, just kind of ballpark? is it similar, just more efficient? is it 15, 20 -- i'm just getting a sense of how you must be viewing the cycle to be adding that capacity and where your revenues are exiting '22 versus that last peak.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
right. so again, david, near term and for the next 12 months or so, it's really supply chain. so as you've said, we've got demonstrated capacity above -- i don't want to necessarily say how much, all right, but if you just look at watertown, we've substantially increased the capacity there for that business, we said on the order of magnitude of 50% for our utilities business. and we believe that's achievable over a couple year period of time.
we expanded our changzhou facility that gives us a good export for the china market in an export market. and the only thing, david, i want to be clear on, our mexico facility would stood up our temporary facility right now. we've got our team in place. we're growing our team.
we're producing telehandlers there. we are building a special purpose center that will take the next two to three years to complete in mexico. so we believe we've got plenty of capacity given the market needs, david, and that's why we're working so hard on the supply chain, not just the immediate, but working with the ceos of our suppliers to have them understand that we believe we're in a strong growth cycle, and we need product not just for '22, but '23, '24 and '25.
randy wilson -- director of investor relations
david, thank you. operator, next question.
operator
your next question comes from jamie cook with credit suisse. please go ahead.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. good morning. i guess my question is, i'm just trying to square your top line guide for aerial. i think it's like implied at the midpoint up 8% to 9%.
so sort of what are you assuming for price versus volume? i'm assuming little or not a lot of volume in that forecast. i'm just trying to square it relative to your competitor who's, i think, implying double-digit growth. so i guess that's my first question. and then my second question, can you just provide a little more color on -- i know the free cash flow was a little short of expectations, you talked about inventory build, sort of what's the strategy for inventory in 2022, and just what happened during the quarter? thanks.
julie beck -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, jamie, for the question. when we look at 2022 and compared to 2021, we're seeing far more price increase than we are of volume increase. and again -- the volume increase, again, is due to those supply chain constraints. they are holding back some of that production.
so far more -- again, far more on price than volume. in terms of free cash flow, yes, we had a disappointment in -- with shortfall for q4. we were -- we had an approved irs refund. we have an approval letter for $39 million, and we still have yet to receive that.
and then we also had an increase in inventories in the quarter. and this, again, is due to those supply chain disruptions. there's -- we have a machine sitting in the hospital being ready to ship, waiting for parts that haven't shown up yet. it's causing production disruptions as well.
and we have a lot more inventory on the water and in transit than we have had in the past. so we did have an increase in inventory. when we look to 2022, we expect another strong free cash flow year. we're expecting -- anticipating our fourth year in a row of strong free cash flow.
and when, we talked about it, we'll have -- we talked about increased earnings. and in terms of our working capital, as sales increase, that working capital and inventory level will increase right along with that.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
just to follow up, though, on the top line guide, more price versus volume. john, just to be clear, this is more -- you as well. just to be clear, it's not you're assuming you're going to lose market share, it's more of a function of we're being conservative with the guide because of the challenges that are out there?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, jamie. in terms of market share, we held market share in the genie business throughout 2021. we are not assuming any significant market share or any market share rose.
and we actually think in a couple of product lines, we can gain some market share. for one product category, we did have some significant disruption, this was in telehandlers, and we're working with our supply base to improve that. so no, we're not anticipating any significant changes in market share on a year-over-year basis. it's basically based on the current constrained supply chain environment, and we got to work to break those constraints.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
all right. great. i appreciate the color. thanks.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks. appreciate it.
operator
your next question comes from steven fisher with ubs. please go ahead
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks. good morning. thanks, julie, for the q1 color and the first half, second half on incrementals.
i guess with a low single-digit margin in awp in q1, it seems like you should have a double-digit margin somewhere in the year. would you agree with that? and with the normal seasonality not as applicable this year, what do you think or what are you planning for is likely to be your highest margin quarter of the year in awp?
julie beck -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so from -- you're exactly correct. in the first quarter, we expect awp margins to be in the low single digits and meaningfully improve each quarter on a sequential basis throughout the year. so it just improves as we go every quarter.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
ok. so fourth quarter should be the highest quarter of the year, you think then? ok.
julie beck -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
great. and then your awp backlog is almost 85% of your revenue target just because of that supply chain constraint on the revenues. i guess how much of that backlog is for 2023 at this point? and if very little is for '23, are you expecting to be kind of fully booked on your revenue plan by the end of march? and i guess if the supply chain doesn't allow for any more upside, are you just going to sort of stop taking orders? or are you going to take orders and just give a 2023 delivery date on them?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
so you're right. in terms of our coverage, it's historically high based on the constraints that was described. in terms of our backlog, we only report backlog that's for 12 months. and so we do have some backlog that extends beyond that, not -- excuse me, that's not in our backlog because we only say what we expect to deliver in the next 12 months.
we will be taking pricing actions as we go through 2022. again, our pricing objective is to offset material and freight cost increases. so we're booking deliveries into 2023. those would be at a 2023 price level, not at the 2022 price level.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
ok. very helpful. thank you.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
appreciate it. operator, next question.
operator
your next question comes from nicole deblase with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
nicole deblase -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yes. thanks. good morning, guys.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, nicole.
nicole deblase -- deutsche bank -- analyst
so you mentioned during the prepared remarks, julie, that the quarterly cadence of revenue is going to look different this year, which makes sense. is this kind of similar to what it feels like the margin progression is where you start off at a low point and each quarter gets better? is it the same path for revenue?
julie beck -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
really, the revenue strength is about half. the first half and second half are relatively consistent. what really happens is that price/cost mix gets better throughout the year. so the first quarter, again, is really challenged as we ship stuff, but still we have some things in backlog at 2021 prices.
and we're experiencing the higher cost in q1. so really, it improves throughout the year, but it's more because of the price/cost as opposed to the revenue mix. they're relatively equal in the first half and the second half.
nicole deblase -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. ok. that's clear. thanks.
and then on the sg&a to sales, so you're guiding at a little bit below 11% in '22. this is the second year in a row that the guidance looks well below like the original 12.5% target. how do we think about like the sustainability of 11% sg&a to sales beyond 2022?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, nicole. it's an internal debate. and we actually would think that 11 to 11.5% range, given a growing revenue environment, is perhaps a more reasonable target.
yes, we were at 12.5, that was in the past. we've gotten a lot more efficient in our systems and our processes. and so i would say that 11 to 11.5% range is probably a more realistic range for us, subject to change. but as we look at our strategic plan now, i would say 11 to 11.5% is a better target for us than the 12.5%.
julie beck -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
and just to add, the team has been really -- has done a great job of lowering sg&a costs here. they're down $100 million from where they were in 2019. and so we're going to be very disciplined about anything that we add. we've only add are those value-creating projects, very, very prudent with expense management always going forward as well.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good. thanks. operator, next question.
operator
your next question comes from courtney yakavonis with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
courtney yakavonis -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys. thanks for the question.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
courtney yakavonis -- morgan stanley -- analyst
if we could just go back, john, to your comments that we're going to see an improvement in some of the cost pressures as we go through the year. i think you mentioned you didn't see that improvement in the fourth quarter. so is the right way to understand that, that if you were carrying forward the fourth quarter's cost pressures, that $2.30 that's in your outlook would be significantly higher and you are baking an improvement? or is that improvement mostly from lapping the tough -- or the easier compares that you're going to have in the third and fourth quarter of the year?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
it reflects the cost increases that we're expecting in the year, in 2022. part of those cost increases were as a result of the inflationary increases that we saw in the back half of the year. if you remember, in a lot of the contract, steel, for example, it takes 120 days or so for it to go through the p&l. and so it reflects the higher cost basis that we saw in q4, and it reflects some of the amelioration or the abatement in cost increases that we're anticipating based on certain key indices that we follow closely.
courtney yakavonis -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. got it. but to be clear, it is not the run rate from q4? you are expecting the abatement. and is it primarily on the material side where you're baking in that improvement? or are you also baking in an improvement in the logistics? and i think mig had asked earlier, just the breakdown, if you could give us of that $2.30, what's logistics versus material so we can put some of our own assumptions in?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
i would say, just looking at it, it really is the material -- the underlying material. we're not necessarily assuming any significant improvement in the logistics world right now. it's still significantly constrained. so it really is a material play.
we'll see on the material side, but that's not our operating assumption right now.
julie beck -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
and if we look at the cost pressure and what's there for 2022, a vast majority of that is the increase of material costs, not in transportation.
randy wilson -- director of investor relations
thanks, courtney. operator?
operator
and your last question for today comes from jerry revich with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. hi. good morning everyone. julie, welcome.
i'm wondering if you could talk about the implications of your growing electrification mix within the portfolio. are there any incremental opportunities that are coming up for you folks in terms of helping with on-site charging or anything along those lines that's coming up as an opportunity as the electrification mix in the portfolio rises? and can you comment, now that you're scaling the business, what the margin profile is? if there's any difference between electrified powertrains for you folks versus diesel? thanks.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, jerry. just, longer term, our product portfolio across the businesses really looks at electrification. as we said, a lot of the genie products are already electrified. what's changing there is going all electric.
electric drives, changing from deep cycle batteries to lithium-ion batteries. and so you're seeing the evolution of battery technology that's playing a role in the genie business. as the evolution of that technology continues, you will see that be adopted even into more product lines, booms, scissors. and someday, i think telehandlers will be the laggard in that, given their duty cycle.
but we will see that as well in the future. so as lithium-ion continues to be adopted across other industries, we'll see that adoption in our industries as well. in the mp business, it really depends on what specific products we're talking about. there, is -- a lot of times, we have an electric option if the electric with -- or our irish friends would say the mains are available or the electric distribution is available.
if it's not, then you're going to remain with large diesel engines. but again, across the product portfolio, on every product line, we have an electrification product development plan for those products as the world continues to move toward electrification. so incremental -- jerry, i don't know if it's necessarily incremental or not. i think it's just how the market is moving.
and then in terms of the margin side and cost side, originally, lithium-ion was more expensive, frankly. and the battery solutions were more expensive. but as that cost is coming down the cost curve, because it's being utilized in so many other industries, now you're getting to the point where that lithium-ion solution on a life cycle cost basis is competitive to other alternatives, especially internal combustion engine alternatives. so as you see that continue, i think that will also precipitate a greater move toward electrification as the life cycle costs come down with it.
so that's how we're handling it. it's a key part of our product development efforts across our business lines, looking at what's going to happen in the next three, five, 10 years. and that's incorporated into our development plan. incremental, i'm not sure, jerry, i wouldn't say that.
i think it's where the world is going.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
terrific. separately, on the supply chain side, can you talk about what are the critical components that you're concerned about today, if that's any different from three months ago and you alluded to having supplied components on the water? to what extent is that driving the outlook for production to ramp up over the year because you have the visibility in terms of what's at ports, etc.?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so jerry, i think similar to what other manufacturers have talked about, electronic components, we've had to do a lot there to modify chips, boards, circuits, and the like. so electronic components continue to be a challenge. tied to electronic components is engines, the ecus or ecms, whichever manufacture choice is used.
so engine availability is the near-term constraint, that i think will work itself out. but right now, that's a near-term constraint. hydraulic systems. there are several hydraulic systems that have been constraints for us, and that's caused a challenge.
and then our utility business, it's the only business where we use chassis that was adversely impacted with the chassis supplier. so those are the primary commodities that we're dealing with. there's the odds and ends that creep up as well. but those are the key ones that we're working on to improve supply of so that we can increase our production to meet the needs of our customers.

operator
greetings, and welcome to the terex corporation fourth quarter and full year 2021 results conference call. [operator instructions]. as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. it is now my pleasure to introduce your host, randy wilson, director of investor relations for terex corporation.
thank you, sir. you may begin.
randy wilson -- director of investor relations
good morning, and welcome to the terex fourth quarter and year-end 2021 earnings conference call. a copy of the press release and presentation slides are posted on our investor relations website at investors.terex.com. in addition, the replay and slide presentation will be available on our website. i'm joined by john garrison, chairman and chief executive officer; and julie beck, senior vice president and chief financial officer.
their prepared remarks will be followed by q&a. please turn to slide 2 of the presentation, which reflects our safe harbor statement. today's conference call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied. in addition, we will be discussing non-gaap information that we believe is useful in evaluating the company's operating performance.
reconciliations for these non-gaap measures can be found in the conference call materials. please turn to slide 3, and i'll turn it over to john garrison. 
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, randy, and good morning. i'd like to welcome everyone to our earnings call, and thank you for your interest in terex. we are proud of all terex team members who are keeping themselves and others safe, meeting the needs of customers and helping our communities. i would like to thank our team members around the world for their continued commitment to our zero harm safety culture and terex way values.
safety remains the top priority of the company, driven by think safe, work safe, home safe. our strong commitment to zero harm is driving improvement of safety metrics, such as total recordable incident rates, which has significantly improved over the past five years. this is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team members. please turn to slide 4.
our strong environmental, social, and governance foundation drive stakeholder value. a few highlights as we progress on our esg journey. first, environmental. terex products help our customers to meet their sustainability goals.
two-thirds of genie scissors, one-third of genie booms, and 60% of material processing products have an electric option. turning to social. diversity, equity, and inclusion is being embraced and driven throughout the organization. next, leading with strong governance.
our esg efforts are led by senior management, with oversight from our board of directors. we are firm believers in our actions matching our words, whether it's producing sustainable products; promoting diversity, equity and inclusion; or being good global citizens. the team recognizes there is more work to do around this important topic, and we will provide updates throughout the year. please turn to slide 5 to review our q4 2021 financial highlights.
we had an excellent quarter, eps of $0.82 nearly quadrupled year over year, sales were up 26% year over year and we ended 2021 with a record backlog of $3 billion, up 122%, driven by strong customer global demand. and focused cost management continued, resulting in 300 basis points of operating margin improvement. overall, the fourth quarter financial performance demonstrated strong execution for our team members in a dynamic and challenging operating environment. please turn to slide 6.
our execute, innovate, and grow strategy has strengthened our business operations in 2021. on execution, the team proactively managed supply chain disruptions to deliver sales growth of 26% year over year, aggressively managed costs to deliver a 430 basis point improvement in sg&a as a percent of sales and improved genie's future cost competitiveness as our temporary mexico facility is now producing telehandlers and continues to ramp up. turning to innovation. we introduced new products, including environmental and recycling solutions in materials processing; new electric offerings in genie; and electric grid products in utilities.
we continue to invest in connected assets and digital capabilities, such as customer dealer integration and telematics across the enterprise to better serve customers. we invested in our business for future growth, both organically and inorganically. the team expanded production capabilities of mobile crushing and screening equipment in china and northern ireland; acquired mds international, offering adjacent products for our mp customers; and continued expansion of service facilities, such as our new houston, texas location for utilities customers. please turn to slide 7.
materials processing segment is a consistent strong performer. it is a diversified, high-performing portfolio of businesses, which continues to invest for future growth. mp brands have leading positions in their respective markets with excellent end market product and geographic diversification. we have a great opportunity to grow organically through innovation, product and service development, and expanding into product adjacencies, including conveying, washing, environmental, and recycling.
parts & services remains a focus for the segment, as it continues to develop digital offerings for dealers and customers. more than 8,000 of mp's machines are fitted with telematics hardware, and the number of dealers using customer and dealer integration, or cdi, has doubled in 2021. mp's end market diversification is a strength, whether it's aggregates, construction, recycling, or global infrastructure. all of these markets are growing.
please turn to slide 8, and i will review awp offerings and end markets. starting with our utilities business. it has excellent growth prospects. the need to maintain and grow the electric grid, along with continued 5g rollout, will drive multiyear demand.
some key product lines for terex utilities include bucket trucks, digger derricks, and tree trimmers, used for the maintenance and expansion of electrical grids. also, we recently invested in viatec's battery technology for utility trucks called smart power takeoff, or smartpto. this environmentally friendly solution allows our utility booms to operate without truck idling. as a result, our customers can reduce vehicle maintenance and carbon emissions.
turning to our genie business. genie is a globally recognized brand with great products. the 60-foot j-boom was named the contractors top 50 new product. hybrid power options on scissors and booms provide indoor and outdoor job site flexibility and quiet emission-free performance.
and our new telehandler offers increased lift capacity and lower cost of ownership. these products demonstrate genie's strength in listening to customers and responding with innovative industry-leading products. genie's end markets of construction, infrastructure, and industrial applications will drive demand. further, we are at the beginning of a new multiyear replacement cycle in north america and european rental markets.
please turn to slide 9, and i will discuss the supply chain environment. like most other industrial companies, we are facing shortages and cost pressures for materials, logistics, freight, and labor. these headwinds have constrained our growth in the short term. the significant increase in covid cases in january and february around the world are impacting our production and supplier deliveries.
however, we are aggressively managing these challenges. the team continues to mitigate cost pressures and minimize production disruption by staying close to our existing suppliers and expanding our supply base. we designed components to maximize availability of critical inputs to improve production, provide transparent communication of delivery and cost headwinds for our customers and we have taken pricing actions, but they have not been sufficient to offset unprecedented material and logistics inflation, which accelerated in the back half of 2021. we anticipate these challenges to continue in the first half of 2022.
however, for the full year, we anticipate material costs stabilizing and being price cost neutral as price realization improves throughout the year. our production and supply chain team members are working tirelessly. they are demonstrating resilience and flexibility to increase customer deliveries. and with that, i'll turn it over to julie for her first earnings call with terex.
julie?
julie beck -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, john, and good morning to everyone. i am very excited to have joined terex with its great brands, terex way values, strong history, and strong balance sheet. i look forward to working with the team to drive operational margin improvement, free cash flow generation, growth, and enhancing value for all stakeholders. now turning to slide 10.
i want to congratulate the team on posting excellent fourth quarter results. looking at the fourth quarter, sales of $990 million were up 26% year over year and year-end market demand remained strong. for the quarter, we recorded an operating profit of $70 million, more than double our operating profit of $32 million in the fourth quarter of last year. operating profit increased due to strong sales and $3 million of positive financial call-out.
operating margins improved 300 basis points in the quarter, driven by actions to prudently manage and reduce costs. we achieved this positive operating results through disciplined cost control, while adapting to a dynamic market environment. interest and other expense was approximately $8 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2020, due to a gain related to the relocation of our genie administrative office and reduced debt levels. our effective tax rate of approximately 15% benefited from discrete items, including the favorable resolution of tax audits.
our fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.82 increased nearly four times, representing a $0.61 improvement over last year. the financial call-out, highlighted in this slide, represent a $0.16 benefit in the quarter. free cash flow for the quarter was below our expectations. first, we have not yet received an approved $39 million irs refund.
and second, inventories increased due to disruption and logistics delays. turning to slide 11 and our materials processing segment financial results. mp continues to perform very well with sales of $454 million, up 24% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and the business ended the year with a backlog of $1 billion, which is nearly double that of a year ago. these results were driven by continued strong customer demand in all end markets and geographies.
mp delivered 13.8% operating margins by driving sales growth, while managing material costs and manufacturing headwinds. this is a testament to the team's operational execution. turning to slide 12 and our aerial work platforms segment financial results. awp sales of $534 million increased by 30% compared to last year, driven by strong global end market demand.
awp fourth quarter bookings of $922 million were up 23% year over year, while backlog at quarter end was nearly $2 billion, up 137% from the prior year. awp delivered improved operating margin of 4.8% in the quarter driven by strong customer demand and prudent expense management. turning to slide 13 and full year 2021 financial highlights. our performance in 2021 reflected strong improvement in the business and the extraordinary efforts of our team members.
earnings per share increased significantly from $0.13 to $3.07 or a $2.94 improvement. sales of $3.9 billion were up 26% year over year as end markets recovered. operating margin of 8.4% expanded 620 basis points, driven by strict expense discipline. sg&a spending was $42 million lower year over year at 11% of sales, beating our 12.5% target.
we delivered a 32% incremental margin, exceeding our 25% target. and we repaid $0.5 billion of debt, reducing net leverage to 1.1 times. turning to slide 14. this slide summarizes our 2021 financial results and call-out.
included in our operating profit were $5 million of positive call-out. below the line, there were $29 million of noncash charges associated with our debt refinancing and term loan repayment. this was partially offset by a $12 million cash gain related to our genie administrative office relocation. turning to slide 15.
i want to reaffirm our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including a strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation to enable growth. our team members remain vigilant and aggressively manage all costs, generating $125 million of free cash flow in the year. our strong free cash flow generation and proceeds from the sale of our terex financial services portfolio in february 2021, allowed us to repay $0.5 billion of debt this year, resulting in net leverage of 1.1 times. as a reminder, we have no near-term maturities.
our next maturity is in 2024. we continue to invest in the business in 2021 with $60 million of capital expenditures. our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation allowed our board of directors to reinstate and pay out a quarterly dividend for 2021. just this week, the board has approved an increased dividend of $0.13 per share as we continue to return cash to our shareholders.
we have ample liquidity with $867 million available to us at year end so we can manage and grow the business. now turning to slide 16 and our full year 2022 outlook. i would like to update you on how we currently anticipate 2022 to develop financially. it is important to realize we are operating in an unprecedented supply chain environment and a pandemic, so results could change negatively or positively.
with that said, this outlook represents our best estimate as of today. we anticipate earnings per share of $3.55 to $4.05 based on sales of approximately 4.1 to $4.3 billion. traditional seasonality of sales is less applicable in 2022 as the supply chain environment has extended product deliveries. this sales outlook reflects the latest dialogue with our suppliers.
our 2022 sales are not a function of demand, rather the ability of the supply chain to deliver components. we have the internal capacity to produce more and have demonstrated such in the past. awp sales of 2.3 to $2.4 billion and mp sales of 1.8 to $1.9 billion reflects strong customer demand, but with the constraint presented by the supply chain. turning to operating margin.
we expect operating margin for the year to be in the range of 8.8 to 9.5%. operating margin is expected to be lower in the first half of 2022 and higher in the second half as supply chain headwinds abate and pricing actions taken are realized as backlog is shipped. to help frame the development of operating margin in 2022, the first quarter of 2022 will see increased cost pressures compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. mp's margins of 14 to 14.5% will be relatively balanced throughout 2022, but the first quarter will be challenged by supply chain constraints.
awp margins of 7.8 to 8.5% reflects significantly higher input costs peaking in the first quarter with price realization improving throughout the year as we work through the backlog. in the first quarter of 2022, we expect awp operating margin in the low single digit and meaningfully improving throughout the year. based upon global tax laws, we expect a 2022 effective tax rate of approximately 20.5% due to higher u.s. income and lower discrete benefits, partially offset by lower local and u.s.
tax on rest of world income. for 2022, we are estimating free cash flow of 175 to $225 million, reflecting another year of positive cash generation. we also estimate capital expenditures net of asset disposition will be approximately $90 million, the largest component being our genie mexico facility. corporate & other costs are planned to occur relatively evenly throughout the year.
overall, our 2022 guidance represents a continued improvement in operating performance when compared to 2021 despite the challenging supply chain environment. turning to slide 17. our 2022 earnings per share outlook reflects the following assumptions: from an operational perspective, sales will increase as customer demand remains strong; pricing actions, along with manufacturing efficiencies, will offset cost pressures; sg&a reflects prudent investment in the business, including our new product development, engineering and digital initiatives and remains at 11% of sales. further, nonoperational impacts include unfavorable foreign exchange headwinds due to a lower euro exchange rate when compared to 2021.
in addition, we have an unfavorable tax impact as our full year effective tax rate is expected to normalize to approximately 20.5% as favorable discrete items from 2021 are not expected to repeat. these two items together amount to a $0.30 per share headwind. next, favorable interest and other expense due to lower debt levels and interest rates. finally, onetime items, both positive and negative related to our bond refinancing and genie administrative office relocation are not expected to reoccur.
taken together, these assumptions result in our 2022 earnings per share outlook of $3.55 to $4.05. this outlook is the best view at this time and can be impacted positively or negatively depending on how the supply chain develops in 2022. before i finish, i would like to thank john sheehan for his support and teaching me all things terex and leaving me such a strong finance team. happy retirement, duffy.
and with that, i will turn it back over to you, john.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, julie. turning to slide 18. looking ahead to 2022, let me provide you a few highlights from our execute, innovate, and grow strategy. execution is the foundation to deliver on our commitments to our team members, customers, and shareholders.
we must and will continue to drive operational improvements. turning to innovation. we are investing in new product development, whether it's electrification of our products or new end market applications, such as recycling and environmental. we're also investing in digital in multiple facets of the business, improving our internal business processes, and enhancing the ease of doing business with terex.
growing terex is a focus for all team members. we are investing in parts and service capabilities and expanding manufacturing capacity as we look to better serve our customers. we have a disciplined m&a process and are looking to grow from acquisitions. turning to slide 19 to conclude my prepared remarks.
terex is well positioned to deliver increased shareholder value in 2022 because we have strong businesses, strong brands, and strong market positions, upon which we can grow. we will continue to invest, including in new products and manufacturing capacity, where demand calls for it. and we have demonstrated resiliency and adaptability in a challenging environment. i am confident this will result in terex being an even stronger company.
and with that, let me turn it back to randy.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of nicole deblase with deutsche bank. your line is open.
nicole deblase -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yeah, thanks. good morning, guys.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, nicole.
nicole deblase -- deutsche bank -- analyst
so the 1q margins were definitely, i think, better than expected. but incrementally, inflation has stepped up versus when you guys provided your original outlook. so maybe you could talk a little bit about how the price cost equation is looking for the full year relative to how you were originally thinking about it?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, nicole. so the objective of our pricing strategy really across our global businesses is to offset material and logistics cost increases. we took pricing actions in late 2021 as inflation began to accelerate. but unfortunately, it was not enough.
and so, we had to take additional actions across the company in 2022. we are being transparent with our customers and our distribution partners regarding the level of inflation that we're seeing and why we need to take the additional pricing actions. i'll also comment that our supply chain teams are pushing back hard on our suppliers. but nonetheless, we are seeing inflationary impact.
and so, in the awp business, again, took pricing actions late '21, it was not enough. and so, we implemented further price actions in april to mitigate the inflationary pressures that we're seeing. and our outlook is, is that price realization will improve throughout the year. for awp, and this was consistent, nicole, we do anticipate being price cost negative in the first half of the year and price cost neutral for the full year as that price realization improves.
if we look at our mp business, mp has done a really good job, offsetting most of the material and logistics inflations that we've seen around the globe. and they've been dynamic in updating their pricing, and we expect that they will continue to be dynamic as we go forward. and even though their pricing has been more dynamic, as we know, we've seen greater inflationary pressures here this year as a result of the war in ukraine, which impacts our mp business given their production capacities in europe. and so, we're looking for them to also to have to take further price actions as we progress, and we're expecting mp for the full year to remain price cost neutral.
so again, that's our pricing actions. we're being transparent with customers, being clear of what we need and why we need to take these pricing actions. they're difficult conversations, but absolutely necessary given the unprecedented level of inflation we're seeing. so pricing is dynamic, and it's ongoing to offset these inflationary pressures that we're facing.
nicole deblase -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. thanks john. and just as a follow-up, i mean, one of your biggest competitors talked about actually taking surcharges this week, which is a total change in how the industry typically prices. and even adding those surcharges to equipment that's already in backlog, what is terex's approach to taking the incremental price increases that you just spoke about?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
our approach is price actions, you can call them surcharges or price increases. we did take the pricing actions for anything that had not been delivered. so anything delivered after mid-april in the genie business will carry the higher price. thanks, nicole.
appreciate it. operator, next question.

your next question comes from the line of steven volkmann with jefferies. your line is open.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning, folks. thanks for taking my question.
operator
good morning, stephen.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
maybe semi related, but i just want to sort of understand the moving parts here. so last quarter, you said you expected awp margins to be sort of low single digits in the first quarter. obviously, they came in better than that, even sort of subtracting your good guy that you described, julie. and i'm just curious what was better than you expected? was it price cost or just throughput, supplier availability? just what actually was better?
julie beck -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so steve, thanks for the question. we had a slightly higher volume, and we had a bit of a favorable product mix. we had some strong execution in price cost and really the team did an excellent job on strong expense management, both operating and sg&a costs were very favorable there.
we have a very strong cost control environment and they've done a really great job on managing costs. so all these things were very favorable. we did have some unfavorable exchange though, i wanted to make sure everybody knows of this. the dollar has strengthened.
the genie awp business in particular has been impacted by the strengthening of the dollar against the euro.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and i guess as we think about the second quarter, it sounds like you're kind of thinking margins are flattish sequentially, on what i assume is up revenue sequentially, but correct me if i'm wrong there. but that seems conservative or have things sort of deteriorated at the margin that that's sort of a more realistic outlook?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
go ahead, julie. i'll take the first part. steve, on the volume side, and we can talk a little bit more on the supply chain, but with the changes in china and the covid policies there, we have a large production facility that produces for china, but also exports out of china to the rest of the world other than the united states. and so, we're seeing some softness in production as a result of those covid.
so we're looking at probably flattish revenue year over year in the awp segment. and julie, you want to comment on the margin side?
julie beck -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. margins will be up slightly just due to a little bit more pricing actions coming through in the second quarter.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. thank you.

your next question is from the line of tami zakaria with j.p. morgan. your line is open.
tami zakaria -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for taking my question.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, tami.
tami zakaria -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good morning. how are you? given you have taken multiple price increases year-to-date, can you remind us what's the volume and price mix embedded for the full year, sales growth? and also, if you could remind us what the mix was in the first quarter's 16% growth you saw?
julie beck -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so thank you -- thanks very much for the question, tami. so we -- in the first quarter, we had more price than we had volume. so about -- and it was offset by fx of 3.5%.
so about two-thirds of our increase was related to price, a third of it was related to volume. and so, as we look at our full year, we'll see more pricing, we have higher costs offsetting that. we have unfavorable foreign exchange in the year and volume up a little bit more than what we gave you last time about 6%.
tami zakaria -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. thank you. and also, can you talk about the recent northern ireland steel fabricator acquisition? anything you can share on what kind of sales and margin accretion you expect over time? and how this fits into the overall portfolio?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, tami. yes, the recent acquisition we made, really, it's a vertical integration play. we needed to take control. they're a heavy fabricator manufacturer.
we've been doing business with them for quite some time. and we needed to be -- to ensure our growth in our mp business there in northern ireland where they're crushing and screening products, we needed to control the fabrications. and so, there was going to be a change of control in the business, and we felt it was appropriate for us to control that fabricator to ensure that we have the growth that we need going forward. so it really is -- it's a vertical integration play, tami, to control our supply chain.
tami zakaria -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thank you so much.

your next question comes from the line of david raso with evercore isi. your line is open.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi. good morning. so it appears all the math, and i know corporate expense goes down sequentially because of the one-off item in 1q. but it seems like puts and takes 2qs maybe around $0.85 or so.
what i'm trying to understand is then the back half of the year, you would need roughly about $2.20 to get to the midpoint of the guide. and that just feels like a tug of war between price cost improvement and then the negative, in particular, the china lockdowns and russia-ukraine fall out, especially on your cost structure in europe. can you help us a little bit quantify how you're thinking about the guide in that back half when it comes to -- and i know it's hard to predict, but i mean, is there some work around a little bit around the china lockdown to some degree or some assumption of handling the lockdowns in a different way or just assuming there's some opening? and then the russia-ukraine fall out, i guess, particularly that would hurt the mp profitability. so just trying to think about the second half earnings being above the first half with those tug of wars, price cost to positive versus those two obvious negatives of the lockdown in the russia-ukraine situation?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, david. and you're right, price cost, given the pricing actions, we need to see improvement in the back half of the year, clearly on the price/cost side. i think, david, really, the way we're looking at it is it's really this is not a demand issue, it's a supply issue.
and what we're doing is we're looking at what's the demonstrated capacity of our suppliers, and we've built our outlook around that demonstrated capacity. they've demonstrated $1 billion, $1.1 billion type of level of capacity to meet our needs. and so, we've built our outlook around that. and in terms of the supply chain, supply chain performance, we didn't see an improvement in the supply chain in the first quarter.
as a matter of fact, we saw some deterioration in performance. we're anticipating in other parts of the world, we do see a slight improvement, but not substantial improvement in the supply chain to meet our forecasted needs. a bit of a challenge right now is covid in china. it has impacted our facility.
the good news is, is we haven't been shut down completely, but we have had rolling shutdowns based on the ability to have material in the plant so our team member can work. our suppliers are experiencing similar phenomenon. and so, based on the best information available, that's how we've laid out our outlook for the second half of the year, and it's really in that $1.1 billion kind of range, and that's the demonstrated capacity that suppliers have exhibited, frankly, for the last couple of quarters, and we're not anticipating a significant improvement. now, if we do get a significant improvement, clearly, the demand is there and we'll be able to produce and deliver more.
but right now, the constraint is the supply chain and the new variable here in the last 60 days, 30 days is really the china covid policy and what impact that has on the global supply chain. and so, that's obviously what we're managing, and we believe our outlook comprehends the best available information available.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
yes. and i'm just trying to think of it mathematically. if it's sort of like $0.85. 2q has to go up roughly call it $0.20, $0.15 sequentially to get to that sort of $1.10 run rate in the back half.
every 100 bps of price cost improvement is about $0.10, right? so it seems like there's a couple of hundred bp of improvement in price cost, and then just hopefully a little improvement in the lockdown situation. is that the rough math on how to think about the swing from the first half negative price cost to second half positive price cost. it's at least a couple of hundred basis points, and that kind of gets you the incremental eps.
julie beck -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so david, you're correct. what we'll see for awp is the operating margins of 7.8% to 8.5%, and it improves sequentially over time as price realization improves throughout the remainder of the year. and for the mp business, operating margins remain relatively flat in that 14% to 14.5% for the year. they just continue to do an outstanding job each quarter.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. so the awp price cost swing is the major driver for the back half and then mp will obviously see what happens with the russia-ukraine situation, but that's sort of the delta, right? if you can get some lockdown help that obviously helps awp volume on top of the price cost and then the russia fall out, obviously, on the cost side for mp, where you've already taken the margins sort of down to a lower than previously expected, right? just the idea of sort of flattish the rest of the year, roughly speaking. so --
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
ok. that's a fair assessment, david.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you very much.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thank you.

your next question is from the line of jamie cook with credit suisse. your line is open.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. good morning, and nice quarter.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, jamie.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
my question is on backlog on awp. obviously, i think you're at $2.3 billion, which suggests you're starting to take orders for 2023. can you just sort of help us understand how contractually, one, whether you are? and how you're contractually making sure we don't have price protecting yourself, right? so we don't have price cost headwinds in 2023, whether you have any surcharges in there or contract relief for 2023? and then since you announced the april price increase, have you seen any change in order patterns as a result of that?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, jamie. i'll answer the questions in reverse order there. and i can say this broadly across the globe, we haven't seen any significant order installations as a result of the price actions that we've been taking. of course, there are pockets at times.
we saw some in our utilities business based on municipal contracts. but in those cases, actually, it went to rebid, and we were able to win the bid. in terms of the genie or the aerials business, the good news is we are seeing quite strong demand. our rental companies are in really good position.
they're seeing record levels of utilization. their business is strong. we're entering into the replacement cycle. and i think the replacement cycle is going to continue.
and i think it's probably going to continue to be pushed a little bit to the right because of the industry's ability to meet the demand from a capacity standpoint. so we are having discussions with customers. we do have orders that are flowing into 2023. the way in which we have handled it is we have provided indicative pricing that is provisional and that will be reviewed at the end of the year as we get closer to the time of actual production in the beginning of delivery.
so we are not locking in pricing for 2023 at this time. we've provided provisional indicative pricing for all customers that are interested. they are taking some production slots, but we have the ability to go back at the end of the year and adjust prices based on what the material and material conditions are at that point in time in the year and into 2023, i might add.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
john, just as a follow-up, in terms of who's coming in for 2023, is it the nationals? or is it pretty broad-based across your customer base? and then i'll get back in the queue. thanks.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
jamie, it's really broad-based. so it's across all customer segments and north america, european-based, principally right now in north america, but we're seeing strong demand all over the world right now in genie, with the exception of china. so it's broad-based across the customer segment.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst

your next question is from the line of stan elliott with stifel. your line is open.
stan elliott -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. thank you, guys, for taking my question. a quick question on the franna business. it's been a great product, great margins for you guys, taking it into china.
what sort of investments will be required from you all there? can you build it within some of your existing facilities? just curious how that will eventually ramp?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so you're right, franna is a great business down in australia, and we're seeing some real strength. again, there's positives and negatives great high commodity prices around the world for mining lead to strong business for us with franna. and it's actually going to india.
so what the team has done is -- and we're the clear market leader in pick & carry in australia, but it's a much smaller market. and so, the team has taken the fundamentals of the front of design and we're moving it to our facility in hosur, localizing it, done a great job localizing it and building it there. we had expanded one of our manufacturing facilities in hosur. so right now, they're going into the existing facility.
we will need if we're as successful as we think we will be, we will need to add to the capacity that we have there stand in hosur. and again, it will be modest levels of investment. but again, excited to see that that's a great example of growth, product line extension, regional growth that the mp team is really good at, and we're excited to see what happens. and the reception thus far has been quite positive.
and again, it's the world's largest pick & carry market. so we're excited to see if we can drive some incremental growth and profitability in india with our franna product line.
stan elliott -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
and switching gears, maybe a little bit about what's happening on the m&a environment. curious if the transaction from the other week, is that really more, was that with moving more into fabrication? would you still like to be more expansive within the product categories that you're operating more on the mp side? just curious if that marked a shift change or if there's kind of more opportunistic?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
so we obviously -- we have a bias toward growth now with capital deployment. so if you look at the investments we're making for organic growth, a fairly substantial in our systems and technology for organic growth. we also have done several smaller acquisitions over the course of the last year. we are building an active m&a pipeline.
our principal focuses are in and around the mp businesses and the verticals that we compete in in mp. with the market structure, we think there's going to be opportunity. so we have an active m&a pipeline that we're active on. and in this particular case, it's really tied to, yes, to some extent, it was opportunistic.
but to a broader extent, we wanted to make sure we controlled our ability to a critical part of our business. and key heavy fabricators are very important to our growth for our mp business. and so, it was opportunistic key area for us, and we felt the vertical integration there in northern ireland was important to have that ability to grow going forward. so that's why we made the acquisition stand.
stan elliott -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
perfect. thank so much for the time and congratulations, and best of luck.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, stan.

your next question comes from the line of steven fisher with ubs. your line is open.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
thanks. good morning. i wonder if you could just give us a little more color from the front lines of the supply chain situation. is this still a seven-day, a week frenzy kind of dynamic? or is any of it normalized a bit? and i guess related to this, on china, how much of the concern here is just concern that it might have a more global impact versus just within china? or are you already seeing it have a global impact on the supply chain?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
so the supply chain environment still is incredibly dynamic. when you look at supplier on-time delivery performance, we have not seen -- good news is it hasn't deteriorated significantly, but it hasn't improved. so on any given day, we literally have hundreds of parts that are late or not where they need to be in our facilities around the world. so the teams are doing a heck of a job adapting to that environment.
so we have not seen a significant improvement in the supply chain. we did see a build in what we call hospital inventory, almost a $40 million increase, and that represents inventory that's substantially complete, awaiting one or two components that we can complete and ship. and so, the team still dealing with that phenomenon, and we would have never spoke about hospital inventory prior to this experience. but that's the environment that the team is dealing with.
and so, it really is resilient adaptability staying close to suppliers, getting the best information available as soon as possible and then adjusting your production schedules to maximize our production and limit the disruption to a certain extent, but it's disruptive every single day. and the covid situation in china, it has clearly impacted our plant. the good news is we're not in a region where our plant has been shut down for a month. it's been able to operate, but we are seeing and we have situations where suppliers are giving us a heads up that their second or third tier suppliers are struggling right now, and that's going to impact their deliveries to us.
so again, it's just another variable that the teams have to manage. and the good news, though, in china is when our team members can work, we have 99% plus attendance, and they want to work all the hours that are required to make it up. and so, once they get some freedom of movement in china, it will recover quite quickly. now, you got to deal with the logistics and all that sort of thing, but that's the good news in this challenging scenario is once the policies change china will recover quickly.
the question is how long do they -- are we in this zero tolerance, zero covid and what impact does that have. and it really is city by city, plant by plant. and so, that's why it remains dynamic. and again, our team is doing a heck of a job managing through that, not just in china, but on a global basis.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
ok. and just can you remind us what your position is on steel costs for the second half of the year versus the first half?
julie beck -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so our original outlook, we had talked about at $1,800 in the first half for hot-rolled coil in the u.s. going down to $1,200 in the second half. that assumption is now $1,800 in the first half down to -- up to $1,400 in the second half.

steve barger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, steve.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
your comments on challenged incremental margin, especially in the first half were totally understandable. my question is, if you come in at high teens this year, for argument sake, does that rebound above the target range next year, meaning that as you get a handle on price and supply chain, you would expect to run further into the 30%-plus range to kind of get to a two-year average on that target?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
so i'll take the first one, steve, and i'll let julie jump in. honestly, our target as a manufacturer is 25% incremental. as we said, clearly challenged in the first half of the year above that target in the second half of the year, we'll see as we move into 2023. clearly, in the awp segment, we need to be looking at something north of 25% to get to the margin levels that we think that business should operate in.
on the mp side, their consistent level of operating margin. sometimes they fall a little short of that 25% target. but as julie said, that's because of some of the investments we're making. so the 25% target is our target, and we'll see as we move into 2023.
but clearly, in the awp segment, we're going to have to do better than that to get back to the margin levels that we think the business should enjoy.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
understood. thanks. and you talked about the fuchs operating hours being up and driving the parts business. how does fuchs compare to, say, screening in terms of driving aftermarket parts? and can higher operating hours across the installed base really drive a material benefit to earnings? or is that just more of a modest tailwind?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
so the highest parts usage is obviously the heavy screens and crushers, just given the nature of ground engaging. but the operating hours of our fuchs machines in terms of hours run on the engines and movement is actually the highest. so we -- they do generate a nice parts revenue stream. a lot of the strategies that we've put in place are driving incremental revenue in our parts business margins of -- again, we have to take the same pricing actions there.
so it's a modest tailwind for us as we go forward. but we do think there's ability to continue to grow our parts and service business across the globe. thanks, steve.

hey. good morning, guys. i wanted to ask a question about europe specifically. just the demand environment in europe and your ability to get pricing, is it -- are you getting pricing the same levels that you're getting in north america? thank you.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks. in terms of the pricing actions, the pricing actions are regional based on the specific cost needs in the regional markets. for both awp and mp business, they are taking pricing actions around the globe specific to the respective products in the region. so the pricing actions do vary, and we are seeking price increases in europe, both in the awp business and the mp business as we go forward.
seth weber -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
how would you characterize the demand levels in europe relative to north america? or any sort of impact that you're seeing on a demand perspective with respect to the war?

jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst

john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning. 
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
john, i'm wondering if you can -- john, can you talk about your handling of the current supply chain headwinds in china given the experience that the organization has gained over the past three years dealing with these rolling shutdowns globally. how much more global is your supply base today as you drill down and look at core underlying components, third-tier suppliers? can you just talk about that dynamic, it feels like you're in a better position today than over the past couple of years, given the work the organization has done, but maybe you could quantify the supply base and provide some more color on that?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i mean, the team has done over the last several years, a tremendous work on the strategic sourcing initiative. and it really is a globalized supply base. now, with that, came manufacturer suppliers in china and especially around castings, hydraulic components and some electronic components.
china is a world leader in those categories. so those are categories where we have seen some disruption associated with covid. and again, that's what we'll be watching quite closely. the work the team has done, consolidating suppliers, identifying primary suppliers and growth suppliers who've been able to move.
and again, this tight supply environment has been challenged, but where we need to move some supply or increase capacity. we have had some success there. and most importantly, i would say, is that just the level of importance that we are to the supply base has enabled senior-level dialogue because i'm spending a lot of time on the supply base side and the strategic sourcing initiative that we underwent allowed me to have those relationships that i think are critical in this time period to ensure that our suppliers understand the impact that they're having on our business and to making sure that the suppliers are utilizing all resources available to help break the constraints that have been applied. and we've seen some amazing work done by the teams from an engineering redesign standpoint and done things safely and properly tested in time frames that we wouldn't have thought possible.
prior to this pandemic. so i would say that strategic sourcing enabled us to have those relationships that we needed through the organizations. we're more important to these suppliers and it's clearly helped. now, with the level of disruption they're experiencing, their on-time delivery performance is not anywhere near where we would like, but that's one of the things we discuss with when we have our senior level meetings.
so again, i think we've made progress. we are localizing some. as i mentioned in my opening comments, we are localizing some in mexico. we think mexico will be a good supply base for us to support not only our mexico operations, but also our u.s.-based operations.
so you will see us moving some from asia into mexico as we go through the coming years because we think that's a quite attractive place for us to be going forward. so that's, jerry, kind of around the world on supply chain, if you will.
jerry revich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
i appreciate it. and i'm wondering, john, now that you have all of the telematics data in place, can you just talk about how in europe utilization has evolved year-to-date, given the disturbance in energy prices? and obviously, the war, can you just talk about what the utilization has looked like in awp in europe in the quarter versus normal seasonality through april, if you can share it?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
right. so just looking at the graph as we speak, we saw good utilization increase in general and actually january and february. we did see it decline slightly in march in a little bit more in april. now, again, we're not seeing in north america, especially, we're not seeing the normal seasonality impact because the demand is so strong, but we did see a little bit of come down in operating hours in april in europe based on our telematics data.

john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, randy, and good morning. i'd like to welcome everyone to our earnings call and appreciate your interest in terex. i would like to begin by thanking all terex team members for their efforts in this challenging global operating environment with production disruptions and covid impact. team members are working diligently to improve our performance for customers and shareholders.
we are seeing strong global customer demand in our business. bookings of $1.8 billion increased 19% year over year. record backlog of $3.5 billion increased 17% sequentially and 73% compared to prior year. the global operating environment has become increasingly difficult and unpredictable.
with that said, our supply chain team members are working hard to minimize production disruption and to deliver for our customers. next, let me take a moment to address the war and its impact on terex. first, our thoughts are with the ukrainian people. during the first quarter, we stopped accepting new orders from russia and belarus.
we have no manufacturing and limited historical sales into russia, belarus and ukraine. however, the recent increases in commodity prices, energy costs and logistics resulting from the war are adversely impacting the company. despite these challenges, terex team members have worked together to drive our strategic priorities, execution, purposeful innovation and growth. turning to slide three.
we are proud of all terex team members who are keeping themselves and others safe. i would like to thank our team members around the world for their continued commitment to our zero harm safety culture and terex way values. safety remains a top priority of the company, driven by think safe, work safe, home safe. our strong commitment to zero harm is driving improvement of safety metrics such as total recordable incident rate, which has significantly improved over the past six years.
this is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team members. please turn to slide four. our strong environmental, social and governance programs deliver stakeholder value. we continue to progress on our esg journey with leadership from our board of directors and executive leadership team.
during each quarterly investor call, we will feature one of our pillars of our esg strategy, and we will report progress. this quarter, we are highlighting social responsibility, which includes diversity, equity and inclusion, or dei, employee engagement and community support. i am proud that many of our team members are actively participating in our affinity groups, which includes veterans, women, working parents, pride and non-majority team members. for example, our working parents group is very active in supporting each other during this demanding time for working families.
in addition, 3,000 team members participated in our march international women's day events throughout the world. our goal is to capture the full potential of terex by making sure every voice is heard and team members feel valued and welcome. affinity groups give team members an opportunity to support one another, grow their networks and provide education. each of our executive leadership team members is sponsoring one of our eight global affinity groups.
one of our objectives is to drive action around social responsibility, including increasing email and non-majority representations throughout the company. our executive team's compensation is aligned with these goals. i want to recognize our team members' impact on their communities, which clearly demonstrates that terex way values its fixmanship and service leadership. our materials process from team members in india are partnering with local nongovernmental organizations to fund children's rights and education.
our noida team members will participate this quarter and a habitat for humanity project and environmental cleanup. also team members in the company have donated to the ukrainian relief efforts. we are pleased with our progress on our esg goals. please turn to slide five to review our financial highlights.
the team delivered solid financial results for the quarter. sales of $1 billion were driven by continued strong global customer demand with continued crude cost management. operating margin of 7.4% improved year over year, and earnings per share of $0.74 increased 32% compared to prior year. overall, first quarter financial performance demonstrated continued strong execution of our team members in a dynamic and ever challenging operating environment.
please turn to slide six. our mp segment is a diversified, high-performing portfolio of businesses. mp's brands have leading market positions with excellent end market, product and geographic diversification. mp's global demand remains strong, demonstrated by a 24% increase in bookings and a record backlog of $1.2 billion, up 66% year over year.
our powerscreen and finlay brands are benefiting from strong global aggregate demand. we have leading market positions with our mobile crushing and screening products. growth of environmental and waste recycling solutions is driving demand for our ecotec and cbi products. the mp team has taken existing product designs and modifying them to service the fast-growing environmental and waste recycling markets.
the strength of residential construction is driving demand for our cement products as u.s. housing inventory is being replenished. our advanced mixer business has launched new products and features. our fuchs material handlers are benefiting from high scrap steel prices.
in addition, fuchs machines operating hours are higher, which drives parts revenue. the strength of commodity prices is driving demand for front of pick & carry cranes in australia. this product is being redesigned for the growing indian market, which is the largest pick & carry crane market in the world. mp's end market diversification is a strength.
all these markets are growing and provide strong demand for our leading mp brand. mp's end markets are also strong, demonstrated by a 16% increase in bookings and a record backlog of $2.3 billion, up 77% year over year. construction, infrastructure and industrial applications are driving demand for genie solutions. applications for genie products include data centers, warehouses and manufacturing facilities.
the replacement cycle in north america and europe is positive as fleets age and customers have strong utilization rates. globally, increased adoption continues to improve labor efficiency and job site safety. except for china, demand ran strong for genie products in all regions. our utilities business will benefit from the electric grid expansion, as well as anticipated infrastructure bill related spending in 2023.
further, the business will participate in the demand for 5g telecom across the united states. the business has robust demand as customers look to reserve multiyear production slides. our new state-of-the-art watertown, south dakota facility has the capacity to support this growth. turning to slide seven.
our execute, innovation and growth strategy will continue to strengthen our operations in 2022 and allow the company to capitalize on strong demand in our end markets. first, the team continues expansion into new markets and geographies, which has high growth potential, including recycling, material handling and electrification. mp continues to build out prostack, bulk handling product offerings and distribution channels. this is an excellent adjacency to our existing material handling solutions.
in awp, the genie substation utility boom demonstrates partnership between our genie and utilities business, to deliver a new insulated boom for electric substations where an operator cannot use the bucket trucks. our parts and service teams are investing in digital offerings for dealers and customers, including my terex and lift connect. enhanced features include improved service analytics, allowing customers to maintain their equipment and reduce downtime, timely information such as utilization rates and fuel consumption improves customer operating performance, online product information and intuitive parts and service order functionality. more than 60,000 machines are fitted with this technology and more enhancements are under development.
we are also expanding our utilities customer service footprint with the new atlanta facility. in addition to technology and customer experience, we continue to invest for growth, both organically and inorganically. in february, we made an investment in viatec with their plug-and-play electronic power take-off system. this demonstrates our commitment to support the electrification of utility fleets that allows trucks to operate without engine.
this solution supports our customers' esg needs by eliminating noise and carbon emissions. it also lowers operating costs and extends the life of utility equipment by reducing engine operating hours. this week, we announced the acquisition of a heavy fabrications manufacturer based in northern ireland. this purchase supports mp's growth strategy by increasing fabrication capabilities and capacity.
these actions and investments demonstrate our commitment to executing on attractive growth priorities that support our strategy. turning to slide eight. an important part of terex's organic growth is our new monterrey, mexico facility. i recently visited the temporary facility where our highly engaged and talented genie team members are currently producing telehandlers.
the team is building a strong operational foundation based on the zero harm safety culture and terex way values. i also visited the site of the permanent facility, which is early in the construction phase and progressing well. local supply chain development is also underway. the monterrey team came together over the past year from multiple industries, and they are doing an incredible job.
it has been great to see the excellent teamwork among our local monterrey, broader genie. and corporate teams, working together to create a world-class manufacturing facility. please turn to slide nine. geopolitical issues and local covid policies are causing increased disruptions and significant cost increases in materials, logistics, freight, energy and labor.
these headwinds have constrained our growth. however, we are aggressively managing these challenges. in the quarter, covid cases continued to increase. at terex, we had more cases in q1 2022 than we had during the full year of 2021.
this adversely impacted production and efficiencies at our facilities, as well as our suppliers. towards the end of q1, china covid policy started causing a significant disruption to our changzhou and jiading facilities. this is also impacting many of our china-based suppliers, further increasing disruption in our global supply chain and logistics. the team is battling headwinds every day by mitigating cost pressures and minimizing production disruption by staying close to the suppliers and expanding our supply base.
we did that in confidence to maximize availability of critical inputs to improve production, providing transparent communications of delivery and cost headwinds to our customers and implementing price increases in response to inflationary cost pressures. in this dynamic environment, our operations, sales and customer service team members are demonstrating resilience and flexibility to increase production deliveries for our customers to overcome these global challenges. and with that, i'll turn it over to julie.
julie beck -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, john, and good morning, everyone. let's take a look at our first quarter financial performance found on slide 10. we reported sales of $1 billion, up 16% year over year, primarily due to increased volume and price. foreign currency translation negatively impact sales by $32 million or approximately 3.5% in the quarter as the euro weakened against the dollar.
gross margins declined by 180 basis points in the quarter as pricing actions partially offset cost increases. our awp business recognized $3 million of benefits related to prior periods from the reinstatement of tariff exclusions and a business tax refund. recall that we were not able to ship all 2021 priced orders in 2021 due to component availability. input costs for steel, hydraulics, engines, brakes, and logistics have increased on a year-over-year basis, on a sequential basis and since our last earnings call.
despite the highly inflationary environment, sg&a expense was $3 million lower than the prior year. sg&a percentage of sales of 11.1% improved by 210 basis points from the prior year as strip expense management control continued. operating margins of 7.4% was up 30 basis points compared to the prior year and up 40 basis points sequentially through disciplined cost control. first quarter operating profit was $75 million compared to $62 million in the prior year.
current quarter operating profit included $5 million of charges in corporate and other associated with restructuring, severance and litigation charges related to former product lines. interest and other expense was approximately $4 million lower than q1 of 2021, primarily due to reduced interest expense on debt levels that were lowered by $239 million. the first quarter 2022 global effective tax rate was approximately 18.5% as we recorded favorable discrete items in the quarter. our global effective tax rate estimate for the year remains at 20.5%, consistent with our previous outlook.
first quarter earnings per share of $0.74 increased 32%, representing an $0.18 improvement over last year. the financial callout had a $0.02 per share negative impact in the quarter. incremental margins of 9% for the quarter were below our target of 25%. as we discussed in february, in the first half of the year, our incremental margin framework of 25% is challenged as inflation continues to escalate.
our return on invested capital remains strong at 19.2%. free cash flow for the quarter was negative $72 million, which was consistent with past historical patterns for the first quarter. we have not yet received an approved $39 million irs refund. i will discuss free cash flow in more detail later in my prepared remarks.
let's look at our segment results, starting with our materials processing segment found on slide 11. pictured here on the slide are excellent examples of our growth investments in mp, our ecotec recycling product line and terex washing systems. mp had another strong quarter with sales of $453 million, up 20% compared to the first quarter of 2021. and the business ended the quarter with a backlog of $1.2 billion, up 66% from a year ago.
booking activity was particularly strong in our aggregate and environmental businesses. in these challenging markets, mp increased our operating profit by 31% in the quarter and reported operating margins of 14.2%, up from last year by 120 basis points and sequentially by 40 basis points. mp has been able to show consistent performance even in this inflationary environment. the team continues their excellent operational execution.
on slide 12, see our aerial work platforms segment financial results. awp sales of $552 million increased by 16% compared to prior year. awp first quarter bookings of $1.1 billion were up 16% year over year with particularly strong booking activity in the utilities business. backlog at quarter end was $2.3 billion, up 77% from the prior year.
both genie and utilities have taken multiple price actions over the course of 2021 and 2022 to address inflationary cost pressures. awp delivered operating margins of 5.9% in the quarter, up from last year by 30 basis points and sequentially by 110 basis points driven by strict expense management. excluding the financial call out benefits in the quarter, operating margins were consistent with the prior year. the genie and utility teams are working diligently to deliver every day.
i am proud to work with them as we continue to drive operational improvement. please see slide 13 for an overview of our disciplined capital allocation. to provide you some color on our free cash flow performance. historically, the business is in a negative free cash flow position in the first quarter.
in the first quarter of 2021, our free cash flow was positively impacted by $15 million of tax refunds and $7 million of net benefits from the sale of our tfs portfolio. q1 2022 has improved when compared to our historical performance in the first quarters of 2019 and 2020. free cash flow in the quarter of negative $72 million was adversely impacted by increased inventories of $108 million. the higher inventory levels were a result of a $42 million increase in hospital inventories awaiting installation of final components and a $44 million increase in raw materials to support our backlog.
now, let me detail some uses of our cash in the quarter. we continue to reinvest in our business with capital expenditures and technology investments of $23 million. a large portion of our capital expenditures is related to our modern mexico facility. returning cash to our shareholders is an important element of our disciplined capital allocation strategy.
the company increased its quarterly dividend per share in february to $0.13, an 8.3% increase. in addition, we completed $18 million of share repurchases in the quarter, and we believe that terex shares are an attractive investment. we had $122 million remaining on our share repurchase program. finally, the company has significantly delevered over the past four years and strengthened its balance sheet.
outstanding gross debt has been reduced by $738 million since the first quarter of 2019, a 50% decrease and $239 million since the first quarter of 2021 or a 24% decrease. we have no near-term maturities until 2024 and 81% of our debt is at a fixed rate until the end of the decade. our net leverage remains low at 1.35x, which is well below our two and a half times target through the cycle. we have ample liquidity of $753 million.
the company is in an excellent position to run and grow the business. now, turning to slide 14. we are reaffirming our full year company and segment 2022 outlook that we shared with you in february. supply chain challenges continue, but inflation pressures, geopolitical uncertainty and highly restrictive china covid policies have gotten worse since we've last spoke to you.
it is important to recognize this unprecedented environment could change this outlook positively or negatively. our performance in the first quarter was better than expected. as for commercial demand, we continue to see strong bookings activity in the first quarter. we ended the quarter with backlog of $3.5 billion.
however, our sales outlook reflects the latest dialogue with our suppliers. sales are not a function of demand, but rather the ability of the supply chain to deliver components. we have the internal capacity to produce more and have demonstrated such in the past. operating margins are expected to steadily increase throughout the year as price cost dynamics improve.
mp's margins of 14% to 14.5% will be relatively balanced throughout the year. awp's operating margin of 7.8% to 8.5% reflect price realization improving throughout the remainder of the year. in the second quarter, we expect awp's operating margins in the mid-single digits. operating margins are expected to improve in the third and fourth quarters as pricing actions take effect.
with that said, incremental margins in the first half of the year are anticipated to be negative but improved in the second half and be above our 25% target. mp had an outstanding second quarter in 2021 with operating margins of 16.4%. so the business has a difficult year-over-year comp for the second quarter of 2022. in addition, mp's incremental margins are negatively impacted by investments in new products and manufacturing capacity.
awp also had a strong second quarter in 2021, delivering 11% operating margin as sales recovered and there were minimal inflationary pressures. therefore, unfavorable price cost dynamics in the first half of 2022 will result in incremental margins below our target but increasing to above our targets in the second half of the year. turning to free cash flow. we expect improved free cash flow in the next three quarters, and we reaffirm our $175 million to $225 million outlook.
finally, i would like to reaffirm our earnings per share outlook of $3.55 to $4.05. and with that, i will turn it back to you, john.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, julie. turning to slide 15 to conclude my prepared remarks. terex is well-positioned to deliver increased shareholder value because we have strong businesses, strong brands and strong market positions, combined with record backlog upon which we can grow. we will continue to invest in new products and manufacturing capacity along with strategic inorganic growth.
we will continue to execute our disciplined capital allocation strategy, and we have demonstrated resiliency and adaptability in an increasingly challenging environment. i am confident this will result in terex being an even stronger company. and with that, let me turn it back to randy.
randy wilson -- director of investor relations
thanks, john. [operator instructions] with that, i'd like to open it up for questions. operator?
",2022-Q1,TEX
1.0,0.83175,":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from stephen volkmann from jefferies. please go ahead. your line is open.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
hey. good morning, everybody. thanks for taking the question. going around maybe slightly left field, but i'm curious if you can just comment around sort of the ramp-up in monterrey, your plans for that, sort of how that progresses? and i guess what i'm really trying to think about is what's the margin impact of that over the next medium term as that ramps up?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks for the question, stephen. as we indicated, and julie said, monterrey, mexico is one of our major capital investments for the year and important to us. i think the team is doing a really good job in a challenging environment. the project is on time and in budget.
we completed the telehandler move from our oklahoma city facility. so we stopped the telehandler production in oklahoma city and moved that to mexico, monterrey, into the temporary facility. so the primary facility and permanent facility is under construction and doing well. at the same time, we're moving other product lines in mexico as well.
those are products that were originally scheduled to be manufactured in china, but we moved into mexico, and some of the products in the redmond facility, where labor is tight, we're moving into the mexico facility. and again, that is on time and on schedule. commensurate with that, we're also developing our mexico supply chain, and we think that's also going to provide a competitive advantage for us as we go forward. what we've said there, steve, in terms of the margin improvement of mexico is, over the next couple of years, '24, '25 time frame, when it's complete and the transition and movement of product lines in there, we anticipate about a 200 basis point overall margin improvement in our genie business as a result of the complete utilization, if you will, of the monterrey facility.
so again, we think this is going to help improve our global cost competitiveness, position us to be affected in the north american market. and again, the team is doing a really good job in a challenging environment, not just challenging to manufacture things, it's challenging to build things and the projects on schedule, on budget. and the other thing we're excited about, steve, is our ability to attract incredible talent, both managerial talent and direct labor talent in monterrey, mexico area. so project is going really well.
and like i say, over the next several years, we anticipate it's going to add 200 basis points of margin improvement in the genie business.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
super. i appreciate it. and then my follow-on, just on hospital inventory, john, can you just sort of comment on the trends that you're seeing there? if it's changed in terms of what is missing or anything? and then how you see that progressing toward the end of the year, and i'll pass it on.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, steve. so yes, we're still talking about hospital inventory. and we, like many manufacturing companies, have continued to experience disruption. in terms of the components, i don't think it's a word unique in the sense that we're dealing with electronic components, doing a lot of work there.
engines driven by electronic components are creating challenges, and then hydraulic systems are really the three principal areas that we're dealing with. the team is aggressively managing it. we've got an escalation process up to and including me. so i spend a lot of time during the week dealing with supply chain issues.
what we saw, steve is that we saw the inventory cost, we saw hospital inventories climb. really, in the first week of june, they were up to about over $100 million. the team did a good job over the last three weeks of the quarter, brought it down into that $60 million, $62 million range. so it's up about $12 million quarter-over-quarter, but it did peak at over $100 million during the quarter.
so that describes the disruption that the teams are dealing with and what we're having to overcome to deliver for our customers. and again, i want to congratulate our teams. it's an incredibly challenging environment, but they're demonstrating resiliency and adaptability and finding ways to deliver products for our customers, but we're still experiencing disruption. and in terms of what we're anticipating, steve, for the rest of the year, if you look at our outlook, we're kind of in that $1.1 billion range of revenue.
so we're not assuming any significant improvement in the supply chain over the back half of the year. we are assuming that the hospital inventory comes down a little bit from where we are, helps drive some improvement in free cash flow, but we're not assuming that the hospital inventory goes dramatically better than where we are right now as a result of the disruptions we're continuing to see.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks, john. appreciate it.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer

our next question comes from nicole deblase from deutsche bank. please go ahead. your line is open.
nicole deblase -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi. thanks. good morning.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, nicole.
nicole deblase -- deutsche bank -- analyst
maybe just first starting with -- you guys provided some good color on how you're thinking about the cadence of margins in the back half of the year for both segments, but can you just give us a sense of what you're thinking with respect to the revenue cadence between 3q and 4q?
julie beck -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
nicole, so as we think about our operating flows and our revenue, we've been doing consistently with the supply chain. remember, our sales forecast is a function of supply chain, not as customer demand. so we think about our supply chain being in that one -- $1 billion to $1.1 billion is what we've been doing for the last six or seven quarters. so we're forecasting a slight increase in q3 and q4, but relatively consistent with what we've done, a slight uptick in q3 and q4.
nicole deblase -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. thanks, julie. and then i guess maybe on the mp side, the margins looked really strong during the quarter. was there anything kind of unique going on or onetime in nature? just trying to think about how the 2q performance balances against a step down in margins in the back half.
julie beck -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so overall, for terex, our operating margins are expected to slightly increase throughout the year. and for q2, mp had an outstanding second quarter with margins of 16.5%. and their performance -- we've increased the margin outlook for that business from 14.8% to 15.3% for the remainder of the year. we would anticipate relatively balanced margins in the second half of the year with continued year-over-year improvement.
the quarter benefited significantly from favorable geographic and product mix. and the second half of the year is expected to be impacted by typical holiday and summer factory shutdown, maybe not as favorable product and regional mix. and then we'll have some increasing investments that we think are important for that business in technology, engineering, r&d, and digital customer solutions as well.
nicole deblase -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks, julie.
operator
our next question comes from stanley elliott from stifel. please go ahead. your line is open.
stanley elliot -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hey. good morning, john and julie. thank you guys for taking the question.
julie beck -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
stanley elliot -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
john, could you just go back and talk a little bit about the acculon investment? you mentioned a third of the genie booms, two-thirds of the scissors. how quickly can you accelerate the electric offering within kind of the awp segment? and then how fast can you take that technology and put into other products that you have?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
right. and you're right, we just announced the investment in acculon, and we think it really does help them accelerate. and of course, genie, starting from a position of leadership and electrification within the industry. and acculon brings 13-plus years of experience at operating at the forefront of battery solutions, not just lithium-ion, but advanced battery solutions.
and what the investment does for us, it brings that technology and knowledge with our existing knowledge. but it also -- what acculon does, stan, is they're also very good at certifying technology. and so that's the competency that's important, because you can have the greatest technology in the world, but if you can't certify it cost effectively and timely, you can't get it into the market. so they're going to help with that.
they also bring some artificial intelligence capabilities that we think we're going to be able to use, and some cloud-based technology that we think we're going to be able to use. so we think this will help accelerate our offering in the marketplace. and the good news is, we're starting from a position of strength. and again, we think this will accelerate.
and to your second question, as we work with acculon and our technology centers, we'll also look for how can we utilize that technology in other areas of our business throughout utilities and mp as well. so it's starting with genie, but very quickly we will leverage that across the portfolio. and then last but not least, it's an investment. so we also captured the benefit of -- as this company grows and expands, we get the service provider that we need, but we also will benefit from the financial reward of this company growing, and we think it's going to have a substantial growth over the coming years.
stanley elliot -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great. and then you mentioned $600 million of kind of mp and awp revenues or, i guess, looking out beyond 12 months, how do you think about pricing for these longer-dated sorts of delivered items kind of given the volatility that we've seen here in the marketplace recently?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thanks. and you're right. we are taking orders.
we have backlog that goes into 2023. and again, that's a function of strong customer demand across the portfolio of businesses. if we look at how are we doing in mp, mp's lead times now are significantly longer than our historical averages given the strong backlog that we've had. mp has done a really good job through the course of this time of dynamically adjusting price, especially as we get closer to delivery.
so those units that are in 2023 are priced where we anticipate 2023 pricing to be, but we will adjust that pricing as required given the inflationary environment that we have and that we're facing. and if we look at genie, yes, they've got 2023 backlog. and again, customer demand is strong. it gives us some confidence in the longer-term outlook, based on the replacement cycle.
and in genie, from a pricing standpoint, and we've had -- the team has been executing on the pricing discipline. we implemented price increases in april. and any 2023 orders that we have will have 2023 pricing, and we'll continue to make the adjustments as necessary based on the inflationary pressures that we see. and those conversations are ongoing.
and i would say, very similar story in our utilities business. so the good news is, the demand is strong. our total backlog is up 70%, which gives us some confidence about that future outlook, and we'll continue to address pricing as required given the inflationary pressures that we're seeing.

our next question comes from david raso from evercore isi. please go ahead. your line is open.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for the time. with your stock in the low 30s, obviously, the stock might fully believe in the $4, but it's definitely not believing you can grow next year.
so i'm just trying to think about '23 in the context of -- for example, in awp, your backlog is over $2.8 billion, if you include backlog beyond 12 months. so i mean, you get 0 orders the rest of the year, 0, and fulfill your revenue guide for this year for awp and still end the year with a backlog of over $1.6 billion, right? 70% of a full year of sales. so i think what people are going to be curious about for '23, that backlog, can you give us any sense of are you adding any incremental stickiness to those orders? anything about a more challenging cancellation penalty or anything that we can get comfort that we can believe in that backlog? because obviously, that backlog alone will tell you -- i mean you can get the next 6 quarters, get orders only half of what you just got in the first half of this year, and you would still grow revenues next year in awp. so i think it's just about the believability of the backlog what the stock must be questioning at these levels at a minimum.
can you -- look, i know you can't go to the big rental companies if they want to cancel. it's a challenge to say, hey, you've got to take the machine. i get the relationship. but can you help us understand the stickiness, some of the aspects of this backlog we should be comfortable with? thank you.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, david. and we share your enthusiasm for the backlog and the potential outlook. obviously, it's too early, david.
we're going to learn a lot. it's august. so we're not going to provide 2023 guidance at this time. but you're absolutely right.
we have an incredibly strong backlog and we have significant coverage that's going into 2023. and so we are anticipating growth in both segments based on its backlog in 2023, based on the backlog that we have. now let me be clear, david, we're going to need to see improvement in our supply chain to capitalize and to drive growth as we move into the next year. and if you look specific to the awp, the market is incredibly strong.
the rental companies in north america and europe, for that matter, are seeing very robust business. they're seeing record levels of utilization. they're seeing very strong rental rates. they're seeing very strong used equipment values.
they're being very disciplined in their business, and they're executing incredibly well. they're actually growing their business into other areas. and so the underlying secular rental trends are quite strong. that backlog is in there.
and i can tell you, david, every customer conversation i have, it's not about, hey, we're worried about canceling orders. it's about, can you get us the gear sooner and quicker? and so if you look at the replacement cycle and where we are in the awp aerial segment, it's been delayed, david, because the industry has struggled to meet the needs of the industry. so you've got the natural replacement cycle. you've got the underlying infrastructure and infrastructure builds.
if you just look in north america, there is no money currently being released or spent on the infrastructure bill. that's going to come in 2023 and beyond. and so there's a strong foundation for the rental companies going forward, and they're quite confident in their outlook and that's been relayed to us in terms of their expectations for equipment going forward. and so i think the demand is there.
they need the gear. they're going into the cycle with an aging fleet and that creates a strong demand environment and there's scarcity right now because of production challenges. and so i think those things all go to creating a good demand environment for us going forward. you're right, what do we know? what we know is we've got historically high backlogs in that business at this time.
and the rental companies are doing well. they're looking at their markets and they're robust about their outlook. and that usually, david, when utilization rates are going up, rental rates are going up, used equipment values are going up, those are all great things for the demand within the aerial business. so we've got the backlog.
customers are not telling us they're canceling the backlog. all the questions are about, can you get it sooner, because we need it now.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
sure. i mean, look, there's two things to do off of that, show some increased features that make it stickier than normal to let investors feel more confident that demand will be there, and/or if everybody's confidence in the backlog is what it is, obviously, the response for capital allocation is more share repurchase, right? so i know you're balancing building the portfolio. but i mean that's the crux of the story of the stock. do we believe the backlog will be there in '23, right? because it's obviously suggesting growth for '23.
so i appreciate the commentary, though.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
your question on capital allocation, david. we bought back a significant amount of shares in the quarter because we believe that these prices, that that's an incredible irr. we want to grow the business. we have a bias toward growing the business.
but at these share prices, at these irrs, it's hard not to be active in the market for repurchasing shares.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from michael feniger from bank of america. please go ahead. your line is open.
michael feniger -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. thanks for taking my question. just kind of following up actually on david's question. i mean materials processing is now expected to reach a new margin high.
that's a new milestone. we saw one of your peers in europe just acquire screening and crushing business for 10 times ebitda just a few months ago. so john, just where your leverage is right now? is it below your target? how do we unlock that value in materials processing that the market is putting on other companies that -- of your materials processing unit? is it share repurchases? how do we view m&a really going forward in effort to build out materials processing? how do you kind of think about that going forward?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, thanks for the question, michael. first of all, mp has clearly demonstrated incredibly strong performance in the cycle. it's highly diversified and consistent and it drives significant margin improvement as we go forward. what do we like about it? and you're absolutely right, it contributes more than 60% of our operating earnings, and it's consistent as we go through time.
and so our job is to help the market understand the strength, the diversity, the capabilities of that segment as we go forward. part of the reason it's been so successful is regional diversification. we're not bound to one region, it is truly a global segment. second is product and customer diversification around aggregates, lifting, concrete, our handling, and environmental business, and then end market diversification.
it is construction, yes, but it's waste handling, recycling market. so we serve many markets. we also think from an m&a activity that it's still highly fragmented within the verticals that we compete in. and so you've seen much of our m&a activity, the most recent acquisition of proall, is in that space.
so near adjacencies where we believe we can build out the mp segment and over time actually create multiple segments if we're successful within the mp space. you're also right that we've got a strong balance sheet. our debt-to-equity is at 1.5 times. we've talked about 2.5 times net debt-to-ebitda through cycle.
and so we have the balance sheet. we're going to be disciplined. we've made some acquisitions, and we continue to look in this area, because it is an area that's underappreciated, and it's an area that we've got to do a better job explaining to our investors the power of this segment and the difference in the terex portfolio as a result of mp being 60% of our operating earnings. and we're going to work hard to get that message out.
and when you see our m&a activity, you can expect to see more m&a activity. again, we'll make technology investments, but you can expect to see more m&a activity in and around the mp space as well because we like the dynamics in that space. and we'd like to build that out, and ultimately, over time, create at least multiple segments within the mp segment.
michael feniger -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks for that response. and on the awp side, obviously, the guidance implies a strong margin in the second half and q4 potentially 10% or higher. so it's a good starting point, obviously, for next year. i guess just bigger picture, investors always wonder if you can drive cycle-over-cycle margin improvement in awp.
i mean how different is this energy business today from your last peak in 2018?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
great question. hats off to our genie team, because they've really been focused on improving the global competitiveness of our genie business. that team completed a significant restructuring in 2020 that took out over $90 million of cost, significantly improving the profitability, but also improving the resiliency and breakeven point if we were to face a downturn. i spoke about the market activities and the strength that we're seeing in the market.
but on the operational excellence initiatives, the team has really done a good job the last couple of years driving pricing discipline and pricing improvement, driving process efficiency and effectiveness, and even driving some cost productivity, what we call flex productivity improvement despite the significant disruption that we've been seeing. we talked about okc and mexico. that's going to help. that's different.
we're going to continue to leverage china that also is a cost-effective base to export to other regions of the world. julie mentioned in her comments and the team there has done a fantastic job, aggressively managing sg&a while investing in product development. but the team realizes that we have to be disciplined on our sg&a spend and not allow it to grow as revenue grows and they've done a heck of a job there. and then our strategic sourcing team.
it's been tough in the market for strategic sourcing and our purchasing teams. but despite that, they're still out there working to expand our supply base. they're out there working on cost-out initiatives. they're working to develop our mexico supply base.
all of that didn't exist back in 2018. likewise, new products and new product development. the team is doing a really good job of purposeful innovation, bringing things to market that features and benefits, but also are lower cost to manufacturers, so design for manufacturability, design for assembly, [inaudible] work in our product development. so the team is doing a great job there.
we're investing in technology and systems in that business that didn't exist. but one for us to be easier to do business with our customers, but also to do the digital thread within our own operations. so we can improve the speed of decision-making and improve the decision-making process with systems and processes within the business. so we've got a major initiative underway.
and then the last part is our parts and service team in that business. over the last three or four years, they have done a wonderful job growing the business, expanding the business, and that is also countercyclical for us as we go forward. so that team is working hard in an incredibly challenging environment. and i think they've done a really good job restructuring that business to ensure it's adaptable and resilient to respond to whatever market conditions that, that team faces.
so they've done a heck of a job and a lot of hard work over the last couple of years.

our next question comes from tami zakaria from j.p. morgan. please go ahead. your line is open.
tami zakaria -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. good morning. thank you for taking my questions.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
morning, tami.
tami zakaria -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
morning. how are you? so my first question is -- and i'm sorry if i missed it. so you're expecting 9% pricing for the year and 6% volume. can you give us some color on what price and volume expectation is by segment for the year?
julie beck -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
tami, in general, we're expecting that -- again, as you said, the 9% increase in pricing overall for the year, 6% volume. both of the businesses are having increase in prices as we go throughout the year. so each of them have implemented various pricing actions starting back in last year, and they've been adding them throughout the year as we deal with the increase in costs. so both businesses are seeing increased price as we go forward.
tami zakaria -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
so price increases across segments have been similar? can we assume that?
julie beck -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes.
tami zakaria -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. i have one quick follow-up to what john just mentioned earlier about an inventory influx in june. so when you began the quarter, you were expecting top line to grow only modestly quarter-over-quarter, and you expected that to be driven mostly by the mp segment, but your top line came in well above expectations for both segments, excluding fx. so what really drove that? was june an exceptionally strong month that drove the upside? or did you have better-than-expected sales sort of throughout the quarter?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
it's a good question. remember, early in the quarter we were dealing with the covid disruptions and lockdown in china. and so the quarter started off pretty slow as a result of those lockdowns, not just disruption to our existing facilities, but also through the supply chain and the logistics. and so as the lockdowns in china eased and our teams did a great job literally sleeping in the plants to produce products, it's those ease that improved the supply chain.
and so that helped to reduce some of that hospital inventory. so i would say we saw an improvement as we went into june as the covid policies were relaxed in china.
tami zakaria -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. thank you so much.

our next question comes from seth weber from wells fargo. please go ahead. your line is open.
seth weber -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning and thanks.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
seth weber -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
good morning. maybe, julie, another pricing question for you. the implied kind of high single, low double-digit margin for awp in the back half of the year, does that reflect you're on the positive side of price cost by the end of the year? and can you just give us any indication on awp, how much is structural pricing versus surcharges? thanks.
julie beck -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so thanks for the question. so overall, seth, the operating margins are expected to steadily increase throughout the year as price dynamics improve. and for the year, we expect to be price cost neutral.
awp delivered operating margins of 7.7% in the quarter, up sequentially by 180 basis points in the first quarter. and we expect -- this sequential improvement was a result of strong execution and strict expense management and disciplined pricing actions. we anticipate continued sequential improvements in the second half through a disciplined price cost management, and we expect our incremental margin target to be above our target in the second half of the year.
seth weber -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. is there any flavor for how much of that is structural versus surcharge?
julie beck -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so the genie business and awp, both businesses have taken price increases. so in our utilities, it's been a combination of price increases and surcharges, and the same is true for the genie business. both of them have a combination of list increases and surcharges.
seth weber -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. and then maybe just following up on the mp segment and the strength in the margins there. is there anything with the acquisitions that you've done or investments that you're making that would prevent a 20% to 25% incremental margin for next year as you're thinking about it?
julie beck -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so overall, we're not giving 2023 guidance at this point in time, but we're pleased that mp had 20% incremental margins in q2 and we expect strong incremental margin performance for the rest of the year. and so this business, we're pleased with the absolute overall profitability, but our overall target for terex remains at 25% incremental margin.
seth weber -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. thank you, guys.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question comes from steven fisher from ubs. please go ahead. your line is open.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks. good morning. you mentioned before, john, that the key thing for next year is just to be able to deliver your backlog.
and i imagine you're going to be doing some of your 2023 planning in the next few months. so i guess, with a clean slate on the year and still maybe five months away from the start of the year, can you put better contingency plans in place to kind of better manage supply chain risk for 2023? like to what extent are you kind of now thinking multiple moves ahead to be able to manage next year a little bit better, if possible?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. great question. we spent a lot of time on that. and so from the actions into response.
first, there our strategic sourcing initiative did help identify multiple suppliers for key commodities. and so that initiative has provided at least a list of suppliers to go to. so even in this environment, we have expanded the supply base and that's helped. now with that said, it's obviously still highly constrained.
the engineering redesigns. the team has done a really good job of redesigning some of the components for what's available. part of those redesigns are for what's available not just now, but also into the future. and so we think that will help potentially mitigate some of the electronic challenges and microchip challenges that we've had as a team.
continued engagement at senior levels with the key suppliers up to and including at the ceo level. and so those engagements are going to continue. we've been very transparent in terms of what our needs are as we go forward and the relative performance of the key suppliers. now with that said, i don't want to be totally negative on the supply chain, because they're also highly motivated to deliver for us, so that we can deliver for our customers.
so these are challenging times, they're difficult conversations at times, but the supply base is motivated. so we're expanding the supply base, making engineering design changes as we can, and then looking to reshore in some cases. for example, building up the mexico supply chain over time. we think that's going to provide a greater degree of resiliency for us as we go forward.
so it's a multitude of steps across both businesses, awp and our mp business as we go forward. and then the other piece, i think, that we'll see some improvement on is our utility business has been significantly impacted by chassis and bodies. i think chassis supply, as we move into 2023, we will begin to see some improvement there because that has adversely impacted that part of our business. so just a couple of things that the teams are doing.
we're continuing to do to provide that resiliency that we're going to need to have the opportunity for growth in 2023.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
terrific. thanks very much.

our last question will come from jamie cook from credit suisse. please go ahead. your line is open.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. good morning. congratulations on a nice quarter. i guess just two follow-up questions.
one, can you just comment on what you saw for order trends in europe versus the u.s. sort of versus china, and whether the trends continued into july? so i guess that's my first question. and then your assumptions on -- sorry, i'll just put in my other question now, too. price cost in the back half of the year, i think before you were assuming hot-rolled coil was $1,800 in the first half, i want to say $1,400 in the second half.
what your expectations are now or what's embedded in your guide?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, jamie. the good news is, it's similar to north america on the genie side, the multiyear replacement cycle is going to help. so we're actually seeing stable backlog in order rates despite the challenges in western europe. similar story.
we've seen backlog increase, sales increase in those markets. clearly, those are the markets that we're clearly watching. we're watching all the markets, but obviously very focused on what's transpiring in western europe. but right now, i think the word i would use is stable in terms of demand in bookings and outlook standpoint, but there's actually growing backlog.
julie beck -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
and jamie, our second half hrc for the u.s. north america is $1,050.

greetings, and welcome to the terex second quarter 2022 results conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. it is now my pleasure to introduce your host, jon paterson, vice president and treasurer. please go ahead.
jon paterson -- vice president, financial planning and analysis
good morning, and welcome to the terex second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. a copy of the press release and presentation slides are posted on our investor relations website at investors.terex.com. in addition, the replay and slide presentation will be available on our website. i'm joined by john garrison, chairman and chief executive officer; and julie beck, senior vice president and chief financial officer.
their prepared remarks will be followed by q&a. please turn to slide 2 of the presentation, which reflects our safe harbor statement. today's conference call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied. in addition, we will be discussing non-gaap information that we believe is useful in evaluating the company's operating performance.
reconciliations for these non-gaap measures can be found in the conference call materials. please turn to slide 3, and i'll turn it over to john garrison. 
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, jon, and good morning. i'd like to welcome everyone to our earnings call and appreciate your interest in terex. i'd like to begin by thanking all terex team members for their efforts in this challenging global operating environment, with inflationary pressures, production disruptions, and covid impacts. terex team members have worked diligently to improve our performance for our customers, dealers, and shareholders.
we are proud of all terex team members for keeping themselves and others safe. i would like to thank our team members around the world for their continued commitment to our zero harm safety culture and terex way values. safety remains the top priority of the company, driven by think safe, work safe, home safe. please turn to slide 4 to review our strong financial results.
the team delivered solid financial performance for the quarter, which julie will cover later in her remarks. as a result of our resilient team members' strong execution in the first half of the year and our strong backlog, we are raising full year eps outlook to $3.80 to $4.20. please turn to slide 5. terex participates in attractive end markets that are supported by favorable trends.
and we have strong brands and the capacity to support long-term growth. our mp segment is a diversified and consistent high-performing portfolio of businesses. mp's brands have leading market positions with excellent end market product and geographic diversification. importantly, these businesses are less cyclical in nature.
the overall business continues to benefit from strong equipment utilization rates and dealers looking to replenish their inventory and rental fleet. mp's global demand remains strong, demonstrated by backlog of $1.1 billion, up 32% year over year, with an additional $100 million scheduled to be delivered beyond 12 months. environmental and recycling solutions are driving demand for our ecotec and cbi products. the mp team is taking the existing product design and modify them to service the fast-growing environmental and waste recycling markets.
the powerscreen and finlay brands are benefiting from strong global aggregate demand. we have leading market position with our mobile crushing and screening products, and anticipate tailwinds from increased spending on global infrastructure investments. mp's market diversification is a strength. markets are growing and provide strong demand for our leading mp brands.
and i repeat, end markets are also strong, demonstrated by a record backlog of $2.3 billion, up 62% year over year. an additional $500 million of backlog with deliveries scheduled beyond 12 months demonstrates a healthy customer environment as fleets age and customers have strong utilization rates. globally, increased adoption of aerial work platforms continues to improve labor efficiency and job site safety. construction, infrastructure and industrial applications are driving demand for genie solutions.
applications for genie products include data centers, warehouses, and manufacturing facilities. our utilities business will benefit from the electric grid multiyear infrastructure spending ramping up in 2023. the business has robust demand as customers look to reserve production slot. please turn to slide 6.
consolidated q2 bookings of $1 billion was the second highest in recent history as customer demand remains very strong. elevated customer fleet ages and historical dealer inventory levels continue to support robust demand. utilities bookings remain very strong. overall, our future outlook is supported by strong backlog position that is up 70% versus the prior year when including orders that are scheduled to be delivered beyond 12 months.
turning to slide 7 for an update on our strategic operational priorities. our execute, innovate, and grow strategy will continue to strengthen our operations and allow the company to capitalize on strong demand in our end markets. companywide investments in new product development and continued deployment of digital customer and dealer solutions will help to deliver long-term growth. in the coming slides, i'll highlight two examples of purposeful innovation in our mp and utilities businesses.
we continue to be active in the m&a growth element of our strategy. the strength of construction and infrastructure spending supports our advanced mixture in bid-well concrete products. this week, we announced the acquisition of proall, which expands our concrete product offering in the mp segment. proall is an industry leader in the mobile volumetric concrete mixers that make concrete to specification on site as an alternative to central batching.
genie recently made an investment in acculon energy, an engineering and connectivity company focused on battery technology and electrification. today, 30% of genie booms and 66% of our scissors have electric options. by partnering with acculon, genie is reinforcing its leadership role by accelerating the industry's move toward electrification through the delivery of next-generation battery technology. this acquisition and the investment demonstrates our commitment to executing attractive growth priorities that support our strategy.
turning to slide 8. terex washing systems is a growing piece of materials processing portfolio that delivers complete end-to-end solutions that integrate our crushing, screening, and washing products. wash recycling is the process of producing recycled sand and aggregates from various waste streams that would have traditionally gone to landfill. this application in switzerland converts construction and demolition waste into two sands and three aggregate products for use in the production of asphalt.
all of this is completed by recycling up to 95% of the water for reuse. turning to slide 9. an important part of terex's organic growth is sustained investment and new product innovation. our utilities team has led the market, delivering the first-ever all-electric bucket truck on a class 6/7 medium duty chassis.
this solution combines viatec's smartpto technology, a terex investment made in february 2022, with navistar international's electric chassis. this product is responsive to electric utilities sustainability goals by eliminating engine emission and has created strong customer demand. please turn to slide 10. our environmental, social, and governance programs deliver stakeholder value.
we continue to progress on our esg journey with leadership from our board of directors and executive leadership team. during each quarterly investor call, we will feature one of the pillars of our esg strategy. this quarter, we are highlighting governance. we are proud of the in-depth global experience and diversity of our board.
our engaged board of directors set the tone at the top and oversees esg, including risks, opportunities, and our company strategy. our reputation is among our most important assets, and every terex team member is a guardian of our company's reputation. we protect our reputation by making decisions and taking actions that are aligned with our territory values, guided by our framework outlined in the code of ethics & conduct. responsible, ethical leadership is in our dna and part of our terex way values.
please turn to slide 11. geopolitical issues continue to cause disruption and significant cost increases. although these headwinds have constrained our growth, we are aggressively managing these challenges. in the quarter, china's covid policies caused temporary shutdowns and significant disruption for our changzhou and jiading facilities.
these policies also impacted many of our china-based suppliers, further increasing disruption in our global supply chain and logistics. the team is successfully battling headwinds every day by mitigating cost pressures and minimizing production disruption by engaging with suppliers and expanding our supply base. we designed components to maximize availability of critical inputs to improve production, providing transparent communication of delivery and cost to our customers, and implementing price increases in response to inflationary cost pressures. to recognize and thank our team members for all of their contributions, we recently announced an off-cycle global compensation increase.
in this dynamic environment, our team members are demonstrating resiliency and flexibility to increase production deliveries for our customers to overcome these global challenges. and with that, i'll turn it over to julie.
julie beck -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, john, and good morning, everyone. let's take a look at our second quarter financial performance found on slide 12. we demonstrated solid execution in a dynamic environment, including significant supply chain challenges and continued inflation with reported sales of $1.1 billion, up 4% year over year, primarily due to increased prices. foreign currency translation negatively impacted sales by $51 million or approximately 5% in the quarter as the euro and british pound weakened against the dollar.
gross margins declined by 250 basis points in the quarter as pricing actions partially offset cost increases. the year-over-year gross margin decline was in our awp business, however, margins in this business did improve sequentially. mp was able to effectively overcome cost increases with pricing actions. although the inflationary environment continues, sg&a was flat to prior year.
sg&a percent of sales at 10.1% decreased by 40 basis points from the prior year as business investment was offset by continued strict expense management and favorable foreign exchange translation. operating margin of 9.6% was down 220 basis points compared to the prior year and up 220 basis points sequentially from increased pricing and disciplined cost control. we are pleased with achieving a 39% incremental margin improvement from the first quarter. although price/cost dynamics have improved sequentially from the first quarter, operating profit in the second quarter of $104 million decreased $19 million from the prior year as price realization was offset by continued cost increases, manufacturing inefficiencies caused by supply chain disruptions, and the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.
current quarter operating profit includes $1 million of charges in corporate and other associated with the litigation settlement on a former product line. interest and other expense was approximately $21 million lower than q2 of 2021, as we recorded a $26 million loss on early extinguishment of debt related to refinancing a significant portion of our capital structure and prepayment of term loans in the prior year. we also had an unfavorable year-over-year foreign exchange variance of $4 million. the second quarter global effective tax rate was approximately 17%.
the slightly higher tax rate is primarily due to lower favorable discrete benefit in the current quarter, largely offset by reduced tax on the geographic distribution of income. second quarter earnings per share of $1.07 increased $0.05 over last year and reflects an unfavorable eps impact of $0.09 from foreign exchange translation. also in the prior year, we had $0.26 of unfavorable financial callout, primarily in connection with the refinancing of a significant portion of the capital structure. our return on invested capital remains strong at 17.3% as we continue to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
free cash flow for the quarter of $44 million was consistent with our expectations for the second quarter. i will discuss free cash flow in more detail later in my prepared remarks. let's look at our segment results, starting with our materials processing segment found on slide 13. mp had an excellent quarter with sales of $481 million, up 9% compared to the second quarter of 2021 with growth across all product lines.
on a foreign exchange neutral basis, sales were up 16%. the business ended the quarter with a backlog of $1.1 billion, up 32% from a year ago. the strong backlog supports our sales outlook and is approximately three times historical norms. we also have $100 million of additional backlog delivered beyond 12 months.
in these challenging markets, mp increased their operating profit to 16.5% and increased their margins 230 basis points from the first quarter. mp has been able to demonstrate strong performance even in this inflationary environment with approximately 20% incremental margins on a reported and operational basis, excluding fx. the team continues their excellent operational execution. on slide 14, we see our aerial work platform segment financial results.
awp sales of $598 million were slightly higher compared to the prior year, increasing 4% on an fx-neutral basis. backlog at quarter end was a record $2.3 billion, up 62% from the prior year. both genie and utilities have taken multiple price actions over the course of 2021 and 2022 to address inflationary cost pressures. in addition, both businesses have been battling parts shortages constraining their growth.
awp delivered operating margins of 7.7% in the quarter, down from last year by 330 basis points, but up sequentially from the first quarter of 2022 by 180 basis points. the sequential improvement was a result of strong execution on strict expense management and disciplined pricing actions. please see slide 15 for an overview of our disciplined capital allocation strategy. free cash flow for the quarter was $44 million and consistent with our expectations.
free cash flow includes $38 million of irs refunds, but was negatively impacted by $63 million of hospital inventory as well as unfavorable foreign exchange. now let me detail some usage of our cash in the quarter. we continue to reinvest in our business with capital expenditures, acquisitions, and technology investments of $32 million. a large portion of our capital expenditures is related to our monterrey, mexico facility, which remains on schedule.
in addition, we prepaid $23 million of our term loan, reducing the outstanding balance to $55 million. returning cash to shareholders is an important element of our disciplined capital allocation strategy. the company continued its quarterly dividend per share of $0.13, an 8.3% increase over the prior year. we also repurchased $61 million of shares in the quarter as we believe that terex shares are an attractive investment.
we have $61 million remaining on our share repurchase program. the company's strong balance sheet has allowed us to return approximately $100 million of cash to shareholders year to date. the company has significantly delevered over the past four years and strengthened its balance sheet. outstanding gross debt has been reduced by $524 million since the second quarter of 2019, a 39% decrease, and $66 million since the second quarter of 2021 or a 7% increase.
we have no near-term maturities until 2024, and 72% of our debt is at a fixed rate of 5% until the end of the decade. our net leverage remains low at 1.56 times, which is well below our 2.5 times target through the cycle. we have ample liquidity of $678 million. the company is in an excellent position to run and grow the business.
now turning to slide 16 and our full year outlook. thanks to the strong execution of our team members and our robust backlog, we are raising our 2022 outlook that we shared with you in february and april. we expect earnings per share of $3.80 to $4.20 on sales of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. this outlook incorporates an additional unfavorable $0.25 per share due to foreign exchange from our initial outlook.
supply chain challenges, inflation pressures, geopolitical uncertainty, and highly restrictive china covid policies continue, but the team has successfully navigated these challenges for the first half of 2022 and we expect continued improvement in price/cost dynamics throughout the year. our strong backlog supports our sales outlook, which in total remains unchanged and reflects the ongoing dialogue with our suppliers. sales are not a function of demand, but rather the ability of the supply chain to deliver components. we have the internal capacity to produce more, which we have demonstrated in the past.
for the full year, our sales growth is based upon improved price execution of approximately 9%, volume growth of 6%, partially offset by unfavorable fx of 6%. sg&a cost management has been excellent, and we have reduced our full year outlook to 10.6% of sales. interest and other expense increased $5 million on higher interest rates and unfavorable fx. our global effective tax rate for the year has been reduced to 20% based on a more favorable full year geographic mix.
we estimate a share count of approximately 70 million based on repurchase activities in the current year. we continue to expect sequential free cash flow improvement in the second half, but have lowered our full year outlook to $150 million to $200 million as a result of negative foreign exchange. corporate and other loss has been increased to $80 million. operating expenses are in line with our initial outlook.
however, results have been adversely impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange and $7 million of year-to-date financial callout associated with restructuring, severance, and litigation settlement expenses on former product lines. we expect our incremental margins in the second half to be above our 25% target. turning to the segment outlook. based upon mp's successful mitigation of persistent input costs, supply chain challenges, and first half performance, we are increasing the operating margin range to 14.8% to 15.3% with relatively balanced margins throughout the second half of 2022.
for awp, supply chain challenges continue to be more disruptive in this segment with the majority of our total hospital inventory. this segment has been performing well, and we expect sequential quarterly margin improvement to continue through the balance of 2022. therefore, we have increased the bottom end of the margin range to 8% and maintained the top end of 8.5%. we are extremely pleased to be in a position to raise our earnings per share outlook to $3.80 to $4.20.
and with that, i will turn it back to you, john.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, julie. turning to slide 17 to conclude my prepared remarks. terex is well positioned and has a strong foundation to deliver long-term value for all stakeholders, because we have great businesses, strong brands, and strong market positions upon which we can grow the company. we will continue to invest in new products and manufacturing capacity, along with strategic inorganic growth.
we'll continue to execute our disciplined capital allocation strategy, and we have demonstrated resiliency and adaptability in an increasingly challenging environment. i'm confident this will result in terex being an even stronger company. and with that, let me turn it back to jon.

operator
(operator instructions) your first question comes from the line of jamie cook from credit suisse. your line is now open.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, good morning. i guess two questions to start off. one just on the announcement on the sale of the part of the crane business there. i'm just trying to understand the timing, given that we're at the bottom of the cycle. would it made more sense to wait until the cycle improves and perhaps catch a better price tagging? and just how we should think about your ability to compete competitively on the remaining crane business and whether or not that's strategic to you?
and then my second question, just some help on the aerial guide. obviously, as we look from 2019 to 2018, it's sort of an apples and oranges comparison. so within your core aerial business, can you help us understand what you're assuming in terms of volumes, price, cost, mix? thanks
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks jamie, and good morning. just a couple comments on the transactions that we announced on friday. first and foremost, it is consistent with the focus element of our strategy, selling the demag mobile crane business to tadano. and i think if you take a step back and look at independent of where you are in the cycle or proceed where you are in the cycle, there's clear and compelling industrial logic for the combination in the global crane market. we ultimately believe that this combination will be good for the customers, team members and our shareholders and it's going to create a combined company that's much stronger together than either of the companies could have been independently in their common core focus on the business of lifting. so from selling the demag to tadano, we just think there's very strong compelling logic, independent of where one may believe you are in the cycle.
as it pertains to the second part of the announcement, which is also important is that, we are exiting the okc-produced north american mobile crane product lines. in that, we have an ongoing strategic analysis and review, and we basically came to conclusion that the current and anticipated return profile of these products did not meet our criteria, would require substantially more investment in the time to get a return on that investment was not acceptable. and it was for that reason that we decided to exit those okc product lines.
now with that said, the crane businesses that we're retaining are strong businesses. the rough terrain cranes out of our crespellano facility in italy enjoy a strong presence, especially in europe and the middle east. we are going to continue to operate our tower cranes business. again, has a strong global presence and executes well. and our pick & carry business, which we're reporting under our mp segment, there's a logic for that. that's an australian, southeast asia-based business, strong customer overlap with our mp business and that's a very strong performing business for us.
and overall, we'll talk about utilities. it's a very strong business. it's a business that we're excited about. it's a business that we're making significant investments in to continue to grow that. so overall, we think the transactions that we've announced are going to drive substantial improvement, make terex stronger, improve our financial metrics. and again, are consistent with the focused element of our strategy.
in terms of the -- jamie, you asked a question about the segmentation. just looking at the revised segmentation, and i'll let john kind of take over on the awp side. moving out utilities in the awp, we think that make sense. there are synergies on the product and the customer side and clear synergies on the service and support side between our utilities business and our awp business. i spoke about the pick and carry business with mp. and again, the rts and tower businesses are good businesses that operate and execute well, and we think there's opportunity to invest and grow those businesses going forward. so those are the reasons why we announced when we did and entered into the transaction.
john, did you want to comment on the awp?
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so in respect to awp, as we indicated, revenues of $3.1 billion does include the terex utilities business, which comprises $400 million of revenue and a 9% to 10% operating margin. therefore, the awp growth rates, the 3% to 6% revenue growth and the operating margin that we are providing guidance for today wouldn't be different with or without the utilities businesses included.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
sorry, any assumptions on price cost on assets this year?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
in terms of the pricing for awp, jamie, so the pricing actions that we're taking are designed to offset the higher material costs and it does represent a majority of the revenue increase in our 2019 guide. i think it's well chronicled what's happened on material cost over the course of 2018. we've been very transparent with our customers about the cost increases we're seeing as we went into our 2019 negotiations. our commercial excellence initiative, the teams are working hard on that to maintain process discipline and reduce any leakage that you get. it's a challenging pricing environment. the team's doing a good job. we're really focused on selling that value proposition at the acquisition price or cost operating residual value. so net on pricing in awp in 2019, our intentions to offset the input cost increases with our 2019 pricing. we did roll our surcharge from 2018 into our 2019 pricing. so that was designed to offset material cost increases that we'll see.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. thank you. i'll get back in queue.

your next question comes from the line of steven fisher for ubs. your line is now open.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
thanks. good morning.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, steven.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
good morning, john. wondering if you could talk about the visibility that you have to achieving the midpoint of the guidance in terms of what you're assuming for awp orders for the second half of the year, both from the national rental companies and independent rental companies. and then maybe since it's a bit of a wide range, what does the upper end and lower end of the guidance range reflect?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'll talk the first part overall kind of just looking at the markets, and then i'll have john talk about the guidance range. as you saw, we did end the year with backlog up 14% and that's on our traditional awp products. if you include the utilities business, backlog's up about 21%. what we're seeing in north america is the rental channel remains strong and their capex plans show year-over-year increases. i will say that, that does vary by major customer. it was good utilization, a good rental rate, fleet growth. there's still -- we're anticipating fleet growth in 2019, clearly we had slowing over the 2018 fleet growth that we saw, but we do believe the replacement demand cycle is beginning to increase. that's north america. if we look at europe, we're anticipating europe pretty flat. there's geopolitical challenges in europe and so year-over-year, we're seeing a flat impact in europe. again, a mature market, we're seeing some of the replacement cycle kick in there. and we're continuing to see good growth in australia -- asia pacific, australia and china as we begin -- continue to see increasing product adoption. so we think we're going into the year in a reasonably good position with the backlog that we have for the year.
john, would you like to comment on the guide?
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. in terms of our awp guide as well as the overall guide for the company in the first quarter, i did mention in my prepared remarks the impact of the winter storms that we saw in the pacific northwest here over the last 10 days, which actually were quite unusual and resulted in our principal awp manufacturing facilities being closed for over a week. we are currently assessing the impact of those winter storms on our results and may have some impact on the q1 results for awp. that said, we aren't anticipating that the storms would have any impact on our full year guidance that we're providing today. our teams are now back up and running, and they're meeting customer demand.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
but i get curious, just sort of the upper end and lower end of the ranges. i mean, would upper end mostly be driven by buybacks or better-than-expected buying in the second half of the year or something in the remaining crane businesses, if you could kind of frame the -- that range?
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i think that the ranges reflect the markets in which we're operating and recognition that there is a lot of orders still to be booked for the full year that would play into that. material costs, also very dynamic area with respect to material costs and steel prices at the moment, so that's a factor that goes into the guidance range that we provided. the guidance that we're providing today does not include share repurchase -- any share repurchase assumption, so it assumes the currently outstanding shares. so those are some of the factors, i guess that i would refer to, steve.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
okay. and then just a follow-up. now that you have done some of the resegmenting. i guess it sounds like on awp, maybe the margins are not that different, but just curious, since you've talked in the past about 25% incremental margins for the business, how should we think about those incremental margins going forward for the overall company given some of this resegmenting and then maybe some -- within some of the segments?
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. as we've talked about the expectation that we have for our businesses to achieve 25% incremental margin and that holds true actually for the remaining cranes businesses that we haven't -- that we still have in our portfolio. and so, i wouldn't think about our expectation changing there in any material way.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
terrific. thanks a lot.

your next question comes from the line of david raso for evercore isi. your line is now open.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi, good morning. you touched on this a little bit earlier about the remaining crane business, but sort of bigger picture. let's assume the tadano proceeds come in, you're going to end 2019 with your net debt-to-ebitda down about 1.2 times. i'm just trying to think philosophically, john, now that we've made some hard decisions on the crane business, looking forward, and i know end markets, how they're acting will this dictate this to some degree, but how should we think about how you think of the leverage? any cash flow kind of beyond '19? how do you think about the business that historically tariffs hasn't pretty acquisitive, but how do we think about post '19 and the new framework and you running the company? how to allocate cash flow moving forward?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, david. again, we embarked a couple of years back on a strategy of focus, simplify and execute to win and the actions that we've taken over the course of time have been clearly indicative of the focusing on businesses that have the opportunity to outearn their cost of capital through the economic cycle. so we've also been focused on simplify, and we have more work to do as a result of the transactions that we've announced today. and then our execute to win priorities around commercial excellence, life cycle solutions and most importantly, strategic sourcing. we've made significant investments in strategic sourcing, and we need to begin to see the impact of that in our operating margins.
around that, david, we've had a disciplined capital allocation strategy where we fundamentally believe in focusing and improving our free cash flow. we have to drive improvement in our free cash flow in 2019, and using that free cash flow to invest in organic opportunities. as you see, our capex for the year is up substantially. we believe those are significant returns to shareholders in these types of projects, so we're going to continue to invest in that. we're going to continue to invest in engineering and innovation. and if there's capital available, we'll continue to look at share repurchases and returning capital to shareholders via repurchases and dividends.
so right now, david, i would not anticipate a significant change for the strategy that we've embarked on. as we grow, as we execute, there could be a change as we go forward in the future, but right now we believe that the strategy we're on is driving value for our customers, our team members and our shareholders. so we're going to remain consistent.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
can i take that answer to mean we should not think of a reduced leverage at the end of the year as a recipe to look toward acquisitions? it should be more about reinvest organically and more debt reduction or repo. is that a fair...
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
that is a fair summary, david. our disciplined capital allocation strategy that we've outlined many times remains in effect. we believe that there is more for us to do to achieve the organic growth of the businesses we have. and we have not changed our thinking surrounding the leverage in the company at 2, 2.5 times through the cycle, so that we're going to continue to operate this business and drive value for our shareholders.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
and lastly, related to the asset sale. tadano's interest in the tower crane business or even the rts, where that conversion go, i would have thought that might be something they would also think would be attractive given tadano's lack of exposure in towers in particular?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
david, i will just say that, the conversations that we've had really did focus on the product lines that -- in our slide book and our demag mobile cranes business. that was their principal area of interest and i think was a mutual area of interest for both companies.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
all right. i appreciate it. thank you.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you david.

your next question comes from the line of ann duignan from jp morgan. your line is now open.
ann duignan -- jp morgan -- analyst
yeah. hi, good morning.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, ann.
ann duignan -- jp morgan -- analyst
maybe you could talk a little bit more about strategic sourcing, where you're negatively impacted as you were looking for $40 million in savings and then $80 million by year 2020. you've reduced those a little bit this morning. can you just talk about what the impact of the sale of the mobile cranes business had on strategic sourcing? does it take out some of the volume, some of the savings? just a little bit more color around wave 1 and wave 2, please.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, ann. again, we're continuing to execute on the strategic sourcing process that we've outlined over the course of the last year or 1.5 years. you're correct, ann, it did decrement the savings that we had anticipated slightly. previously, we were anticipating about $40 million of savings in '19 and $80 million of savings by the end of 2020. that was decremented by about $5 million in 2019, and that $5 million carried over into 2020. so i would say not a substantial decrement in the strategic sourcing savings. the significant savings in strategic sourcing really are being generated in our awp business, and to some extent some of the mp businesses.
the teams are in the implementation phase now, significant number of suppliers are changing hands. the good news is, we are seeing the savings that we had anticipated. we are reducing the number of suppliers that we're working with, which i believe over time is going to help us. clearly, it's been a very dynamic environment on the supply side to be engaged in a strategic sourcing process. but the teams are executing, and we need to deliver savings this year and next year. and then, our wave 2 -- as you indicated, our wave 2 teams now are right in the middle of process, beginning to get the rfps and rfqs back, beginning to determine which suppliers we're going to visit to enter into a detailed negotiation. so wave 1 is in implementation. wave 2 is in the supplier selection process, and we're committed to continuing to execute this to drive margin improvement.
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
and john, i would just add in response to the previous question asking about what would drive us in the upper end and the lower end of the range, right. one thing that i didn't mention was strategic sourcing. that's certainly an opportunity that i should have mentioned.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
that's correct.
ann duignan -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay. i appreciate that. and then similar question on the $140 million of capex. your depreciation is running about $53 million. so that's a significant multiple on depreciation. can you just talk about specifically what you're investing in? should we be concerned that we're over investing at the peak of the cycle? just give us some confidence in where that capex has been spent and why now?
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
sure. happy to, ann. you know that if you follow our disciplined capital allocation strategy, it starts with making organic investments in the businesses that are going to drive growth for us in the future. the $140 million of capex that we're projecting for 2019, the largest single investment is for our utilities business and a new manufacturing center in watertown, south dakota. the utilities business, as i talked about a little bit earlier is a $400 million business, 9% to 10% operating margin. and they're constrained in their ability to grow and to expand margin by the manufacturing structure that they have in place today.
so that's our largest business and we're really excited -- our largest investment and we're excited about the investment in that business. aside from that, we are also investing in northern ireland in our materials processing businesses. we also have it investments that we're making in 2019. and you look -- so that for 2019, the capex is exceeding the depreciation that we have, but i also would say that over time, we do see our capex converging with the level of depreciation that we are spending.
so good investments from our perspective. we're going to continue to follow the disciplined capital allocation strategy and generate strong returns from those investments for our shareholders.
ann duignan -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay. i appreciate that. just real quick, of the $140 million, how much is going to south dakota? and then, i'll turn it over.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, no problem. roughly 50% of the capex for 2019 is related to our facility in watertown, south dakota.
ann duignan -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay. thank you. i appreciate it.
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
absolutely.

good morning, steve.
steve volkmann -- jefferies llc -- analyst
maybe just a couple of cleanup items. what's the cash that you're expecting from the sale of demag?
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. we would expect to have net proceeds from the transaction of approximately $125 million, steve.
steve volkmann -- jefferies llc -- analyst
okay, thanks. and then, would you expect any writedowns or charges as you exit the us businesses?
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so, we did take a charge in the fourth quarter of about $6 million that's included in our us gaap results here for the fourth quarter. we, obviously, will be winding down those businesses in the north american cranes over the first half of the year. and at this point, i wouldn't -- i won't comment on whether there would be future charges that we need to take.
steve volkmann -- jefferies llc -- analyst
okay, fair enough. and then maybe sort of a big bigger question, john, other john. i noticed you sort of still talking about your 10% ebit margin target. but, obviously, the transaction gets you quite a bit of the way there. are you being sort of aggressive enough in your view? is there a way to take that target higher now that you have a different business mix? or is this still the right way to think about it?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think -- right now, steve, i think it is the right way to think about the business. clearly, the announcement's taking us a significant way toward achieving that objective. we're going to continue to drive revenue and margin improvement in our mp and awp business. obviously, strategic sourcings are a very important part of that margin opportunity growth as we go forward. so, i would hold that for now and then as things unfold, we'll be back to you in terms of any potential changes.

your next question comes from the line of joe o'dea from vertical research partners. your line is now open.
joseph o' dea -- vertical research partners -- analyst
hi. good morning.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, joe.
joseph o' dea -- vertical research partners -- analyst
could you expand a little bit on the awp 4q margin and then the 2019 doesn't really seem to appear to carry over any of the softness that we would have seen in the fourth quarter. so just kind of what happened there? and then the confidence in no carryover from that?
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, sure. i'll start there, joe. in terms of the fourth quarter for awp, and i mean i'll start with -- they had a really strong 2018, revenue up 24%, expanded their margin by 200 basis points. in the fourth quarter, there were three primary issues that affected the segment. first was material costs, and that really had the largest impact on our operating margin. it was really a dynamic period in the fourth quarter for material costs, especially when you look at the 301 tariffs and the impact both on a direct tariff as well as an indirect tariff basis. so material cost was the number one impact. second were freight costs that were higher than the prior year. and then lastly, the product mix profile was unfavorable. we did have a higher share of telehandlers in the fourth quarter with a different margin profile.
so, we did have some challenges in q4, but we did increase the overall operating margin for the business by 200 basis points over the course of 2018. from a looking forward to 2019 perspective, as john garrison indicated earlier, our 2019 pricing does encompass the material cost increases that we experienced here over the course of 2018, including the fourth quarter. and so that's why the issues will not continue into the first quarter or into our 2019 guidance.
joseph o' dea -- vertical research partners -- analyst
that's helpful. thanks for those details. and then, a second question on the remaining cranes piece and really the rts and towers and whether or not there's any synergy value to a broader product line from a revenue perspective? and as you move forward without the demag line and some of the mobile lines, what that means from an ability to compete? do you lose some of that synergy opportunity on deals and just kind of how you feel about your competitive positioning in those product lines with a much smaller cranes footprint moving forward?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, joe. with respect to the rts and towers, both are stable and they are profitable business with good relative market positions. towers really has always been operated as an independent -- a fairly independent business, independent of the mobile crane operations. so frankly, i don't think there's going to be that much impact. there's not a lot of package deals with towers necessarily in mobile cranes. so i don't -- we don't think there's going to be a significant impact there.
on the rough terrain crane side, it's going to be our global manufacturing center. there may be some impact in the north american market associated with rts, but that crespellano business has a very strong european rt presence and middle east rt presence. again, operates relatively independently of the other elements of the crane business. so we think there's opportunities for these businesses going forward. they're good businesses, well-run, well-managed and we think there's opportunity for us as we go forward into the future.

john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, andy. the pricing for 2019 for the vast majority of what is in backlog is at 2019 pricing. so no, there should not be an impact. there's a very small number of units that carry over that we had a delivery commitment in '18 that for whatever reason we could not achieve that would carry. but it's a small percentage. the majority of the backlog, the vast majority of the backlog is at '19 pricing.
andrew casey -- wells fargo securieties -- analyst
okay. thanks, john. and then on the movement at towers and rts into corporate and other, a few questions there. first, i'm not sure if my understanding is correct, but i historically thought rt was a bigger product for the north american market. first, is that right? and is that why you're highlighting eu and middle east? you might have some dis-synergies from the divestiture?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
we were a little bit inverse compared to most. you're right, the rt market in north america is the largest market. our relative market position there was the weakest. we have a much stronger market position in the rt business in europe and middle east. so we were a bit unique there compared to the overall industry.
andrew casey -- wells fargo securieties -- analyst
okay. thank you. and then -- that any incremental stranded costs from the divestiture incorporated into the corporate and other guide for 2019?
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so when you look at our -- well, first, when you look at sg&a in total, sg&a in total for 2018 at 12.3% was actually below the commitment that we made in december of 2016 in our investor day for a 2020 sg&a target of 12.5%. when you look at the corporate and other segment, we have been centralizing costs into corporate, strategic sourcing. global parts' elements of the commercial excellence initiative and it are all examples of that. and to your exact question, there is in the corporate and other up to $20 million of stranded costs that we will be getting after and reducing over the course of 2019. so we're continuing to manage our overall cost structure as you can see by the discipline we had in the overall sg&a as a percent of sales. but we're also going to continue to invest in the priority -- the execute to win priority areas.
andrew casey -- wells fargo securieties -- analyst
okay. thanks, john. and then one last question. if i look at the placement of towers and (inaudible) and to corporate and other, historically terex has ultimately walked away from some of the revenue that you put into corporate and other. can you discuss what metrics you're considering to determine whether that revenue that's now in corporate and other remains a part of terex?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. the reason -- the core reason we're putting it in the corporate really has to do with the sg&a efficiency. maintaining a three segment organization with $750 million of revenue or so we just didn't believe was efficient. and so these two businesses that have been put in there are strong businesses. as i've indicated, they've operated relatively independent anyway, and these are in businesses that are strong market positions, good return businesses, that we're going to invest in to continue to grow those businesses going forward.
andrew casey -- wells fargo securieties -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and your final question comes from the line of seth weber from rbc capital markets. your line is now open.
brendan shea -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
this is brendan on for seth. just kind of touching on awp. again, your commentary has been very optimistic, very positive and it was a little bit of a difficult comp year-over-year, but i was wondering any more color you could give on the 2% decline this quarter in orders?
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, i think just if you look at the relative backlog, we had a very, very strong 2017. we were able to build the backlog up 14% on a year-over-year basis off a very strong comp. and so overall, no, i wouldn't read anything more into that. it's still a good, solid environment. stable and healthy is what is the words that we'd use. so i wouldn't read too much into that. and i'd look more at the backlog and the relative side to the backlog given that we had a strong backlog in '17.
brendan shea -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. thanks. that all from me.
operator
i'd now like to turn the call back over to john garrison for closing remarks.

good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in today's fourth quarter 2018 financial results conference call. participating on today's call are john garrison, chairman and chief executive officer; and john sheehan, senior vice president and chief financial officer.
following the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. we have released our fourth quarter 2018 results, a copy of which is available on terex.com. today's call is being webcast and is accompanied by a slide presentation, which includes a reconciliation of gaap to non-gaap financial measures that we will use during this call and is also available on our website.
all adjusted per share amounts in the presentation are on a fully diluted basis. we will post a replay of this call on the terex website under events and presentations in the investor relations section.
let me direct your attention to slide two, which is our forward-looking statement and description of non-gaap financial measures. we encourage you to read this as well as other items in our disclosures because the information we will be discussing today does include forward-looking material.
with that, please turn to slide three, and i'll turn it over to john garrison.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, and thank you for joining us and for your interest in terex. overall, our global team executed well in the fourth quarter, completing a year of significant growth and considerable earnings improvement. we made progress implementing our strategy and are seeing the results in our performance, expanding operating margins and doubling full year earnings per share.
our global markets remain strong. we increased backlog in every segment, up 19% overall. this growth is on top of the strong backlog we had at the end of 2017, a clear indication that our commercial strategies are working and the markets we serve continue to grow.
awp grew sales by 24% in 2018 and expanded their operating margin by 200 basis points. we are encouraged by the strength of the north american rental markets where our customers continue to anticipate growth and continue to increase their capital expenditure plan.
cranes delivered on its commitment to generate a profit in the fourth quarter. improvements made in materials management enabled better manufacturing productivity and customer deliveries. mp continued to executive at a high-level, growing the fourth quarter sales by 20% and expanding operating margin by 150 basis points. for the full year, mp grew sales by 17% and increased operating profit by 32%. a great year for our global mp team.
turning to slide four. we made progress implementing our strategy in 2018. an area of intense focus for us is safety. we're developing a 0 harm safety culture across terex that puts safety first in every aspect of our business. we continue to make progress in 2018, reducing our loss time rate by 27%, and improving total recordable rate by 13%. good results by our team in a year that saw us on board thousands of new team members across our global sites. it is important to understand that safety performance is highly correlated with overall performance. companies that execute well on safety, execute well on all aspects of their business.
turning to slide five. we have announced the sale of our demag mobile cranes business, which sells all terrain and large crawler cranes, produced at our facilities in zweibrucken, germany. the demag mobile cranes business has been an important part of terex for many years, with dedicated team members that have made significant contributions to terex and to the crane industry.
however, after a strategic evaluation, we determined that as a stand-alone business, demag mobile cranes was unlikely within an acceptable time period to outearn its cost of capital over the cycle. the combination is based on strong industrial logic. the demag mobile crane business will become part of a global crane company that is well established in the industry. subject to customary regulatory approvals, we expect this transaction to be completed midyear, and we'll use the proceeds to invest in our existing businesses and reduce outstanding borrowings.
we're also exiting the north american mobile crane product lines manufactured in oklahoma city. these changes will simplify the okc operation, which will continue to produce telehandlers and refurbished units for awp and products for materials processing. reshaping our mobile cranes portfolio is consistent with our strategy to focus on businesses that provide the greatest return to our shareholders. these actions will significantly increase our operating profit, margins and earnings per share and will improve our free cash flow and lower our net leverage. we will continue to manufacture terex branded rough terrain, tower and pick and carry cranes. we'll also maintain parts, service and support for our north american crane products.
the utilities business will become part of the aerial work platforms segment. the pick and carry business will become part in the material processing segment. the rough terrain and tower crane businesses will be reported in corporate. these remaining businesses are strong performers with approximately $750 million of revenue and 10% operating margin. during the transition, our global team will continue to provide exceptional service to our customers.
turning to slide six. during 2018, we continue to implement the simplify and execute to win elements of our strategy. we initiated strategic investments to expand our global manufacturing footprint, including the new utilities manufacturing center in south dakota and mp locations in the uk and india. these actions are consistent with our disciplined capital allocation strategy.
execute to win is about dramatically improving our capabilities by investing in people, processes and tools in our three priority areas: commercial excellence, lifecycle solutions and strategic sourcing. the improved process discipline from our commercial excellence program is translating into growth and margin improvement. we continue to develop our parts and service organization in the fourth quarter and completed the implementation of a new best-in-class parts pricing system in awp, utilities and portions of the mp business.
finally, our strategic sourcing initiative continues to make progress. savings associated with our wave 1 award decisions are in line with our objectives and implementation is under way. on a continuing operations basis, we anticipate savings of approximately $75 million to be realized by 2020.
turning to slide seven. we have an aggressive strategy deployment plan for 2019. we will complete the demag mobile crane sale and exit the okc mobile crane product lines. our team has a proven track record of executing these types of transactions. we will continue to reduce general and administrative expenses to reflect the more focused portfolio, while continuing to invest in our strategic priority areas, including engineering, new product development and innovation. we also plan to invest approximately $140 million in capital expenditures in 2019, substantially more than 2018. the increased investment will fund manufacturing capacity expansion, underpinning our multiyear global growth strategy.
our commercial excellence teams will focus on improving the customer experience and driving process discipline by completing the deployment of the terex proven sales process in salesforce.com. our global parts and service organization is taking shape. the team has an aggressive plan to improve operations, which will dramatically improve customer service.
finally, on strategic sourcing. implementation teams in each of our manufacturing facilities are working through supplier transitions, starting with the highest impact opportunities. on a continuing operations basis, we are planning to achieve savings of approximately $35 million this year.
turning to slide eight. the 2019 guidance we are providing today is based on our continuing operations, which excludes the elements of our former cranes segment that we are divesting and exiting. we expect these portfolio actions and the ongoing implementation of our simplify and execute to win strategy to dramatically improve our financial performance again in 2019.
we expect to increase sales and significantly improve earnings per share and free cash flow. overall, we're excited about 2019. we will execute our plans to deliver strong financial results and make fundamental changes that will dramatically improve terex for years to come.
with that, let me turn it over to john.
john sheehan -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, john. let me begin by reviewing our q4 segment highlights. awp increased sales by $86 million or 19% compared to last year, driven by growth in north america and asia. fourth quarter bookings were similar to last year at a very healthy $831 million, fueling year-end backlog of $868 million, a 14% year-over-year increase.
awp's operating margin of 4.9% was significantly impacted by material cost headwinds, including higher steel costs, direct and indirect tariffs and unfavorable product mix.
moving to cranes. improvements in materials management and operational performance enabled revenue growth of 12%. and as expected, the cranes segment returned to profitability in the fourth quarter.
materials processing closed out the year with another excellent quarter. sales were $340 million, up 20%, driven by global demand for crushing and screening products, material handlers and environmental equipment. the mp team increased year-over-year operating profit by 34% and expanded operating margin by 150 basis points despite material cost headwinds. backlog grew 54% to $490 million. both awp and mp are well positioned for another strong year heading into 2019.
let's turn to slide 10 to review our q4 consolidated results. total sales increased by 16%. mp's higher operating margin and lower corporate expenses more than offset the impact of margin pressure at awp, leading to overall margin expansion and 30% higher operating profit on an adjusted basis. investment in our transformation program and asset impairment charges related to our oklahoma city-based cranes operation were the primary differences between our as reported and as adjusted operating profit.
net interest expense increased $5 million year-over-year, resulting from increased borrowing and higher interest rates on floating rate facilities. a onetime noncash charge of $67 million related to the annuitization of our us pension is included in our as reported results. we reduced our effective tax rate in the quarter to 18% to account for our full year tax rate of 22%, which is lower than our previous estimate due largely to tax settlements outside the united states. on an adjusted basis, we generated earnings per share of $0.51, 55% greater than last year.
turning to slide 11. overall, 2018 was a good year for terex. awp achieved global sales of approximately $2.6 billion and expanded its operating margin by 200 basis points. mp had an excellent year, approaching $1.3 billion in global sales and expanding its operating margin to 13.1%.
cranes underperformed through the first three quarters, inhibited by supply chain issues, but returned to profitability in q4. overall, we grew sales by 18% to $5.1 billion, improved our operating margin by 160 basis points and generated 52% more operating profit than the prior year.
executing our disciplined capital allocation strategy, we lowered our average outstanding share count by 19%. as a result, we doubled our eps, generating $2.71 per share. it took a ton of hard work by our dedicated team members around the world to achieve these results in 2018.
turning to slide 12. we continued to deliver on our commitment to follow a disciplined capital allocation strategy. in 2018, we generated free cash flow of $15 million, higher inventory levels, principally in awp, and the timing of 301 tariff recoveries impacted cash flow. we expect to reduce awp inventory during the upcoming selling season.
we are making strategic investments in our businesses. in 2018, we invested nearly twice as much capex as the prior year, and we plan to substantially increase capex again in 2019 with the new utilities manufacturing facility in watertown, south dakota being the largest investment. we will continue to invest in our transformation priority areas at lower levels than in the past of couple years as our internal capabilities are maturing.
in q4, we annuitized our us pension plan, removing $109 million in gross pension liability from our balance sheet and eliminating future administration and funding costs associated with the plan. we continue to return capital to shareholders. throughout 2018, we repurchased over 11 million shares of terex stock, reducing our outstanding shares by 14%.
finally, we generated 17% return on invested capital in 2018 and are on track to achieve our 2020 objective of 20% roic. the terex team has and will continue to generate shareholder value through the execution of our disciplined capital allocation strategy.
let's turn to our 2019 guidance. we expect to achieve significant financial improvement by executing the portfolio action that john described. in addition, we will benefit from the ongoing implementation of our simplify and execute to win initiatives. the guidance we're providing today is for continuing operations, which excludes the element of our former cranes segment that we are divesting and exiting. we expect to increase revenue on a comparative basis by 3% to 6% to a midpoint of approximately $4.7 billion, with operating margins between 9% and 10%. we anticipate higher interest and other expense up about $12 million due to increased borrowing and higher rates on floating rate facilities.
our 2019 tax rate assumption is 21%. we expect this operational performance to result in 2019 ebitda between $465 million and $525 million and free cash flow of $165 million. we expect 2019 earnings from continuing operations of between $3.60 and $4.20 per share. this represents an improvement of approximately $1.20 per share or 45% greater eps than our actual as-adjusted 2018 results. from a quarterly perspective, we expect eps to be generated roughly 15% in q1, 35% in q2, 30% in q3 and 20% in q4.
that said, i would like to point out that as a result of the recent winter storm in the northwest united states, our awp washington state manufacturing facilities, representing the majority of our north american production have been closed for over a week. we are evaluating the impact of this unusual winter storm on our q1 results.
we have made several changes to the reporting structure of our business segment. our utilities business is now included in aerial work platforms and the pick and carry business is in materials processing. the rough terrain and tower cranes businesses are in corporate. we expect awp to increase sales by 3% to 6% on a comparative basis to a midpoint of approximately $3.1 billion and improve operating margin to between 10.5% and 11.5%.
materials processing is a consistently strong performer. we expect to grow sales in 2019, anticipating an increase of between 2% and 6% on a comparative basis to a midpoint of approximately $1.4 billion, while achieving an operating margin of between 13% and 13.5%.
mp operates several facilities in the uk. our guidance assumes that there will not be any major disruptions associated with brexit. we are taking precautionary measures to mitigate potential supply chain disruption and will continue to monitor events as the year unfolds.
finally, within corporate we expect sales from the towers and rough terrain cranes businesses to be approximately $245 million. corporate also captures the investment we continue to make in our execute to win initiatives.
with that, i'll turn it back to john.
john garrison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, john. i'll review our segments, starting with awp, which now includes terex utilities. the global markets for the aerial work platforms are stable at healthy level. and the north american utility market remains strong. following a strong 2018, our awp team enters 2019 with a backlog, including utilities of $1.1 billion, 21% higher than the prior year.
the underlying construction, utility and industrial markets in north america remained strong. our rental customers continue to see improving rental rates and higher equipment utilization. rental market growth and replacement cycle demand is driving the anticipated growth in 2019. product adoption is continuing to fuel growth in china and other developing areas around the world.
material costs rose considerably in 2018, driven by higher steel prices and tariffs. we reset prices heading into 2019 to help offset these higher material costs. to improve margins, the awp team is fully committed to executing their strategic sourcing plan, including transitioning significant volume to new suppliers.
in the aerials market, the genie brand is synonymous with technological leadership and innovation. the genie team maintains a steady cadence of new product introductions and enhancements. in 2019, we'll continue to add more fuel-efficient, hybrid products and fill out the extra capacity line.
the xc line is important for genie as the new ansi standards governing load levels take effect later this year. the awp team used the ansi standard change as an opportunity to innovate and add customer value. our new xc family of booms increases the platform capacity, allowing contractors to safely lift more workers, tools and equipment. in some cases, a single xc machine can do the work of the two competitive machines. these innovations were part of a long-term product development strategy. the extra capacity line will create value for our rental customers and end-users, another great example of genie innovation.
now part of awp, the utilities team will remain focused on implementing its manufacturing strategy and executing its new product and service development plan, designed to gain share in a stable market environment. in summary, our dedicated and passionate awp team will continue to meet the growing demand of our customers around the world.
turning to mp. materials processing is a high-performing segment that consistently delivers strong results and meets its commitment. mp finished strongly, increasing backlog by 55%, it's well positioned heading into 2019.
global demand for crushing and screening equipment is expected to remain strong. construction activity, aggregate consumption and environmental regulatory change continued to be the main demand drivers. demand for material handlers is also expected to remain strong, and the markets for our environmental products are growing. the mp team continues to expand its penetration into emerging markets for environmental and mobile crushing and screening equipment with considerable growth coming from india.
finally, our pick and carry business in australia expects sales to remain steady in 2019 after achieving considerable growth over the past two years. new product development will continue to differentiate our mp businesses with new crushing and screening products being launched in the powerscreen and finlay line this year. our new fuchs products are designed to open adjacent markets, including timber yards, ports and other waste processing.
to support mp's growth plan, the team is implementing a global manufacturing strategy to increase capacity in the uk, india and china. the team will execute these plans throughout 2019 and into 2020. i expect our mp team to continue to execute at a high-level and deliver on its plans again this year.
turning to slide 16. to wrap up our prepared remarks, our global terex team achieved significant growth and made meaningful improvements in 2018. we are taking action to focus the portfolio on high-performing businesses. we will continue to execute our transformation program, simplifying the company and building capabilities in our execute to win priority areas. we expect to significantly improve our financial performance again in 2019. we are confident in achieving our 2020 objectives of 10% operating margin and 20% roic.
finally, we will continue to follow our disciplined capital allocation strategy and create additional value for our shareholders.
with that, let me turn it back over to brian.
brian henry -- senior vice president, business development and investor relations
