operator
good morning. my name is maria, and i'll be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the first quarter 2020 discover financial services earnings conference call. [operator instructions] thank you.
i will now turn the call over to mr. craig streem, head of investor relations. please go ahead.
craig streem -- investor relations
sure. thanks a lot maria. good morning everybody and welcome to our call. we'll begin on slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find as always in the financial section of our investor relations website investorrelations.discover.com. our discussion this morning contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in today's earnings press release and presentation. our call this morning will include remarks from our ceo, roger hochschild; and from john greene, our chief financial officer. and after we conclude our formal comments, there will be time, as maria said, for a question-and-answer session. during the q&a session, we appreciate it if you limit yourself initially to one question. if you have a follow-up maybe queue back in so we can be sure to accommodate as many participants as possible.
and now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to roger.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
thanks, craig, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. i hope all of you and your families are staying healthy and safe during these very challenging times. i'd also like to take a moment to acknowledge and thank the healthcare workers, first responders, grocery store workers, and many others who've been working so hard and often great personal sacrifice for the benefit of our communities and country. the structure of this call will be a bit different than our traditional earnings calls. after my opening remarks, john will discuss our first quarter results with a particular focus on the reserve build. i'll then come back and provide additional information as to what we have been seeing since the end of the first quarter.
here at discover, our top priority has been the health and safety of our employees. our headquarters functions moved to work from home on march 16 with minimal disruption. and our technology team and field leadership did an incredible job getting nearly all of our 8,000 discover call center team members working from the safety of their homes within two weeks. a robust business continuity plans, digital business model and a 100% u.s.-based customer service helped ensure our representatives were ready, even as we faced an unprecedented increase in call volumes from concerned customers impacted by the coronavirus. early on in the crisis we answered 95% of calls in less than five minutes. and for april, as our team got more comfortable working from home, average call times have been under one minute.
we are providing significant support to our customers across every product to help them through this crisis. we've expanded payment plans across our credit card, student and personal loan and home equity products and waived fees on cd early withdrawals for customers who need emergency access to their funds. our strong capital position and balanced funding model are also a source of strength. john will provide additional detail but i'm especially pleased with the strong demand we are seeing for our deposit products. some of the early impacts of the pandemic can be seen in our first quarter results specifically in sales volume and card loan growth. for the company overall, we generated a net loss of $61 million or $0.25 per share as the benefits of solid growth in average loans were more than offset by higher provision expense.
as we adopted the cecl reserve methodology on january 1, the reserve build this quarter reflected the life of loan view as well as an outlook for a weaker economy and higher unemployment. actions we have taken since the crisis began includes significant tightening of underwriting for new card and personal loan accounts with additional employment verification and we've pulled back on balance transfer offers and line increases. as i've mentioned on prior calls, for the last 18 months we have been tightening credit at the margin, as we have felt for some time that we are in late credit cycle. but given the present environment we are adopting a significantly more cautious view. to give you a sense for how our card portfolio compares today with how it looked at the end of 2007, our contingent liability, meaning the total open to buy for our card products has been reduced from roughly 5.7 times loans to around 2.7 times.
and the percentage of the portfolio below a fico score of 660 has gone from 26% at that time, down to 19% at the end of 2019. so while we are not immune from the impacts of deterioration in the economy, our portfolio is significantly better positioned than it was ahead of the last financial crisis. in addition to our credit actions we are taking a hard look at operating expenses to ensure investments align with the economic environment. we are implementing approximately $400 million of cost reductions over the remaining three quarters of 2020 and will continue to review expense levels as the economic environment evolves.
i'll now ask john to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail. then i'll come back to discuss the current environment.
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, roger, and good morning everyone. before i begin, i want to echo roger's thanks to all the people working on the front lines of the pandemic. i also want to thank all of our discover associates. they've pivoted to a work from home environment while maintaining their high service levels and professionalism throughout. today, i will summarize the results for the quarter, then provide details on our credit performance and loan provisions. i'll conclude with an update on capital and funding trends before turning the call back over to roger to summarize our covid-19 response actions. in light of the uncertainty in the economy, we are withdrawing our previously provided guidance.
but as roger mentioned, we are targeting $400 million of cost reductions through the balance of the year, with the majority in the second half. our expense actions include, reducing account acquisition expense, cutting spending on brand awareness and consideration activities, and reducing vendor and technology spend. we will continue to review all discretionary spending as the payback on incremental spend has changed. in the interest of focusing our comments this morning on the impacts of the pandemic and our responses, we are not going to review our customary slides on loan growth, payment volumes, and revenue. but you can [indecipherable] disclosures on slide 11 to 16 in the appendix to this presentation. and as always, we are happy to take questions on these or any other aspects of the quarterly results.
on slide 4, looking at key elements of the income statement, revenue, net of interest expense increased 5% this quarter, driven primarily by a 6% increase in average loans and a $35 million net gain in our payment services segment, principally from the sale of a portion of an equity investment. net interest margin was 10.21% for the first quarter. this was down 25 basis points year-over-year, due largely to lower loan yields as the prime rate came down in response to fed rate cuts in september and october of last year. this was partially offset by lower funding costs. the additional fed rate cuts in march of this year will impact net interest margin beginning in the second quarter. provisions for credit losses include a net charge off of $769 million, up 8% from last year and an increase in reserves of approximately $1 billion, reflecting the deterioration in the economic outlook.
i'll have some additional comments in credit in a moment but before we turn to the next slide, i want to discuss operating expenses. they were up 13% from the prior year first quarter. the increase was principally due to higher compensation expense, increased marketing cost and investments in technology. turning now to slide 5, showing our key credit metrics, credit performance remained stable in the first quarter. we did not see any discernible impacts from the national covid-19 containment activity or from our own credit mitigation actions in response. card charge-offs increased 15 basis points from last year's quarter due principally to seasoning of loan growth. the credit card 30 plus delinquency rate was up 17 basis points from last year, but flat versus the prior quarter with both metrics reflecting consistent performance and typical seasonal patterns.
our private student loan and personal loan portfolios also had stable credit performance in the quarter with both showing slight improvements in charge-offs and delinquency rates. on slide 6, you'll see our allowance for credit losses. we added $2.5 billion to the allowance for credit losses in january of this year as we transition to a life of loan cecl basis. at the end of the quarter, we added approximately $1 billion to the allowance largely due to changes in the macroeconomic forecast. the reserve build assumes unemployment rising to more than 9% recovering through 2022 and a decline in gdp of nearly 18%. we also included our best estimate of the reserve implications of the government stimulus programs. as the economic outlook evolves and the impacts of the various government relief programs become more clear, we will adjust our allowance accordingly.
turning to slide 7, our common equity tier 1 ratio increased 10 basis points sequentially mainly due to a decrease in loan balances, partially offset by capital returns. for purpose of calculating regulatory capital, we have elected to defer recognition of the cecl day 1 adjustment for two years. so, we will begin to phase in our day 1 cecl impacts in 2022 with 100% phased in by 2025. the federal banking regulators have also provided to phase-in for the day 2 impacts of cecl with 25% of the quarterly reserve build also being deferred until 2022 and then treated the same as the day 1 deferral. our payout ratio, which includes buybacks was 99% over the last 12 months. as roger noted, we have suspended our share buyback program but we will continue to fund our regular quarterly dividend.
our liquidity position remains very strong. as of the end of the quarter, we had $19 billion in liquid assets, $6 billion in committed borrowing capacity through privately placed asset-backed securitizations, and $35 billion in borrowing capacity at the federal reserve discount window. as of april 20, our liquid assets have grown to more than $23 billion. in addition to those forms of actual and committed liquidity, we have access to funding through our direct-to-consumer deposit channel with average deposits increasing 20% year-over-year and now making up over 55% of total funding. based on the strength of consumer demand, yesterday, we reduced rates on our savings accounts by 10 basis point and will continue to look for opportunities to do so. in summary, good progress on the expense front, liquidity is robust, capital remains strong and we continue to monitor and manage our credit exposure.
and now, i'll turn the call back over to roger.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
thanks, john. while we will not be providing new guidance, given the uncertain economic outlook, i do want to provide you with an update on two key areas where the covid-19 pandemic is impacting our business in a way that was not captured in the q1 results. on slide 8, we're giving you a detailed look at sales volume trends to illustrate how covid-19 has affected cardholder spending in april as compared to the much smaller impact we saw on the first quarter sales. the first column shows the composition of sales by category for the full year 2019 so you can see where our cardholders spend is normally distributed by industry. we then give you the year-over-year growth percentages for the first quarter of 2020 and month-to-date april. on a day-adjusted basis, every day sales, which includes gas, groceries and wholesale clubs and makes up about 22% of total sales saw growth of 10% during the quarter.
so far in april however, every day sales are down 14% year-over-year as increased spending on groceries is more than offset by a 60% reduction in spend in petroleum. discretionary spend is down 33% driven by the travel category, which although only 8% of cardholder spending is down 99% and by retail, which is down 11%. as long as stay at home orders remain in place and many businesses remain closed we expect the weak sales volume trend to continue and future trends will depend upon the pace of the recovery. turning to slide 9, i want to take you through the skip-a-payment programs we have implemented to help our customers during this period of economic difficulty. we recognize that covid-19 has placed financial stress on the discover customers who may be out of work or have suffered reduced wages.
one of the key differences in this downturn compared to the great recession of 2008-2010 has been the staggering pace of job loss, but also the amount of government stimulus and the potential for many of those jobs to be restored after a hopefully brief period of unemployment. therefore we are offering support to those impacted by covid-19 with skip-a-payment programs available across all of our products, many modeled on the relief we traditionally provide for a natural disaster. through the first half of april, we have enrolled over 450,000 customers and roughly $3.8 billion in receivables in skip-a-payment programs to provide financial relief to our customers across our lending products. the receivables enrolled now represent 4% of total loans. but we are encouraged that the number of daily enrollments has been declining since the level peaked in late march.
we will continue to work with these customers closely and potentially extend programs when required to meet the customers' needs. let me close by summarizing some of the actions we have taken to respond to the covid-19 pandemic. we have shifted virtually all of our employees to work from home in a sustainable model that still continues to provide an industry-leading customer experience across all of our products. we have taken swift and meaningful action to adjust our credit policies to reflect the new environment, continuing to lend but with tightened standards for new accounts and for growing existing accounts. we are implementing expense reduction initiatives while preserving key investments that will allow us to grow our business over the long term, and we are prepared for additional actions as the environment evolves.
while our capital position is strong we have suspended our share repurchase program in order to enhance our capital base. clearly, we will have some challenging quarters ahead, but i am confident that we have taken the correct actions. none of us can foresee when the pandemic impacts will subside and allow the u.s. economy to begin to recover. but discover is well-positioned for the recovery that we know will eventually come. we have a loyal customer base, committed employees and a strong financial foundation to build from as we look to deliver long-term value to our customers and shareholders.
that concludes our formal remarks. so i will turn the call back to our operator, maria to open the line for q&a.

thank you. [operator instructions] and we'll take our first question from bob napoli of william blair.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
thank you and good morning everybody. hope everybody's well. a question on the -- your outlook for unemployment and gdp since you're reserving for the life of the loans and i know you gave some numbers. but are you -- can you just go over those numbers for 2020, 2021 and what you're expecting as far as recovery and what effect is -- will that have on loan growth?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
okay. thanks bob. this is john. i'll take a shot at that. so there is a wide degree of economic forecast that we took a look at while we're building our models and ultimately our allowance. so what we built in was unemployment peaking at 9% and staying relatively high through the balance of this year so about 7% through the end of the year and then it recovers slowly through 2022. so not expecting a real quick recovery and rather slow in our allowances as reflected in that dynamic as we as we model that out. the loan -- and your second part of your question on loan growth, so the loan growth will be dependent on how we see the economy and the recovery proceeding. as roger mentioned in his comments, we have been cautious coming into this cycle and when the pandemic hit, we pulled back further, so loan growth will be subject to essentially the recovery of the economy.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
so we would expect to see loans declining, i guess from here, at least for the next quarter or two? i mean, is that fair?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
bob, there are a lot of factors that will go into where loans go. certainly the retail spend numbers that i gave you will have a significant impact on that. the credit action and expense actions we've taken will have an impact on loan growth as well. but to john's point, there's a lot of uncertainty that will be determined by the pace of the recovery.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
thank you. appreciate it.
operator
our next question comes from the line of sanjay sakhrani of kbw.
sanjay sakhrani -- kbw -- analyst
thanks, good morning. and i hope you guys are doing well as well. i guess it's been pretty well documented that since the end of march some of the economic forecasts have actually been revised worse. so could you just talk about how that might be contemplated in the future, or whether or not you guys think it should be? and then also how you guys are incorporating some of these skip-a-payment to cure rates and such inside your loss assumptions?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
okay, thank you. so, as i said on my response to the last question, there is a wide degree of variation on the estimate. so when we put this together, we were looking at what -- likely scenario was. now, the economic backdrop continues to evolve. so we certainly did consider that there are some overlays related to how we think about recoveries and certainly we did put a mild overlay in for the government stimulus programs, but it is uncertain. and if the economy deteriorates further and we don't see a recovery that will have reserve implications. if it runs out as we've modeled that will also play through into the balance sheet and the p&l. so i know i'm not being real specific on your answer, but at this point given the uncertainty this was our best estimate. in terms of your second part of your question on skip-a-pay, so that -- the nature of that program is -- for card is that an inbound call will happen.
the customer, if they're impacted by covid, they'll get an automatic, basically payment deferral. they won't have to make the payment. if they call back a second time, they can get a second deferral on the payment. and after that, they would either pay and go current or continue to kind of roll into delinquency buckets and ultimately charge-offs. so as we provisioned, we thought about life of loan provisions and feel like we did a reasonably good job of capturing the dynamics on the portfolio. the one impact on skip-a-pay is that if a customer is in trouble and isn't able to pay it will result in up to a two-month deferral into charge-off just by the nature of how things roll. but i do want to point out that just over 80% of those customers who entered into the skip-a-pay program were current at that time.
sanjay sakhrani -- kbw -- analyst
okay. and just to clarify, i guess the same forecast you used for your assumptions in the first quarter, have those actually been revised for the worse in early into the second quarter? and if everything remain the same would that mean that there would have to be an additional provision or are you saying that it's really subjective based on sort of how you're seeing things unfold based on your own forecasts?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, so there is a number of factors and i'm not trying to be allusive here, sanjay, but unemployment and gdp contraction are obviously key inputs. the duration of the slowdown will also be important, geographic input impacts are important, job classes are important. so ultimately, it will be a matter of the pace of the recovery, but just to go back to clarify my remarks, so we assumed just over 9% unemployment levels at a peak and then a very, very slow recovery in 2020 and then coming in through 2022.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
and sanjay, just to build on that, the reserve is calculated at a point in time and so we'll go through a similar process next quarter. my guess is there will be a lot of ups and downs in economic forecasts between now and then. and i would contrast that with in terms of how we make our credit decisions that is done on a near continuous basis, and a much more granular level. and so we're looking by industry sector, we're looking by geographic area. we're making decisions on who we book, line assignment, how much employment verification we do. so i contrast the reserve calculation with how we're managing credit, which is near continuous.
sanjay sakhrani -- kbw -- analyst
okay, great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of mark devries of barclays.
mark devries -- barclays -- analyst
yeah, good morning. thanks for taking my question. it sounds like your macro assumptions are not too dissimilar from the last recession as far as kind of, where unemployment peaks and the pace of the recovery. yet the card reserve reflects cumulative losses that are probably less than half of what you experienced in '08, '09 timeframe. can you just talk about how -- the portfolio has changed in a manner that it makes you comfortable that the losses won't approach what we saw in the last recession?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
there is a couple of important pieces related to the portfolio that change. so roger mentioned this in his comments in terms of the open to buy. so the open to buy has reduced by about $54 billion from the last recession to this recession. average fico scores in the portfolio have increased between 500 basis points and 600 basis points, which is a material change. our underwriting frankly is far more sophisticated than it was 10 years ago. and frankly, the actions that this business undertook when the pandemic started to actually drive some real difficult employment numbers was drastic and very, very quick. so i don't know if it's -- if there is a perfect formulary between the last recession and this recession, time will tell. but certainly, i feel like the business is well-positioned and took decisive action. and again, if the economic outlook changes, we'll adjust the reserves and the allowance accordingly.
mark devries -- barclays -- analyst
okay, fair enough. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of don fandetti of wells fargo. don, your line is open. make sure you're not on mute.
donald fandetti -- wells fargo -- analyst
yes, john. try to sort of tell you to a specific number on the stimulus, is it realistic that you could have as you've looked at your scenarios maybe a point or two lower net charge-offs from stimulus? and then secondarily, most financial institutions have said there'd probably be another reserve build, a sizable reserve build in q2. just wanted to, i know you've talked a lot about it, but is that the case as you sit here today in april?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
so real difficult to answer at this point. so we're going to monitor the economy and our portfolio and actually how our customers are performing and make appropriate calls on reserve builds in subsequent quarters. in terms of the government stimulus programs, the impact that we modeled was relatively modest. so i don't know if i would go to a full percentage point on charge-offs, but there was a mild impact. and as we see that unfold, it will become more clear. the key thing on the stimulus programs at least initially was with the unemployment checks going out in the $600, i'll say benefit, that's a front-loaded impact and we'll have to see how things develop on the back half of the year.
donald fandetti -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay, thank you. that's helpful.
operator
our next question comes from the line of bill carcache of nomura.
bill carcache -- nomura securities -- analyst
thank you. good morning. roger and john, i was hoping to follow-up on your thoughts about the potential benefit from government relief programs, specifically on the paycheck protection program. can you comment on the idea that unemployed consumers who are receiving payments under ppp and therefore are not receiving unemployment insurance maybe understating the true level of initial claims, which you guys have always cited as an important leading indicator of credit performance? and then if we extend that line of thinking, how much of a concern is there that like those receiving unemployment insurance, employees participating in ppp face uncertainty about their employment outlook and still have to make decisions about which bills to pay first, what that means for the unsecured credit card? just i guess, the overall consensus view seems to be that ppp is a positive in the near-term, but it's not a longer term fix and i was just hoping to that you could maybe speak a little bit more to i guess, the broad potential that the ppp program will benefit, your loss experience and your confidence level in that? thanks.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yeah, i mean, i think all of the government stimulus provides a benefit, but given the depth of the decrease in economic activity what we all really need is for the economy to start back up again and that will depend on the pace of reopenings in different states and it is impossible for us to forecast as we sit here. some of the traditional relationships may break down a bit. a lot of the initial unemployment claims have been driven by, i would say entry-level employees and retail, restaurant, other industries that may have less of a correlation with what we see in our prime card base. so there is a necessary even the same one-to-one interaction that we would have seen in previous downturns where the job mix was different and that job mix may change over time during this recession as well. so i would summarize with, the government programs are helpful but what we really need is the economy to get going again and so lot of this will depend on the pace of the recovery.
bill carcache -- nomura securities -- analyst
thanks, that's helpful. i guess maybe if i could just follow-up with a conceptual question on cecl. i guess, a different way of asking would come up on the idea that if macro conditions were to continue to deteriorate relative to your expectations at the end of q1. at a high level, is it reasonable to expect that we will see additional reserve building? and then therefore when conditions stop deteriorating, we'll stop seeing additional reserve building and maybe kind of another way to ask that is if you can envision a scenario where you would need to continue to build more reserves even after economic conditions start to improve? just trying to get -- just get the big picture idea of how cecl is going to work.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
okay. so big picture, if the economic conditions continue to deteriorate, there will be two dynamics that are likely to happen. one would be cecl life of loan provisions would increase, so the allowance would increase. we would also take appropriate actions to ensure that our portfolio is stable and the lending activity we were doing made sense. so you could expect that the portfolio frankly might not increase and would actually decrease and if that were the case, you would see some level of offset as a result of reserve releases tied to the portfolio size or the overall loan size. so there's multiple dynamics there that come into play, but i hope that conceptually helpful.
bill carcache -- nomura securities -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of jason kupferberg of bank of america.
maher -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, thank you for taking my question. i wanted to ask a little bit more about just the forbearance programs. sorry, firstly, this is maher [phonetic] on for jason. i wanted to ask about the forbearance program and the skip-a-pay. are you also continuing some of your typical modification programs here? and can you just help us a little bit with the mechanics in terms of just how you deal with the fact with whether you'd lower credit limits available to borrow, etc, for those who seek either of these programs? and just how you expect that to lead -- like with the skip-a-pay, whether you -- will people be transitioning from that if they continue to grow through the delinquency buckets to your other modification programs? or is it that once you do the skip-a-pay, now you don't -- you aren't eligible for some of those other programs? just want to understand a little bit more on how you're dealing with some of the delinquencies? thank you.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yeah, it's roger. let me try it at a high level. as john described for card, it's a two-month program, up to two months for skip-a-pay but they do one month. less than 5% have renewed for the second month, so we'll see how that plays out over time. we do still have our programs for customers that need a longer period of assistance. regulators have been encouraging us and others to maximize the support we provide for customers. but again, i think it really does depend on the pace of recovery. as john pointed out, over 80% of those taking advantage of skip-a-pay are current and so our hope would be, and again, that's why we've modeled it after some of disaster relief programs we traditionally had that they will require a shorter bridge. and then we'll be able to get back to paying their bills, if not we have longer term programs to assist them.
maher -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
and just, sorry, just to clarify on that one, do you do anything with the longer -- with skip-a-pay that there is no change to their credit limits available to borrowers, etc? correct?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
no. for those who have signed up for skip-a-pay, it does not impact their credit limits.
maher -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
understood. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of rick shane of j.p. morgan.
rick shane -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi guys. thanks for taking my questions this morning. thank you for all the information on the skip-a-pay. i'm curious what you're seeing in terms of payment behaviors for consumers who are on skip-a-pay programs. are you seeing an increase in consumers who are making minimum payments on a monthly basis?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
so we're still [indecipherable] pattern to emerge and part of it is driven by the drastic reduction in sales volume that you've seen. what i would say is that reduction in sales is relatively equal across transactors and revolvers. and so, it's balanced in that way. but what happens with payment rate, i think will be determined on how quickly those sales ramp up. some people making larger payments and you can see from the inflow into our deposit products, there are a lot of households who are still ok but are looking to fortify their position. so i'd say it's too early to really pick out a pattern in terms of impact of all these changes on payment rate.
rick shane -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it, ok. and we share your view in looking at this in the context of a natural disaster in terms of how the challenges emerge. but one thing that historically has been subsequent to a natural disaster are significant insurance payments into those regions, which create things like huge cash inflows. we've seen deposit spikes associated with that. i don't necessarily think that we're going to see that this time. is it your view that that will actually change the post event payment behavior and credit characteristics?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
there is a lot of speculation out there. in some ways this is like a natural disaster. in other ways, there is a big debate in terms of the resurgence of economic activity that you get from rebuilding after a disaster. you won't quite have that here. and so, the economic -- people aren't going to go to twice as many restaurants. and so, is that economic activity just lost? i would say probably while you don't have the degree of insurance payments, you do have an unprecedented amount of governmental assistance. and my guess is, you'll continue to see additional programs. so that is probably a bit of an offset compared to what you would have seen coming out of insurance.
rick shane -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. hey, thank you for taking my questions and we wish everybody their health and safety. thank you.
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, rick.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
thanks, rick.
operator
our next question comes from the line of kevin barker of piper sandler.
kevin barker -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks. just in regards to the liability side of the balance sheet, i mean are you seeing changes in behavior on your deposit side? and what are your expectations going into the second and third quarter on just overall deposit growth given the differing -- the stimulus checks combined with stress across unemployment. i know it's difficult to really pinpoint it, but it seems like there could be a lot of overlays where you might actually see a little bit of pickup in deposits and then maybe a decline. can you just give us a little idea on your expectations there?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. so i think supply and demand are starting to come into balance. but it's going to take another quarter or so. the appetite for our deposit products has actually been very, very good. we've traditionally been second or third on the bank rate table. we have then recently been a little bit more aggressive on the downward side based on the overall demand for our product. so i think certain people are coming out of equities and looking for a safe place to put their cash. i think other folks have looked at our offerings and our service levels and decided that we're a good spot and they've chosen us. so as we look forward in future, i'll say future quarters, it'll be subject to a couple of things. so the supply and the demand factors -- what our competitors are doing. and then obviously our own performance, but we look to kind of move on the deposit pricing to actually pull back some of the nim that was impacted by the fed actions.
kevin barker -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and then in regards to some of the programs that you laid out with the $400 million of expense savings, should we assume that that's off of what your previous guidance was or is that completely separate from what you.
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you. yeah, that was off the previous guidance. and as we said when we issued that it was -- it'd be best based on a strict payback analysis. so are we going to get long-term returns for the incremental investment with the economic backdrop changing? we, of course, made the appropriate decisions.
kevin barker -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you for taking my question.

our next question comes from the line of john hecht of jefferies.
john hecht -- jefferies llc -- analyst
good morning, guys. and thanks very much for taking my question. your first question is where are we on utilization rates and average balances? and how does that compare to maybe a period entering the last recession?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
i'm sorry, can you repeat the first part of that question?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
utilization.

utilization rates, so as you look at overall utilization rates for the portfolio, i think we showed that the amount of contingent liability, i.e., the ratio, which is kind of the ops of utilization is significantly down from prior years. so one, as part of the credit tightening that we've done over the last several years a key component has been tightening contingent liability and tightening that exposure.
john hecht -- jefferies llc -- analyst
okay, thank you. and then, i'm trying to quantify the effects of the rate changes in march. how much of the impact to benchmark rate did you see in the quarter? i know it was later in the quarter and what do we think about nim trends over the next quarter or two?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
okay. so we didn't see any impact in the quarter from the fed reductions at the end of march. so there is about 150 basis points of reduction. so we're not giving guidance, but i'm going to give you a couple of points in terms of how to think about it. so the 150 basis points hit, there is an impact for three quarters of the year on that. our deposit betas have traditionally been about 50%. we took some proactive steps early in the year reducing overall deposit rates by 20 basis points to 50 basis points depending on the product. and then we're pulling back on the promo mix, which should also help rates. so you put those factors together and i think it draws a picture of how our nim could look for the year. now the quarterly trends are going to be a little bit different based on what's happening in the particular quarter on revolver and transactor mix.
john hecht -- jefferies llc -- analyst
perfect. thank you guys very much.

our next question comes from the line of moshe orenbuch of credit suisse.
moshe orenbuch -- credit suisse -- analyst
great, thanks. roger, maybe as you kind of sit and think and obviously you're going to be doing less marketing but you're going to be doing it kind of in a different mix of products. and as you think about discover's product set and service niche, kind of how do you think about what you are going to be doing and where there are opportunities to capitalize, and maybe if you could also just throw in thoughts on rewards competition in this environment as well? thanks.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yeah, thanks moshe for the question. one of the things we're trying to do is keep an eye on the opportunity in this environment. and so even as we've made cuts we continue to make investments as well that will strengthen discover, build the brand, and make sure we're in great shape for the future. so we're excited about the partnership with qiwi [phonetic] that just launched. products such as our miles card where you have the ability to redeem at amazon and paypal, that's a lot more useful than programs that were structured just around travel. our third quarter promotion is for restaurants, for the 5% program. we think that will resonate very, very well. and our rewards rate and product is really structured well for a wide variety of scenarios.
so for example, issuers that have big sign up bonuses, they're having to extend the period to earn those because of the reduced level of retail sales and complaints from their customers where ours is just a flat match for the first year of spending. so we're very excited about where our products are positioned. we've talked a lot about the traction we're getting in deposits. i also think a lot of our messages really will resonate in this environment. who wants to waste money on a credit card with an annual fee? and we're the only one with only no annual fee products. so we're really excited about some of the opportunities we're seeing in this environment.
moshe orenbuch -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. i would assume that you would expect better -- whether it's a response rate or conversion rates and things, you know like that in this -- while marketing is lower you might have some of that?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yeah, we're seeing -- and some of it plays out in the personal loan space for example, some of the traditional competitors and the fintechs who do not have robust funding models are cutting very, very aggressively. so even with reduced marketing, we're still hoping to generate good results.
moshe orenbuch -- credit suisse -- analyst
great, thanks very much.
operator
our next question comes from the line of betsy graseck of morgan stanley.
betsy graseck -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, good morning, and thanks for all the comments. a couple of questions. just one earlier, i think you mentioned something about how this recession is going to be very different from previous ones in part because of the quick job losses and then expected recoveries. do you know the job types by customer that you have?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
we get it at the time of underwriting so some of it can drift over time. it varies a bit by product. we have much better information for the personal loan customers is an example. we don't have our student loan customers given they haven't been employed. so it does vary, but i would say, we have very strong for personal loans and a good amount on the card portfolio.
betsy graseck -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. and then separately on the reserving as you know, folks like us who are looking at the reserve levels relative to the 2018 bank loan stress test just to get a sense as to how you're comping this upcoming recession versus that stress loss scenario that you ran a couple of years ago? and when we look at that the credit card reserve that you've taken is running, if my math is right, around 45%-ish of that stress loss period, but the other consumer is running much higher. and on the other consumer products i think it averages around high '80%s, low '90%s. so i was just wondering is there a reason why you feel this [indecipherable] is going to be tougher on that other consumer. and does it have to do with your answer you just gave or is there anything else there?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
i would say, it really has to do with more technical differences between the nature of those two different stresses. a lot of it has to do with when a recovery comes in. so just comparing scenarios based on peak loss can give you different numbers. so i wouldn't say it's anything different we're seeing by asset class. it's more technical based on those scenarios.
betsy graseck -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. and then just two other quick ones. when people sign up for skip-a-pay, and let's say they go for the one month, is it automatic that they can go for the two months or they have to call in every time or check it on the email?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yeah, betsy, they have to call in on the card side.
betsy graseck -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. all right and i guess with the call times being extremely low, that's not going to be a challenge for them. and then lastly, on the forbearance side with the call-ins that you've been receiving, from the slide deck, obviously, it shows that the beginning of april was the peak and i got a few questions overnight. why do you think that's the case that the requests for skip-a-pay have already started to decelerate at a time when unemployment claims are still rising here?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, that's a good question. some of it could be related to the government stimulus programs and then it could be just the cycle. we do expect the trend to decline and then a modest pick up as they approach into the second month for certain customers. but we'll have to see.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yeah, i mean, i guess i would probably point to, a, people may have a better feel of what stress is coming their way even before they're actually unemployed and so they may have called us, knowing that their boss say, hey, we got one week left and then we're closing down. so there isn't necessarily that line of sight. the second thing, my personal view is unemployment claims have actually been gated by capacity to process as opposed to each week 6 million people are losing their jobs. and so, that's why we would have seen the bubble earlier, because we didn't have that same capacity constraint that i believe you've seen around unemployment claims.
betsy graseck -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. that'd be great -- it'd be great to update that as you get in front of people to over the quarter. thanks.
operator
our next question comes from the line of meng jiao of deutsche bank.
meng jiao -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, good morning guys. one quick question, i guess on the skip-a-pay payment. can you guys give further demographics, i guess on what you're seeing in these customers? i mean, is it-is it safe to assume that the lower fico score customers are the ones currently enrolling in the skip-a-pay payments or is that too much of a generalization?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
you know, i would say, we talked about over for a card at least over 80% are current. they are relatively highly utilized in terms of the amount of balance. but there's actually a mix of some that are transactors as well historically in that. so that's probably the information we're willing to provide at this time.

and with that, i'd like to turn the call over to roger.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
thanks, eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. i too want to add a farewell to craig, and thank him for many years of service to discover, dating all the way back to great support in our original spin-off from morgan stanley.
our strong fourth quarter results were the capstone to good performance in a very challenging year, proving the value and resilience of our digital banking business model. while the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic were expansive, our business stood up to these challenges and we are in $799 million after-tax for the fourth quarter and over $1.1 billion for the full year.
our fourth quarter results underscore the capital generation of our model. while our revenues were down 4% year-over-year, our outstanding credit performance combined with the actions we took to reduce our funding costs and control our expenses, enabled us to exit the year with a 30% roe in the fourth quarter.
looking back on the full year, our operating results highlight the strength of our business and the execution of our team. we proactively adapted to the many ways in which the pandemic has altered our operating environment, including changes in consumer spending patterns, repayment trends and borrowing habits.
discover has always provided best-in-class customer service and this did not change with the pandemic. while other issuers faced significant challenges with long hold times, there was no disruption to our outstanding service as we leveraged our digital capabilities and our 100% u.s.-based customer service. we kept average hold times under five minutes through the trough of the downturn and they quickly returned to normal levels of under one minute.
additionally, our operational flexibility allowed us to keep our employees safe with nearly all employees continuing to work-from-home since mid-march.
similarly, our history of conservative credit management and the resilience of our prime customer base positioned us well as we entered this period of economic stress. we also took quick action at the onset of the pandemic to mitigate credit risk by tightening new account underwriting criteria, reducing promotional rate offers and pulling back on credit line increases, and we added $2.4 billion to reserves as the macroeconomic outlook deteriorated.
as expected, the tightening of our underwriting criteria combined with elevated payment rates impacted our loan growth and our total loans decreased 6% year-over-year. however, we took substantial market share in private student lending and gain share in card lending.
our digital bank operating model combined with disciplined expense management has historically generated industry-leading efficiency, but in 2020, we took additional action to control costs and delivered on our commitment to cut $400 million from planned expenses despite absorbing several one-time items that have occurred during the year. excluding the one-time items, expenses were down nearly 2% year-over-year.
we achieved this while still investing in analytics, automation and core technology capabilities to support long-term growth and efficiency improvement. for example, we've invested in new analytics to optimize acquisition marketing to our core customers and we enhanced customer engagement through more targeted offers and interactions.
our payments business was also well positioned heading into last year's sudden economic decline. our pulse debit business had a strong year with volume up 10% from 2019, reflecting the impact of stimulus funds and higher transaction sizes as debit became a critical way of procuring goods during the pandemic.
our discover proprietary network was down 2% for the year and exited the fourth quarter at plus 5%, in line with card sales volume. while diners club volume declined, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on global t&e spending, we signed five new international network partners as we continue to expand global acceptance.
as we look into 2021, we believe there is a significant amount of uncertainty around the timing and shape of the economic recovery and some of the impacts from last year's downturn have yet to be fully realized. for this reason, we anticipate deterioration in our credit performance in the back half of this year.
nonetheless, we see reasons for optimism. after bottoming in april, our card sales steadily rebounded throughout the year and returned to growth in the fourth quarter. we saw improvement across all categories, especially in grocery and retail, which now represent more than half of our sales mix. this favorable sales trend has also continued into the first half of january.
in this environment, we will remain disciplined on expense management but also committed to making investments for growth and efficiency and anticipate higher marketing expenses relative to 2020 levels.
we also anticipate resuming a more normal pattern of capital return. earlier this week, our board of directors approved a new $1.1 billion share repurchase plan and we may begin buybacks as soon as the first quarter, subject to the federal reserve's limitations.
in conclusion, 2020 presented us with unparalleled challenges but our business model has well positioned, and i couldn't be more pleased with how the team here at discover responded. i'm confident that the actions we took strengthened our business and will drive long-term value for our shareholders and customers.
while there is still uncertainty around the pace of the recovery, i'm optimistic that 2021 will be a better year.
i'll now ask john to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail.
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, roger, and good morning, everyone. i'll walk through our fourth quarter results, starting on slide 4. we earned $799 million in net income or $2.59 per share. these results included several one-time expenses, totaling $137 million. excluding these, eps would have been $2.94.
there were a number of factors, both positive and negative, that influenced our performance during the year. importantly, our results for 2020 reflect proactive management of our funding and operating cost and our conservative approach to credit management. these factors helped offset the revenue impacts of elevated payment trends and lower sales volumes.
however, we're seeing some positive signs with a return to sales growth in the quarter and continued expansion of our net interest margin. in the fourth quarter, net interest income was down 2%, reflecting a 5% decline in average receivables and lower loan yield. this was mostly offset by decreased funding costs driven by lower market rates and management of our deposit costs.
non-interest income was 14% lower, driven by higher rewards costs from strong engagement in the 5% category this quarter, a one-time write-off of certain real estate facilities and lower loan fee income also contributed to the year-over-year decrease.
the provision for credit losses was $305 million lower than the prior year due to meaningful improvement in credit performance. there was no change to reserve levels in the current quarter, whereas the prior year included an $85 million reserve build.
operating expenses increased 8% year-over-year driven by one-time items related to software write-offs, charges for penalties and restitution, and costs of a voluntary early retirement program. compensation expense also contributed to the increase. these were partially offset by lower marketing costs and decreased professional fees. excluding one-time items, expenses were down 4% from the prior year.
turning to loan growth on slide 5. total loans were down 6% from the prior year driven by a 7% decrease in card receivables. lower card receivables were the result of three factors. first, payment rates continue to be elevated. while this has reduced loan balances, it has had a favorable impact to credit performance. second, promotional balances have continued to decline due to actions we took early in pandemic to tighten credit. and third, an increase in transactor activity.
looking at our other lending products. in student loans, we had a strong peak origination season, increasing market share in leading to 7% loan growth. personal loans were down 7% as a result of actions we took early in the pandemic to minimize potential credit losses.
moving to slide 6. net interest margin continued to improve, up 34 basis points from the prior year and 44 basis points from the prior quarter to 10.63%. compared to the third quarter, lower deposit pricing was the primary driver of the improvement in net interest margin. we cut our online savings rate another 10 basis points from the third quarter as we continue to actively manage funding costs lower. online savings rates, 12 month and 24-month cds are all down to 50 basis points.
lower interest charge-offs and a favorable mix of promotional rate balances also contributed to the margin expansion from the prior quarter. these factors offset the impact of the high level of balance sheet liquidity that we are currently carrying.
while this is depressing, our net interest margin today, it should benefit margin as we deploy this liquidity into future loan growth.
average consumer deposits increased 18% from the prior year. we continue to see steady demand for our consumer deposit products, which were up $1 billion from the prior quarter.
all of the growth from the third quarter was from indeterminate maturity accounts, which allows us to immediately capture the benefit of deposit rate decreases.
turning to slide 7. we continue to optimize our mix -- our funding mix. and our goal remains to have 70% to 80% of our funding from deposits. we also have an opportunity to benefit from higher rate funding maturities over the next couple of years. both of these items are expected to benefit net interest margin in future quarters.
looking at slide 8. as roger noted, we delivered on our commitment to reduce planned expenses by at least $400 million during the year, and i'm pleased to say that we accomplished this goal despite several one-time expense items that occurred in 2020.
total operating expenses in the fourth quarter increased $94 million or 8% from the prior year, driven completely by $137 million in one-time expense items. excluding these, operating expenses would have been down $43 million or 4% year-over-year. yet, even as we remain disciplined on costs, we continue to invest in analytical capabilities that we expect will drive future growth and efficiency improvements.
looking at some of the individual line items. employee compensation was up $57 million or 13%, driven by a one-time item related to a voluntary early retirement program as well as staffing increases in technology and higher average salaries and benefits.
marketing and business development expense was down $75 million or 32%. most of the reduction was in brand marketing and card acquisition as we aligned marketing spend and tightened credit criteria in response to this changing economic environment.
professional fees decreased $22 million or 10%, mainly driven by lower third-party recovery fees related to courts operating at limited capacity.
on slide 9, you can see our credit metrics for the quarter. once again, credit performance was very strong and total charge-offs below 2.4% and credit card net charge-offs nearly 2.6%. the card net charge-off rate was 78 basis points lower than the prior year, while the net charge-off dollars were down $180 million or 28%.
compared to the third quarter, net card charge-off rate declined 82 basis points. the 30-plus delinquency rate was 55 basis points lower than last year and increased 16 basis points from the prior quarter.
credit also remained strong in our private student loan portfolio with net charge-offs down 31 basis points year-over-year. excluding purchased loans, the 30-plus delinquency rate improved 40 basis points from the prior year and 9 basis points compared to the prior quarter.
in our personal loan portfolio, net charge-offs were down 147 basis points and the 30-plus delinquency rate was down 29 basis points year-over-year.
to wrap up credit, this was another quarter of strong performance across all of our lending products driven by the actions we've taken in underwriting, line management and collections, the resiliency of our prime customer base and the impact of government stimulus.
we believe that losses will increase in the second half of 2021 and into 2022. however, the timing and magnitude of losses could be impacted by any additional government assistance or material shifts in the economic environment.
moving to the allowance for credit losses on slide 10. we held allowance flat to the prior quarter. while the macro environment has improved, the outlook remains uncertain.
similar to our past approach, we modeled several different economic scenarios. the primary assumptions in our economic model were a year-end 2021 unemployment rate of about 8% and gdp growth of about 2.7%. we did not include any additional stimulus beyond what has already been provided to consumers.
our economic scenarios also consider the increasing number of covid cases, the timing of the vaccine rollout and the recent increase and unemployment claims.
turning to slide 11. our common equity tier-1 ratio increased 90 basis points sequentially to 13.1%, remaining above our 10.5% internal target and well above regulatory minimums. we have continued to fund our quarterly dividend at $0.44 per share.
regarding share repurchases, as roger indicated, earlier this week, we received authorization from our board of directors to repurchase up to $1.1 billion of common stock. and we intend to begin share buybacks in the first quarter, subject to the federal reserve regulatory limitations.
moving to slide 12 and some perspectives on how to think about 2021. we anticipate modest positive loan growth for the year. we see opportunities for customer acquisition, but the level of growth will be dependent on payment rate trend and the timing and pace of the broad economic recovery.
with respect to our net interest margin, as i previously mentioned, we expect we will continue to see benefits to margin from lower deposit rates and maturity of higher rate funding. we also remain committed to disciplined expense management and we'll continue to invest to drive profitable long-term growth and efficiency improvement. this includes increased marketing investments for new customer acquisition as well as investments in advanced analytics and technology capability.
in terms of credit performance, as i've already noted, we expect losses to increase in the second half of 2021 and remain elevated into 2022.
finally, our capital allocation strategy has not changed, and we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.
in summary, we had a solid fourth quarter with strong credit performance across the portfolio, net interest margin expansion driven by lower funding costs, flat reserves; and excluding one-time items, operating expenses were down year-over-year.
i'm very pleased with our execution throughout 2020 and discover's efforts to protect employees and provide uninterrupted best-in-class service to our customers.
the quick actions we took at the onset of the pandemic and our investment in core capabilities protected and strengthened the discover franchise in 2020.
the challenges we faced, demonstrate the resiliency of discover's digital banking business model; and while uncertainty remains, we are well positioned for growth as our economy continues to recover.
with that, i'll turn the call back to our operator, maria, to open the line for q&a.

thank you. [operator instructions] we'll take our first question from moshe orenbuch from credit suisse.
moshe orenbuch -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks, and welcome, eric. and if craig is listening, it's been a pleasure working with you too. i guess both, roger and john, you talked about the idea of increasing marketing expenses into 2021. could you just kind of flesh that out a little bit, talk some about how much you'd like to grow accounts? what you're looking for? what signals would drive you to step on the gas a little harder or pull your foot off? because you've seen some of your competitors already start to spend the marketing. we don't know yet what that's generated. but maybe just talk about that a little bit.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yes. thanks, moshe. so, you saw how we're thinking about the expense base for 2021. and then, i'll talk more specifically around marketing and new customer acquisition and growth.
so, in terms of expenses, the business is committed to driving positive operating leverage over the mid-term. now, opportunities in 2021 will dictate how much marketing dollars we ultimately end up spending for new customer acquisition. but in terms of the overall expense base, there will be incremental dollars for marketing, new customer acquisition and third-party recovery fees. as the courts reopen, we expect that those fees will increase consistent with the level of recoveries that we hope to achieve on bankrupt accounts.
so, outside of those areas, we're targeting to keep expenses flat across the business. now, certain accounts may go higher, certain may go lower, but the way you can think about it is growth initiatives, incremental spend, the balance of the income statement in terms of expenses will be flat to down.
in terms of new account growth, what we're targeting is mid-single digits. maybe if we're fortunate, we see some opportunities, upper single-digit account growth. and we hope that will translate into increased loan balances. we didn't give any specific guidance on loan balances because of the broad economy uncertainty there; and frankly, repayment trends have been pretty remarkable; and with it, potential new round of stimulus, that could further increase the prepayment trends.
so, that's how we're thinking about growth and expenses. so, if there's a follow-up, we could take a quick follow-up. if not, we'll head on to the next question.
moshe orenbuch -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks very much.
operator
our next question comes from the line of sanjay sakhrani of kbw.
sanjay sakhrani -- kbw -- analyst
thanks. good morning. and my congratulations to eric and craig as well. wanted to drill down on the credit quality and reserve assumptions. i understand sort of the reversion to the mean assumption given the underlying unemployment rate. however, i think moody's has been improving their laws, their unemployment assumptions and that rate is declining sort of in the second half of this year and into 2022.
i'm just curious sort of how to put your assumption that the loss rates will get to the reserve levels -- those embedded in the reserve assumptions? and at what point do you reassess that? is there something sitting inside your portfolio that's leading you to be more conservative? thanks.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
okay. thanks, sanjay. so, i'll take this one as well. so, first, let me start off by saying we're very pleased with the portfolio's performance. so, the resiliency of our customer base has been remarkably strong. so, in terms of the modeled assumptions -- so in my script, i talked about 8% unemployment at the end of 2021. i realize that's higher than where we are today from reported number. and we also assumed gdp growth of 2.7%. now, there are some folks forecasting an increase in gdp as well.
so, as we thought about the reserves and the positioning of the balance sheet, there's a couple of things that we took into account. so first is the overall unemployment numbers. there's about 10.7 million people out of work. there's another 7.3 million people that aren't included in the unemployment number due to the fact that they haven't actively worked -- looked for work in the past four weeks.
so, to me, where we are from a life of loan loss reserving standpoint made perfect sense is conservative. we didn't feel like we had enough data points at this point, given the level of uncertainty, to make a material change to the absolute level of reserves in the fourth quarter, given a life of loan reserving assumption. but i can say this, we're going to continue to look at our portfolio and the macro environment.
we're going to look specifically at the trajectory of unemployment and the type of unemployment. so, we're seeing unemployment levels transition from service workers to white collar workers, who would more likely be representative of our customer base and the impact of stimulus.
so today, we're well positioned, and we're going to continue to reassess it, first quarter, second quarter and into the second half of next year and make appropriate adjustments.
sanjay sakhrani -- kbw -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of rick shane of jpmorgan.
rick shane -- jpmorgan -- analyst
good morning, and congratulations, eric. and craig, when i saw the -- i'm hoping you're listening. when i saw the voluntary early retirement, i hope you're a reasonable chunk of that number.
sorry. when we think about what you've said in terms of marketing and adding new accounts, that makes sense. there will presumably be a lag in loan growth as you add accounts. historically, when you started to grow the portfolio, again, it's been led by wallet share gains and line limit increases.
i'm curious when you think you might take that sort of brown out alignment in increases off? and how we should think also about rewards rate as you think about wallet share going forward?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yes. so, i'll start it on the rewards rate. we tend to keep our rewards program very stable. it provides a lot of value. and so, while you've seen competitors make dramatic changes, we feel like our leadership position in cash rewards serves as well.
so, we have in the past talked about a low single-digit increase in rewards rate due to structural changes. that will likely continue. but beyond that, we feel very good about where we're positioned and the competitiveness of our program.
in terms of growth, it's always been a mix of new accounts and stimulating the existing portfolio. and so, it will remain that going forward. in terms of what would get us to loosen credit, i think many of the indicators that john talked about, right? so, getting better line of sight in the direction of white collar employment is probably the most critical one.
rick shane -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. okay. thank you, guys.

our next question comes from the line of mark devries of barclays.

yes. thank you. i've got a follow-up to sanjay's question. clearly, the credit performance you've experienced so far is much better than you would have expected, just given all of the different macro assumptions. and so, my question is, what do you think you need to see in the data before you feel comfortable releasing reserves?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
okay. thanks mark. so first will be the performance of the portfolio. so, what's happening on specific roll rates, are they holding or are they deteriorating, consistent with what our modeled expectations are? broad macro is going to be important. we also do know that if there's another round of stimulus, that will -- which isn't baked into our reserve assumptions-- we do know that that will have an impact on a couple of factors -- certainly, delinquency, repayment rate and ultimately charge-offs and required provisions. so, we'll keep an eye on that.
roger and i both talked about white collar employment levels and [speech overlap] will also be new jobless claims. so, putting those factors together with a strong overview on how the portfolio itself is performing, will be the key factors in determining what we do with reserves in 2021.
mark devries -- barclays -- analyst
got it. thank you.

our next question comes from the line of betsy graseck of morgan stanley.
betsy graseck -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, good morning.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
good morning.
betsy graseck -- morgan stanley -- analyst
i had a couple of questions on the buybacks that you announced. i just wanted to understand if the buyback announced -- like, what kind of cet1 you're thinking about when you are putting forth that buyback estimate?
and then the second question that's related to that has to do with whether or not you've embedded reserve releases in your estimates for that? i mean, because of the four-quarter trailing, federal right now is -- kind of circular reference there. so, wanted to understand how you're thinking about reserve releases and what your target cet1 is?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
okay. thanks. so, we continue to target 10.5%. in terms of how we thought about buybacks this year, the first piece i would say is, we wanted to ensure we're prudent with our capital, given the level of uncertainty. we do have the fed constraints in terms of the four-quarter average of net income. and so, the first quarter and -- well, the second quarter and first quarter of 2020 are impacting that calculation for the first quarter of '21. and then, we're also thinking about the cecl transition impact, which will be somewhere between 200 and 250 basis points as we think about cet1.
so ultimately, we didn't want to be out at the far edge of the buyback envelope. we felt that $1.1 billion was an appropriate return of capital given a level of uncertainty. and that will take a dent out of, what i'll say is, the excess capital that we have right now. but our earnings power will be really important and that will give us an opportunity to reassess that in 2022 as well.
betsy graseck -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. thanks. and then just separately, a follow-up question here on how you're thinking about the interchange rate? i mean, there's been a couple of -- there's been some pressure on it recently after years of improving. i just wanted to understand, is the recent behavior more of a short-term phenomenon, less t&e? or is there something else going on that we should be thinking about remodeling out that one?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. yes. so, the fourth quarter did come down a little bit. and we can largely point to mix as there was a strong pull away from the traditional online -- or excuse me, the brick-and-mortar retailers to the online retailers, which certainly impacted it. but from our perspective, very well aligned with our 5% categories in the fourth quarter, which also drove incremental sales through our card. and ultimately, we think it will translate into other forms of revenue, specifically interest income as balances revolve.
betsy graseck -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. so, this quarter was primarily the 5% cash back on the dot-coms that got obviously utilized very, very fully?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes.
betsy graseck -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. thanks.
operator
our next question comes from line of bill carcache of wolfe research.
bill carcache -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks. good morning. i'd like to echo my congratulations to eric and craig. i wanted to ask about the net interest margin. and i believe that 10.63% is the highest we've ever seen. can you talk about whether the trough is behind us? how sustainable this level is and the extent to which you see room -- margins to actually expand from here, given the room for deposit repricing and remixing toward lower cost deposits that you see from here?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. sure. sure, bill. so, from the trough, our second half nim improved by nearly 80 basis points, incredible. so, obviously, we can't run that trajectory in perpetuity. so, a way to think about that is we ended the fourth quarter at the 10.63% that you just mentioned.
my view is that we still have some opportunity on deposit pricing, especially, if there's another round of stimulus because that will put a lot of liquidity in the market and the competition for deposits will further abate.
now, how much, ultimately, room we have there, uncertain. is it 10, 20 or more bps, to be determined. but my view, at least 10 bps, very conservative view.
the maturity profile, we included that information in the deck to allow folks to be able to model through some improvements that we'll see there. and then -- so frankly, some things that are pushing against net interest margin, especially in the second half of the year. if the credit losses do accelerate as we've indicated, that will put some dampening pressure on net interest margin.
so, broadly speaking, we do see further room for expansion there. but i would jump from the fourth quarter number and do those steps i just mentioned to get to a reasonable way of thinking about the balance of the year.
bill carcache -- wolfe research -- analyst
got it. thanks, john. very helpful.
operator
our next question comes from the line of don fandetti of wells fargo.
don fandetti -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi, good morning. rogers, if you could comment on what you think about the sort of long-term growth rate of the card business? if it's been impacted by -- you have a lot of new areas like personal loans, you have buy-now pay-later. is this just on the edges or do you think that this has some impact on the growth of the card industry? and could you be wrong on that, i guess? and could some of these new initiatives and fintechs be more impactful?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
i certainly could be wrong. so, i'll say that upfront. but we have not seen either of those have an impact on card loan growth. and you've seen that in the past, whether it's been a home equity loan boom, where a lot of people are doing cash out refis and using that to pay down debt.
a lot of consumers seem to carry a level of credit card debt that they are comfortable with, certainly our base, and they tend to revert back to that amount. and so buy-now pay-later is the most recent trend that's out there. we're looking at that very carefully and have yet to be able to see an impact on our revolving loan balances.
so, in my decades in this business, there's always something that's going to kill off credit cards. but so far, the growth trajectory of the industry remains solid.
now. it is a mature business. but we also -- as we think about our growth, it's a combination of where the industry goes, but also our ability to take share from our competitors and capture a disproportionate of student, young adults who are coming into the industry. and so, we feel good about that.
don fandetti -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of kevin barker of piper sandler.
kevin barker -- piper sandler -- analyst
good morning. just wanted to follow-up on your -- your guidance for losses to increase in the second half of 2021 and then likely remain elevated into 2022? i mean, are you envisioning, just given the current economic environment, that these are likely that we're going to have a plateau in 2022? or is it going to be like a slow decline after we peak in the second half of 2021, just given what your view is on the economy and how things are playing out so far?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. okay. so, at this point, there's a bit of both art and science in terms of modeling kind of peak charge-offs. and what we've seen as we've gone through this pandemic is the peak has continued to push into future periods. and essentially, that's what we're seeing today.
it's hard to believe, given the level of absolute unemployment and those folks that are outside of the employment ranks that aren't in the unemployment number, that there isn't going to be some material impact to credit and charge-offs at some point.
the roll rates we're seeing right now in terms of -- from aging buckets, one to the next, are incredibly strong, which is positive. so that means, by itself, there can't be an acceleration of charge-offs in -- at least in the first four months of the year. beyond that, you would expect, given the unemployment numbers that the roll rates will deteriorate, charge-offs will increase and continue to increase until there's absolute stability.
so, we're seeing a peak in late 2021 and that could carry through into 2022 and then moderate as the towns go back and the economic -- the broad macros improve.
so, that's how we're thinking about it. i'm not sure if we've got it 100% right. if we don't, we're going to adjust accordingly.
kevin barker -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and then the follow-up on your comments about targeting to keep expenses flat across the business, is that relative to account growth? or is that saying, we're -- year-over-year absolute expenses will remain flat in 2021?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. so, i want to be careful here. it wasn't absolute expenses. so, what i tried to do is distinguish between those expenses that will help us accelerate growth. and we expect those to increase. those that aren't targeted to accelerate growth, we expect will remain flat to down. we expect -- if you go through kind of line items of the expense base, salaries and wages, we've done some things this year to level that off, including the voluntary early retirement program.
we have activated our procurement organization around third-party spend, and we've driven a lot of productivity through that. we have looked at every single line item on the expense base and we're making determinations on whether or not those expenses will help us drive long-term growth. if the answer is yes, maybe will increase. if the answer is no, they're going to be flat to down.
kevin barker -- piper sandler -- analyst
so just to be clear, those expenses that are driving growth, should they be in line with account growth or be above or below, just dependent upon what you're seeing underlying the business?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
so maybe one way of looking at that, for card, new accounts as an example, we expect our cost per account to be below what we saw in 2019. and that's with a tighter credit box and reflects the benefits we're seeing from some of our investments in advanced analytics as well as just the differentiation and appeal of our product.
kevin barker -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from the line of bob napoli of william blair.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
thank you. good morning. i think i've said goodbye to craig, like at least eight times over the last few decades. i don't think it's going to be the last one for some reason, but good luck.
roger, just -- and so the world has come discover's direction, if you would, i think the digital banking, branches banking structure that you have and then you have the unique asset of the network, obviously. but what are you working on? there's a lot of changes. while the markets come your direction, there's a lot of new businesses, direct banks, digital banks and development of companies like venmo or private companies, chime. are there things that you're doing as you look at this to be on offense to expand the ecosystem of your products and services to try to get direct deposits to get more of, let's say, transaction banking accounts as well? what are you doing on the banking side? with all of the innovation in the market, where is discover investing?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yes. so, great question. if the world is coming your way, you've got to keep moving to stay ahead. and so, that is our focus. we've always stood for innovation back to our founding and inventing credit card rewards, but more recently with everything from the fico score on statements, ability to freeze your account. and so, you can rest assure that that focus is still there on a pipeline of customer-driven innovation across all of our products.
specifically, in the deposit side, we think there's a lot of opportunity to get into transaction accounts. it will be a while before they become a material part of our funding base. but with our low-cost direct-to-consumer digital model as well as the advantage we have from being exempt from the durbin interchange caps because we own our proprietary network, we're uniquely positioned for a bank over $10 billion.
and so, it isn't maybe the primary focus right now, just given the excess level of fundings, but it is a critical initiative. and we feel good about our ability to compete both against traditional branch-based banks, but also against any of the new fintech players.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
okay. thank you. i'd love some color on what else you look -- you're thinking about there. but as you look at the -- your customers -- the customers that you're adding, is there any change in the demographic mix of the new customers you're adding? there's a lot of times we are getting commentary or questions around, well, the millennials are not going to borrow on their credit cards the way others did. and there are other new forms of credit. is discover getting the same share of those younger customers? and are you keeping them? do you feel there's anything to the thought that the millennials will be less likely to use credit cards? and, i mean, if so, are you looking at other products like buy-now pay-later?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
so, in terms of millennials, based on the data we see, we're either the leading or one of the leading underwriters for college students. and the brand is incredibly strong. we have college students and young adults that appreciate sort of the leading digital functionality, as well as some of the innovations i talked about. and we're seeing very similar usage patterns as we saw in prior generations of customers.
so, we're very excited about the growth there. and i think being in the student loan business and the second largest originator, helped to get our brand out there in front of the next-generation of consumers.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
okay. thank you. appreciate it.
operator
our next question comes from the line of john hecht of jefferies.
john hecht -- jefferies -- analyst
morning. congratulations to eric and craig, as everybody else has said. and thank you guys for taking the questions.
maybe follow-on to bob's question, but in a different way. i mean, you guys have tightened -- over the past several quarters, you've had substantial net paydowns. i'm wondering, has your kind of back book composition changed in a good or bad way, or a positive or, i guess, negative way based on those patterns?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
i would say nothing dramatic. and part of the advantage we had, we have been tightening for a number of years coming into this. we felt like we were late cycle and talked about that with you guys on the call. clearly, we didn't expect it to end the way it did in early 2020. but that helped us from having to take some of the magnitude of changes, but i think some of our competitors did.
so, we try and be consistent in how we run the business. and so, we've targeted the same prime consumer. and i think the drove [phonetic] have not seen any dramatic shifts in terms of our composition, either with the new accounts we're booking or our existing portfolio.
john hecht -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. great. thanks. and the second question is private student lending. i think you guys referred to some market share gains in the recent periods. i know there's been some shifts in terms of other big banks that are exiting that segment. and then there's a new administration and then maybe some changing policy or some thoughts about potential changing policy. maybe just some commentary given your momentum there and your outlook there given those factors?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yes. so, i would say there's always a lot of discussion about what might happen in washington about student loans. i would say, keep in mind, that over 90% of student loans are the federal student loan program. and so, that's where a lot of the attention is focused, very different animal in terms of the, quite frankly, lack of underwriting of that product and the losses they experienced compared to how we go to market.
so, we feel really good about the business, clearly benefited from one of the larger players stepping back. but we believe we would have gained share even if they hadn't. and so, it reflects the fact that the brand is well-positioned. it resonates with consumers and we take the same approach in terms of customer experience and differentiation with the student loan product as we do on the card side.
john hecht -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you guys very much.
operator
our next question comes from the line of mihir bhatia of bank of america.
mihir bhatia -- bank of america -- analyst
hi. maybe just staying with some of your non-card products. i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about just the outlook in competitive intensity you are seeing for some of the -- whether it's student loans, personal loans, even just on the network side of your business? i know there has been a focus to grow some of that too. so maybe just talk a little bit about what you're expecting from those businesses as we head into 2021? thank you.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
sure. so, i'll start on the payment side. always, very intense competition. in the payment side, we compete largely against two very large players. so, especially in debit, it's really head-to-head competition for merchant routing day in, day out. we don't expect that to change. but i feel good about the products we have, and we have a great team on it.
in terms of other products, we talked about student loans. for personal loans, we have modestly widened credit on that. that was the product we tightened the most, just given the volatile in the downturn. we've loosened up, i would say, marginally, and feel good about what we're originating, positioned a little differently than most. we've always had a relatively narrow credit box for that, and those loans are, sort of, bigger ticket debt consolidation primarily. but i would say across all of our products, given the returns we get, these are all highly competitive, very challenging markets, and that sort of occurs day in, day out.
mihir bhatia -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you. and then just if i could quickly follow-up on some of your nim comments. i know you mentioned the funding side of the balance sheet, optimizing that. is there also an opportunity a little bit to optimize on the asset side of the balance sheet? maybe you were running with a little bit of excess cash in 2020 given the downturn, or is that fairly well-optimized already? thank you.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yes, thanks. i'll jump in on that one. yes, we do have some excess liquidity right now, and there is an opportunity to continue to move that forward. now we're going to, i'll say, gauge that based on the level of asset growth because asset growth will consume that liquidity. and we've built a plan that assumes a level of growth. so. that's one point.
the other piece is around deposit pricing and how we price the deposits coming in, turning into cash. and then in terms of balance sheet positioning, we are mildly asset-sensitive right now. so, in a rising rate environment, that will also be beneficial to net interest margin.
so quite honestly, the liquidity, i think, will take care of itself over time. and the positioning of the balance sheet in terms of asset sensitivity, very, very positive to be accretive to net interest margin in a rising rate environment.
mihir bhatia -- bank of america -- analyst
understood. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of meng jiao of deutsche bank.
meng jiao -- deutsche bank -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question. i just wanted to get a sense on how you guys are thinking about deposit growth specifically, both direct-to-consumer and the broker deposits? i guess for dtc, it's now, i guess, 62% of total funding. i believe, previously you mentioned a longer-term target of 70% of the funding stack. is that hard to still hold? or do you expect dtc deposits to be even higher as a percentage of the funding stack going forward?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. so, we're targeting 70%, 80%. so, 62%, you're correct on the number. so direct-to-consumer, our proposition has been very, very positive. we don't compete on the basis of price, which has been a good thing in terms of helping us to modulate some of the liquidity that we have. but also, the fact that deposits continue to grow shows that there is a level of loyalty and trust with the discover brand.
in terms of the broker cds, we actually use that almost as a valve of sorts, right? so as our funding needs increase, we'll go more heavily into brokered cds. as they decrease, we shrink it. so that's the way we've managed it traditionally. it's going to continue to be a liquidity channel for us, but a, what i'd say, less important channel over time in terms of total quantum of deposits.
meng jiao -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. and then a second question. just broad based, is there, i guess, anything structurally different in regards to releasing reserves under cecl than the prior method of looking at allowance reserves?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
not so much structurally. i mean, we've got a thorough process that considers all the elements of cecl under gaap. the one thing i would say is the life of loan reserving does require more modeling and, frankly, a greater level of judgment given how far out into the horizon you're projecting losses.
so, there's certainly a very strong governance element. there's a science to it, and then there is a level of professional judgment or art to it as well. so -- yes, same could be said for incurred, but the horizon is much more difficult given timing of what we're trying to project.
meng jiao -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions.
operator
and ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. our final question will come from the line of dominick gabriele of oppenheimer.
dominick gabriele -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thanks so much for taking my questions. can we just think about a potential windfall of excess capital from reserve releases? excuse me. if that was to happen and the economic situation persisted the way it is today and you felt comfortable releasing the reserves, can you talk about the breakdown of how you would use that excess capital? i mean, when tax reform came, then there was a flood of capital. companies started talking about we'll do half, about a third for growth, a third for capital return, a third for investment in technology, something like that. can you talk about how you think about those pieces, should a flood of capital come your way? thanks.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yes. i'll let john talk about capital return, but i would say, our business does not let itself to rapid deployment of capital, right? we market on a consistent basis, sort of flooding the market in a given quarter based on the amount of capital we have, i don't think makes sense from a long-term standpoint. the same holds true for technology, right? a lot of it is about spending smart, not just putting huge amounts of money.
so, i have a real hard -- if we do have a quarter with a big reserve release, there may be some things. if the margin in terms of investments in the business, that by and large it will fall to the bottom line. and i'll let john pick it up there.
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. and so, dominick, i do appreciate your optimism regarding a flood of capital as a result of reserve releases and a powerful economy. our priorities actually remain the same, so in terms of how we think about capital and allocating the dollars first to growth then to dividend and share repurchases, and then the last priority would be small m&a, i think, bolt-on capabilities or certain niche products that we think will drive long-term shareholder value. so, no change there.
we go through an annual capital planning process here as most financial services institutions do. and we share the outlook with our board and our priorities. and obviously, there's some regulatory constraints that we manage too as well. and then we'll make good long-term decisions to generate profitable growth and shareholder return.
dominick gabriele -- oppenheimer -- analyst
great. thank you. that makes a lot of sense. and then if we just think about the -- if you look at the nim in particular and the -- this quarter, and the interest charge-off reduction in the quarter, that had a big impact on the yield. and so, could you just talk about the balance between, let's say, that interest and fee charge-off even just reverting to normalized levels, not including the spike of losses, let's say? but has that sort of just normalized over 2021 versus some of the benefits you have on the interest expense savings that you're doing, given all the -- what you're doing there? maybe if you balance those two against each other, could you still see kind of nim expansion or levels in 2021 versus stable to improving versus 2020? thanks.
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. we -- dominick, we do see opportunities for nim expansion even in the face of increased interest charge-offs as the portfolio matures and contends with some of the economic stress. but the numbers in terms of quantum, i'm probably not going to get into that level of detail on the call here. but i will go back to what i said earlier in one of my questions in terms of how to think about it. so, we do see an opportunity for nim expansion. and that -- some of that will be tapered by credit and the impact of delinquencies. but even contemplating that, there will be a level of expansion.
dominick gabriele -- oppenheimer -- analyst
excellent. thanks so much.
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
sure. very good.
eric wasserstrom -- head of investor relations

operator
good morning. my name is maria, and i'll be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the first quarter 2021 discover financial services earnings conference call. [operator instructions] thank you.
i will now turn the call over to mr. eric wasserstrom, head of investor relations. please go ahead.
eric wasserstrom -- head of investor relations
thank you, maria, and good morning, everyone. welcome to this morning's call. i'll begin on slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the financials section of our investor relations website, investorrelations.discover.com.
our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in today's earnings press release and presentation.
our call will include remarks from our ceo, roger hochschild; and john greene, our chief financial officer. after we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. during the q&a session, please limit yourself to one question, and if you have a follow-up question, please get back into queue, so we can accommodate as many participants as possible.
now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to roger.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
thanks, eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. last april, if you told me that a year into the pandemic we'd be reporting excellent credit performance, positive sales trends, and solid earnings growth, i wouldn't have believed it. while the pandemic is far from over and there may be twists and turns ahead, as a nation, we have made tremendous progress toward addressing the health crisis and reopening the economy. this quarter, we earned $1.6 billion after-tax or $5.04 per share. i'm very pleased with these results, which reflect our robust business model, strong execution, including a disciplined approach to managing credit, improving economic trends and the impact of federal support for us consumers.
since the end of 2020, our view on economic conditions has improved. the rapid pace of the recovery has lessened our concern of job losses spreading to the white collar workforce and there is also been substantial support for the us consumer through stimulus in january and in march. our current expectation is that credit losses in 2021 will be flat to down year-over-year. this improved economic view, combined with lower loan balances and continued strong credit performance, were the primary drivers of $879 million reserve release in the quarter.
as discussed in previous quarters, the strong credit performance was accompanied by elevated payment rates that continue to put pressure on loan balances, which were down 7% year-over-year. payment rates were over 350 basis points higher than last year and at their highest level since the year 2000. while the impact from stimulus payments should abate over the next few months, we expect payment rates will remain elevated for the rest of the year as household use savings to meet debt obligations and continue to benefit from payment relief programs, such as federal student loan and mortgage payment forbearance.
despite this pressure, we still expect modest loan growth this year supported by several factors. first, there has been a significant increase in sales volume, up 11% from a year ago and up 15% from the first quarter of 2019. improving trends in categories like retail and restaurants are positive signs for future growth. additionally, based on our credit performance in our current outlook for macro conditions, we have begun to migrate our credit standards back to pre-pandemic levels. this is particularly true in card, where our value proposition centered on best-in-class customer service, valuable rewards and no fees continues to resonate strongly among consumers. we're also expanding credit standards and personal loans, but not quite back to 2019 norms.
to offset the higher payment rate, as well as leverage these credit actions, we intend to increase our marketing spending through the rest of this year. outside of marketing, we expect that expenses will be relatively flat year-over-year as we remain committed to expense management. we're reinvesting some of the benefits from our strong credit performance and efficiency gains into technology and analytics to further improve our account acquisition targeting, fraud detection and collections capabilities. the rapid pace of the economic recovery and strong credit performance may provide additional opportunities to lean further into growth. we intend to take advantage of these opportunities and may make additional marketing and non-marketing investments that will create long-term value.
on the payment side, we had continued strong performance in our pulse business, with volumes up 23%, driven by stimulus payments in the first quarter and higher average spend per transaction. we also continue to expand our global acceptance through network partnerships, and this quarter, we signed new partners in jordan and malaysia.
our digital banking model generates high returns and we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. this quarter, we restarted our share repurchase program with $119 million in buybacks, in line with the regulatory restrictions still in place. looking at our strong credit performance and robust earnings, we see an opportunity to revisit our capital return to shareholders in the second half of the year.
as i look toward the future, i'm excited about discover's prospects. our products continue to bring value to our customers. we remain flexible as we support our employees and their families through the pandemic. and we are well positioned to continue driving long-term value for our shareholders.
before i turn it over to john, one last thing, you may not know it, but our clo, wanji walcott, sits in on these calls and is a great part of the team. today is her birthday. so i want to wish wanji a very happy birthday.
with that, i'll now ask john to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail.
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, roger. happy birthday, wanji, and good morning, everyone. i'll begin by addressing our summary financial results on slide 4. as roger indicated, the results this period reflects many of the same dynamics we've seen over the past few quarters. the influence of stimulus resulted in elevated payment rates, which pressured loan growth. it also contributed to the strong asset quality and our significant reserve release in the quarter.
revenue, net of interest expense, decreased 3% from the prior year, mainly from lower net interest income. this was driven by a 7% decline in average receivables and lower market rates, partially offset by a reduction in funding costs as we continued to manage deposit pricing and optimize our funding mix.
non-interest income was 5% lower, primarily due to a $35 million net gain from the sale of an equity investment in the prior year. consistent with our excellent credit quality, lower loan fee income reflects a decline in late fees, while net discount and interchange revenue was up 12% from the prior year, reflecting the increased sales volume.
the provision for credit losses was $2 billion lower than the prior year, mainly due to an $879 million reserve release in the current quarter, compared to a $1.1 billion reserve build in the prior year. our improved economic outlook, lower loan balances and strong credit drove the release. additionally, net charge-offs decreased 30% or $232 million in the prior year.
operating expenses decreased 7% year-over-year as we remain disciplined on expense management. other than compensation, all other expenses were down from the prior year, led by marketing, which decreased 33% year-over-year. looking ahead, we intend to accelerate marketing investments over the remainder of the year. we'll go into details on our spending outlook in a few moments.
moving to loan growth on slide 5. total loans were down 7% from the prior year, driven by a 9% decrease in card receivables. the reduction in card receivables was driven by two primary factors. first, the payment rate remains elevated, driven by the latest round of stimulus and improved household cash flows. second, promotional balances have continued to decline, reflecting the actions we took at the onset of the pandemic to tighten credit. as a result, these balances were approximately 300 basis points lower than the prior year. although we expect new account growth will cause promotional balances to begin to stabilize. as the economy reopens further, we believe consumer spending and prudent expansion of our credit box should drive profitable loan growth going forward.
looking at our other lending products. organic student loans increased 5% from the prior year and originations returned to pre-pandemic levels. we continue to gain market share through mini peak season. personal loans were down 9%, primarily due to the actions we took early in the pandemic to minimize credit loss. as we previously mentioned, we see opportunity to expand credit a bit given the strong performance of this portfolio.
moving to slide 6. the net interest margin was 10.75%, up 54 basis points from the prior year and 12 basis points sequentially. compared to the prior quarter, the improvement in net interest margin was driven by lower deposit pricing as we cut our online savings rates from 50 basis points to 40 basis points during the quarter. we also continue to benefit from the maturity of higher rate cds and a favorable shift in funding mix. our funding from consumer deposits is now at 65%.
future deposit pricing actions will be dependent upon our funding needs and competitor pricing. average consumer deposits were up 14% year-over-year and flat to the prior quarter. consumer cds were down 7% from the prior quarter, while savings and money market increased 4%. loan yield was flat to the prior year. seasonal revolve rate favorability and a lower mix of promotional rate balances were offset by the impact of reduced pricing on personal loans.
looking at slide 7. total non-interest income was $465 million, down $25 million, or 5% year-over-year, driven by the one-time gain in the prior year that i previously mentioned. excluding this, non-interest income was up 2%. net discount and interchange revenue increased 12% as revenue from higher sales volume was partially offset by higher rewards cost. the decrease in loan fee income was driven by lower late fees, which move in line with delinquency trends.
looking at slide 8. total operating expenses are down $78 million, or 7% from the prior year. marketing and business development decreased $77 million, or 33% year-over-year. the reduction reflects actions we implemented in march of last year to align marketing spend with tightened credit criteria. however, we accelerated our marketing spend late in the first quarter and plan to continue this through the year. these investments will drive new account acquisition and loan growth.
the year-over-year decrease in other expenses was mainly driven by lower fraud volume to an -- due to enhanced analytics around disputed transactions and decreased fraud in deposits. this improvement demonstrates a small part of the benefit we expect from the investments we've made in the analytics over the past few years.
partially offsetting the favorability was a $39 million increase in employment compensation, that was driven by two factors: $22 million from a higher bonus accrual in the current year. the remaining increase was driven by higher average salaries, reflecting the talent build in our technology and analytics team.
moving to slide 9. we had another strong quarter of very strong credit performance. the total charge-offs were 2.5%, down 79 basis points year-over-year and up 10 basis points sequentially. the card net charge-off rate was 2.8%, 85 basis points lower than the prior year with the net charge-offs dollars down $209 million, or 31%. sequentially, the card net charge-off rate increased 17 basis points and net charge-off dollars were up $11 million. the increase in card net charge-offs from the prior quarter was driven by accounts that had been in skip-a-pay and did not cure. the program ended six months ago, and at this time, most of the accounts that were in skip-a-pay have returned to making payments. looking forward, we expect minimal impacts to charge-offs from this population.
the card 30-plus delinquency rate was 1.85%, down 77 basis points from the prior year and 22 basis points lower sequentially. with the influence of the skip-a-pay group now largely complete, we think that delinquencies are the most clear indicator of our loss trajectory over the short-term.
credit remained strong in private student loans. net charge-offs were down 15 basis points year-over-year and 18 basis points compared to the prior quarter. the 30-plus delinquency rate improved 55 basis points from the prior year and 19 basis points sequentially. in personal loans, net charge-offs were down 79 basis points year-over-year with a 30-plus delinquency rate down 47 basis points from the prior year and 24 basis points from the prior quarter.
the positive impact of additional stimulus, combined with an improved economic outlook, have shifted our expectation on the timing of losses. we had previously expected losses would increase in the second half of this year and remain elevated into 2022. that is no longer the case. based on our current delinquency trends, we believe losses are likely to be flat to down this year with the possibility of some increase in 2022. that said, a material shift in the economic environment could offer the timing and magnitude of losses.
moving to the allowance for credit losses on slide 10. this quarter, we released $879 million from the allowance. this reflected several factors, including favorable changes to our macro assumptions, a moderate decrease in our loan balance, the continued decline in delinquencies, and lower losses. relative to our view in january, the economic outlook has continued to improve. as we've done in prior quarters, we've modeled several different scenarios and took a conservative but more optimistic view. our assumptions on unemployment for a year-end 2021 rate of 6%, with a return to full employment in late 2023, we assume gdp growth of about 4.6%.
our reserve assumptions did not contemplate any additional stimulus directed to consumers, but did anticipate broader economic benefits from infrastructure spending beginning in the second half of this year. the modest increase to reserves in our student loan portfolio was driven by loan growth coming out of the mini peak season.
looking at slide 11. our common equity tier 1 ratio increased 180 basis points sequentially to 14.9%, well above our internal target of 10.5%. we have continued to fund our quarterly dividend at $0.44 per share and repurchased $119 million of common stock during the quarter. our board of directors previously authorized up to $1.1 billion of repurchases. we will likely accelerate our share repurchases in the second quarter and we see the potential for capital returns to increase in the second half of the year.
as i mentioned earlier, we continue to optimize our funding mix and consumer deposits now make up 65% of total funding. our goal remains to have 70% to 80% of our funding from deposits, which we feel is achievable. though, we expect some quarter-to-quarter variability in this figure.
moving to slide 12. our perspectives on 2021 have evolved from last quarter. we continue to anticipate modest positive loan growth for the year. we are investing in new account acquisition and have already seen strong sales growth through the first quarter. high payment rates will continue to pressure loan growth near-term but should become less of a headwind over the course of the year.
versus the first quarter level, we expect our nim to remain in a relatively narrow range over the rest of the year. while we'll continue to benefit from improved funding cost and mix, we may experience modest yield pressure over the next few quarters from variability in the revolve rate.
our commitment to expense management has not changed. but as roger mentioned, we believe there is an opportunity to drive long-term growth through increased marketing and further investments in data and analytics. excluding marketing, expenses should be near flat from the prior year.
credit performance has remained stronger than originally anticipated, and we now expect credit losses to be flat to down compared to 2020.
lastly, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividend and buybacks. given the level of reserve release and the strength of our fundamental performance, we plan to revisit our capital plan -- capital return levels for the second half of this year.
in summary, we're pleased with our first quarter results. our sales trend, credit expansion and marketing investments positioned us well for growth going forward. we released $879 million of reserves. nim continue to improve, driven by lower funding costs, and expenses were down, but we'll invest in marketing and analytics that will drive revenue, as well as operating and credit cost improvements over the longer-term. as the economy reopens, i'm positive regarding the opportunities for growth. we have a strong value proposition that resonates with consumers and our digital banking model positions us well for strong returns going forward.
with that, i'll turn the call back to our operator, maria, to open the lines for q&a.

thank you. [operator instructions] we'll take our first question from sanjay sakhrani of kbw.
sanjay sakhrani -- keefe bruyette & woods inc. -- analyst
thanks. good morning. i got a question on loan growth and marketing. roger, you talked about moving standards to pre-pandemic levels. maybe you could just talk about the opportunities for growth relative to 2019? and how we should think about the marketing budget in relation to that? and then maybe you could just also tie in your confidence level on the loan growth given the stimulus? i mean, it seems like you guys have kept it flat in terms of the loan growth expectations. so, maybe just elaborate on that? thanks.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
sure. thanks for the question, sanjay. maybe starting then with the stimulus. clearly, one of the biggest differences versus 2019 is the payment rate, and that's partly driven by the cash payments to consumers, the savings rate, but also the relief they get, be it on their federal student loans or other payments they have to make. and so, that's a real headwind against loan growth. and as i mentioned on the call, it's actually at the highest level since the year 2000.
in terms of marketing, we feel very good about the cost per accounts, about the projected returns we'll get on those, have widened our credit box back to the pre-pandemic. although, as you recall, we had been tightening for a couple of years and i would say, continue to remain conservative in our overall credit approach. so, i really think it's that headwind from payment rate that has kept us from being even more enthusiastic about loan growth.
sanjay sakhrani -- keefe bruyette & woods inc. -- analyst
and when we think about the marketing amount relative to 2019, is there any context you could provide for that? sorry for the follow-up.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yeah. i think part of it and john indicated this, i think we're probably more comfortable giving you some view around where we expect total expenses to be. but also it will depend on what we see in the back half of the year. and so, to the extent we see opportunities to deploy more capital against organic growth, we've been clear that's our top priority. and so, that's why we will -- we're continuously revisiting where and how much we should allocate to marketing.
sanjay sakhrani -- keefe bruyette & woods inc. -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from the line of ryan nash of goldman sachs.
ryan nash -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
good morning.
ryan nash -- goldman sachs -- analyst
so, roger, john, on capital, post this quarter's performance, you're at 15% cet1. you talked about reevaluating in the second half of the year. i guess, given the outlook for credit potential for further reserve releases, i think it's fair to say, you guys are going to be building in -- capital in the near term. so, how should we think about the timeframe of getting back to that 10.5% cet1 level and how does that -- how does cecl day one factor into that? and, i guess, roger as a follow-up to that, just given all the capital sit around, does it at all change the way you think about acquisitions? and if so, what would be the priorities? thanks.
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
okay. hey, ryan, thanks for the question. i'll start it and then i'll turn it over to roger for the second piece of the question. so, really, really strong performance and the economy has strengthened beyond our expectations, as we said in our prepared remarks. so, we came into the year somewhat optimistic but also cautious given the amount of uncertainty. what we're seeing is, kind of a broad-based improvement in the economy. our credit fundamentals have been extremely strong. as a result, we made a decision to -- an appropriate decision to release about $900 million of reserve. taking the -- obviously, cet1 ratio well above our internal target of 10.5%.
we're looking to come back to that 10.5% point, we're not going to do it overnight. we know the cecl transition is somewhere between 200 basis points and 250 basis points on cet1, but that still leaves ample room for actions in terms of dividends, buybacks and targeted m&a when and if appropriate. so, specifics around timing, getting back to the 10.5%, i would broadly say, medium-term, but we are certainly committed to that target, and we'll do a number of efforts, including revisiting our buyback levels in the second half of this year to get there.
and the follow-up might be, what do we expect the buyback levels to be incrementalize to? we're not going to give specifics, but i will give a little bit of history. if you go back to '17 and '18, our level of buybacks was about $2 billion. i'm not saying history is going to repeat. it will be subject to -- it's a bunch of conversations with our team internally and then, obviously, board approval. but we'll continue to evaluate.
so, roger, do you want to...
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yeah. and on the m&a front, we try and be disciplined. and so, i would say, we'd not let extra money burn a hole in our pocket. for those of us -- for those of you who've been with us for a longer, you'll recall, we had significant excess capital post the financial crisis. we're limited by the payout ratios and the ccar process. but as said, we will return it over time and stay discipline. so, as we think about m&a opportunities on the banking side, not much out there that fits with our digital model. you're seeing acquisitions that our branch mergers, cost takeout, which doesn't fit. and then on the payment side, while valuations have come in, they are still really high. and so, we lean a bit more toward partnerships, potentially smaller minority investments. so, again, i think you can expect no change to our disciplined approach around returning capital to our shareholders.
ryan nash -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. and if i could squeeze in one other. so, on the slightly higher expenses, john, can you maybe just help us what is the base for that? is it gaap or adjusted?
and then, second, roger, there is numerous mentions of accelerating investments in data, analytics and account growth. can you maybe just give us a sense for what you would need to see for those -- for you to bring those investments on in terms of whether it's in the macro account acquisition or what would you expect to drive that? thanks.
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
great. real quick, first part of your question, the expense growth relative to gaap last year.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
and then on the investment side, a lot of those are on capabilities, especially in the data and analytic area, that just enhance all parts of our operations, whether it's the credit underwriting, the marketing targeting, personalization, collections, etc. and so, they are -- given the return profile, part of it is just bandwidth and talent, i would say, are more gating factors, but we're really excited about the benefits.
and then in terms of putting more dollars to work on the marketing side, it will vary. competitive activity has a bit of an impact on that. but we will -- just look at on the new account side, what we're seeing across different channels and carefully at those marginal opportunities and the returns they generate.
ryan nash -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks for all the color.

our next question comes from the line of john pancari of evercore isi.
john pancari -- evercore isi -- analyst
good morning.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
good morning.
john pancari -- evercore isi -- analyst
given your commentary on expenses and your plan to invest selectively there on the marketing side, can you perhaps maybe help us think about the efficiency trend longer-term? i know you came in around 38.7% in terms of the ratio this quarter. did you think about what is the reasonable long-term expectation as we look out? thanks.
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. happy to cover that. so, as we went through the pandemic, we really scrutinized the expense base. and there has been a long history of expense discipline in this company. and through the pandemic, we found certain opportunities. so, as we think about the balance of this year, the next year and going forward, we're going to continue to focus on controlling corporate cost, so that we can invest savings back into overall growth levers. and we've done that. we're going to continue to do that. as we think about the efficiency ratio, we'll come in this year somewhere around where we finished last year, i think, assuming revenue comes in with the modest growth we talked about in loans. and going forward, i would expect somewhere in the upper-30s would be a reasonable spot. that will indicate that we're driving efficiencies and still investing in the business.
eric wasserstrom -- head of investor relations
any follow-up, john?
operator
our next question comes from the line of bill carcache of wolfe research.
bill carcache -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, roger, and john. there is a lot of debate taking place around what's going to happen with rates whether we get more steepening at the long end and when we'll get lift off at the short end. is discover's ability to get to a mid-20% rotce at all impacted by what happens with rates? maybe another way to ask it is, can you talk about your confidence level and being able to get to, say, mid-25%-type rotce even if the serp remains in place?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, bill. so, specific to rates, so if rates begin to increase, there is indications that a number of different things are happening in the economy. so, you would expect inflation to be increasing, a very, very low level of unemployment, probably near full employment for the economy and a robustness that might rival kind of the pre-pandemic levels on a sustained basis. and so, you have to believe that there is a lot of different things that are going to happen and that the fed also will take some actions to control inflation. now, we have seen this over a number years now that the fed and overall interest rate environment has been on a sustained basis very, very low. as we look forward to 2021 and 2022, my expectation is, rates will remain low and we'll enjoy the benefits of the economy, they're just continuing to grow. beyond that it gets different, that it's more difficult to call.
in terms of total return levels, it will depend on a number of factors, rate is just one of those, credit obviously be an important item. but certainly longer-term, we think that we're in a position to drive high returns for our shareholders. consistent with what we've done historically. and our hope is, when we come back to that 10.5% target, that will further enhance overall returns.
bill carcache -- wolfe research -- analyst
got it. thank you. as a follow-up, can you discuss the opportunity in the student lending space among customers who may not have been thinking about refinancing their student debt to lower rate when their loans went to forbearance? but as loans start to exit forbearance, is there going to be an opportunity for you guys to see an acceleration there?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yeah. so we don't really participate in the student loan refi market. the pricing doesn't really meet our return hurdles. to the extent there is more activity, it can marginally impact the payment rate for student loans. but we feel really good about where we're positioned. and i think last year was very challenging, there's a lot of kids either deferred for a year or had reduced expenses because they didn't have meals or housing, etc. so, again, yeah, we feel good about what this peak season should bring and our ability to continue gaining share.
bill carcache -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you for taking my questions.

our next question comes from the line of betsy graseck of morgan stanley.
betsy graseck -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. good morning.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
good morning.
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
good morning.
betsy graseck -- morgan stanley -- analyst
couple of questions. one, you were talking earlier about widening standards, in particular in card. and i just wanted to get a sense as to what you're expecting that will drive? is that both an increase in accounts, as well as higher lines extended to your existing accounts? and then, could you give us some color on how you expect to pull in the new clients, given the fact that the consumer is in a fantastic spot? are you pulling from other folks or do you feel like this is generating new demand from maybe a younger cohort that's not been borrowing yet? some color on that could be helpful.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
sure. so in terms of the credit expansion, it's probably more heavily impacting new accounts, but also encompasses sort of our line increase and other criteria on the portfolio side as well. in terms of where we expect? i would say, in all times we give cards to consumers who are in good shape. but we do have particularly strong appeal to millennials and students, our secured card is performing well in the marketplace. but then also the traditional prime revolver segment that discover has always targeted. it's a very competitive business. it always has been. so, it's about differentiation. and there, a superior customer experience, a great rewards program, focus on value, those traditional things are what allow us to continue gaining share and booking new accounts.
betsy graseck -- morgan stanley -- analyst
it's interesting because your value prop, very clear, especially versus other card lenders with no fee, etc. how do you think you're positioned against the fintechs who also have a light or low or no fee proposition?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
so, there aren't that many of the fintechs that are active yet in the card space. by and large they do loans of different types. and so, we've yet to see a significant, i would say, fintech player in the card space. and most of our competition tends to be the traditional leaders in the marketplace.
betsy graseck -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. and if i could squeeze one in for, john. you mentioned in answer to the prior question or two ago around the total expense outlook that you're thinking about for the full-year 2021. and i think you mentioned that you're expecting 2021 to come in similar to the end of '20 and then from there as we look to '22 and beyond, migrate back toward like the high-30s. could you just give us some color as to the end of '20 expense ratio that you're thinking about? because there's a couple of different ways you could place based on one-timers? is that a run rate that's north of 40% on the efficiency side, maybe you can help us understand your sizing there?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. so, we used a gaap basis on that. and so, the one-timers that were included in an underlying number that actually we didn't publish but we called out the underlying numbers. it was about $200 million. so, the operating efficiency is going to be dependent upon what we see in terms of loan growth, payment rate and new account generation, which, as roger said, and i'll echo the comments, we're very positive about how we're positioned to drive growth in -- especially in the second half of the year as the payment rate abates a bit. so, what you can expect here and i'm trying to provide as much details as i can, is that, outside of the marketing investments we talked about, some select investments in data and analytics we're looking to keep all other costs flat. and we're going to manage that envelope as we see opportunities, but we'll be able to use that as a jumping off point to drive further improvements and efficiencies in '22 and beyond.
betsy graseck -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. and so, the $200 million is what we should ex out to get to operating that's on the expense side?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
subject to growth and what we see as opportunities. yeah. so there is no absolutes, but -- and as time goes on we'll have more clarity on the opportunities.
betsy graseck -- morgan stanley -- analyst
and then if i look pre-pandemic, right?
eric wasserstrom -- head of investor relations
so, betsy, we do want to do -- betsy, we do have some other questions to get to.
betsy graseck -- morgan stanley -- analyst
all right.
eric wasserstrom -- head of investor relations

our next question comes from the line of mark devries of barclays.
mark devries -- barclays -- analyst
thanks. i was hoping you could give us some color on where we should expect the reserve ratio to migrate to. is it appropriate to think about it going back to kind of the cecl day one level? and if so, at what pace could we get there?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. thank you. so, yeah, we took a meaningful chunk out of the reserve levels this quarter. honestly, the credit outlook and our model has indicated that there is a range of different outcomes we could have made on that. and what we tried to do was take a chunk out of the reserves that made sense, given level of absolute uncertainty in the economy. as we look forward, the absolute reserve level or reserve rate will depend on what we see in the macros, how the portfolio is performing and what we do in terms of account growth, loan balance. but overall, as we think about where the provision levels could be, i would use the day one cecl rate as a decent proxy, and subject to how the portfolio is performing, it could migrate up or down from there.
what we did last year in the first quarter and the second quarter was react to an incredibly dynamic and changing macro environment. and we prudently put up an incremental $2 billion. so, the portfolio performs over time. we could get back to that cecl day one and perhaps a little bit lower with excellent portfolio management. now, timing, i'm not going to be specific on.

our next question comes from the line of don fandetti from wells fargo.
donald fandetti -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hi. good morning. roger, as we went through the pandemic, obviously, there's more e-commerce spend. and is there anything that you've learned in terms of like how you would position the company differently? it seems like big tech and technology are continuing to gain more touch points with customers. is there anything strategically that you want to lean into or you've learned?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
great question. i think it really accelerated a lot of trends that existing prior to pandemic, right? so, consumers were already migrating more and more of their shopping online, but that moved even quicker. their customer interactions were moving more toward digital. that accelerated even further. so, i think it had us recommitted to the path we were on and looking to accelerate some of the functionality. certainly, there were some specific things around the tap-and-go cards, a lot of small dollar transactions migrating from cash to debit that benefited our pulse volumes. but i would say, in general, not so much new trends. but three-, four-, five-year accelerations of trends that were already there and that we have been positioning the company to take advantage of.
donald fandetti -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
got it. and on the potential investments or partnerships, would those be accretive or could they potentially be more technology investments?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
where we traditionally made them on the payment side is with partners that either add capabilities or to cement a relationship that will drive volume over our network. on the technology side, we found plenty of great partners/vendors out there that you don't need -- people don't need money in the current environment. and so, that's why we tend not to do investments in pure technology companies that aren't payments related.

as you look forward to loan growth, how much opportunity is there to category-specific rebound that's more indexed to borrow like travel, for example?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
great question. i think that will be constructive. some of the categories that were strongest through the downturn, though, had a pretty good revolve rates. if you think about home improvement that was really doing well. so, a lot of it i think will be in the restaurant and travel segment. but i wouldn't necessarily expect a huge boost to revolve rate just given, again, some of the categories that were strong in the downturn.

our next question comes from the line of mihir bhatia of bank of america.
mihir bhatia -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning and thank you for taking my question. just really quickly, i wanted to ask about competitive intensity. first, are you seeing any impact on cost of acquisition as customers have come back? i know that had trended very well last year, and that's an area you'd be making investments in.
and then maybe i'll just ask my -- the related question i had on that. last year, discover's no annual fee, no cashback card was just really well suited for the backdrop. as we reopen and maybe travel rewards become more relevant for consumers, are you seeing any impact on your usage, any early indicators from consumers who had may be moved your card to top of wallet last year and what you're seeing? so just, i guess, competitive intensity, more broadly? thank you.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yeah. so, i'll start with the second one. we are not seeing an impact. and we think the lesson learned in the pandemic of the utility of cash rewards, hopefully will last. and we feel very good about even the new or redemption offers we've added. so the ability to redeem at point-of-sale, with paypal, with amazon, we just announced the ability to redeem for carbon offsets, which we think will be popular with millennials. so, no real change to that.
in terms of competitive intensity, we talked about, i would say, just extraordinarily attractive cost per account last year as there was a significant pullback. i think we're now moving toward more normalized levels of competition. and my guess is, we'll see that increase. but our job is to grow the business in face of the competition that's there. and so, while i missed the cpa's from last year, we feel good about the returns we'll generate from our marketing even in a more intense environment.

our next question comes from the line of john hecht of jefferies.
john hecht -- jefferies llc -- analyst
good morning, guys. thanks very much for taking my question. the first question and, roger, you addressed some of this. with respect to the loan growth, maybe you talked about it being a mix of line utilization and new customers. i'm wondering, is there one bigger contribution to that relative to the others. and what's the cadence? is this more of a second half factor or is this going to be balanced over the course of the year?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yeah. so, on the cadence side, i do expect marketing expenses to ramp up over the course of the year. yeah. they weren't overly large q1. but, again, with the wider credit box we'll get more leverage for the marketing spend. so, we'd expect a ramp. but we'll look at that continuously and make adjustments as we see fit.
in terms of the impact of the credit changes, it's probably more heavily weighted toward the new account side versus portfolio, but we always look for a blend of those two as we think about growth.
john hecht -- jefferies llc -- analyst
okay. and then...
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
go ahead, john. please go ahead.
john hecht -- jefferies llc -- analyst
john, i guess, more of a kind of constant question is, we're a year into cecl now and obviously it's had a pretty big impact and how things have turned out from a gaap perspective. how do you stack the major decision making factors with respect to your all [phonetic] now? is it the moody's model? is it unemployment? is it just your internal opinion of your performance trends? how have things changed with respect to the way you look at that all level?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. good question. so, certainly, evolving. so, we use moody's and also two other providers. so, the broad macros are very important. the portfolio performance itself is also obviously key input and we have a team of technical modelers that have run various scenarios, regression sort of scenarios to help make a determination on what overall life of loan losses could be, which is a key input. there is probably 12 to 15 different variables that go into that model that help through the projection. and then the other [technical issues]. and what you have on the balance sheet as of the measurement date in order to set reserve. so, i would say, all of those factors are important.
and then, finally, one other one is the recovery rate which actually also does go into the models. so, four important factors, and we've taken a measured approach to ensure that our balance sheet is appropriately stated and we're on the conservative end of the judgment costs.
john hecht -- jefferies llc -- analyst
appreciate the context. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of meng jiao of deutsche bank.
meng jiao -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for taking my call or questions. so, it looks like monthly sales for travel, restaurants and retail seems to have pretty much materially accelerated from february into march and in particular for restaurants. have you guys seen that carrying over into april as well?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. we have actually -- incredibly the sales performance, the first three weeks of april versus '19, overall, we're up about 17%. and it's three weeks into the month, so things can change. and then versus last year, which was certainly dented significantly by the pandemic. we're up 68% on sales. so, really strong there. and then the mix between revolvers and transactors, obviously, transactors are up higher than revolvers but revolvers are up almost near double digits versus prior year. so, all good.
meng jiao -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of moshe orenbuch of credit suisse.
moshe orenbuch -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks. most of my questions actually have been already asked and answered, but maybe if you could just follow up on two quick points. one is, the payment rate -- the stubbornly high payment rates and how that will likely decline? i mean, is there -- i guess, maybe the question is, how much of that is a function of the actual stimulus dollars versus some of the ongoing impacts that you highlighted, whether it's enhanced unemployment benefits or student loan, interest forbearance, in terms of thinking about the pace of that decline?
and then just very quickly, you talked about the cecl day one. just conceptually, do you think that the life of loan has a higher or lower likelihood on january 1, 2022 of the near-term recession hit on january 1, 2020?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
so, i'll cover the first part. i'll let john forecast recessions. in terms of the elevated payment rate, it is a mix, but you are seeing a lot of it come from the governmental support. and so, we do expect it to come down over the course of the year, but remain elevated compared to historic levels. and this is because households have a lot of savings withdrawn [phonetic] and there is just a lot of other forms of support. so it's not -- it is a headwind against loan growth. it's really been driven by external factors. sorry, i would say, we're not overly alarmed about it. and again, we would expect it to start drifting downwards as we get further past that really extraordinary levels of government stimulus.
and i'll pass it to john for the questions on recessions.
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
great. so, yeah, i think what you're getting at is what will be our macro assumptions at the end of this year forecasting out to 2022. so, today, obviously, there is no perfect answer or perfect insight. i will say this, the pent-up demand for consumers i believe is fairly pronounced and we'll continue to drive spending activity through this year and well into next year. so that to me indicates that the macros should be positive through 2022, beyond 2022, it's really difficult to call at this point.
moshe orenbuch -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. thank you.
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
you're welcome. thanks. thanks for the questions.
operator
our next question comes from the line of kevin barker of piper sandler.
kevin barker -- piper sandler -- analyst
good morning. could you give us a little bit more detail on some of the investment spend you're making on data, analytics and driving account growth? and then also, is there any way to quantify how much incremental spend you are putting into that and returns that are being generated from that, whether it's additional growth or other trends that we can identify to quantify the growth that were in investment returns that you're getting?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. great. so, i'll hit the second part of the question first. so, in terms of returns, we have a rigorous process where we take a look at incremental investments to ensure that they deliver strong cash on cash returns. and in terms of roes or return threshold, i won't be specific, but very, very strong double digits on those, with -- in line with what you can expect from the company on a normalized basis in terms of return on capital.
in terms of what we're investing in data, analytics on -- specifically on, i'm looking at attrition from the portfolio, we feel like there is an opportunity to reduce attrition levels through some early identification of customers who may not be maximizing the usage of the card. we have data, analytics projects going on in collections. i mentioned in our prepared remarks, in fraud and fraud analytics. so, there's -- frankly, there is almost a insatiable demand for these sorts of programs and what we are, we're being very, very selective in terms of making sure that we prioritize the highest returning ones in the current year.
kevin barker -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. thank you.
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
you're welcome.
eric wasserstrom -- head of investor relations
emily, why don't we make this our last question, please?
operator
our final question comes from the line of dominick gabriele of oppenheimer.
dominick gabriele -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
hey, thank you so much for taking my question. i just wanted to go back to the expenses and sorry, i don't mean to beat a dead horse here. if you look at the gaap operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2020 they were almost about $1.3 billion. are we expecting a quarter that could be that high or just because there was -- it seemed to be a little -- or i got a little confused on one of the comments there. so is that reasonable to think that one of the quarters could be near that $1.3 billion level?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. so, i'm certainly not in the business of forecasting quarterly. i will tell you this from an expense standpoint. the marketing expense for the balance of the year, we expect will continue to grow into the kind of that envelope we talked about earlier. the quarter-over-quarter comparisons are, frankly, relatively challenging given what happened in 2020 in terms of our focused approach to look at every single dollar that potentially is going out of the door on an expense item. so, i would just focus on the broad numbers and the quarterly break-outs. i'll leave it to you to figure out what makes the most sense. we here -- we're looking at 2021 and 2022 and don't specifically try to manage to any particular quarterly number.
dominick gabriele -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
makes sense. and then, i guess, if you kind of look at what happened this quarter with the kind of benefits that you guys have -- with having not only a lending business, but one that also gains interchange that really helped to offset some of those slowdown in loans, i guess. do you expect that the -- we could see that discover proprietary network being much higher as far as the growth basis going forward year-over-year versus your loan growth in 2021 do you expect that divergence to be there for at least a few quarters? thanks so much guys. really appreciate it.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
sure. so, our total network spend is benefiting from growth in some of our third-party payments areas. if you include the debit side, pulse is growing very strongly. and so, that's helpful. but we also believe that having a proprietary network is an important differentiator and gives us a whole series of capabilities that helps us grow our banking business. so, again, total volume will depend somewhat on some of the partners and we are a little skewed toward debit for the third parties, but we're going to work for continued robust volume growth.
dominick gabriele -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
great. thanks so much.
eric wasserstrom -- head of investor relations
all right. well --. sorry, maria. but thank you very much. if you have any follow-up questions, feel free to reach out to jon [phonetic], emily and i. and thank you for joining us.

operator
good afternoon. my name is stephanie, and i will be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter 2021 discover financial services earnings conference call. [operator instructions] after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions]
thank you. i will now turn the call over to mr. eric wasserstrom, head of investor relations. please go ahead, sir.
eric wasserstrom -- head of investor relations
thank you, stephanie, and good morning, everyone. welcome to today's call. i'll begin on slide two of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our investor relations website, investorrelations.discover.com.
our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our second quarter earnings press release and presentation.
our call today will include remarks from our ceo, roger hochschild; and john greene, our chief financial officer. after we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for question-and-answer session. during the q&a session, you will be permitted to ask one question, followed by one follow-up question, after your follow-up question, please return to the queue.
now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to roger.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
thanks, eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. we had a very good quarter that highlighted the strength of our digital business model and solid execution on our strategic priorities against the backdrop of continued economic improvement. this quarter was characterized by three important events. first, our card receivables grew sequentially in may and june, causing our period-end receivables to be up quarter-over-quarter. this outcome, combined with the strength in consumer spending and our account acquisition, increased our confidence for moderate receivables growth this year and stronger growth in 2022.
second, we benefited from a gain in our payment services segment. this gain is an outgrowth of a long [technical issues] commercial relationship and underscores our payments ability to forge innovative and lasting partnerships. lastly, we achieved a historic low in delinquencies, which resulted from consumers' strong liquidity position, our conservative stance on underwriting, and the proactive measures we took into the downturn to protect our credit quality. this outcome also supported our reserve release this quarter.
turning to the quarter's results. we earned $1.7 billion after tax or $5.55 per share. these results include a $729 million one-time gain. but even excluding this gain, our results were very strong at $3.73 per share. the drivers of the quarter's strong results reflect the combination of our solid execution and supportive macro conditions. total sales were, up 48% from a year ago, and 24% from the second quarter of 2019.
retail sales remained very strong, and there was significant improvement in t&e categories, which were hardest hit by the pandemic. even travel returned to growth in june, compared to [technical issues] levels. and sales volumes are accelerating. the 24% growth i cited is an increase from 15% in the first quarter relative to the same period in 2019.
we also see an attractive environment for account acquisition even in the face of heightened competition. we have removed nearly all of our pandemic credit tightening and have increased our marketing investment to align with these actions. these decisions supported new account growth of 26% over 2019 levels with strong growth among prime consumers as our differentiated brand and integrated networks support our strong value proposition, which centers on transparent and useful rewards, outstanding customer service and no annual fees.
while the current operating environment is broadly constructive, there are also some challenges. as we have highlighted before, the counterpoint of sustained strong credit performance is high payment rates, which in the second quarter were over 500 basis points above 2019 levels. we may be seeing evidence that payment rates are plateauing, and while we expect some moderation later this year, we believe payment rates will remain above historical levels for some time. even so, we expect to strengthen our sales figures and the contribution from new accounts to drive loan growth through the back half of this year and accelerate in 2022.
as we have said in the past, we will invest when we see attractive opportunities and the actions we took this quarter with increased marketing expenses in investments and technology and analytics were an example of that approach. these investments are consistent with our commitment to long-term positive operating leverage and an improving efficiency ratio as they drive loan growth and enable a more efficient operating platform.
in our payments business, we benefited from a gain on our equity investment in marqeta. this gain was the result of a relationship that began a decade ago, and we continue to see opportunities [technical issues] and innovative partnerships. i'm very excited about our investment in cecl that was [technical issues] week, as we look to expand our partnership with a leading buy now, pay later provider.
we also continue to grow our global acceptance presence and announced new partnerships in bahrain and portugal, adding to the two network alliances that we announced earlier this year. our debit business continued to build on its recent strength. pulse volume increased 19% year-over-year and was up 33% from 2019 levels. in addition to the influence of economic recovery, this performance reflects the greater relevance of debit to many consumers through the pandemic period.
volume at diners has also recovered to some extent and was, up 41% from the prior year's lows. however, volume is still below pre-pandemic levels and may remain so for a period of time. the strong fundamental performance of our digital banking model drove significant capital generation, which this quarter was also aided by our equity gain. we accelerated our share repurchases to $553 million of common stock, a level near the maximum permitted under the federal reserve's four quarter rolling net income test. we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. and going forward, our approach will be governed by the stress capital buffer framework.
on our call last quarter, we indicated that we hope to revisit our capital return for the second half of this year. and i'm very pleased that our board of directors authorized the new $2.4 billion share repurchase program that expires next march. we also increased our quarterly dividend from $0.44 to $0.50 per share. with the current strength of the us economy, i'm increasingly optimistic about our growth opportunities this year and beyond. our value proposition continues to resonate with consumers. our payment segment is expanding its partnerships and acceptance and our capital generative model positions us for strong returns over the long-term.
i'll now ask john to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail.
john t. greene -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, roger, and good morning, everyone. i'll begin with our summary financial results on slide four. as roger noted, our results this quarter highlighted the strength of our digital model, solid execution on our priorities and continued improvement in the macroeconomic environment. revenue, net of interest expense, increased 34% from the prior year.
excluding one-time items, revenue was up 9%. net interest income was up 5% as we continue to benefit from lower funding costs and reduced interest charge-offs, reflecting strong credit performance. this was partially offset by a 4% decline in average receivables from the prior year levels.
excluding one-time items, non-interest income increased 29%, driven by the higher -- by higher net debt count and interchange revenue, due to strong sales volume. the provision for credit losses decreased $2 billion from the prior year, mainly due to a $321 million reserve release in the current quarter, compared to a $1.3 billion reserve build in the prior year, an improvement in the economic [technical issues] and ongoing credit strength were the primary drivers of the release. net charge-offs decreased 41% or $311 million from the prior year.
operating expenses were, up 13%, primarily reflecting additional investments in marketing, which was up 36% and employee compensation, which was up 10%, a software write-off and a non-recurring impairment at diners club also contributed to the increase. i'll provide more details on expense drivers and outlook later in the presentation.
moving to loan growth on slide five. ending loans increased 2% sequentially and were down just 1% from the prior year. this was driven by card loans, which increased 2% from the prior quarter and were down 2% year-over-year. lower year-over-year card receivables reflect two primary factors. first, the payment rate remains high as households continue to have a strong cash flow position, due to several rounds of government stimulus. second, promotional balances were approximately 250 basis points lower than the prior year quarter.
while card receivables declined year-over-year, we considered a sequential increase to be an important data point reflecting continued momentum in account acquisition and very strong sales volume. the high payment rate remains a headwind to receivable growth, although we expect to see modest decreases in late 2021.
looking at our other lending products. organic student loans increased 4% from the prior year. we are well positioned as we enter the peak origination season. personal loans were down 6%, driven by credit tightening last year and high payment rates. we are encouraged by continued strong credit performance in the portfolio and have expanded credit for new originations.
moving to slide six. net interest margin was 10.68%, up 87 basis points from the prior year and down 7 basis points sequentially. compared to the prior quarter, the net interest margin decrease was mainly driven by a nearly 200 basis points reduction in the card revolve rate. loan yields decreased 17 basis points from the prior quarter, mainly due to the lower revolve rate. this decline reflects the impact of increased payments, as well as seasonal trends.
yield on personal loans declined 7 basis points sequentially, due to lower pricing. student loan yield was up 4 basis points. margin benefited from lower funding costs, primarily driven by maturities at higher rate cds. we cut our online savings rate to 40 basis points in the first quarter and did not make any pricing adjustments during the second quarter.
average consumer deposits were, up 6% year-over-year and declined 1% from the prior quarter. the entire sequential decline was from consumer cds, which were down 9%, while savings and money market deposits increased 2% from the prior quarter. consumer deposits are now 66% of total funding, up from 65% in the prior period.
looking at slide 7. excluding the equity investment gains, total non-interest income was up $123 million or 29% year-over-year. net discount and interchange revenue increased $102 million or 43% as revenue from strong sales volume was partially offset by higher rewards costs. loan fee income increased $20 million or 24%, mainly driven by higher cash advance fees with demand increasing as the economy reopens.
looking at slide eight. total operating expenses were, up $145 million or 13% from the prior year. employee compensation increased $46 million, primarily due to a higher bonus accrual in the current [technical issues] versus 2020 when we reduced the accrual. excluding this item, employee compensation was down from the prior year as we've managed headcount across the organization.
marketing expense increased $46 million from the prior year as we accelerated our growth investments. we still see significant opportunities for growth and we plan to accelerate our marketing spend through [technical issues] to drive account acquisition and brand awareness. information processing was up due to a $32 million software write-off, the increase in other expense reflects a $92 million charge and the remainder of the diners intangible asset. partially offsetting this was lower fraud expense, reflecting some of the benefits from our investments in data analytics.
moving to slide nine. we had another quarter of improved credit performance. total net charge-offs were 2.1%, down 132 basis points year-over-year and 36 basis points sequentially. the [technical issues] net charge-off rate was 2.45%, 145 basis points lower than the prior year quarter and down 35 basis points sequentially. the net charge-off dollars were down $276 million versus last year's second quarter and $62 million sequentially. the card 30-plus delinquency rate was 1.43%, down 74 basis points from the prior year and 42 basis points lower sequentially. credit in our private student loans and personal loans also remained very strong through the quarter.
moving to the allowance for credit losses on slide 10. this quarter, we released $321 million from the reserves, due to three key factors: continued improvement in the macroeconomic environment; sustained strong credit performance with improving delinquency trends and lower losses; these were partially offset by a 2% sequential increase in loans. our current economic assumptions include an unemployment rate of approximately 5.5% by year-end and gdp growth of 7%. embedded within these assumptions are the expanded child care tax credits and the benefit from the infrastructure physical package beginning in late 2021.
looking at slide 11. our common equity tier 1 ratio increased 80 basis points sequentially to 15.7%, a level well above our internal target of 10.5%. as roger noted, we are committed to returning capital. the recent board approval increasing our buyback and dividend payouts reflect that. on funding, we continue to make progress toward our goal of having deposits [technical issues] 70% to 80% of our mix.
moving to slide 12. our perspective on 2021 continue to evolve as we see additional opportunities to drive profitable growth. we have increasing confidence in our outlook for modest loan growth in 2021 as strong sales and our new account growth should offset the higher payment rates. we expect nim will remain in a relatively narrow range, compared to the first quarter levels of 75%, with some quarterly variability similar to what we experienced this quarter.
we anticipate a slight benefit from higher coupon deposit maturities and an optimized funding mix with yields affected by variability in the revolve rate. our commitment to disciplined expense management has not changed, and we remain focused on generating positive operating leverage and an improving efficiency ratio. for this year, we now expect non-marketing expenses to be up slightly over the prior year, reflecting the higher compensation accruals and recovery fees. the increase in the use expense categories is closely tied to the economic recovery. for example, the high level of consumer liquidity is supporting elevated recoveries. these recoveries have some costs associated with them, but are more than offset by lower credit losses.
regarding marketing expenses, we expect this will step up more significantly in the second half of 2021 as we further deploy resources into account acquisition and brand marketing. with the continued improvement in credit performance, our current expectation is that credit losses will be down this year, compared to 2020. naturally, a material change in the economic environment could shift the timing and magnitude of losses. lastly, as evidenced by our dividend increase and new share repurchase authorization, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders.
in summary, we had another very strong quarter. we are well positioned for a positive top line trajectory given our sales trends and new account growth. credit remains extraordinarily strong, and the economic outlook continues to improve. we maintained our discipline on operating expenses, while investing [technical issues] returning organic growth opportunities. and finally, we continue to deliver high returns, allowing for enhanced buybacks and dividends.
with that, i'll turn the call back to our operator to open the line for q&a.

[operator instructions] we'll take our first question from john pancari with evercore isi.
john pancari -- evercore isi -- analyst
good morning.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
good morning.
john pancari -- evercore isi -- analyst
just wondering if you could -- good morning. just wondering if you can give a little more color on the payment rate expectation. i guess just what do you see and that gives you confidence in the moderate decline expected for the back half of this year? and if you could talk about the -- how you weigh the risks that the payment rate may not moderate from here?
and then secondly, on that, are you seeing any differences in your fico bands in terms of the payment rate behavior? thanks.
john t. greene -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
great. yes, i'll take the call or i'll take the question, john. thanks for that. so payment rates are, frankly, at a record high. so if you looked at our trust data, you can see that in june, they came in at about 29%, and that's -- frankly, that's an all-time high, at least as far as back as 2005. so what we're seeing when we look at the portfolio -- or not the portfolio, the trends are similar, but the overall payment rates a bit lower. what we're seeing is a couple of factors. so one is a deceleration of the growth in payment rate. and second, we formed our expectation on the second half of the year based on all of the government programs that are out there and most -- the most significant ones are expiring or have expired by the end of the third quarter.
so we expect that, coupled with the strong economic activity and lower savings rate that we're observing, to result in a moderate decrease in the payment rate certainly in the fourth quarter. in the third quarter, it could be flat to maybe even up a mild bit. but overall, our sense is that we've approached the peak of this, and it's going to begin to tail off.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
and in terms of the mix by fico band, it's pretty broad. certainly, the higher fico sku transactor. so you'll have a higher payment rate. in some of the mid ficos, you've seen revolvers turn transactor. but again, to john's point, we do expect it gradually to normalize.
john pancari -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay. great. now that's helpful. and then separately, i appreciate the commentary around the loan growth expectation and you also expect some variability in your margin. so how -- what does that imply for your net interest income expectations? if you could elaborate a little bit on that in terms of the second half trajectory therein and possibly going into 2022?
john t. greene -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so i'll touch upon it. so the net interest income will follow loan growth. but as you know, in the fourth quarter, the build on loan balance is skewed toward the last two months of the quarter. so net interest margin is what i'll say the trajectory is changing in a positive direction, given the sequential loan growth we saw from first quarter to second quarter. but again, it's going to be in the single-digits, lower single-digits is general expectation.
operator
your next question comes from the line of sanjay sakhrani with kbw.
sanjay sakhrani -- kbw -- analyst
thanks. good morning. i guess my first question is, i know everyone is sort of waiting for the consumer to relever and there's positive signs. but maybe, roger, you could just speak to the competitive environment? i mean, obviously, everyone's chasing growth or wanting to grow or maybe you could just speak to how it's out there?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yes. thanks, sanjay. as we've discussed in the past, the card business is always competitive. there was a nice little lull last year that we're able to take advantage of and pick up even more market share. but i think this is returning to more normal, maybe a little heightened, but more normal level of competition. you're seeing new products out there, increased marketing spend. but as i look at our value proposition [technical issues] cost per accounts we're achieving and the returns, i feel very, very good about the marketing spend we're putting out there and what we're generating for it.
sanjay sakhrani -- kbw -- analyst
okay. great. my follow-up is on the sezzle investment. obviously, they're an up and coming buy now, pay later company. i'm just curious sort of if you could speak to that specific investment and how you see that unfolding for yourselves, both in terms of the investment itself, but also strategically inside of buy now, pay later. thanks.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
sure. so in terms of our buy now, pay later strategy, there are really two parts. the sezzle investment is really being driven by the payment side. and that's similar to the investment we made in marqeta a while back. our set of network assets are very useful for many fintechs in terms of just an easier way to process payments and connect to merchants in a wide variety of forms. so i'd say that's the core of what we're doing with sezzle. we also believe that potentially, over time, there may be opportunities on the banking side. so in terms of our providing lending, not necessarily with sezzle, but in the buy now, pay later space more broadly. and again, leveraging what we can do with unsecured lending and our direct merchant relationships. but i'd say, we haven't announced anything on the lending side of buy now pay later at this time.
operator
your next question comes from ryan nash with goldman sachs.
ryan nash -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
good morning, ryan.
john t. greene -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
ryan nash -- goldman sachs -- analyst
john or roger, can you maybe just talk about the expectations for monetizing the marqeta gain? how much do you expect to reinvest versus used for repurchases? is it already factored into the buyback? second, can you maybe just remind us what the lockup is and your intention for the stake?
and maybe just lastly, this increase in expenses that we have right now, marketing and non-marketing investments, how much of these are being driven by the marqeta gain? and should we expect these to be one-time in nature or should we expect them to stay in the run rate? thanks.
john t. greene -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
okay. all right, ryan, thanks. so the marqeta gain was something that when we looked at the plan for the year, we didn't frankly, envision that, that opportunity would turn out quite the way it did, so certainly a nice outcome. the spend that we're seeing isn't dictated based on that size of the marqeta gain, but more about the broad economic opportunity that we're seeing right now to be able to drive positive growth. so frankly, we'll be spending at this level with or without the marqueta gain. the kind of the lock-up, those points are disclosed in the s-1, so you can reference that and get real specificity on it.
and then finally, in terms of the expenses and are they one-time in nature. so within the presentation itself, we highlighted, kind of, three items that were significant. so one was the bonus accrual unrelated to marqeta again and more broadly a reflection of what's happening in the business and the outcomes we're seeing here in terms of generating positive returns. the other item there was the diners intangible, which we took the opportunity based on what we see as the change in the cash flows in diners to fully impair that and took a $92 million write-off. and then the third item was a $30 million software write-off.
so all those are part of our normal, i'll say, hygiene factors. so the last two items were what i would consider relatively one-off, and i wouldn't include those in the, kind of, operating cash flows going forward. but as you're trying to get a sense for overall spend in 2021, we talked about accelerating marketing expense. so the way i would think about marketing specifically is that we anticipate it to return to 2019 levels, which would indicate a material acceleration in the second half of the year, which, again, is tied to the fact that we're seeing good origination opportunities to drive growth and long-term profitability.
ryan nash -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thanks for the color on that. and maybe as my follow-up, so you announced the new $2.4 billion buyback. but just given how high the levels of profitability are, you're still going to be well above the 10.5% level. so can you maybe just help us understand the strategy of getting the capital down over what time frame? are you managing all into cecl day one?
and then maybe attached to that, roger, you talked about potential lending opportunities and buy now, pay later. we've seen others take -- some go at it organically, some go via acquisition. what would you expect to be the strategy for discover on a go-forward basis? thanks.
john t. greene -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
all right. so i'll hit the capital point real quick. and then we'll flip it over to roger to handle it back second part of that question. the second part of that second question, i should say. so the capital plan was based on a couple of different factors. so one, we want to be prudent in our distributions of capital and make sure that we -- organic -- that we allocate our capital to organic growth opportunities and then buybacks and dividends and then acquisitions as they appear, so that hasn't changed whatsoever.
the planning in terms of capital overall is that we are committed to that 10.5%. as we look at the impacts of the cecl capital relief transition, that's about 200 basis points. and then in the first quarter of next year toward the end of this year as we review the outlook for 2022 with our board, we'll make recommendations with a couple of points in mind. the overall economic opportunity, the seb and where we are with that, and there's plenty of room there. and then finally approaching the 10.5%.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yes. and in terms of buy now, pay later, there are many, sort of, different things we could do. clearly, going direct with the merchant relationships we have is one option we could work with partners. i think the market is still very immature, and that's why you're seeing many different combinations, and it will evolve over time. but we don't have anything specific to share at this time.

your next question is from don fandetti with wells fargo.
don fandetti -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi, good morning. roger, kind of, a bigger picture question around technology spend. i just want to get your thoughts on where your head is right now, whether you're kind of making enough investments in ai and machine learning and staffing, different financial institutions or different points of the cycle?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yes. it is a major source of investment for us. and i would say that the scarcest asset there is talent as opposed to technology dollars. and then part of it is just making sure you're investing to monetize the granularity you can pick up with enhanced data and analytics. so looking at the entire [technical issues] stack, your personalization abilities, what you can deliver through different channels. so it's a big focus. i think we're probably the only major bank where the head of data and analytics is a direct report to the ceo. and so i think that reflects the importance we see on that, and i feel very good about our level of investment.
don fandetti -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
your next question is from bob napoli with william blair.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
thank you. appreciate it. good morning. question just a follow-up, i guess, on roger, your investments in like marqeta and sezzle and just the thoughts. i mean, how are you working with marqeta, how are these investments improving the product set, if you would, for discover? and are there more of these types of investments? or could they become acquisitions in the future?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
sure. so, you know, all of these investments start with a commercial relationship. we are not venture capitalists. we have no desire to get into that business. but where we have a commercial relationship with a company where we think there's a lot of potential and there is a way to invest and perhaps extract additional terms, maybe an exclusive arrangement or other commitments, those are the types of opportunities we pursue. and they're largely on the payment side. and we may even, given some of the opportunities we're seeing, accelerate that, although again, it's going to be relatively modest.
in terms of acquisitions, given the valuations, i'm not sure i necessarily see doing acquisitions and this approach around partnership and investment seems to work well. but we will look at it. john and our payments team have a very strong business development effort, and we'll consider acquisitions where it's a capability that will help us monetize our payments assets.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
great. thank you. got a follow-up on spend. your chart on page 16, the acceleration through the quarter relative to 2019. i mean, are you surprised by the level of spend that we're seeing? and how do you think about that relative to the long-term trend? i guess, if you take this quarter, you maybe had a 10% compound growth from 2019, but were you surprised by this and the acceleration through the quarter? and your thoughts on spend growth as you lap -- as you look at 2022 and onwards.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yes. i mean, i think compound growth is a very challenging measure because it smooths an unbelievable cycle that i don't think any of us would have expected in 2019. so the year-over-year spend growth numbers are unsustainably high for the economy as a whole. the economy is growing above, i think, what economists would say its real level should be. and so you're seeing that pent-up demand from consumers. we expect it to normalize at a strong level, and we look to continue gaining market share given how we're positioned. but i don't think anyone is expecting, yes, retail sales to stay up 30% forever.
operator
your next question comes from mark devries with barclays.
mark devries -- barclays -- analyst
yes, thanks. i had a question about the reserve levels. could you give us some sense of what you're kind of contemplating both from a delinquency and a charge-off perspective in those reserves? i mean, i think trends have obviously been very benign and yet you're still almost 200 basis points above kind of your cecl day one. what do you need to see those reserves come down more meaningfully?
john t. greene -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. mark, thanks for the question. so when we approach this quarter, certainly, the economic data was improving. the portfolio is performing extremely well. and the charge-off trajectory, we revised our guidance and now believe it will be below the prior year. so all of those are very, very positive from a reserving standpoint. we did put a bit of caution in the, kind of, reserve numbers as a result of the various government programs that are out there. so if you think about the eviction moratoriums, foreclosure moratoriums, various payment deferral programs and then the massive amount of government transfer payments that hit the economy, we felt like that those contributed to driving delinquencies and charge-offs below historical norms for our customer base.
so under cecl, we reserve for life of loans. and accordingly, we were waiting for those programs to run their course and the cash flows to kind of feed through the economy and impact our customers. and then be able to make, call it, a deeper change to the reserve levels. so as i said earlier, most of those programs ran their course in the third quarter. we obviously have the child care tax -- there's a child tax credit. we don't expect that to be an impact. so in the fourth quarter, we should begin to see more data that would allow us to take a different look at reserves and then into 2022, certainly. our expectation is that the credit environment is very positive from a growth standpoint and accordingly, we'll make reserves that kind of align with that.
mark devries -- barclays -- analyst
okay. got it. and then just one more question. do you have any other private investments that look like they could be in a large gain position just based on any kind of subsequent funding rounds and the valuations those are done at?
john t. greene -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so we have some investments, yes. we try to get in early and build out the commercial relationship, as roger alluded to. and we're hopeful that the combination of working with quality companies and developing deeper commercial relationships will help those folks to be profitable and help us drive business in our payments area, while giving us an option value for that investment. so one would hope that there's more. but at this point, it would be way premature to speculate.

your next question comes from manu srivareerat from ubs.
manu srivareerat -- ubs -- analyst
good morning, guys.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
good morning.
john t. greene -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
manu srivareerat -- ubs -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. i guess you talked a lot about the benefits of having a differentiated product with flexible cash rewards. now as things get back to normal and travel rewards become more relevant for consumers, are you seeing any impact to your utilization levels? is there any indication that consumers might have a shifting preference for travel and my star rewards over cash rewards?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
we've been successfully marketing cash rewards against travel rewards and every other type of card out there for decades. so i wouldn't get too caught up in sort of the shift away from frequent flyer miles in 2020. i think it points to sort of the stability and structure of our program that we didn't have to make a series of changes. we focus on continuously enhancing it. a lot of people don't focus as much as we do on redemption. so the ability to redeem at point of sale at amazon through our partner, paypal. so we are confident that we can compete with the travel rewards programs. a lot of the miles cards really target the super prime transactors, which isn't ours, it's much more a lend-focused model. we've got a very good miles card ourselves that we market. but again, i feel really good that our rewards compete against anyone out there.
manu srivareerat -- ubs -- analyst
okay. thank you for that. and just as a follow-up, how should we think about the rewards rate as you think about growing loan balances, for example? is there anything to that?
john t. greene -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, i'll cover this one. so the rewards rate over time has been relatively stable. it's increased somewhere between 1 bps and 3 bps annually. we expect that the 5% programs and the reward structure will continue that trend, while helping us to sustain a strong level of customer loyalty. so we look at that increase as a natural evolution of a good investment in our customer relationships.
manu srivareerat -- ubs -- analyst
okay. thank you very much. thanks for the color. have a good day, guys.
john t. greene -- executive vice president and chief financial officer

your next question comes from rick shane with jpmorgan.
rick shane -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions. mark really covered what i wanted to talk about in terms of reserves, but i'd just like to follow-up on that slightly. the observation was made that your reserve rate is about 2 points higher than it would have been on day one. day one was essentially an ideal economic environment, low unemployment, steady growth, etc. should we look at day one as a destination for where the reserve rate will go or more as a channel marker in terms of sort of an ideal operating environment?
john t. greene -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. good question. so the short answer is that it depends on the economic outlook and the portfolio performance. i would say, to give a kind of view on the marker, when we look at the reserve rate back in, call it, january 1, we're at just over 6%. we're at just over 8% now. that difference is about $1.7 billion of reserves on the current loan book. so if we have a level of confidence in the economic environment, portfolio continues to be positive. and the work we've done on analytics drive, i'll say, positive credit performance. there is an expectation in a benign environment that we should march back that way. so i think it's premature to say we'll get there. there's a lot of factors that could change. but i look at that day one as a marker for a solid credit environment and a relatively strong performing credit book.
rick shane -- jpmorgan -- analyst
great, ok. that's very helpful. thank you, guys.

your next question comes from bill carcache with wolfe research.
bill carcache -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks. good morning, roger and john.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
good morning.
john t. greene -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, good morning, bill.
bill carcache -- wolfe research -- analyst
can you guys help square the continued strength in customer acquisition that you expect on one hand with payment rates remaining low for an extended period on the other? you mentioned, i think, john, the end of the pandemic-related federal forbearance programs is somewhere is a catalyst for payment rate normalization. but why do you think payment rates will remain elevated after that support has ended?
john t. greene -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i'll start it and then maybe roger will add a couple of points on the back end. so certainly, if you look at, frankly, the projected gdp, that's above normal levels for a strong us economy, and that's as a result of, frankly, all of the activity and the transfer payments i talked about earlier. the -- i think there's a natural, i'll say, transition from where we are today to something that approaches historical norms. the savings rate is still high, but it's falling. and so that's positive. and in terms of overall sales activity versus payment rates, we do expect the sales levels at some point to moderate partly, because of year-over-year comps and partly, because of what's happening on economic activity.
but with that said, i would expect that payment rate, there's a bit of an inverse relationship. and what we're seeing from a growth standpoint is the sales activity, the new account acquisition, the payment rate is a bit of a headwind and then that revolve transactor rate aligning to payment rate. but despite all that, we've been able to grow from first quarter to second quarter. so as that payment rate moderates a bit, sales activity, i think, will be a lag to that. and we'll be well positioned to grow in the fourth quarter and beyond.
bill carcache -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. thank you. and if i may follow-up on that. as we look out to next year, would you expect that process of -- that you've described in the sort of this payment rate and revolve rate normalization, should that provide an incremental tailwind to loan growth such that we could actually see your loan growth start to outpace your spending growth?
john t. greene -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
2022 is still about six months away, five to six months away. so we're working on it right now. i'll tell you this, i'm positive in terms of how the business is positioned and what we can expect from a top line standpoint, as well as credit and expense. so those factors, i feel very good about, but to get into a level of specificity at this point, it's probably a bit early.
operator
your next question is from meng jiao with deutsche bank.
meng jiao -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi, guys. good morning and thanks for taking my questions. i wanted to [technical issues] student loans. as we head into the third quarter, it's probably the first time in over a year that probably many college students are on campus. i guess, are you doing anything differently in terms of how you're approaching the start of this particular school year? and sort of is it fair to say that marketing to students is going to be a large piece of that accelerating marketing spend that you guys have commented on?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
the third quarter is peak season for student loans, but all the marketing is done before they get to campus. volume was suppressed last year, because for many of our customers, we encourage them to take federal student loans and then use our private student loans to top off. and if their expenses were lower, because they're paying tuition, but not paying housing and food, etc, that had an impact on our volume. on the other hand, we did benefit last year from a major competitor pulling out of the marketplace. so i would say we're optimistic with kids going back on campus, that this will be a strong year for originations and that we will continue to gain market share in the student loan product.
meng jiao -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got you. great. and then secondly, i think you mentioned growing confidence in consumer. quarter to date, have you seen, i guess, a continued acceleration in that spending? i know we're roughly 22 days into the third quarter. and then secondly, roger, i think you [technical issues] are unsustainably high. i'm just curious if you had any further color as to when you expect that to sort of normalize? thank you.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
i'll start with that one. i think it will take a while to normalize. there is a good amount of pent-up demand, but also pent up liquidity in the form of the savings that have built up, as well as just the open to buy that people have on their cards from, sort of, month after month of pretty high payment rate. so i think that will provide some support.
on the other hand, a huge amount of uncertainty in terms of what will happen with the delta variants and other factors that can drive the economy. so we feel like we're well positioned, but unclear what the back half of the year will bring. in terms of what we're seeing so far this month, i would say travel continues to be constructive, but overall, not necessarily accelerating, but spend levels staying very strong.
operator
your next question is from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse.
moshe orenbuch -- credit suisse -- analyst
great, thanks. i guess getting back to the bnpl, is your primary kind of revenue or growth kind of opportunity in the sezzle on the lending side, is that the way we should think about it?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
no. you should think about it on the payment segment. so transaction processing revenue and sort of [technical issues] with payment processing and sort of connectivity to the merchant side. and so that's sort of -- our first entry into buy now, pay later has been more on the payment services segment as opposed to our direct banking side.
moshe orenbuch -- credit suisse -- analyst
got you. one of the things that you've talked about in the past about buy now, pay later is the question of whether it kind of encourages or discourages younger consumers from taking out a credit card. and i think you had said, either on the last call or one of the presentations, that because of student lending brand of discover that you haven't, kind of, seen that impact. could you just talk a little bit about how you think about the value, i guess, of the student lending in terms of kind of -- and in terms of that marketing of the discover brand?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
sure. we are very successful in the student card business. i think the student loans help, but also it has to do with the product, the value proposition and some very good marketing. and we see actually great credit performance from students, because contrary to popular belief, a lot of them are very responsible in how they handle their cards.
with student loans, i'd start by saying, we think it's a great business. it's profitable. i would say it is operationally complex, but it also gets our brand out there with parents, as well as students when they're making a series of financial decisions. so there are not that many banks that are in it at scale, not that many too that have sort of the product set that we have to be able to leverage those relationships. so it's a key part of our banking strategy.
moshe orenbuch -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. and just a quick follow-up on the reserving point. i guess, i was sort of wondering, if your reserves on day one included an expectation of a potential of a recession somewhere in the life of those receivables. just as you think about it as we kind of enter 2022, would that be a lower probability just given the experience that we've had or is that [technical issues] think about it?
john t. greene -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so when we did day one, we looked at through the cycle of use. so what essentially that means is, we didn't look at the trough of delinquencies and charge-offs nor did we look at peak. so to extremely oversimplify it, a bit of averaging with the help of a bunch of data scientists. so that day one is a, call it, a normalized view of the credit environment.

your next question comes from mihir bhatia with bank of america.
mihir bhatia -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, thank you for taking my questions and good morning.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
good morning.
mihir bhatia -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i wanted to ask -- i wanted to go back to your comment on competitive intensity, and it certainly does feel like cash back cards has increased. i think you alluded to intensity being a little higher than maybe the average historically. so maybe just talk a little bit more about the dimensions of this competition? is it spilling over beyond just higher direct rewards like the 1.5% or 2% rewards. are you seeing any irrational signing bonuses and productory offers, spend $5,000 in three months, get $100 off. anything irrational? are you seeing anything on the balance transfer side? how is discover responding to this increased competition? and is there -- is the increase in marketing spend in part, because of this elevated competition?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yes. so i'll start with the back half. the increase in marketing spend is driven really by the opportunity we see. so it is not by the competition. i do expect the cost per account to be modestly higher than, say, 2019 levels. 2020 was extraordinarily good. but part of that has to do with just booking more new accounts and the marginal ones tend to be more expensive. i do think some of the rewards products out there will not be sustainable long-term. you've seen 2% cash back offers come and go for a very long time, especially when we eventually get to a higher rate environment.
so far, balance transfer demand is still a bit suppressed. so we're not seeing the overly long 24-month 0% offers. you are starting to see some of those high spend $4,000, get $400 type offers from some of the issuers that i think are most aggressive around growth. but again, nothing that i would say we haven't seen before. it tends to be different people at different times. but this is part of the card business and what we're used to competing against.
mihir bhatia -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you. and then just -- i just wanted to ask about your debit product. any update on that? has that -- where are we -- is that being rolled out? is there thoughts to explain the marketing or push behind it? just any update on the debit product. thank you.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yes. so given the excess deposits we had, we really pulled back on the vast majority of our deposit marketing, including that product, but we're very excited about the differentiation having cash back. so we think we're well positioned against the challenger banks, as well as traditional banks. and so we'll continue to ramp it up, probably more so toward the back half of the year and as we get into 2022.
mihir bhatia -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, thank you.

your last question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley.
betsy graseck -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, thanks. so i just had two. one is on the marketing. i just wanted to make sure i understood what you meant by marketing expense anticipated return to 2019 levels. are you saying that the back half of '21 will be at a run rate similar to full-year 2019 or the back half of '21 is going to be similar to the quarterly run rate of 2019?
john t. greene -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so i think total year '21 to be similar to total year of '19.
betsy graseck -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes, ok.
john t. greene -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
that would require [technical issues] duration in the back half.
betsy graseck -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. okay. and then just separately on credit. i know a huge debate in the group here is around payment rates and how we're anticipating them to traject over the course of the next year or so. one other question specifically for you is that, if i recall correctly, you've got a homeowner sku to your box and home prices have clearly accelerated significantly, 15%, 20%, depending on the location. so i know you look at your customers routinely and check how they're doing financially. are you seeing any signs of your customer base having refi-ed and materially dropped their monthly mortgage payment requirements, which would potentially keep your payment rates elevated for longer or how you think about this refi cycle and what it means for your customers and their financial health and how that translates to payment rate for you? thanks.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yes. we have -- and this cuts across past cycles, we haven't seen a link between sort of a refi boom and card payment rates. and so i don't have any expectation that would happen this time.

operator
good afternoon. my name is ashley and i'll be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the third quarter 2021 discover financial services earnings conference call. [operator instructions] thank you.
and i will now turn the call over to mr. eric wasserstrom, head of investor relations. please go ahead.
eric wasserstrom -- head, investor relations
thank you, ashley, and good morning, everyone. welcome to today's call.
i'll begin on slide 2 of our earnings presentation which you can find in the financial section of our investor relations website, investorrelations.discover.com.
our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our third quarter earnings press release and presentation.
our call today will include remarks from our ceo, roger hochschild; and john greene, our chief financial officer. after we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for question-and-answer session. during the q&a session, we request that you ask one question, followed by one follow-up question, after your follow-up question, please return to the queue.
now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to roger.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
thank you, eric, and thanks for listeners, for joining today's call. we had another period of strong financial results in the third quarter, with earnings of $1.1 billion after-tax or $3.54 per share. in many respects, these results reflected the unique benefits of our integrated digital banking and payments model, which continues to be a source of significant competitive advantage by supporting our value proposition to consumers and merchants and differentiating our brand. these advantages enabled our continued investment in account acquisition, technology and analytics, while generating substantial capital in an environment characterized by new entrants and intensifying competition, we believe the strengths of our model position us to accelerate our growth. underlying our results this quarter were three important advancements.
the first was our return to year-over-year receivables growth, which is driven by our investment in acquisition and brand marketing and continued strong sales trends. total sales were up 27% over 2019 levels with strong momentum across all categories, even travel sales increased, and while they dropped a bit in august due to concerns related to the delta variant, travel has steadily improved since then. we also continue to see attractive opportunities for account acquisition and increased our marketing investments to take advantage of this. while the competitive environment has intensified, new accounts are now up 17% over 2019, reflecting the strength of our value proposition. this value proposition remains anchored in our industry-leading onshore customer service model, no annual fees and useful and transparent rewards. while some of our peers had to reinvigorate their rewards offerings and substantial cost, our rewards costs were up only 6 basis points year-over-year and nearly all of this increase was driven by higher consumer spending as evidenced in our strong discount revenue. given these dynamics, we will continue investing in new accounts, as long as the environment supports profitable opportunities and our robust account growth and our expectations for modest improvement in payment rates supports our view of stronger receivables growth in 2022.
the second key trend was credit, which remained exceptionally strong. our disciplined approach to credit management and favorable economic trends contributed to a record low net charge off rate and continued low delinquencies. the delinquency outlook affirmed our expectations that losses will be below last year's levels for the full-year and supported additional reserve releases during the quarter.
and third is the continued expansion of our payments business. pulse saw a meaningful increase in debit volume with 9% growth year-over-year and a 26% increase over the third quarter of 2019, demonstrating both the impact of the recovery and an increase in debit used through the pandemic. our diners business has also started to see some improvement from the global recovery with volume up 12% from the prior year as the global economy recovers, we will continue to look for opportunities to expand our international reach.
in summary, our value proposition continues to be attractive in our integrated digital banking and payments model supports profitable long-term customer relationships and is highly capital generative. i continue to feel very good about our prospects for future growth.
i'll now ask john to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail.thank you, roger, and good morning, everyone. once again, our results this quarter reflect strong execution and that continued economic recovery.
looking at our financial summary results on page 4, there are three key things i want to call out. first, our total revenue, net of interest expense is up 8% from the prior year, excluding $167 million unrealized loss due to market adjustments on our equity investments. including this, revenue is up 2% for the quarter. second, is a continuation of very strong credit performance. net charge-offs were down $343 million from the prior year, which supported a $165 million reserve release this quarter.
lastly, we continue investing for growth, with increased marketing spend, higher operating expenses and other areas were largely related to the economic recovery. i'll go over the details of our quarterly results and our full-year outlook on the following slides.
looking at loan growth on slide 5. we saw the return to growth this quarter with ending loans up 1% over the prior year and up 2% sequentially. card loans were the primary driver and we're also up 1% year-over-year and 2% over the prior quarter. the year-over-year increase in card receivables was driven by strong sales volume and robust account acquisition. sales growth continued to accelerate and was up 27% over the third quarter of 2019. year-to-date, new accounts were up 27% from the prior year and up 17% over 2019 levels. the contribution from these factors was mostly offset by the ongoing high payment rates as household savings and cash flows remain elevated. the payment rate was approximately 500 basis points over pre-pandemic levels. we anticipate that the payment rate will moderate a bit as most federal covid support programs have ended and consumer savings rates have started to decrease. that said, we expect payment rates to remain above historical levels through 2022.
looking at our other lending products. organic student loans increased 4% from the prior year with originations up 7% as most schools have returned to the normal in-person learning model. personal loans decreased 4% driven by high payment rates. our underwriting criteria have returned to pre-pandemic levels and we expect a return to growth in this product in future periods.
moving to slide 6, net interest margin was 10.8%, up 61 basis points from the prior year and 12 basis points from the prior quarter. compared to the prior quarter, the increase in net interest margin was primarily driven by lower interest charge-offs and lower funding costs. this was partially offset by a higher mix of promotional rate balances.
card loan yield was up 1 basis point sequentially as lower interest charge-offs were offset by the increased promotional balance mix. yield on personal loans declined 15 basis points sequentially due to lower pricing. the margin continued to benefit from lower funding costs primarily driven by maturities of higher rate cds and an increased mix of lower rate savings and money market balances. average consumer deposits were flat year-over-year and declined 1% from the prior quarter. the quarter-over-quarter decline was largely driven by consumer cds. we also saw a slight decline in savings and money market deposits as consumers continue to spend excess levels of liquidity.
we also continue to optimize our funding stack. late in september, we executed our first abs issuance since october 2019 consisting of a $1.2 billion security with a three-year fixed rate coupon of 58 basis points and a five-year $600 million security with a fixed coupon of 103 basis points. these were our lowest abs coupons ever and show good execution in timing by our treasury team.
looking at revenue on slide 7. total non-interest income increased $90 million or 20% over the prior year excluding the unrealized loss on equity investments. net discount and interchange revenue was up $61 million or 26% driven by strong sales volume. this was partially offset by increased rewards costs due to high sales in the 5% category, which was restaurants and paypal, both this year and last. we continue to benefit from strong sales through our partnership with paypal, while restaurant sales were up 62% year-over-year as dining activity recovered. loan fee income was up $21 million or 21%, primarily driven by lower late fee charge-offs and higher non-sufficient funds and cash advance fees.
looking at slide 8. total operating expenses were up $185 million or 18% from the prior year. the details reflect our focus on investing for future growth while managing our operating cost. employee compensation increased $12 million driven by a higher bonus accrual in the current year. excluding bonuses, employee compensation was down 3% from their prior year from lower headcount. marketing expense increased $70 million supporting another quarter of strong new account growth. other expense included a $50 million legal accrual. professional fees were up $47 million, primarily due to higher recovery fees. courts reopening combined with strong credit and economic conditions have driven an increase in recoveries and their associated fees. year-to-date, recoveries were up 20% compared to the prior year. the benefits of these cost is reflected in lower credit losses.
moving to slide 9. the trend of sustained strong credit performance continued. total net charge-offs were a record low at 1.46%, down 154 basis points year-over-year and 66 basis points sequentially. total net charge dollars decreased $343 million from their prior year and were down $131 million quarter-over-quarter. credit performance was strong across all products, as evidenced by the net charge-off rates on card, private student loans and personal loans.
moving to the allowance for credit losses on slide 10. this quarter, we released $165 million from reserves and our reserve rate dropped 35 basis points to 7.7%. the reserve release reflects continued strong credit performance. and a largely stable macroeconomic outlook. the impact of these was partially offset by a 2% increase in loans from the prior quarter. our economic assumptions include an unemployment rate of approximately 5.5% by year-end and gdp growth of just over 6%. these assumptions were slightly less positive to no issues in the second quarter, but still reflect a strong economic outlook.
looking at slide 11. our common equity tier 1 for the period was 15.5%, well above our 10.5% target. we repurchased $815 million of common stock and as we had previously announced, increased our dividend payable by 14% to $0.50 per share. these actions reflect our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. on funding, we continue to make progress toward our goals of having deposits be 70% to 80% of our funding mix. deposits now make up 68% of total funding, up from 62% in the prior year.
wrapping up on slide 12. our outlook for 2021 has not changed and reflects continued strong execution against our financial and strategic objectives. in summary, we remain well positioned for profitable growth from improving loan trends. credit performance trends remain favorable, reflecting positive macroeconomic conditions and our approach to underwriting and credit management. investments for growth have supported a significant increase in new accounts while we've contained operating expenses. lastly, our integrated digital banking and payment model is highly capital generative allowing us to invest for growth and return capital to shareholders. we look forward to providing our outlook for 2022 on our conference call in january.
with that, i'll turn the call back to our operator, ashley, to open the lines for q&a.

[operator instructions] and we'll take our first question from john pancari with evercore isi. please go ahead.
john pancari -- evercore isi -- analyst
good morning. i want to see if you can give us a little more color on your payment rate expectations. i know you expecting to remain elevated through 2022, but just wanted to see if you're starting to see signs of account that typically revolve, starting to see some declines of payment rates there. and then, i guess, how material of an inflection you think we can see through 2022 or do you think that's not likely until 2023? thanks.
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
great. all right. thanks for the question. so, the payment rate has been persistently high and what we did see in the month of september was that ticked down mildly. it did increase from july to august which was frankly a bit of a surprise. but as i look at the data we're seeing here in terms of revolve and then the forecasted trends, my expectation is that, in the fourth quarter, it will continue to step down. some of that has to do with governments support programs ending in september and some of it has to do with the holiday season. and then as we look on the holiday season into 2022, i do expect that it will continue to step toward a normalized rate. but frankly, i don't think that will happen until 2023. so how do we think about the implications from that? certainly, the payment rate is a bit of a headwind to growth. but what we've seen is really strong account acquisition and strong sales growth, which to date has helped offset some of that payment rate impact. so overall, we feel very, very comfortable with that '20 -- the balance of 2021 and then 2022 will have a bit of tailwind related to both payment rates declining and then strong execution from the new accounts and sales growth.
john pancari -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. okay. thanks, john. and then, on the account acquisition front, i know you indicated that you expect marketing costs to be higher in the second half. so if you can give us a little bit more detail around your expectation there and how they could trend for the fourth quarter? and then, does that imply that you could see some continued upside pressure into 2022 on marketing as you drive account acquisition in light of pressured payment rates?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. yeah. so, from a marketing standpoint, we spend the money as we see opportunity to drive profitable new accounts. and frankly, we've had a great quarter and a great year with that. the third quarter spend actually came in mildly lower than what we originally anticipated, and the guidance i had provided on the last call was that we would approximate the 2019 levels of total marketing expense. i think it will be a little bit under that -- bit under that, largely not because of opportunities, but basically kind of some process oriented stuff in terms of account targeting. so we feel like the money we'll spend in the fourth quarter will certainly generate positive new account growth. it will pick up from the third quarter, certainly, and provide us a good trajectory for 2022.
john pancari -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions.
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer

and we'll take our next question from ryan nash with goldman sachs. please go ahead. your line is open.
ryan nash -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey. good morning, everyone.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
morning.
ryan nash -- goldman sachs -- analyst
roger, you talked about intense competition and the impact of new entrants. can you maybe just expand on those points about what you're seeing competitively, how you think discover is positioned for it? and where do you believe this is having the biggest impact on your business and how are you responding for it? thanks.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
sure. thanks for the question. yeah. i think my actual comment was good growth in the face of intense competition, and i think that really sums it up well. the competition in the card business is always intense. we were lucky enough to have a lapse in 2020. and so, we saw extraordinarily good cost per account. but it's what we're used to pacing. it will vary based on which issuers are refreshing their cards or have more of a desire -- the growth for growth than others. but i think our focus on a clear differentiated value proposition has resulted in continued strong generation of new accounts. and i'm excited about what i see.
in terms of the new entrants, we see that less in the core credit card space. but i would say, very, very aggressive competition around personal loans, and that's an area where we focused on the long-term remain disciplined in our underwriting and what we're willing to invest in new accounts and are used to seeing competitors come and go.
ryan nash -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. and if i could ask a follow-up question to the question john asked prior. so, john, in terms of marketing, with the level you'd be hitting in the fourth quarter as it steps up a little bit, is -- should we think about that as a go-forward run rate? are there more investment that needed to be made?
and then second, there was comments about dts increasing and as it relates to marketing, can you maybe just help us understand where are we today versus pre-pandemic levels? and what is the strategy to continue to increase balance transfer activity on the go-forward basis? thank you.
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
sure. on the marketing spend, that will be determined based on the opportunities we see. as we look at 2022, we do see a continued benign credit environment and frankly, as very strong opportunity to drive profitable new account growth. so, as that opportunity continues to persist, we'll continue to spend marketing dollars. so what i would suggest is, we concentrate here on 2021 and then in the january call we'll talk about 2022 in terms of the opportunities there. but i'll leave you with this point that, the fourth quarter trajectory should help inform what we intended to spend in 2022.
in terms of balance transfers, we did see a impact from some of the increased balance transfers that we executed in early part of 2021 in the third quarter in terms of a mild impacts to margin. we will continue to take a look at that space and see what we can generate profitably. it's been a good source of account acquisition for us historically and we'll continue to remain disciplined and put those prime revolver accounts on the accounts transfer.
ryan nash -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions.
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, ryan.
operator
and we'll take our next question from don fandetti with wells fargo. please go ahead.
donald fandetti -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hi. good morning. i guess, roger, a little bit of a longer-term question around your debit business. it seems like we're going to have direct-to-bank payments in the united states over time. and there's a lot going on, paypal potentially buying pinterest. can you talk about how you see debit evolving over the long-term? and are there any implications given that you own a network?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
sure, great question. there are always, i would say, new payment schemes and methods out there, a lot of them though tend to rely on existing payment. so you think about when apple launched their wallet, even paypal, the vast majority of their volume is process through existing payment networks. and debit processing is incredibly complex and quite frankly, very low margin and very efficient. as you look at how sort of the three major debit networks us, mastercard and visa operate. and right now, given the interchange caps a lot of banks have the economics for them are relatively thin. so, while we look at what the fed might be proposing, what goes on in other markets, i don't see anything in the near or even medium-term that it looks like it has the potential and quite frankly, you're starting to see an increase in volume on the debit side, even a lot of buy now pay later players are leveraging debit for their payments.
donald fandetti -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
you don't see debit really going away per se and being replaced by direct to account payments in the us?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
no. the risk management of payments is quite complex in terms of both fraud and identity. there are a lot of processes and controls the major networks have in place. there is a robust ecosystem. if you think about point of sale devices, merchant acquirers. and so, to think that that will change suddenly, i see it as a low probability.
donald fandetti -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and we'll take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
betsy graseck -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. hey, roger, just following up on that, is there an opportunity for you to take your debit network and debit capabilities and expand it into that new, i wouldn't called, new, i guess, but into that revitalized interest in debit that we're seeing?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yeah. a great question, betsy. certainly, we have a unique set of network assets and provide connectivity to merchants, whether through proxy card numbers or a series of other technologies and work closely with a number of fintechs around that. so that's at the core of some of what we do with sezzle. actually, that was the beginning of our relationship with marqeta many, many years ago and there are a lot of others that are either in the market now or that we're in discussions with. so, i think that the pulse and the debit assets we have combined with our signature network or an advantage that we look to monetize.
betsy graseck -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. and then, as we're thinking about the dance that's coming over the next couple of years between loan growth and credit normalization. can you help us understand how you're thinking about managing that trajectory? because what i heard earlier in the call is, you've been getting more and more efficient at account acquisition, right, part of your marketing spend coming in lower-than-expected or at least lower than consensus than we expected is a function of you doing something. i don't know, if it's cloud or technology or what to get more efficient at account targeting and account acquisition. so, on the one hand, you've got that running in a very positive direction, you talked about the payment rates being a little bit of a headwind to monetizing that. but at the same time, we've got credit normalizing. so is there an opportunity for you to pull levers on marketing to generate some more loan growth? or is it more likely to come from the personal loan side or the student loan side as credits normalizing, how should we think about how you're managing that?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. hey, betsy, i'll take this one. so, there is a lot to that question. so let me just give a view in terms of what we're seeing as we closed out the third quarter. so, as i mentioned, the payment rate is stepping down and from august to september, we expect that to continue. that will help certainly drive loan growth. my sense is today that there is a relationship between payment rate and sales activity. so, the persistently high payment rate i think has driven sales activity across the industry now we benefited, i would say, slightly disproportionately in terms of driving incremental sales, partly due to the acquisition point you mentioned. so, there's two dynamics, but third dynamic is credit normalizing and my sense is that, credit normalization will continue through 2022 into 2023. so today, where i sit, i'm positive on credit. so, those factors in the aggregate in addition to the point you mentioned in terms of account targeting, i think position us pretty well in 2022 for positive loan growth, not -- the specifics will come a little bit later in january when we give our view, but we're all positive on that front today.
betsy graseck -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. and could you touch on what was driving that account acquisition being more efficient? you mentioned the process-oriented improvement. so what specifically you're talking about there?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
so, betsy, it's roger again. a lot of the enhancements we're seeing are leveraging the advanced analytics. and so, that's really helping both on the underwriting side with sort of swap in swap outs, as well as better targeting, combined with investments we're making from beginning to end in the martech stack. and we think those are already serving us well. but there is also plenty of upside as we continue to focus on that area.
betsy graseck -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. all right. thank you.
operator
and we'll take our next question from bill carcache with wolfe research. please go ahead.
bill carcache -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you. good morning, roger, and john. i wanted to follow up on your conviction in a more robust loan growth in 2022, if we were going to get even just modest mid-single-digit spending growth next year, do you think the incremental tailwind from payment rate normalization could be enough to support double-digit loan growth? and just to clarify on this point, did you say earlier, john, that you think we could see payment rates get back to sort of normalized maybe 2019 levels by the end of 2023? is that a reasonable expectation?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
so 2023 is horizon that we're looking at for payment rate to normalize and when that happens we expect savings rate to return to normalized levels. so, one view is continue to watch the savings rate and that should help inform payment rate and that's frankly one of the metrics we look at.
in terms of robust loan growth in 2022, let me just put it this way here because we're going to hold off until january on providing explicit detail, but the new account originations has been important for growth. sales activity has been important for growth. the payment rate, as i mentioned in the prepared remarks, has been a headwind, not completely unanticipated. we did see it mildly higher than what we had modeled, but we're still on track for delivering the loan growth that we talked about for 2021. 2022 it will be informed by all of those factors and shared, bill, with more -- in more detail in january.
bill carcache -- wolfe research -- analyst
understood. thanks. if i can follow-up on a separate question on bnpl risk. yes, there is a group on one side that thinks that it's largely customers who can't qualify for credit and are just using bnpl to turn their debit cards into credit cards. and we've heard the ceo of sezzle, which we know is one of your partners sort of speak to that point. and then there is another group that is more concerned about the competitive threat posed by certain bnpl players that do longer-term instalment lending and the risk that they'll even to margins and pricing over time. can you frame for us how you're thinking about the competitive threat? and now that you've had a little bit more time to study, what's happening with the different bnpl players?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
sure. so, i'll start with the -- we've always had more time to study it. i would say, the market is not yet mature. and i think market clearing economics have yet to be established. part of the challenge is, there are many segments within buy now pay later from the people financing a multi-thousand dollar purchase, which by the way they've done for years in terms of traditional sales finance versus sort of more spreading out payments on $60 worth of cosmetic. so those segments all have different characteristics. certainly, at the lower end, there are many customers who are either debit preferring or do not have access to significant amounts of credit. but i think you'll continue to see it evolve. you're starting to see some pressure from merchants who are unwilling to pay take rates above what they pay in card. so, right now we certainly see opportunity on the payment side, as i talked about earlier, leveraging our assets. over time we think there may be opportunity for us as an issuer and again, partially leveraging our unique model, and our proprietary network. but right now, i would say, we are not seeing any noticeable impact on revolving loans and believe that we are well positioned to respond if it does emerge.
bill carcache -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks, roger, and john. appreciate you're taking my questions.
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer

and we'll take our next question from sanjay sakhrani with kbw. please go ahead.
sanjay sakhrani -- keefe bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
thanks. good morning. i wanted to follow up on some ryan's questions on competition. i guess, roger, when you think about the competitive landscape on a go-forward basis, if you looked at the post-financial crisis period, a lot of that competition was transactor-oriented, like people going up transactor customers. do you think this time is going to be a bit different given what unfolded last time? or do you think that it's all going to be the same? i'm just curious as you think about how you're setting up competitively.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
so sanjay, i am lucky enough to be able to look back over multiple cycles of competition and it has varied, everything from sort of an intense focus across the board on prime revolvers to transactors. i think, certainly, american express will stay focused on that spend-based model. a lot of banks focus on those transactors because they are very profitable customers, not so much in card, but in other segments of the business. the prime revolver space has historically been the most challenging in terms of what it requires from a value proposition and underwriting. for transactors, it's really about rolling out rich rewards program. so, we expect to see competition across the spectrum, but what impacts us most will be that in the prime revolver space.
sanjay sakhrani -- keefe bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
and you don't see any of that really intensifying relative to what you anticipated? i mean, it's pretty consistent.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yeah. i would say, it's an intensified significantly since sort of the lull during the pandemic, but it's now getting back to, i would say, more normalized levels.
sanjay sakhrani -- keefe bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
got it. and then, john, just one follow-up on nim. i know we're not talking about next year's guidance until next quarter. but just broadly speaking, as we sit here today with your nim pretty high levels is to relative to history. as the growth comes, do you envision that to be a tailwind for the nim? or does that start counteracting some of this because the bt rates increase? i'm just curious sort of how we should think about the progression going forward. thanks.
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, sanjay. so, if you go back and look at nim historically, you'll see that it was subjected to, frankly, higher funding costs from unsecured term debt. what we've tried to do is, sore up the liability side of the balance sheet, so targeting 70%, 80% based on or from deposits. and then the rest combination of secured and unsecured security offerings. so, that will create stability in terms of the funding cost. in terms of pluses and minuses to the revenue line, what we'll say is, some bt-related impacts to nim. you'll see credit, if it does normalize a bit of credit normalization in terms of nim, but you'll also see that sustained impact from funding i just talked about. so we're looking at nim to be higher than what we've experienced historically and we're going to compare 2021 how we ended -- end the year in terms of the balance sheet position and see how that impacts 2022. but overall, i would say, the funding position has created more stability and a economic benefit to investors.
sanjay sakhrani -- keefe bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
understood. thank you.

and we'll take our next question from mihir bhatia with bank of america. please go ahead.
mihir bhatia -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning and thank you for taking my question. maybe to start, if you could just clarify a little bit on the marketing expense guidance, i guess, maybe for the fourth quarter. i understand you don't want to talk about 2022 yet, but just for the fourth quarter. when you talk about marketing expense relative to 2019 levels, are you talking on a quarterly basis or fourth quarter is we're looking at $235-ish million? i understand you may not want to give exact numbers, but should we be thinking on a quarterly basis or on a full-year basis just given the back up in the first three quarters of the year, that would be a pretty big increase versus on a quarterly basis? so just want to make sure you clarify that. thank you.
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
so, thanks. so we -- when we reference 2019, we're talking a full-year basis. so then that would force folks to do a little bit of math on the third quarter and fourth quarter. we came in lower in the third quarter than we anticipated. fourth quarter, we expect it will increase from the $210 million. so to, frankly, remove some ambiguity on this. so it will be somewhere in the range of $220 million to, call it, $280 million.
mihir bhatia -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. thank you. and then...
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
i hesitate to give that level of specificity, but given the confusion i just wanted to put it away.
mihir bhatia -- bank of america -- analyst
sure. and we appreciate that. just -- maybe just taking a step back on the credit side and just longer-term consumer credit performance. i think you underwrite new accounts. can you just talk about what kind of through the cycle loss rate assumptions we are making? i guess, what i'm really trying to understand is, what is the normalized loss rate for your credit card portfolio as you think about longer-term?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yeah. so what i would confirm is, we do use a through the cycle loss rate and so do not use current losses, but that's not something we disclose.
mihir bhatia -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. thank you.
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer

and we'll take our next question from arren cyganovich with citi. please go ahead.
arren cyganovich -- citigroup -- analyst
thanks. the pace of spending by your card holders accelerated a little bit in 3q relative to 2019. is that consistent through the quarter or did it show any signs of rising or falling in terms of the cadence there?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
we have seen ups and downs, in particular, we talked about a bit of a soft thing around travel, that occurred in august. and i think that was driven by a lot of what was going on with the pandemic. but we continue to see very robust sales volume, even continuing into october.
arren cyganovich -- citigroup -- analyst
okay. thanks. and then, the comments on the personal loan pricing and competitive pressures there, is that mainly from new entrants in the market? we're seeing a lot of different types of personal loan models coming to market in the past couple of years. is that something that you would expect to continue as a competitive pressure going forward? or is this more of a just marketing down relative to where the existing book was?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
a lot of it is coming into from new entrants. personal loans are probably the easiest to fund outside of a bank. and have the easiest servicing requirements. and so, it's where a lot of the new entrants will go with new models. we are a disciplined, both on credit, but as well as pricing and we'll not go below the targeted returns we want to hit. a lot of times that will flush its way through when they either don't get the performance that they want to see or have other challenges. you do get sometimes prioritizing growth over returns but that tends not to last for too long.
arren cyganovich -- citigroup -- analyst

and we'll take our next question from mark devries with barclays. please go ahead.
mark devries -- barclays -- analyst
yeah, thanks. i just had a question about what you're seeing in the student lending space? and one of your competitors has noted some headwinds in the quarter. just how is that shaping up?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
so we feel pretty good about peak season volumes were up roughly 7% year-over-year and we believe that we gained share, although we're still sort of processing. so, clearly, it's -- we saw one major competitor step back last year. but we're very excited about that market. we underwrite it in a very disciplined way and it's a great way to get a really good product in our brand in front of the next-generation of prime card holders.
mark devries -- barclays -- analyst
okay. got it. and then just a follow-up question on pulse, as you know, you had some pretty strong volumes there. roger, is there a point at which you start to get some meaningful scale benefits and the earnings contribution from that becomes more meaningful and grows faster than the volumes?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
we would love to increase the percent of our earnings that comes out of the payment segment. i think one of the challenges we also are working pretty hard to increased earnings from our banking segment. so we're not standing still there either. it's -- while we're excited about pulse, it's also very competitive. we're battling for routing at the merchant level with visa, mastercard, day in day out. we've seen a lot of growth from -- expanding from traditional pin debit to card-not-present. and so, that's been particularly helpful. but we're very focused on growing that business.
mark devries -- barclays -- analyst
okay. got it. thank you.

and we'll take our next question from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse. please go ahead.
moshe orenbuch -- credit suisse -- analyst
great, thanks. maybe just to come back to the new account acquisition, is there -- in particularly in card, is there a way to talk about either if there are any different channels that you're using or what's the nature of the consumer? is there any differences in the type of consumer that you're seeing?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
not really, moshe. i don't think we've seen anything dramatic since prior to the pandemic. clearly, the continued migration to digital channels, direct mail becomes a smaller and smaller piece, but that's been a trend for many years now. so we continue -- we are fine-tuning the digital channels. i guess, what we've seen is a greater ability to measure the results of top of funnel spend. as it shifts more digital, when that spend moves from tv to even video that's online, you can do a better job with tracking an attribution. and so, we are repositioning how we spend and that's one of the areas we're leveraging some of our advanced analytics.
moshe orenbuch -- credit suisse -- analyst
got you. thank you. and as you mentioned kind of using balance transfer as part of this, can you talk a little bit about anything you can share with us in terms of whether they're all at zero or are there some that are at yields above zero? and any kind of update on what you've seen in terms of retention of those balances?
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
sure. so, probably one of the bigger trends, there was a real collapse in balance transfer demand during the pandemic.clearly, a lot of issuers were pulling back on credit line increases. but i think consumers were much more focused on paying down their debt versus moving it around. so you saw softening in demand for personal loans and balance transfers, that starting to come back. for us, a lot of our acquisition offers are at 0%. the portfolio offers tend to either be above zero or have a fee that provides a pretty effective yield, and as john pointed out, for most of those, we see a very high return from the balance transfer itself given this funding environment, as well as a good percent sticking. and that's something we model very carefully.
moshe orenbuch -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks very much.

and we'll take our next question from dominick gabriele with oppenheimer. please go ahead.
dominick gabriele -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
thank you so much for taking my questions. i guess, if we just think about the comments around the economic outlook getting for early assumptions around your economic outlook becoming a slightly worse from the third quarter -- from the second quarter to the third quarter, but then being incrementally positive into 2022 credit trends. can you just square those two pieces together?
john t. greene -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. happy to dominick. so, when we modeled in the second quarter, frankly, they -- the economists saw a higher level of gdp growth and employment returning to normalized levels sooner. and when we updated those, the gdp has come down, employment returning to normalized levels pushed a bit. so that was one of multiple inputs. we provide that detail because it's -- frankly the most transparent that the people can take a look at to get a view of how we're thinking about the reserves.
now, the other items that are important in terms of our thinking here in the third quarter was: first, the portfolio performance and it's been super strong; second was the ending of many of the government support programs related to covid. so most of those ended in august and september. what we'd like to do is, see some seasoning of the impacts of those into the fourth quarter and perhaps even in the first quarter next year if what we expect is that, the impact of that seasoning will be very, very mild on the portfolio and the broad macros continue to look favorable, there is enough kind of points of reference that would lead us to begin to step the reserves back to day one. but a lot of things need to happen and we ended up where we were in the third quarter. we ran through multiple models, multiple scenarios and we got comfortable with where we were to make sure the balance sheet was fairly stated. but we do see that the broad macros out into the future are positive. so we'll see how they sustain and make a call in the fourth quarter and in 2022.
dominick gabriele -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
great. thanks for that. and if you all think about how the hierarchy of products that you have, as well as across the consumer space for normalization on which products could normalize perhaps, let's just -- i don't know, to even maybe 2019 levels, nco rates. are there certain products you would expect to normalize either faster than other products? or any color you can provide along the trajectory of one product versus the other, given what you're seeing in your customer base would be awesome? thank you so much.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yeah. that's a difficult thing to do in that -- it will be subject to the economic environment. so, we know historically, right, if there is a period of tougher financial situation, the personal loans will be the ones that get the least priority in terms of payment. credit cards tend to be high. the student loans, given the long duration of those contracts, they don't seem to gyrate as much with the economic outputs, plus that so much of our portfolios co-signed that it provides additional coverage there. so you get to kind of personal loans subject to the economic environment and then the card. my sense is the card has been prioritized in terms of the payment hierarchy because of what has happened in terms of cash in the digital environment, it's really difficult to shop without a card these days. so i look for stability there.
dominick gabriele -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
great. thanks so much. i appreciate it.

and our final question will come from bill ryan with seaport research. please go ahead.
bill ryan -- seaport global securities -- analyst
thank you and good morning. a couple of questions. one on the personal loans business, i believe you've been in the business since 2007, a lot of new entrants in the marketplace today. you kind of talked about it. but i was our member, two-thirds of your book is roughly from the existing discover credit card file, but the other third historically coming from the other place out of market or out of your existing file. as far as the underwriting you're seeing from the new entrants, you kind of talked a little bit about it, but i was wondering if you could take a little bit more granular approach to it and talk about, are they making compromises relative to what you're willing to do on credit, payment income, yield verification, all the above?
and second, just kind of going back to the bonus accruals. a lot of companies are stepping up bonuses, employee retention efforts. is this something we should kind of view as transitory one time? or might this transfer into a little bit higher compensation expense going into next year? thanks.
roger c. hochschild -- director, chief executive officer and president
yeah. i'll start with the bonus accrual. we haven't made any changes to our bonus program. so, to the extent there are changes in bonus accrual, it just reflects far stronger financial performance this year versus last year and then how that translates.
in terms of personal loan space, it is very hard to get line of sight into the practices of these companies and there are many of them. we've seen them come and go over multiple cycles. in general, i would say, they tend to have fewer manual or labor-intensive processes. so, i'd be surprised if they did the extent of employment verification we do. and again, it might be appropriate, if their average ticket is lower. they may have different return profiles. the one thing i would say, the vast majority lend to a much broader spectrum than we do. and so, we focus on the prime segment, again, primarily debt consolidation, but it is hard to generalize across the many different new entrants that may have different models.
bill ryan -- seaport global securities -- analyst
okay. thank you.
eric wasserstrom -- head, investor relations
