[operator instructions] our first question will come from don carson of susquehanna. please go ahead.
don carson -- susquehanna -- analyst
thank you. john, in your prerelease, you talked about some weakness in chlorine volumes as well, obviously ags continue to weak, but what are you in some of these other markets like refrigerants and tio2? any uptick? and maybe just talk about edc demand and price outlook for the second half?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
okay. in terms of -- if you look at our chlorine demand historically, it is always been the strongest in q3. and i would same as it relates to both tio2 and refrigerants, which we saw fairly weak in the first half, we have seen some seasonal uptick in both of those. i'll let jim just comment on edc.
james a. varilek -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
this is jim. from edc standpoint, i think the demand is actually been pretty solid throughout the first half, and we expect that to continue into the second half. what we're seeing in the marketplace actually is, there is a broadened demand for edc a long time ago. 18 months, 2 years ago, it used to be predominantly asia. but in the last 1.5 year, we've seen demand increase in southern europe. we've seen in also increase in middle east, north africa as well and then, of course, most recently in latin america. so demand is solid, if we remain constructive on edc.
don carson -- susquehanna -- analyst
and then as a follow-up. on slide 20, you show significant leverage to lower nat gas and ethane cost and price of those been coming down, what benefit did you see from that? if any in the first half giving you hedging position? and how do you see that contributing to earnings growth in the second half?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i would say, generally, we are a hedger as it relates to gas, predominantly. and that some of the benefit was tempered, but it will just be delayed in our system. and we have been benefiting, and you see that in terms of the profitability of our edc from the lower ethane prices, although a lot of that has occurred just fairly recently.
operator
next, we have kevin mccarthy of vertical research.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research -- analyst
good morning. just a follow-up on edc. i was wondering if you could comment on the level of edc prices that is baked into your financial guidance for 2019. we've noticed some weakness over the last 2 months-or-so and just would like to understand, kind of, what you're assuming in terms of the sequential pattern there?
james a. varilek -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yes. from an edc standpoint, there has been some movement that we've seen in asia, and i think that's because of low ethylene pricing that's taking place. so you probably are hearing and seeing some of the spot volumes that are moving to asia that have reduced some numbers. what i would say is that, as i mentioned earlier, what we're seeing in the marketplace, olin doesn't have to participate. specifically in asia, we have a broad-based participation and a significant amount of our volume for the third quarter and into the fourth quarter has already been preplaced at contractual pricing. so we're going to be somewhat -- we'll see somewhat muted effect relative to that spread.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research -- analyst
and then as a second question, i think, you indicated in your press release that your average realized pricing for caustic soda declined 3% in 2q versus 1q. just wondering if it's possible to provide a similar #4, the chlorine side of the molecule, including derivatives, what was your average price experience there?
james a. varilek -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
i will tell you that on the chlorine side itself, chlorine is actually up year-over-year. so the derivatives get very messy, because mix gets into the play, but i think you can look at the big derivatives which are -- with the bleach that just takes chlorine and moves it through and chlorinated organics and chlorine moves through. so those would have a positive trend. i would say the other derivative is hcl which is much more market-driven and that has tended to be lower year-over-year at this point. but still, if you look at hcl from our perspective, it's still a value-add compared to selling merchant chlorine.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research -- analyst
just to clarify, were prices stable on a sequential basis versus 1q?
todd a. slater -- chief financial officer and vice president
kevin, this is todd. if you go back to slide 19, you will see, virtually, all prices were similar. q1 versus q2, except for caustic and hcl.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
next, we have eric petrie of citi.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
good morning.
james a. varilek -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
morning.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
you noted that in your second half from the first half guidance that pricing could contribute roughly $15 million. of that, how much is caustic soda represents, chlorine derivatives or any pricing uptick that you think you will realize in epoxy?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we have not broken that out. i would just say as with most of our portfolio, caustic is roughly half of our volume. so it's probably represents half of the price.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
okay. helpful. and then by region, could you talk about your customer caustic soda inventories, at least in europe, it seems that stocks remains elevated year-over-year on a historical basis. so with prices seemingly trussing and bottoming out at this level, i wonder if you could talk about potential restocking in second half.
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i guess, i would say, from the standpoint of inventories, we don't pay that much attention to europe other than i could tell you that for the year 2019, exports from europe to north america are down. i would also tell you that exports out of china are also down. so we think that we're going to continue to see -- we're going to see benefiting -- continue to see benefit overtime from a tightening market.
operator
next, we have michael leithead of barclays.
michael leithead -- barclays -- analyst
good morning. following on the last question, so if i sort of build a half-over-half ebitda bridge, pricing is going to give us $50 million, turnarounds are going to give us another $25 million, and i think in your preannouncement, you called out $20 million in epoxy items. so if i math is right, that leaves us around $115 million gaap that in terms of hitting the guidance. i'm assuming that's mostly volume that's going to get us there?
todd a. slater -- chief financial officer and vice president
that's correct.
michael leithead -- barclays -- analyst
okay. and since you bought the dow business 4 years ago, what has historically been the seasonal volume split between the first half and the second half?
todd a. slater -- chief financial officer and vice president
if you just look at ebitda between first half and second half for the 3-year average of '16, '17 and '18, we've averaged about 45% of our ebitda in the first half, 55% in the second half, but it's been as low as 41% to 42%. so, i would say, what we're forecasting is not way out of line what we've seen historically.
michael leithead -- barclays -- analyst
but i guess, just one last one. you've seen a massive caustic upcycle over the past 3 or 4 years, so the second half has just benefited from higher price over the past 3 years versus that first half this year. so i'm assuming pricing skus some of the ebitda benefit. so i guess, that's why i was asking the volume side, what has that split in?
todd a. slater -- chief financial officer and vice president
well, let me give you -- i'll give you 3 statistics, because the biggest -- the 3 biggest things that benefit for us in terms of first half versus second half. the first is bleach, which is seasonal. and it's not the biggest of the businesses, but historically that has been up somewhere in the 15% to 20% range, first half to second half, and that's not cyclical. and in fact, as hard as it was in july, that's actually positive in terms of the comparison. the second has been our vinyls business, and that over the prior 3 years has averaged about a 5% to 7% improvement, first half versus second half. and then we have some large pipeline customers, who are predominantly related to the polyurethanes path and that has historically been up about 15% in the second half versus the first half. and a lot of that just has to do with the timing and turnarounds, but we typically take our turnaround when our customers do. so there is 3 big pieces.
michael leithead -- barclays -- analyst
that's super helpful. thank you.
operator
next, we have jim sheehan of suntrust.
jim sheehan -- suntrust -- analyst
morning thanks for taking my question. can you address your chlor alkali vinyls to demand declines in the quarter? you said down 4%. it seems to be well below gdp or industrial production rates. is this an impact of trade and tariffs or something else?
james a. varilek -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
jim, this is jim. no, it's not a result of the trade tariffs or anything. we mentioned some of the weakness on the chlorine side of things, chlorinated organics, refrigerants and the agricultural market that impacts us and obviously that -- when you have that demand on the chlorine side, its both side of the eta. that's primarily what we're talking about in terms of the volume declines.
jim sheehan -- suntrust -- analyst
okay. and in epoxy, you talked about tight chloro hydrant conditions supply/demand may be resulting in upward pricing for epoxy and liquid epoxy resin pricing. do you think that tightness is enough to offset some of the demand weakness we're seeing in electronics and from automotive end markets?
pat d. dawson -- executive vice president and president
yes. jim, this is pat. we will see. because the real issue there with epi prices going up 30% in the last 2 months, so that puts pressure -- margin pressure on the nonintegrated epoxy resin producers in china. and so we've seen that price of ler in china go up to levels where we were in late '17 and early '18. and what that does is you get the price of ler in china higher than the price of ler out of china. so producers in asia where we see a lot of the competitive activity coming into europe and north america, they'll send that ler into china because they can make better returns and that takes product off the market in europe and north america. hence, you can get a tightening from that kind of arbitrage dynamic. so that's really what we see could happen here in the second half of the year.
operator
the next question will have come from matthew blair of tudor, pickering and holt.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering and holt -- analyst
hey good morning everyone. i just want to clarify on the use of cash proceeds. i think, previously you were talking about paying down $250 million to $300 million of debt. is that still intact? or is the general idea to build cash in advance of this third ethylene payment?
todd a. slater -- chief financial officer and vice president
matthew, this is todd. that debt prepayment was in effect lowering debt in advance of the ethylene payment that was going to be do at the end of 2020. so we are going to build cash over the next 1.5 year to be in a position to pay that.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering and holt -- analyst
okay. sounds good. and then it looks like epoxy contracts in the u.s. settled down a little bit in july. i'm just wondering, are you expecting margin compression in epoxy in the third quarter? or do you think you will make that up with cheaper raws?
pat d. dawson -- executive vice president and president
this is pat again. i think we had price increases out there in may, and we got modest improvement traction on that pricing that you saw in the chart there from the icis index in that may, june time frame. no question with the lackluster demand in asia and in europe. we're seeing pressure on the margins, but we're also not seeing the -- any major increases in raw material costs. so we think margin should be pretty stable here as we go into the second half of the year in north america.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering and holt -- analyst
good. thanks.
operator
next, we have hassan ahmed of alembic global.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
you guys talked about a recovery in caustic pricing in the back half of the year, now there is some industry consultants out there talking about the restart of a caustic facility in the back half of the year in the u.s. not a huge capacity, but a restart of the same. so as you guys think about your sort of forecast looking for higher caustic prices in the back half, are you factoring in that capacity coming on stream?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i guess, what i would say that it is a small facility, that's a restart in the whole scheme of things in terms of the capacity that's $13 million in north america. it's very small. so i would say that we're very constructive on what we're seeing. the demand on caustic is strong in the domestic market and obviously would pick up in the export market that we're seeing. we're constructive on it. and that plant restart we wouldn't expect to have any impact on the overall supply/demand outlook.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
understood. and since you brought up the export demand side of it, i would love to hear what you guys are seeing, specifically on the brazilian side, it seems alunorte is sort of ramping up production, braskem facility continues to be offline, the very least through the end of the year. so what are you guys seeing on the sort of brazilian export demand side?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we continue to see relatively strong demand in brazil aided by some supply outages down there. we talked in the prepared remarks that we have seen the price of caustic in brazil, the domestic price go up about $200 a ton over the last quarter. and i'll make one other comment about our caustic soda pricing. our caustic soda pricing outside of north america went up approximately $50 a ton from the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter. so the export market is improving.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
very helpful. thanks so much.
operator
next, we have steve byrne of bank of america.
steve byrne -- bank of america -- analyst
yes thank you. are your higher-margin chlorine derivative products running at capacity? or could you shift more chlorine molecules into those end markets in a way from, say, spot edc?
james a. varilek -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
this is jim. we do have the ability to move some product around. our assets are running hard, and i think we talked in our investor day about adding additional capacity down the road to support the derivative demand in bleach and hcl and so forth. and we are in fact, doing that. so i would say the assets downstream are running well -- running hard and we do have -- we do still have the capability to optimize across different product portfolios based on operational things and seasonal demands.
steve byrne -- bank of america -- analyst
and this environmental remediation charge that you have, what size is this associated with? what's the source of the contamination? and how significant could this be longer-term?
john l. mcintosh -- executive vice president of synergies and systems
we're not going to respond specifically about the site. this is just part of the ongoing remediation activity at the site. this is not indicative of a trend or harbinger of things to come. this is just a normal course of events as we work cooperatively with the agencies to remediate sites that were targets -- or orphan sites for us years ago.
steve byrne -- bank of america -- analyst
can you just comment on what the contamination is?
todd a. slater -- chief financial officer and vice president
steve, this is todd. if you look over the last 15 years, environment is also a long-term item for olin. our average expense has been just under $20 million a year and it ranges anywhere from $38 million in a year to $8 million. so this $20 million item happens is not unusual, it happens periodically over a 15-year period. and the other day, i think, we have over 77 sites that olin is dealing within the -- its environmental portfolio. and remember this is a heritage dow site as we didn't take any legacy dow environmental liabilities.
operator
your next question we have will come from frank mitsch of fermium research.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
hey good morning, congrats on the bond offering. i wanted to follow-up on caustic pricing. i believe you indicated that indices had a down $20 a ton on the second quarter versus the first quarter. i thought you mentioned industry was in july also down $5. as we look at -- if we think about where the industry index will end the third quarter, what are your expectations in terms of it being higher than where it ended in june? is that how we should be thinking about that we should be getting more than that $5 down index by the end of this quarter?
james a. varilek -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
frank, this is jim. just for clarity, the july index was actually moved up $5 ihs. there is a number of different indexes and they range anywhere from up $5 to up $30 on the indexes. so we do expect that we've reached inflection point here and with demand continuing to be strong here as we go through the summer time that we would expect continued movement -- upward movement on the prices. i think from an expectation standpoint, if you think about third quarter, caustic pricing being at or slightly better than the second quarter would be a good assumption.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
that makes a lot more sense, which is why i asked the question because i obviously had misheard it. so my apologies there. on the itc incident, negatively impacting epoxy by $10, is that demand gone forever? or is that nearly delayed and you will be making that up as we progress through the year?
pat d. dawson -- executive vice president and president
frank, this is pat. no, no. that demand is not gone forever. it was a temporary situation and so we -- we're seeing that come back strong here as we go into the second half of the year, and actually we started to see it come back in the month of june.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
terrific. thanks so much.
operator
the next question we have will come from jeff zekauskas of jpmorgan.
jeff zekauskas -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thanks very much. your maintenance expenses have come down nicely from 2017, may be from about $220 million then to about $136 million in '19. i was wondering, are these elevated? or is the $136 million that you think you're going to pay this year, is this still an elevated level of maintenance? or is this now a more of normal level of maintenance? what's the trajectory of maintenance spending asset base case over the next several years?
todd a. slater -- chief financial officer and vice president
jeff, there is a couple of things that drive the level of maintenance spending. one, there is a large outage that occurs every 3 years in the dcm plan, which is obviously the biggest and most complicated plan we have, and that will drive a top in the year that, that occurs. that last occurred in 2017. so we will see that again in 2020. we also had once every 6-year maintenance at both of the epoxy plans, part of that occurred late in 2017, part of that occurred in 2018. so both that, again, drove '17 up above what i would call the normal line. i would say '19 is probably a little bit below the normal line. but as we go into 2020, i would tell you we would expect that to be elevated because of dcm.
jeff zekauskas -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and then if you could just briefly summarize why caustic soda prices for the first half of 2019 probably were lower than you expected? and why the -- and why do you think that stabilization and growth in caustic, which is about to come, is probably coming at a slower rate? what were the primary levers in your mind behind that toughness in the caustic market? and why have they altered?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i think there was one discrete event, which was the whole issue of in alunorte which was -- has been discussed for about a year. and i think ultimately the restart of half of that plant, which consumes 15,000 tons of caustic a month was delayed much longer than we might have anticipated a year ago. the other thing, i think, if you look at some industry data and some consumption data, i think caustic soda demand in north america was just a little bit weaker in the first half of the year than we would have expected. now there is probably impossible to specify where that came from, but that's why. we started to believe, we turned the corners, we said in our remarks around the demand disruption from alunorte. on top of that we've seen a supply disruption in latin america around braskem. and we've seen in our system of improving demand as we started to move into the summer months, which are typically the strongest months from a manufacturing perspective.
jeff zekauskas -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. all right. thank you very much.
operator
and next we have mike sison of keybanc.
mike sison -- keybanc -- analyst
hey guys, just a question on the july realization of $5 and -- for caustic. i think you guys and some others announced $60. what -- can you maybe talk about what -- why the realization was so low? was it more supply? was it more demand in terms of pricing realization?
james a. varilek -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
mike, this is jim. the price realization, it's always hard to turn things when you're going from a market that has been moving down to up. a lot of the individual negotiations take place and you should think about this also as a range in terms of pricing. some of the different indexes there, like i said, from $5 to $30 range on that. and so that would indicate kind of a spread of what type of price realization took place in the -- across the industry. and some of that will continue to be pushed into the latter parts of the third quarter.
mike sison -- keybanc -- analyst
got it. and then in terms of demand, where do you need that demand to improve, just on a geographic basis? i mean, is it more the less that needs to improve to see the improvement in demand? or do you need some demand overseas as well?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
this is john. i would say to you that caustic for us is a global market. so we really need it to be indifferent where demand improves.
mike sison -- keybanc -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
next we have neel kumar of morgan stanley.
neel kumar -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. good morning. trade sources mentioned that u.s. export offers have come in at about $20 per metric ton lower versus july. i was just wondering, if that's indifferent from what you're seeing in the market? and what are the drivers of the lower offers? and then, is there anticipated price improvements to the second half of the year? does it come from higher domestic or escrow pricing?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, i'll go back to the answer i gave to a question a few minutes ago, which is, in our system, caustic sold out of north america went up approximately $50 a ton between the end of the first quarter and the end of the second quarter. so -- and we do not expect that to go down as we move forward. so it's our expectation that for us and our system, export pricing or non-north american pricing will be improved in the second half versus the first half. and i think that's consistent with what you see in the index, which is up $40 a ton. i can't comment on what one shipment that might be at a slightly different price might mean. from our perspective, this is what we're getting under our contracts. as we've said in the past, we sell virtually nothing in the spot market. so we're at least constructive on the direction.
neel kumar -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's helpful. and we've seen some commentary about pressure inventories in caustic being a bit elevated over the last couple of months. have those levels begun to get drawn down with higher export demand? or how would you characterize inventories for that industry currently?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i would say, i can't talk about the industry. i can tell you that our inventories are at normal to slightly below normal levels right now.
operator
and the next question we have will come from john roberts of ubs.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
thank you. i may have misheard at the beginning, but i think you talked about some chinese supply disruptions in epoxy, is that the glycerin-based chinese industry? or was that chemical-based epis disruption? or were these some of older explosion that happened a while ago that just went through the system?
pat d. dawson -- executive vice president and president
john, this is pat. this is was chloro hydro-based epichlorohydrin. it was not glycerin, the epi-based. and it was really -- this is out in the press, primarily around highly heading some environmental issues and capacity that has really gone down.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
is there a fair amount of excess glycerin-based production that can still come back to market here that kind of pulling the pricing continues up?
pat d. dawson -- executive vice president and president
i would say the honest answer right now is hard to tell. there is a lot of the different sizes of that glycerin to epi in terms of scale. there is a lot of different costs involved in those small assets. most -- there is very little epichlorohydrant that comes out of china, john, as you know. so i think most of this is around chloro hydrant-based and that is, of course, most of the capacity in china is chloro hydrate-based.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
and then follow-up on winchester. are we kind of completed all the destock at both end consumers in the supply chain now and until the next kind of disruption comes along, this is a new normal and we'll have normal seasonal patterns of the current level of results at winchester?
todd a. slater -- chief financial officer and vice president
john, this is todd. i think we've seen that the distributors and retailers, i think, inventories were in line. it's still unknowable what the consumer has in their safety stock. so it's not clear that they are buying what they are technically consuming today. so but what we've seen in the first half of the year, winchester is sort of even though commercial sales have been down and pricing has been down with commodity cost and improved military volumes, year-over-year results are very similar.
operator
next, we have arun viswanathan of rbc capital markets.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great thanks. good morning guys. just a question, going back to the bridge. so you highlighted kind of comparable winchester earnings sets minimal h2 improvement, lower turnaround of $25, prices only $15 and then you said that leaves $100 or so for volumes. could you break that out as well? i mean, that seems like a quite a big jump to me. was that just weakness in h1 that was more pronounced and you see all that coming back? and what gives you that confidence, especially given the demand weakness that you saw in the first half?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we just -- we provided some information specific to products a few minutes ago, where we talked about bleach, which, i think, everybody knows is a seasonal business. and if you look at the weather pattern in united states early part of the year, especially, april and may was a lot cooler and a lot wetter. july was a lot harder than normal and that continued in august. that represents a big uptick. historically, we've seen 15% uptick first half to second half. i talked about the vinyls business, which has a seasonal component to it in terms of how we run, how our customers run and that has historically had a 5% to 7% uptick second half to first half. the epoxy business has always been seasonally strongest in the first -- in the second half versus the first half.
it really goes to a lot of the businesses in europe, a lot of it is construction-related and that is predominantly a summer activity, june, july, august, september. so we're confident in that. and i also talked about what -- our large pipeline accounts, who primarily are in the european's business and we have typically seen somewhere in the 15% improvement year -- first half to second half in them. so all we're really looking for here is the normal demand pattern over the first half to second half. and a lot of that gives you -- and that plays into the fact that second half turnaround costs are going to be lower because some of this is driven by turnaround that occur in the first half versus the second half. so we're as confident as we could be about the pattern that we're seeing. this is not that unusual.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
and then just so we can put that into context, i have those numbers as far as bridge up 15% to 20%, 5%, 7% in vinyls, pipeline up 15%. given those typical movements, i guess, in the past has that typically resulted in a $100 million improvement second half versus first half? or is that because of changes in your system that you could realize that larger level of improvement?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i would say, that typically creates a significant change from first half to second half. we said earlier that over the last 3 years that we've owned the dow businesses, we've seen about 45% of our ebitda be generated in the first half, 55% in the second half and pricing can skew that all over the place. we're looking at this and the number we're giving you is based on or obviously based on assumptions on price, and there is not a lot of price skewing that -- this time.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
and then just to understand the lower-end of the guidance then. so assuming the midpoint you get that $100 million-or-so in volume. so the lower end, is it mainly just the volume doesn't come through? or were there other factors that go into the lower end of guidance?
todd a. slater -- chief financial officer and vice president
well, i would say, the 2 big variables around the guidance are, we realize the $15 million in price and the rest is the volume.
operator
next, we have an aleksey yefremov of nomura.
aleksey yefremov -- nomura -- analyst
thank you. good morning. apologies another question on first half versus second half. if i take the $650 million you expect at the midpoint in the second half and divided by 2, that's about $325 million per quarter. should i think about the seasonality as 3q is going to be higher than that average and 4q below that?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no. i think with the product mix that we have today, and some of the changes in the customer, i would say, q3 and q4 should look similar to each other.
aleksey yefremov -- nomura -- analyst
so about $325 million per quarter is roughly. all right. and then the $20 million environmental charge, should that benefit the corporate line in the third quarter compared to the second quarter because of absence of it?
todd a. slater -- chief financial officer and vice president
all other things being equal. yes.
aleksey yefremov -- nomura -- analyst
last quick one, if i may. could you quantify the negative impact of itc fire in the first half? and how much it will benefit in the second?
todd a. slater -- chief financial officer and vice president
all we've said is that it was $10 million in the second quarter.
aleksey yefremov -- nomura -- analyst
thank you.
operator
there are no further questions. this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would now like to turn the conference call back over to mr. john fischer for any closing remarks. sir?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer

good day, and welcome to the olin corporation second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. [operator instructions].
i would now like to turn the conference over to ms. logan bonacorsi, olin's director of investor relations. ms. bonacorsi, the floor is yours, ma'am.
logan bonacorsi -- director of investor relations
good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. before we begin, let me remind you that this presentation, along with the associated slides and the question-and-answer session, following our prepared remarks, will include statements regarding estimates of future performance. please note that these are forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected.
some of the factors that could cause results to differ from our projections are described without limitations in the risk factor section of our most recent form 10-k and in yesterday's second quarter earnings press release. a copy of today's transcript and slides will be available on our website in the investors section under past events. the earnings press release and other financial data and information are available under press releases.
with me this morning are john fischer, olin's chairman, president and chief executive officer; pat dawson, executive vice president and president of epoxy and international; jim varilek, executive vice president and chief operating officer; john mcintosh, executive vice president, synergies & systems; and todd slater, vice president and chief financial officer. we will begin with our prepared remarks and thereafter, we'll be happy to take your question.
i'll now turn the call over to john fischer. john?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, logan, and good morning, everyone. today, we'll begin my remarks by discussing the key points from the quarter just ended, followed by the outlook for the second half of 2019, a detailed review of each of olin's business segments and conclude with our view on market dynamics for chlor alkali and epoxy. with that, let's turn to slide three. during the second quarter and consistent with our early july update, olin reported adjusted ebitda of $204.6 million.
second quarter results were challenged by several factors across our business segments. specifically, we experienced lower-than-anticipated demand for merchant chlorine and certain chlorine derivatives, predominantly from titanium dioxide and refrigeration customers and agricultural customers impacted by flooding. we were challenged by several onetime events in the epoxy segment, which negatively impacted results by approximately $10 million. these included customer issues resulting from the intercontinental terminals company storage fire in the houston, texas area and reduced production in europe resulting from an unplanned outage at the utility supplier.
we incurred, as expected, approximately $40 million of sequentially higher planned maintenance turnaround costs in our chemical businesses, and we recorded a $20 million environmental expense from remedial activities related to a legacy olin manufacturing site. now moving to our third quarter 2019 outlook, which is on slide four. we expect our third quarter adjusted ebitda to be higher than that achieved in the second quarter of 2019. first, we expect improved operating rates of seasonally stronger sales volume in each of our 3 segments. second, we expect approximately $40 million of lower maintenance turnaround costs compared to the second quarter.
third, the absence of the onetime events that challenged olin in the second quarter should benefit third quarter adjusted ebitda. finally, while the second quarter declines in caustic soda indices will continue to affect the price in olin system during the third quarter, the anticipated improvement in caustic soda pricing should provide positive momentum moving forward. now looking at the second half of 2019 outlook, which is on page 5. as we guided to in early july, we expect full year adjusted ebitda to be in the range of $1.075 billion and $1.17 billion.
at the midpoint, this guidance implies second half of 2019 adjusted ebitda of approximately $650 million. the key assumptions behind this forecast are: higher volume levels in chlor alkali and epoxy, increased operating rates in the chemicals business, lower turnaround costs, stronger contribution from the winchester segment and improved cost performance. although pricing is expected to improve, we are assuming that approximately $15 million of the adjusted ebitda improvement in the second half, compared to the first half, will come from higher prices. now we'd like to take a more detailed look at each of the business segments starting with chlor alkali products and vinyls on slide six.
second quarter 2019 adjusted ebitda for the chlor alkali products and vinyls segment was $189.5 million, representing a 35% year-over-year decline and reflecting the significant impact of lower caustic soda pricing. in fact, caustic soda pricing in olin system was approximately 25% or approximately $100 million lower when compared to the second quarter of 2018. in addition, lower overall volumes, which were down approximately 4% year-over-year, negatively impacted the second quarter segment results. offsetting some of the year-over-year pressure from caustic soda prices and lower overall volume levels was a larger contribution from olin's ethylene dichloride business.
ethylene dichloride pricing improved approximately 40% over second quarter 2018 levels. now let's discuss caustic soda pricing, which is on slide seven. domestic caustic soda pricing declined at a slower rate in the second quarter 2019 with the third-party indices moving down an additional $20 from first quarter 2019 levels. this price reduction, coupled with the first quarter decline still being recognized in our system, led to a 3% sequential decline in olin system. an upward turn in caustic soda price has occurred later than we had anticipated, but we are now seeing positive developments.
during the second quarter, the caustic soda demand locations that plagued the market for more than 1 year was largely resolved. in addition, global restraints on the supply side, particularly in latin america, have emerged resulting in the need for additional caustic soda exports from the united states. the tightening supply and demand dynamics taking place today should lead the caustic soda price improvement as we progress through the back half of the year. in fact, we're already seeing indications of upward pricing momentum. for example, u.s. spot export pricing reversed its downward trend in the second quarter with indices of increasing approximately $40 per ton over the first quarter.
resilient domestic pricing is increased approximately $200 per ton since the end of the first quarter and most recently, the domestic caustic price indices broke its streak of low -- declines in july by increasing $5 per ton. now let's move to the performance of our epoxy segment, which is on slide eight. during the second quarter of 2019, olin's epoxy business generated adjusted ebitda of $29.7 million. this level of adjusted ebitda coupled with our first quarter 2019 results represents this olin's strongest first half performance from this segment since owning and operating this business.
looking ahead to the third quarter of 2019, we expect epoxy segment results to increase when compared to the second quarter of 2019. specifically, $20 million of lower plan turnaround costs, resumption of normal customer operations at the itc terminal storage facility and the resolution of the unplanned utility outage that started in germany plant will supplement the expected seasonal uplift in volumes. moreover, we continue to believe we will see improved year-over-year performance from the epoxy segment in 2019. looking now at global epoxy resin prices, which are shown on the chart on slide nine.
during the second quarter, liquid epoxy resin pricing in all regions declined from the pricing levels experienced during the prior year quarter. sequentially, pricing in asia and europe moved lower due to weaker-than-expected demand, while u.s. liquid epoxy resin pricing appears to have stabilized. however, ongoing supply disruptions in china have tightened epichlorohydrin supply. in fact, epichlorohydrin prices in china increased approximately 30% over the past 2 months. this has resulted in upward pricing momentum for liquid epoxy resins in china. we believe this development could tighten global markets resulting in an increase in global liquid epoxy resins pricing in the second half of 2019.
now turning to our winchester segment, which is summarized on slide 10. winchester experienced a 9% decline in adjusted ebitda for the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter last year. this decline was the result of lower commercial volumes and lower product pricing. favorable commodity and operating cost partially offset the impact of the lower volumes and pricing. we're forecasting sequential improvement in adjusted ebitda during the third quarter as the business enters its seasonally strongest quarter of the year. we expect to see an improvement in commercial sales and volumes across all product categories and in military and law enforcement sales volumes.
this should lead to a stronger overall performance during the year, second half. we continue to expect winchester's results for the full year of 2019 to be comparable to the full year levels achieved in 2018. now turning to our long-term view of the market. in mid-july, olin completed a $750 million bond offering and new $2 billion bank credit facility. todd will discuss this transaction in more detail in a minute, but overall, we were able to establish a low-risk pathway to refinance the high-cost bonds assuming -- assumed during the 2015 dow merger when the bonds become callable in late 2020, while also increasing our overall financial flexibility.
despite the recent weakness in caustic soda pricing and lackluster demand for certain of our products, our positive long-term view of the chlor alkali and epoxy markets is unchanged. this positive outlook reflects the following: in the chlor alkali sector, demand growth is occurring on both sides of the eu; to date, there have been minimal global capacity additions and announcements of additions to meet this growing demand. current industry economics do not support world scale for chlor alkali capital investment. as a result over time, supply and demand balances will continue to tighten creating upward pricing momentum for olin's caustic soda, chlorine and chlorine derivative products. similarly, in the epoxy business, we see steady global demand growth and minimal announced capacity additions.
now i'd like to turn the call over to todd slater, olin's cfo. todd?
todd a. slater -- chief financial officer and vice president
thanks, john. before turning to our 2019 cash flow outlook, i'd like to discuss the recent capital market transactions in more detail on slide 12. in mid-july, we completed an opportunistic bond offering, which extended our debt maturity profile and enhanced our current liquidity position. we issued $750 million of 10 years senior unsecured notes at an interest rate of 5% and 5.8%. we immediately used the proceeds from the offering to prepay the term loan a facility and the outstanding borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization facility.
as a result, we have effectively no prepayable debt outstanding. concurrently, we put in place a new $2 billion bank credit facility, consisting of an $800 million revolving credit facility and a $1.2 billion delayed draw term loan. we expect to use the proceeds from the delayed draw term loan to pay the existing high-cost bonds that were assumed in the acquisition of dow chlorine products businesses when the bonds become callable in late 2020. by addressing this future need now, when the credit markets are favorable, we have positioned olin to enhance our balance sheet and cash flow significantly at attractive terms within the next 15 months. we estimate that the 2020 refinancings will reduce annual interest expense by $50 million to $70 million.
now let's turn to our 2019 cash flow forecast, which is on slide 13. assuming the midpoint of our full year adjusted ebitda guidance, we expect to generate approximately $310 million of cash flow in 2019. starting with the midpoint of our adjusted ebitda forecast, which is in the far left of the waterfall chart. we did that $16 million in estimated cash tax payments. we're forecasting our cash tax rate will be in the 25% range for the year. column 3 reflects the midpoint of our current forecast for capital spending of $375 million, which includes annual maintenance capital spending of between $225 million and $275 million and the investment associated with our multiyear information technology integration project of approximately $80 million.
as we have previously discussed in 2017, we began a multiyear project to implement new enterprise resource planning, manufacturing and engineering systems across the heritage olin and the acquired dow chlorine products businesses. the project includes the required information, technology infrastructure. now turning to the fourth column. we expect a $100 million increase in working capital in 2019, as we will use cash from our refinancing to discontinue the sale of receivables under our factoring arrangement. in the next column, onetime items include information technology integration costs and cash restructuring costs of approximately $80 million. this includes approximately $40 million for the it integration project that i just spoke about and approximately $25 million of duplicate it costs that are being incurred during the transition.
these costs were partially offset by $20 million of pre-tax proceeds from the sale of an investment in a nonconsolidated affiliate during the first quarter. the next column represents an estimate of cash interest expense. on june 30, we had approximately 30% of our debt at variable interest rates. however, following the refinancing that was just completed, that percentage has dropped to 20% of our debt at variable rates. we're forecasting the 2019 interest rates will be slightly higher than those we experienced in 2018. in the far right column, we are forecasting $310 million of cash flow.
given the recent capital market transactions and the debt repayment progress to date, our top priority for free cash flow is to return to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and build our cash position in advance of the ethylene payment, which will be no more than $493 million and that is due in late 2020. finally, on thursday, july 25, olin's board of directors declared a dividend of $0.20 on each share of olin common stock. the dividend is payable on september 10, 2019, to shareholders of record at the close of business on august 9, 2019. this is the 371st consecutive quarterly dividend to be paid by the company.

we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] first question comes from don carson of susquehanna. don, please proceed.
don carson -- susquehanna -- analyst
yes. thank you. john, a question on the chlor alkali cycle. this cycle seems a little different in that normally industrial demand is more sustainable than vinyls demand especially into residential construction. we seem to have the opposite this time around. is that why you think that we're going to have lower caustic pricing in 2020 versus 2019? and then i have a follow-up on winchester.
john e. fischer -- chairman of the board, president, chief executive officer
what i would say is what i think is that -- we think is different about the chlor alkali cycle as we said, at this moment is there has been a significant increase in the amount of chlorine exported as derivatives over the past 12 years. if you would look, today between 35% and 40% of the chlorine that's produced in north america is actually exported. so when we look at a slowdown in industrial production in the united states, it has typically been accompanied by a slowdown in housing and construction in the us, but what we really for this cycle to take full effect, we really need there to be a global slowdown in construction, so that the chlorine demand actually goes down in north america. so we would see a lower level of exports.
i think if you looked at caustic demand in north america, it would, it would significantly exceed chlorine demand right now. just in north america.
don carson -- susquehanna -- analyst
and then my follow-up on winchester, we've seen a significant change in industry distribution patterns or about to see where the largest retailer walmart is going to restrict its sales of certain types of ammunition. what impact do you think this has on overall demand, if any -- and could that actually be positive for you given that presumably these smaller distributors who may -- who will take over from walmart, don't get the same terms as a walmart does.
john e. fischer -- chairman of the board, president, chief executive officer
i would say at the moment, it's probably too soon to tell, because walmart is still in the market. their targeted exit on the products, their exiting is december 1 and i imagine that they're not helping the market right now, because they are trying to move all of that product.
longer -- in the immediate aftermath, i would not be surprised if there is some short run disruptions on the retail supply side, just because walmart has such a large presence and nobody else comes close. i think your -- your comment on pricing probably has some validity, but we'll need to see how that plays out.
don carson -- susquehanna -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from kevin mccarthy of vertical research partners. kevin, please proceed.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
yes. good morning. would you comment on where you think demand for chlor alkali is tracking in 2019, and based on your prior experience with previous downturns, what would you expect the trajectory to look like, demand wise as we move through 2020.
james a. varilek -- chief operating officer, executive vice president
kevin, this is jim. i would say on a year-over-year basis, we have seen some weaker operating rates and so forth which would indicate that we have had a lower caustic output. so i think that's been exacerbated here in the third quarter, we've seen that -- we've seen that decline and we've seen it in specific pocket for in pulp and paper and alumina that are actually driving that. having said that, i think there is some inventory corrections and so forth that are taking place in those markets and as we look into 2020, we need to see some kind of a -- what i would call an industrial production rebound to see increasing demand and we need to get -- as was mentioned earlier, we need to get the industrial production side of things, which driving -- drives caustic demand, moving to the upside in excess of chlorine demand, which will help bring balance back to the market.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
okay and then i had a follow-up question, if i may on winchester. on slide 11, i think you referenced $25 million of transition costs. can you talk a little bit about what those are? and also whether you need to reinvest capital to serve this contract and whether or not there are any other meaningful contracts that might roll off or roll on over the next year or so?
james a. varilek -- chief operating officer, executive vice president
the $25 million is the expense that olin will incur to take over what is effectively a $500 million business in a different location. we have to provide the entire management team, which is somewhere between 12 and 15 people. they have to be relocated, they have to have a -- what i'll call it transition period living there. there are certain investments that we need to make in terms of getting -- what i'll call the management systems up to speed. there are 2000 employees at lake city that become our employees, we have to put them on our benefit programs, etc, etc. so that is what the $25 million is about.
in terms of investments by olin, the only real investment we are obligated to make is in working capital. and i would tell you, i think that's in the $60 million to $80 million range, which will occur late next year.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from jim sheehan of suntrust. jim, please proceed.
jim sheehan -- suntrust -- analyst
good morning, thanks for taking my question. would you expect caustic soda customers to be in need of restocking inventories sometime in early 2020?
todd a. slater -- chief financial officer, vice president
yeah, we would expect that. i mean -- they've been in destock mode for quite some time. so we would expect that at some point here, that restocking has to occur. right now with prices moving down with -- we say industrial production in general, demand in kind of a malaise, they've been destocking and will probably continue to do that until they see something to the positive side, that will cause them or give them a trigger to restock. but it's got to happen at some point in time.
jim sheehan -- suntrust -- analyst
thank you. and what is your expectation for a turnaround costs in 2020 relative to 2019?
john e. fischer -- chairman of the board, president, chief executive officer
we haven't given a specific number, jim. but i would tell you qualitatively, they will be higher. we've talked about the large turnarounds. there is one in the vcm plant that occurs every three years. it will occur in the second quarter of next year and that will all other things being equal make turnaround costs higher next year than this year.
jim sheehan -- suntrust -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from frank mitsch, fermium research, frank, please proceed.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
thank you and congrats on the lake city contract. john interesting factoid on the chlorine customer not buying anything for four weeks starting in september. i was wondering, what industry or what end market that was. and do we have to go back to like to the '08, '09 timeframe for the last time you saw that occur.
john e. fischer -- chairman of the board, president, chief executive officer
that is the longest outage from that type of customer we've seen since the end of 2008. so yes, you do have to go back that far, i'd rather not say where they came from, but i would just take the opportunity to say, we were moving along through the month of august last -- this past august with relatively high demand across the spectrum of what we're doing and it's like we hit a wall in september. and that's what we're really experiencing now. things dropped off dramatically and they've stayed down up till today anyway.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and in discussing not just customer inventories, but i'm more curious on the caustic soda side in terms of producer inventory levels, we heard that they were somewhat elevated, can you talk about how that trended? how do you believe that trended through the third quarter and where producer inventory levels are on caustic here today.
john e. fischer -- chairman of the board, president, chief executive officer
i would say, i don't feel qualified to comment on the competitors or the other participants in the market. i would tell you that as we sit today, our caustic inventory is equal to or slightly below our normal levels.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
and was it above it during the third quarter, and you've been able to work that down, is that the way that we should think about that?
john e. fischer -- chairman of the board, president, chief executive officer
we've had a series of -- it was -- our third -- we built in little bit of inventory in the third quarter because we have a series of turnarounds that are going on early in the fourth quarter. those turnarounds have had the effect of bringing inventory levels below normal.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
terrific, thank you.
operator
our next question comes from neel kumar of morgan stanley. neil, please proceed.
neel kumar -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. i was just wondering, if you can give any preliminary expectations on how to think about 2020 ebitda, i mean just given the softness, we're seeing in demand, you think it's fair to think about it as annualized fourth quarter ebitda expectations plus perhaps the quarter on the new winchester contract?
john e. fischer -- chairman of the board, president, chief executive officer
what i would say is we intend to give full-year 2020 when we report our fourth quarter earnings. i would just go back to the comment i made to frank about how strong the slowdown was and i would say, based on that and the ability of this industry to move very rapidly one way or the other, it would be imprudent to really give 2020 guidance at this moment.
neel kumar -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. and then i just -- i was wondering, if you can talk about what you're seeing in terms of the edc market going forward. it seems that prices started to strengthen a bit in october, so just curious as to what you're seeing in that market?
james a. varilek -- chief operating officer, executive vice president
yeah, neel, this is jim. edcs, i think at the last call, what we said was that we expected edc demand to continue fairly solid in the third quarter, we did see that prices did come down as we expected and we mentioned that we were going to be buffered from a good bit of that movement and we in fact did see that. so that's the third quarter. heading into fourth quarter, there is -- there has been still some pressure on edc prices to the downward side, but you're correct in your observation that here in the last few weeks, we've actually seen some movement to the upside on edc. and as i've spoken before we oftentimes edc demand pick up as people start to restock in the fourth quarter.
so what -- we'll have to see where the rest of the quarter takes us in terms of pricing, but we would expect to see some increased volume in the latter part of the quarter.
neel kumar -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, all right, thank you.
operator
our next question comes from michael leithead of barclays. mike, go ahead.
michael leithead -- barclays -- analyst
thanks, good morning, guys. if we were to just flatline pricing for your key products right now, what would the year-over-year ebitda headwind be next year versus this year?
john e. fischer -- chairman of the board, president, chief executive officer
i don't think we want to -- i don't know what flatlining means, because it will move -- you want to flatline at this moment, i would say --
michael leithead -- barclays -- analyst
if we just took third quarter levels and just ran them straight.
john e. fischer -- chairman of the board, president, chief executive officer
i don't have that calculation, i would prefer to answer that with more information.
michael leithead -- barclays -- analyst
fair enough. and then on cash flow, i think slide 12 is helpful to think about 2021, but if we were to just bridge from 2019 to '20 for free cash, we'll pick whatever level of earnings next year, but just agnostic of that, how should we think about the changing cash calls next year versus what we have this year in 2019?
john e. fischer -- chairman of the board, president, chief executive officer
well we've talked about a couple of things that are what i would call one-time cash flow. todd talked in his remarks about the ethylene. we also talked about the bond call, there is a premium to be paid on that and we talked about the need, there was an earlier question, to fund working capital at winchester. that said, i would expect, given the environment we're in that you will see lower capital spending for us next year and if the business stays where it is, we should see working capital ex the lake city thing be a positive for us next year.
michael leithead -- barclays -- analyst
got it, thank you.

your next question comes from eric petrie of citi. eric, please proceed.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
hi, good morning.
john e. fischer -- chairman of the board, president, chief executive officer
good morning.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
it seems the alumina industry is oversupplied with recent producer announcements to review capacity, has this impacted you at all? and have you seen what the slowdown in industrial production customers for caustic switch more to spot versus contract?
james a. varilek -- chief operating officer, executive vice president
as i mentioned before, eric, this is jim. as i mentioned before, we have seen weakness in the market and i think the best -- the alumina market. i think the best indicator of that. it actually is the pricing and the price declines that have taken place in that market but they would come off all the way down into the -- the lmes or way down into the levels that they haven't seen in several years. so that it would indicate the weak demand. as far as individual capacities in alumina and so forth. i think you'd have to speak to them about what's the rightsizing, whether capacity needs to come off. we have seen weaker demand coming out of the alumina -- alumina sector, but to your comment about spot or whatever.
spot caustic pricing and so forth and spot versus contract, i would say we haven't seen a significant change in the action of in that industry.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
helpful. and secondly, how much of your epoxy volumes are indexed raw materials?
john e. fischer -- chairman of the board, president, chief executive officer
indexed raw materials.
pat d. dawson -- executive vice president and president-epoxy and international
yeah. jeff, this is -- sorry eric, this is pat. but the index seems very little, quite frankly, most of the indexing where we index to raw materials is in our upstream things like benzene and propylene. so benzene we can pretty much immediately offset any changes there in our upstream, very little indexing gets done in the midstream and downstream parts of our portfolio.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from jeff zekauskas of jpmorgan. jeff, please proceed.
jeff zekauskas -- jp morgan -- analyst
thanks very much. what's south american demand for caustic been like for you. if you look at the third quarter and compare it to the second?
james a. varilek -- chief operating officer, executive vice president
jeff, this is jim. demand in latin america has declined in the third quarter. latin america had been a very strong growth area over the past couple of years. again, i would focus on pulp and paper and alumina markets which drive latin american growth and specifically brazilian growth and those have been softer. and so we have seen the same things, latin america, as we've seen elsewhere in the world, respective to those two sectors.
jeff zekauskas -- jp morgan -- analyst
in thinking through the last few conference calls, i think when we began 2019, there was a general optimism around caustic prices and obviously caustic prices has been weak. when you think through the change from a more optimistic approach to a less optimistic one, do you think that the major factors were really in paper and alumina or do you think that the factors were wider than that and leading to the weakness in caustic prices?
james a. varilek -- chief operating officer, executive vice president
i think they are much wider than just those two sectors. i really think that when you look at the, whether you want to call it an economic malaise, the impact of trade wars, uncertainty around brexit and so forth. i think that's weighing across a variety of different industries and it backstop [phonetic] into what we're seeing. and clearly pulp and paper and alumina have seen declines and we have a tenancy to highlight those because they're larger end use segments. but at the end of the day, i think it's a broader decline and i think that's also why we saw the significant drop-off in the middle of the third quarter, there was an awful lot of negative economic data and so forth and forecast that came out during that period.
and i think that affected the mindsets of many of our customers.
jeff zekauskas -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay, thanks very much.

our next question comes from hassan ahmad of olympic global. hassan, please proceed.
hassan ahmad -- olympic global -- analyst
again, and again in your prepared remarks, i keep hearing that there is no incremental capacity on the horizon, but over the last couple of weeks, certain reports have popped up that an overseas player may invest as much as $3 billion in the us toward a fairly integrated chlor vinyls facility. so how are you, i mean, have you heard similar things and how should we be thinking about that?
james a. varilek -- chief operating officer, executive vice president
hassan, this is jim, i think the way to think about capacity and the future capacity, i think, what we've consistently said is that we believe over the long term that demand for caustic products will outstrip the capacity that's being added. i don't think anybody believes that there won't be some incremental capacity or even longer term, there may be some larger capacity that will be added at some point in time. what we've said is that demand will outstrip capacity additions and that right now reinvestment economics are -- did not exist on a large world-scale integrated facility. so i think suppliers in various whether they pvc producers or integrated players continuously evaluate when and if the most opportune time might be to invest. so i think that's an ongoing process, but we still firmly believe that this imbalance between growth and capacity will continue for some period.
john e. fischer -- chairman of the board, president, chief executive officer
and there was, there was something published about an overseas producer adding capacity in north america, but that was capacity associated with pvc some chlor alkali with a targeted date of installation of 2025 to 2026 and it was a relatively small amount when you look at an 80 million ton market that if it grows would have -- that was half -- less than half of 1% of the gdp mark or the caustic market, so.
hassan ahmad -- olympic global -- analyst
understood, very helpful and just sticking to the supply side in during sort of the course of q3 earnings, some of the companies reporting have talked about increased environmental sort of inspections and the like in china. are you hearing similar things within chlor vinyls. are you hearing of any curtailments in china based on -- off of these sort of inspections and the like?
pat d. dawson -- executive vice president and president-epoxy and international
hassan, this is pat. certainly you've seen a lot of volatility over the past year in china around these environmental issues in epoxy and specifically in epichlorohydrin. so as volatility continues to persist around these supply disruptions and that's has led to epi prices going up 40% year-over-year. now, it's important to keep in mind that very little epi leaves china because it's just not cost effective and only time it comes out that epi prices go up outside of china. so what this 40% year-over-year increase has done in china on epi its now caused ler prices in china over the past 30 days to 45 days to go up significantly, and actually prices for ler in china are now about $500 a ton higher than outside of china.
and so if this arbitrage persist and there will be increased ler imports into china from producers probably primarily in northeast asia but many parts of the world. so i think this could bode well for ler pricing around the world and of course, hassan, we saw some of this same movie before in late '17 and '18 which led to ler prices not just going up in china. but in other parts of the world as well. so stay tuned, the environmental issues continue to persist and it definitely continues the impact both chlor alkali and epoxy capacity.
hassan ahmad -- olympic global -- analyst
very helpful, thank you so much.

mike sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
hey, good morning. when i think about slide 6 and you go back to the last downturn in '15 and '16 for industrial demand. contract -- north american contract prices were similar to spot and now spot is a lot lower and contracts -- is little bit higher. so do you think contract will sort of follow suit with spot or does the spot come up or how does that dynamic kind of unfold over the next couple of quarters, do you think?
james a. varilek -- chief operating officer, executive vice president
mike, this is jim. i think that as long as spider -- spot and export prices remain below the contract -- their contract prices, there will be some pull down in those prices just because that's the trade-off that companies make. having said that, however, we still believe in the fundamentals of this marketplace and we're still getting a lot of request from a contract standpoint where customers continue to be focused on security of supply and so forth. so we believe that the, we're not going to see a dive off here in terms of the contracts, but because of that security of supply and so we think that it's going to continue to maintain this spread and in fact, the first thing that will move when we have -- when we go to the upside is the export in the spot pricing and it can move fairly dramatically as obviously you see on this chart.
mike sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
right. and then just could you maybe just give us where you think operating rates are for north american spot export market is now and maybe where it was over the last years? just to give us a perspective of and where we're sort of at?
james a. varilek -- chief operating officer, executive vice president
from an operating rate standpoint, i think the most recent operating rate was 84%, which was a significant decline from 92% in the previous month. and i think what would you see, over the course of the year is that we're about 1% to 2% -- percentage points lower this year than last year in terms of operating rate. the september drop off there were a very significant amount of turnarounds that affected that that operating rate. so 1% to 2% less -- lower than last year is what we're seeing from an operating rate standpoint.
mike sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
great, thank you.

our next question comes from matthew blair of tudor, pickering and holt, matthew. please proceed.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. on the last call, i think you talked about expectations for pretty strong volumes in the back half of 2019. and i just want to clarify, is that still occurring, and it's just the pricing that has come off or are you also seeing this weak demand environment pressure your volumes as well?
james a. varilek -- chief operating officer, executive vice president
the demand environment that we based our second half outlook on when we had the conference call in august has not materialized. as i said it to answer, an earlier question, sometime in september, we saw a pretty significant slowdown in demand, pretty much across the chemicals portfolio. so what is impacting us today is a combination of weaker demand and weaker pricing. some of which that pricing follows the demand obviously.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt -- analyst
makes sense and then slide 20 shows chlorine prices holding steady, but some of the derivatives like hcl and chlorinated organics are are seeing price declines. i was just hoping, if you could provide some commentary on this dynamic and when this happens, are you able to adjust your production slate to i guess minimize some of the downside?
john e. fischer -- chairman of the board, president, chief executive officer
what i would say on the chlor -- on each of those there is a discrete market around selling chlorine as a merchant product, selling chlorinated organics which is a global product and selling hcl, which is north american product. and we do -- we do toggle back and forth across the entire portfolio which includes edc, which includes epoxy resins according to where pricing is and where demand is for all three. and that's kind of how we manage it. if you look at just a simple trade-off in hcl for the last probably a year or so has had pricing higher than the merchant chlorine market, we would favor making hcl versus merchant chlorine.
merchant chlorine has held relatively steady that's positive and there might be a moment now where we would favor that over some chlorinated organics products.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt -- analyst
sounds good. thanks.

our next question comes from steve byrne, bank of america. steve, please proceed.
steve byrne -- bank of america -- analyst
yes, thank you. several of your large petrochemical peers do not provide specific earnings guidance just reflecting uncertainty in commodity pricing. and i just would like to hear your view on your level of commitment to continuing the level of detail you provide.
john e. fischer -- chairman of the board, president, chief executive officer
that's something we evaluate it on an annual basis. and it varies, it has evolved over time when we were a smaller company with prior to the dow acquisition, we had a different view there and we're doing something different now than we did then. and it just continues to evolve.
steve byrne -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, fair enough. thank you, john. i did want to ask you about your view of your competitors in epoxy resins. do you have an estimate of what fraction of your epoxy resin competitors are back integrated into benzene and propylene? and how much of those raw materials, do you have long-term supply agreements for?
pat d. dawson -- executive vice president and president-epoxy and international
yeah. so steve this is pat. i mean, first of all, no one, none of the epoxy competitors are back integrated into the hydrocarbons into benzene or propylene. so it's pretty clear, quite frankly very few of our competitors, actually only, i think we're the only one that's fully back integrated into chlor alkali and we use both chlorine and caustic and net liberator of caustic soda when we're making our epichlorohydrin. so we have the best integrated position than anyone out there and people like huntsman are -- have moved really downstream and are no longer really in the upstream or quite frankly the midstream, so i hope that answers your question.
steve byrne -- bank of america -- analyst
yes, thank you.
operator
our next question comes from arun viswanathan of rbc capital. arun, please proceed.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great, thanks, good morning, guys. yeah, i just wanted to ask back on the caustic price kind of evolution and outlook. so i think going into q4, the thought was that operating rates would come down on the chlorine side, and that would support potentially some pricing on caustic, i guess, what you're communicating is that did happen, but the demand in caustic has been materially weaker than you expected. and so we are in a little bit of a state of oversupply in caustic. my question is, assuming that the pricing doesn't necessarily go up in q4, usually when we enter q1 and q2, we see a tick back up in operating rates and potentially that would further prevent pricing progress.
so is that kind of your base case for the progression over the next quarter or two, that pricing will remain muted. and if so is demand improvement in caustic the main driver of what's going to drive a slightly better caustic pricing environment.
john e. fischer -- chairman of the board, president, chief executive officer
i would come back to -- to start the basic issue for a chlor alkali producer is not necessarily the absolute demand for chlorine or caustic but demand for one relative to the other. so to answer your question, we would have to make or establish the premise of what happens to chlorine demand. we are seeing as i gave the example of a large chlorine customer not buying any chlorine for four weeks earlier this quarter.
we are seeing chlorine demand slowdown, also we talked about that as it relating to chlorinated organics and some other things, i don't know that we see clearly enough right now. to know what's going to happen, i think, i don't think chlorine demand is that much greater than caustic demand, it doesn't feel that way to us. and if we had a couple of percentage point decline in operating rate more than what we see in the fourth quarter carrying over into the first quarter. you could see caustic prices move up somewhat. i think we're sort of on the -- what i'll call the edge of balance and imbalance.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
and then just as a follow-up. so if you look at your three businesses you've laid out the incremental improvement that could happen in winchester relatively clearly. so we can understand that. i guess chlor alkali as you just pointed out, it's going to depend on chlorine and caustic demand and assuming those were maybe driven by construction and industrial production. and then, i guess what about epoxy, i guess if you think about the drivers from here, you had mentioned kind of a $250 million level of normalized ebitda in the past. is there a path to that still that you can lay out in 2020 or 2021?
pat d. dawson -- executive vice president and president-epoxy and international
yeah, i think, this is pat again. clearly, we're very confident that there is a path to $250 million to $300 million in epoxy and the real drivers to that is around the demand side, first of all, and historically demand in epoxy has grown around 3%. i mean this year, we see growth flat at best. europe, the second largest epoxy market in the world has been flat since the middle of '18. so no question, we need to see that demand come back and this whole industrial funk that we have seen hitting us has really impacted the demand for epoxy, certainly centered around what's happened in automotive, electronics and industrial coatings, so we need to see demand come back, but as we outlined at the february investors discussion, you've got operating rates today in epi and liquid epoxy resins in the mid to high-80s.
and so if we just get some demand coming back, we think we're in a good position in our cost position and we think, we're in a good position to grow and expand these margins through volume increases here over the next several years.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay, great. and then just lastly, i just wanted to come back to the idea of no new capacity. again, it does appear that there are several players who are looking at building some extra chloro vinyls capacity here and there has been some installations of a lot of ethylene here. and so just wondering at what point would you expect new capacity announcements. well, what is it going to take, is it going to take a much better caustic pricing environments, some improved environment on the chlorine side and ethylene? and so i guess, implicit in your assumption that there is not going to be much capacity build -- built, would that also imply that that pricing for these products is going to stay relatively muted? thanks.
john e. fischer -- chairman of the board, president, chief executive officer
i think the biggest two factors that you have to look at is what's the price of pvc and what's the price of caustic. and right now neither of them are anywhere close to what it would take to justify a significant investment in the entire chlor vinyls chain at least through pvc and depending on who it is maybe through ethylene. so i think and we showed a slide back in february that showed we're a long way from where reinvestment economics are for those today.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay, great, thanks.

our next question comes from john roberts of ubs. john, please proceed .
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
thank you. back on lake city, a lot has been going on with atk since its orbital deal and then its northrop grumman deal. did it become non-core for them, i'm just trying to get a sense at how competitive the bidding was or what it was that allowed olin to win this back after so many years?
john e. fischer -- chairman of the board, president, chief executive officer
john, to the best of my knowledge, atk was not a bidder for the contract. i believe other bidders were general dynamics and northrop grumman and i think that orbital business is actually today sitting in northrop grumman.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
right. that's what i meant. it went -- the operating went through orbital, then in northrop grumman, but they did bid to keep it then.
john e. fischer -- chairman of the board, president, chief executive officer
they did bid to keep it, yes.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
okay. and then do you think, imo 2020 could increase export caustic and edc freight costs here and maybe result in a little bit lower netbacks as we get into next year?
james a. varilek -- chief operating officer, executive vice president
this is jim. i wouldn't expect it to have a major impact. there may be some demand, but we, it's probably going to be small enough that we may have a hard time finding it, but we'll take anything to the positive, but i don't think it's going to be a big impact.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
no, i was asking whether your freight cost would go up and therefore maybe the netbacks be a little bit lower.
james a. varilek -- chief operating officer, executive vice president
i don't think that's going to drive freight costs.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
our next question comes from travis edwards of goldman sachs. travis, please proceed.
travis edwards -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, good morning, two quick questions or clarification for me. first on free cash flow next year, you provided a little bit of detail on some of the elements impacting that, but as you think about the upcoming ethylene payment to dow if you're generating cash, maybe buying back shares opportunistically. are you planning to address that payment just using cash in the balance sheet or are -- you think you'll have to pull down a bit on that revolver?
james a. varilek -- chief operating officer, executive vice president
i would say at this point. we haven't given any guidance on what we intend to do there.
travis edwards -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thank you. second question is on the lake city contract, you touched on this a bit on the prepared remarks, but again, just question or clarification, is there any sort of sensitivity to that $40 million to $50 million of incremental ebitda, is there any possible changes to the contract itself, whether that would be in the volume or pricing side between now and when you take over?
john e. fischer -- chairman of the board, president, chief executive officer
well the majority of that business is the government's business and they have a pretty good idea, because we had, our winning proposal, the prices that we bid were based on a set of volumes that they're sort of obligated to buy. so i think that's a positive, there is an ability to use that facility commercially, which i would tell you, has a high degree of probability, because we've been in that commercial market for 150 years. so i feel that there is relatively small deviation around those numbers.
travis edwards -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. [speech overlap]
john e. fischer -- chairman of the board, president, chief executive officer
and we would have a lot of warning where there to be a change.
travis edwards -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. appreciate it. thank you.

operator
good morning and welcome to the olin corporation third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to logan bonacorsi, olin's director of investor relations. please go ahead, miss.
logan bonacorsi -- director of investor relations
good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. before we begin, let me remind you that this presentation along with the associated slides and the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks will include statements regarding estimates of future performance.
please note that these are forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected. some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from our projections are described without limitations in the risk factors section of our most recent form 10-k and in yesterday's third-quarter earnings press release. a copy of today's transcript and slides will be available on our website in the investors section under past events. the earnings press release and other financial data and information are available under press releases.
with me this morning are john fischer, olin's chairman, president and chief executive officer; pat dawson, executive vice president and president epoxy and international; jim varilek, executive vice president and chief operating officer and todd slater, vice president and chief financial officer. we will begin with our prepared remarks and thereafter, we will be happy to take your questions.
i will now turn the call over to john fischer, john?
john e. fischer -- chairman of the board, president, chief executive officer
thank you, logan, and good morning, everyone. today, i'll begin my remarks by discussing the key points from the third quarter followed by our updated outlook for the remainder of 2019. a detailed overview of each of olin's business segments. our long-term view on market dynamics for chlor alkali and epoxy and conclude with the winchester segment.
with that, let's turn to slide 3. during the third quarter of 2019 , olin reported adjusted ebitda of approximately $293 million. while this represents a year-over-year decline results for the quarter improved 43% sequentially despite a challenging economic backdrop. third quarter results benefited from lower planned maintenance turnaround costs, strong operating performance, the resolution of the onetime events that affected the epoxy business during the second quarter as well as seasonally higher volumes across our business segments. however, several challenges during that period worked to offset these positives.
beginning in the middle of the third quarter, we saw a significant slowdown in demand from a broad spectrum of chemical customers. we experienced slower-than-expected demand from urethane, agricultural, refrigerant, alumina, pulp and paper, automotive, electrical laminate and industrial coatings customers. in addition to lower volumes, lower customer demand negatively affected prices for several products. we experienced lower pricing for caustic soda, ethylene dichloride, hydrochloric acid, chlorinated organics and epoxy resins.
moving now to our updated outlook for the full year, 2019, which is on slide 4. we expect full year 2019 adjusted ebitda to be between $930 million and $980 million. this compares to full year 2018 adjusted ebitda of $1.265 billion. the year-over-year decline in adjusted ebitda can be primarily attributed to three factors, an approximately $325 million impact from lower caustic soda pricing, lower epoxy resin pricing, partially offset by lower maintenance turnaround costs.
looking ahead, we expect the weak underlying demand fundamentals in our clinical businesses to persist, at least through the remainder of this year. as a result, we anticipate our fourth quarter adjusted ebitda to decline when compared to the third quarter of 2019. the fourth quarter may represent the lowest earnings quarter of the year. the key assumptions behind this forecast are lower caustic soda, ethylene dichloride, hydrochloric acid, chlorinated organics and epoxy resin pricing. lower volume levels in chlor alkali and epoxy, lower operating rates in the chemical business due to seasonally weaker demand coupled with seasonal inventory destocking and fourth quarter turnaround.
now, we'd like to take a more detailed look at each of our business segments starting with chlor alkali products and vinyls which is on slide 5. the chlor alkali products and vinyls business experienced lower demand from a broad spectrum of customers including urethane, agricultural, refrigerant, alumina and pulp and paper customers. as an example, a major chlorine customer did not buy any chlorine over four week period beginning in september. the slower demand negatively impacted both volumes and pricing. third quarter 2019, adjusted ebitda for the chlor alkali products and vinyls segment was $234.9 million representing a 29% year-over-year decline. this decline was driven by lower caustic soda pricing.
caustic soda pricing in olin system has declined more than 20% or approximately $90 million when compared to the third quarter of 2018. chlorinated organics and hydrochloric acid pricing also declined year-over-year. volume levels for caustic soda, chlorine, chlorinated organics and hydrochloric acid all declined year-over-year. offsetting some of this year-over-year pricing and volume pressure were lower raw material and operating costs. looking at the fourth quarter of 2019 and given the current demand environment, we expect results for the chlor alkali products and vinyls segment to be lower sequentially and to likely represent the lowest earnings quarter of 2019.
now let's take a closer look at caustic soda pricing which is on slide 6. caustic soda pricing in olin system declined in the third quarter, the price decline was particularly pronounced in the export market, where caustic soda pricing indices were down $55 per ton in the third quarter and $25 per ton additionally, in october. domestic pricing while lower in the third quarter and in october was more resilient due to support from a relatively stronger us economy and the cost to serve that market . looking ahead, we expect the current weakness in caustic soda demand to continue in the fourth quarter and potentially into 2020.
let us now move to the performance of our epoxy segment which is on slide 7. during the third quarter of 2019, olin's epoxy business generated adjusted ebitda of $51.1 million, a 9% decline from the level achieved in the third quarter of 2018. while these results fell short of our expectations, the first three quarters of 2019 represent olin's strongest nine month period for this segment since the acquisition of dow's chlorine products businesses in 2015. the gradually improving trend in epoxy results highlight the strength of the business is chlorine integration and the potential longer term earnings power. looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2019, we expect epoxy segment results to be lower than the fourth quarter 2018 results.
sequentially, we anticipate seasonally lower volume levels, stable raw material costs and unfavorable pricing trends to affect quarterly results. we now believe 2019 epoxy segment adjusted ebitda will be lower than last year's levels due to lower margins, partially offset by lower maintenance turnaround costs. looking now at global epoxy resin prices which are shown in the exhibit on slide 8. during the third quarter, liquid epoxy resin pricing continue to move lower in all regions. the average global epoxy resin pricing has declined approximately 15% during the first nine months of 2019. the price declines have primarily been driven by demand weakness from global automotive, electrical laminate and industrial coating customers. a bright spot in the epoxy business has been sales in the wind energy sector, which are forecast to increase approximately 15% in 2019 compared to 2018.
before moving to the winchester segment, i would like to emphasize the long-term outlook for our chemicals businesses, which is on slide 9. demand for olin's key products such as caustic soda, chlorine, chlorinated organics, ethylene dichloride and epoxy resins have been weaker in 2019 than 2018. production levels for alumina and pulp and paper, two key end use markets for caustic soda have declined. demand for epoxy resin in europe, olin's largest epoxy market has been flat and hydrochloric acid demand in north america has declined due to weaker demand from oil and gas producers.
in spite of these near term dynamics, we continue to believe market fundamentals for chlor alkali, vinyl and epoxy products will be supported by favorable long-term supply and demand fundamentals. we continue to believe that there will be demand growth for the chlor alkali sector on both sides of the ecu, both chlorine and chlorine derivatives as well as caustic soda. capacity growth will lag demand. to-date there have been minimal global capacity additions and announcements of additions to meet projected demand growth. the us will continue to enjoy a sustained energy and feedstock advantage over the rest of the world.
current industry economics do not support world scale chlor alkali investments, ultimately over the long-term supply and demand balances will tighten resulting in upward pricing momentum for olin's caustic soda, chlorine and chlorine derivative products. similarly in the epoxy business, we see global demand growth and minimal capacity additions.
now let's move and talk about our winchester segment which is on slide 10. winchester experienced its first quarterly year-over-year increase since 2016 ending the third quarter of 2019 with adjusted ebitda of $19.1 million. the 26% improvement was a result of higher commercial, military and law enforcement volumes and favorable commodity and operating costs. lower year-over-year product pricing partially offset the improvements. we are forecasting a sequential decline in adjusted ebitda during the fourth quarter, consistent with the businesses normal seasonality. we continue to expect winchester's results for the full year 2019 to be comparable to or slightly better than the full year levels achieved in 2018.
now turning to the lake city contract in slide 11. late in the third quarter, it was announced that olin's winchester segment secured the contract to operate the government owned lake city us army ammunition facility in independence, missouri. this award is transformational for the winchester business. after a one-year transition period, winchester will assume operational control of the facility on october 1, 2020. the contract has an initial term of seven years and we expect this multi-year contract will drive a significant increase in annual profitability for the segment starting in late 2020. we estimate increased annual revenue of between $450 million and $550 million and a corresponding improvement in annual adjusted ebitda of $40 million to $50 million.
the full year effect of the lake city contract will begin in 2021. i would like to highlight several other near term enhancements that will improve cash flows as we transition from 2020 to 2021 and these are shown on slide 12. in 2021, we expect incremental cash generation of approximately $225 million from items within olin's control or that are contractually committed. the refinancing of the high-cost bonds, which were issued as part of the dow acquisition in 2015 will become callable in late 2020 and are expected to reduce interest expense by $50 million to $70 million annually. the winding down of the multi-year information technology project to integrate the acquired dow chlorine products businesses will save approximately $100 million of capital and expense spending.
the vinyl chloride monomer contract is transitioning from the toll manufacturing arrangement that has been in place since the acquisition to a direct customer sale agreement beginning on january 1, 2021. and finally, the full-year effect of the new lake city army ammunition contract. these cash flow enhancements of approximately $225 million provide significant incremental cash flows to olin independent of industry conditions.
and with that, i'd like to turn the call over to todd slater, olin's cfo. todd.
todd a. slater -- chief financial officer, vice president
thanks, john and good morning, everyone. the accelerated share repurchase program that was announced on august 5 was completed in early october. 5.7 million shares of olin's common stock were repurchased for $100 million. also during the third quarter, olin completed a $750 million bond offering and a new $2 billion bank credit facility. we are able to -- we were able to establish a low risk pathway to refinance high-cost bonds assumed during the 2015 dow acquisition, and when they become callable in late 2020, while increasing our financial flexibility.
now let's turn to our updated 2019 cash flow forecast, which is on slide 13. assuming the midpoint of our full-year adjusted ebitda guidance, we expect to generate approximately $230 million of free cash flow in 2019. from the midpoint of our adjusted ebitda forecast, which is on the far left of the waterfall chart, we deduct $30 million in estimated cash tax payments. the cash taxes paid in 2019 are almost all attributable to earnings in foreign jurisdiction.
column three reflects the midpoint of our current forecast for capital spending of $375 million, which includes annual maintenance capital spending of between $225 million and $275 million and the investment associated with our multiyear information technology integration project of approximately $70 million. as we previously discussed in 2017, we began a multi-project to implement new enterprise resource planning, manufacturing and engineering systems across the heritage olin and the acquired dow chlorine products businesses. the project also includes the required information technology infrastructure.
now turning to the fourth column, we are expecting a $25 million increase in working capital in 2019, as we use cash from our -- from the refinancing to reduce the sale of receivables under our factoring arrangement. in the next column, onetime items include information technology integration costs and cash restructuring costs of approximately $90 million. this includes approximately $50 million for the it integration project that i just spoke about and approximately $25 million of duplicate it costs being incurred during the transition. these costs are partially offset by $20 million of pre-tax proceeds from the sale of an investment in non-consolidated affiliates in the first quarter.
the next column represents cash interest expense. as of september 30, we had approximately 5% of our debt at variable interest rates. in the far right column, we are forecasting $250 million -- $230 million of free cash flow. now i'd like to move on to olin's priorities for free cash flow, which are on slide 14. since the acquisition in 2015, olin has utilized its cash flow repaying approximately $500 million of debt, repurchasing $190 million of olin common stock or 6% of shares outstanding, and continuing our consistent quarterly dividend. looking ahead, our 2020 priorities for free cash flow will be expanding our cash position on the balance sheet in advance of the approximately $490 million ethylene payment at the end of 2020.
as a reminder, this investment will provide olin additional cost based ethylene for 20 years and support the vcm contract. after 2020, we expect to use our free cash flow to reduce debt levels, reward shareholders and invest in our pipeline of low cost organic growth projects. these growth opportunities exist in smaller increments across the chlorine envelop and our production platform and can be implemented as market conditions warrant.
finally, on wednesday, october 23, olin 's board of directors declared a dividend of $0.20 on each share of olin common stock. the dividend is payable on december 10, 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on november 12, 2019. this is the 372nd [phonetic] core -- consecutive quarterly dividend to be paid by the company. operator, we are now ready to take questions.

thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] and our first question will come from neel kumar of morgan stanley. please go ahead.
neel kumar -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, good morning.
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning.
neel kumar -- morgan stanley -- analyst
i know you mentioned that january costs in edc prices are approximately 15% below the average 2019 price. can you just give us a sense of what type of ebitda headwind that could translate to assuming prices remain at january levels.
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we made a comment in -- just made a comment in the remarks, that said, if all prices that we discussed, which was caustic, edc, hcl and then epoxy resins remained at current levels throughout the year. the negative impact would be approximately $250 million.
neel kumar -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you. and then you talked about some cost containment and productivity initiatives in 2019 to offset the cost of pricing initiatives. so can you just give us a sense of some examples of this and what initiatives you have in place for 2020 in addition to the plant closure that should reduce your cost by $35 million?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, we talked about pretty significantly lower raw material costs both in the chlor alkali sector from electricity and ethylene, and in the epoxy sector from benzene and propylene. and we also talked about 6% reduction in our employees and head -- contractor head count and that occurred in 2018. and i would tell you there is an added benefit just from that because that was not in place all year in 2019. and we expect to reduce that head count an additional 4% in 2020, and we also expect again to benefit from lower raw material costs, both on the electricity and ethylene side as well as benzene and propylene.
neel kumar -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
and our next question will come from kevin mccarthy of vertical research partners. please go ahead.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
yes, good morning. on slide 12, you show an expected payment of $493 million to procure more ethylene. my recollection is that you had an option to do so. and so my question is, if we fast forward to december and it turns out that ethylene prices are quite low for whatever reason. do you have the ability to defer that payment? would that be feasible or impractical?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i think that is, that is totally impractical. it allows us access to cost-based ethylene for 20 years. it matches up with the new vinyls contract we've already negotiated. so i would say that and as todd mentioned in his remarks, vinyls is one of the two --that plant is one of the two most important plants in our system. and we're not going to do anything to jeopardize that. so that's in our mind not practical.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
understood, thank you for that clarification. second, i wanted to ask about working capital. todd, if we look at the balance sheet, accounts receivable, for example declined $16 million year-over-year or about 2%. looks like payables were up, can you speak to those line items in the context of the relatively large price declines that you quantified in the prepared remarks? why did we not see more of a change there?
todd a. slater -- chief financial officer and vice president
kevin, good question. in receivables, we do, we do factor our receivables as sold. so, year-end to year-end directionally, you're looking at about $70 million in less receivables sold. so when you factor then to the equation, receivables was actually down fairly consistent with the sales change and accounts payable and you see inventory is down as well. those are much more in line.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
i see. thank you for that clarification.
operator
and our next question will come from don carson of susquehanna financial. please go ahead.
don carson -- susquehanna financial -- analyst
thank you. john, seems you're kind of in a situation where chlorine demand is stronger than current caustic demand. so with early restocking in pvc domestically boosting chlorine demand. how do you see industry operating rates and olin operating rates in chlor alkali for the first and second quarters on a year-over-year basis?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
what i'd like to do is answer that historically. we believe from the time we made the dow acquisition through the end of 2018, olin's operating rates were actually slightly better than the industry. in 2019, we believe that reversed. we have a significantly larger exposure to the urethanes chain, both mdi and propylene oxide producers than we do to the vinyls chain. so i believe in 2019, our operating rate was probably a little bit lower than the industry. and i would suggest that based on what we've seen so far in january that will continue early in 2020.
don carson -- susquehanna financial -- analyst
okay. and then just switching to epoxy. so given the level of demand and where raws are is the fourth quarter ebitda of roughly $36 million, is that kind of a good run rate for each quarter as we go through 2020? or do you see any potential upside?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, the run rate is heavily influenced by turnaround schedules, i would suggest, based on the turnaround schedule we forecast that you're going to see a weaker level in q2. and then seasonally, we typically see q3 be stronger. and i would say if you looked at the pattern we saw in 2019 that's a good pattern.
don carson -- susquehanna financial -- analyst
and final question, just on winchester. you've talked in the past about a lot of channel inventory and customer inventory. where do you think we are in that right now? you think we're at the point where industry small caliber shipments can actually equal final ultimate demand?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i think we saw that developing as we moved through 2019. i think the one wildcard that the industry is faced is the withdrawal of walmart from certain industry categories specifically pistol ammunition and hunter's sporting rifle ammunition, which they essentially exited the business by december 1 and sold out their entire inventory. so i actually think we saw some purchasing at the end of the year in excess of what we would normally see. and we're going to see inventory replenishment, but it's not at walmart. so the, what i'll say is the view is a little muddled at the moment.
don carson -- susquehanna financial -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
and our next question will come from frank mitsch of fermium research. please go ahead.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
yeah, good morning folks. listen, regarding the chlor alkali shutdown announced in december, so hoping you might talk a little bit more about the thought process behind that. i guess, i'm assuming that was on the higher end of your cost curve. do you anticipate other shutdowns either by yourselves or by or by the competition?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well frank, we announced that as part in concert with the shutdown of a chlorine derivative, which we've seen just declining demand to the point where it doesn't make sense to run the plant and that just gave us the opportunity to shut down the chlor alkali plant that feeds it or on the site, it actually creates less demand. i'm not sure i want to comment on what other people are going to do. we're going to manage our system to optimize our costs and if we get in a place where plant makes no sense from an economic perspective, we will take action.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
got you, got you. and just curious, i mean i know it's very early days with respect to the corona virus, but it seems to be a topic that comes up everywhere, and just my gut would suggest that olin might be a beneficiary in terms of disinfectants etc. are you seeing any change in purchasing patterns with respect to the corona virus?
pat d. dawson -- executive vice president and president
yeah, frank. this is pat. listen, first of all, i think it's important to remember that our exposure as olin is very, very small. china represents less than 5% of our overall revenues. we do have, we do have an epoxy plant over in china that serves mainly our downstream markets and this facility is currently down as it normally is this time of the year and will start back up next week. so really at the moment, back to your question. we haven't really seen any direct impact to our businesses, but we're monitoring that and watching it very closely to see if it could benefit us on the chlorine side as this evolve.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
yeah, no, i would have anticipated that you would have seen bleach sales and chlorine sales move up, but at this point it's too early -- it's too early to make that call.
pat d. dawson -- executive vice president and president
yes.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
all right, thank you so much.
operator
our next question will come from mike sison of wells fargo. please go ahead.
mike sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
hey guys, good morning. when you talked about the $250 million negative for pricing in 2020, prices remain at fourth quarter levels. is that more front-end loaded? does it primarily hit you in the first and second quarter? any thoughts on how that, how that flushes through?
todd a. slater -- chief financial officer and vice president
let me clarify something. that's based on -- that $250 million is based on the pricing we saw in january, not fourth quarter.
mike sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
got it.
todd a. slater -- chief financial officer and vice president
and obviously if you're looking at year-over-year comparisons, the gap narrows as we move through the year.
mike sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay, great. and just yeah, i know it's tough to forecast and predict, but what do you think needs to happen to get some momentum in chlor and caustic prices as the year unfolds?
james a. varilek -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
mike, this is jim. what we really need is we need that the industrial production side of things to grow. we would love to see a pickup in the automotive market. also some of the aluminum markets like aerospace, aircrafts, commercial aircrafts and so forth. and if we saw those pick up that would obviously start to rebalance things between chlor -- within chlorine and caustic side.
mike sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
our next question will come from jim sheehan of suntrust. please go ahead.
jim sheehan -- suntrust -- analyst
thank you. good morning. a question on your earnings power. if we look back at 2014, your pro forma ebitda was $1 billion. since then the caustic soda index prices are up a bit and chlorine and edc prices are down, but natural gas prices have dropped from around $4 to $2.50. that should have given you a net ebitda tailwind. and then when you consider cost synergies of $250 million and revenue synergies on top of that, you should have been able to generate about $1.3 billion or $1.4 billion of ebitda in 2019, based on your sensitivities. but you did $941 million in 2019. that's about $60 million below the level of pro forma five years ago. how do you explain not being able to grow ebitda over 2014 pro forma?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i would say, i think you've thrown a lot of things at us there, and i would prefer to write down what you said and get back to you on that point, because we're not going to pound through the pro forma and all the differences that i'm not saying you're wrong. i'm not sure exactly or about the veracity of everything you said.
jim sheehan -- suntrust -- analyst
okay, fair enough. now it looks like your ebitda is declining in 2020 at the current price levels, which means your net debt to ebitda ratio might be rising. if pricing continues to erode, are you in any danger of tripping debt covenants this year?
todd a. slater -- chief financial officer and vice president
jim. as you know, in december, we redid our bank agreements that expands our leverage ratio for the next two and a half years to which should enable us to ensure a level of compliance. and so we would expect that we will be fully in compliant including the investment outflows in 2020 with our bank, with our bank agreements. and don't forget about the $250 million of incremental cash flow that starts in late '20 and is full bore in 2021.
jim sheehan -- suntrust -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
and our next question will come from matthew blair of tudor, pickering and holt. please go ahead.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering and holt -- analyst
good morning. thank you. john, you mentioned the pricing environment was clearly pretty tough in q4. could you just provide some commentary on just overall volumes and just overall demand trends as you progressed throughout the quarter? would you say that december was either stronger or weaker from a volume standpoint, compared to october?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, october -- in october, we had some turnarounds. so that's not a valid comparison. i would say that what we saw in december, in the fourth quarter generally was quite a bit weaker than what we saw in the third quarter and that was across the spectrum of chemical products.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering and holt -- analyst
got it. and then, any thoughts on edc supply demand. it looks like several new edc plants in south korea and china this year could raise global capacity by over 3%. what do you project for demand? and is there a concern that edc might weaken as you progress through the year?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i don't know, i'm not going to forecast what it's going to do. what i would say is we've actually seen edc in january and february. and as we look at march can pick up in terms of demand and pick up a little bit in terms of pricing.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering and holt -- analyst
sounds good. thanks.
operator
our next question will come from eric petrie of citi. please go ahead.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
hi, good morning, john.
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
so us export prices for caustic soda declined to $200 to $250 per ton. can you just talk about the arbitrage windows that are still existent for you? and talk on how you're seeing transport cost developed?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
obviously, the best of arbitrage for olin is to stay out of the straight export market and i would say when you look at those prices, those are not prices that olin sold at. our best situation is to continue to export if you will into latin america, where we continued to build out a distribution system, and where we get prices significantly higher than what you see in the export market.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
okay. for my second question, a competitor recently announced epoxy price initiatives. have you done the same? and then, broadly, could you change your strategy to go more downstream to support that near-term earnings target of $250 million of ebitda?
james a. varilek -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yeah. hi, eric. just a couple of comments. first of all, we had increases out there in january, we had very modest success with that. we do have increases out there for february as well. and your last point, we do continue to build our downstream businesses around formulated products, around wind and a few other areas. so that is a part of our strategic thrust as well.
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
but i want to emphasize we are at our core chlor alkali producer, which means we are going to stay in the upstream of the epoxy chain, that's where our strength is. and that's what we're trying to leverage.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question will come from mike leithead of barclays. please go ahead.
michael leithead -- barclays -- analyst
thanks guys, good morning.
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning.
michael leithead -- barclays -- analyst
i guess just two quick ones on the input side of the equation. first on your chlor alkali ebitda sensitivity table, i know you added a little asterisk where you mentioned there might be some impact to the sensitivity because of your hedging activities for inputs. so i guess can you just give us a sense of the level of cost-benefit you expect to realize in 2020. since my guess is, it's probably less than what the sensitivity would imply given where natural gas prices are today.
todd a. slater -- chief financial officer and vice president
this is todd. if you you -- as you -- as everyone on the call knows we are a hedger, we do hedge gas and ethane for ethylene needs on a rolling four quarter basis. if you look today at where our hedge position is for natural gas and ethylene, ethane for 2020 as well as a current futures number for 2020, you're probably looking at good news year-over-year, '20 versus '19 in the $40 million plus range.
michael leithead -- barclays -- analyst
got it. okay, that's helpful. and then to tie-in with that. you mentioned earlier, kind of rough $250 million headwind number on pricing. if we run rate january numbers, is that net of this benefit from cost reduction? or is that just purely run rating gross pricing?
todd a. slater -- chief financial officer and vice president
that is run rating gross pricing.
michael leithead -- barclays -- analyst
okay, perfect. thank you.
operator
and our next question will come from stephen byrne of bank of america. please go ahead.
steve byrne -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, you made some comments about the supply and demand imbalance on the chlor alkali chain that's leading to the lower pricing in caustic but yet pricing on the chlorine derivatives are not very favorable either. is it your view that chlor alkali industry is too fragmented for there to be any idling of capacity to tighten this market up and drive pricing up?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no, i don't believe that at all. i think if you looked at the industry operating rates they are in the mid 80s. so we're just -- we're suffering from two things, we are suffering from lack of overall demand. and then the imbalance between chlorine and caustic at less than optimal levels.
steve byrne -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
well, maybe an extension of this then on the epoxy side, you commented about some of the end markets being weak and yet your volumes went up, is that, is it logical to push more volume in a declining price environment? or do you have the ability to tighten that by cutting back on production rates?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. the thing i would point out is that in 2018, we had two very significant 60 day turnarounds, one at our plant in europe, one at our plant in the united states. so the 2019 volume increase would have been expected under all circumstances.
steve byrne -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
and then i have one question on your sg&a expense, it looks like you trimmed it in 2019 versus 2018 and perhaps that is a reflection of the headcount reduction that you mentioned earlier, but if you go back to a few years post the acquisition from dow, the sg&a expense was lower. what has been driving that up to more than offset the cost synergies from that acquisition?
todd a. slater -- chief financial officer and vice president
steve, this is todd. one of the big items that runs through sg&a that has gone up from, i'll say 2016, early 2017 levels are the cost associated with this it integration project and that number was about $77 million in 2019. so that's the big driver from what your referenced several years ago. but the sg&a was down in 2019 versus 2018 in spite of $40 million of higher it integration costs year-over-year. it was legal, consulting, incentive, stock-based compensation, i mean it was lower costs generally across the board.
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
and again, we keep emphasizing that project is scheduled to conclude at the end of 2020. and we talked about $100 million of less spending in 2021 split between capital and expense. the expense piece of that is part of the g&a.
steve byrne -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
and our next question will come from hassan ahmed of alembic global. please go ahead.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
good morning, guys. you guys were kind enough to share with us that if we were to mark to market pricing at january levels, it would be around $250 million ebitda hit. now, obviously we've seen crude oil prices and crude linked sort of raw material prices come down a fair bit. we've seen similar sort of dynamics happen on the nat gas side of things. so what would that number ebitda sort of benefit wise look like if you were to mark to market raws where they are currently in january. obviously taking into account the hedging activities and the like you mentioned?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, we said in the remarks qualitatively we expected raw material costs in both chlor alkali and epoxy to be down. todd just gave a number associated with natural gas and ethane of $40 million to $50 million and i can tell you on the epoxy side, it's a similar number to that and there are some other benefits coming from that.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
understood, understood, very helpful. now moving on in q3, during the conference call, you guys talked about sort of continued destocking in caustic. i mean with pricing sort of sliding more, i would imagine that sort of you can continue through q4 as well. so where do you see sort of industry inventory levels right now.
james a. varilek -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
this is jim. i think you're correct. from a customer standpoint with a declining price environment it's natural for them to run inventories down and that started as early as the third quarter and moved through the end of the year. so we believe that customer inventories have moved down. i can't really speak to producer inventories. all i can say is that olin's inventories are lower at the end of the year than they were in the third quarter.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
super. thanks so much guys.
operator
and our next question will come from jeff zekauskas of jp morgan. please go ahead.
jeff zekauskas -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thanks, very much. you're shutting down a chlor alkali plant and a vdc plant. and you talked about the chlor alkali plant being 230,000 tons. maybe the vdc plant buy some caustic soda and maybe you're not running at a high rate of the plants you're going to shut down. so what's the net capacity closure really for the industry in the shutting down of those units. and do you plan to shut them down in the first half or the second half?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
the capacity around chlorine and caustic soda is as we stated, 230,000 tons. we've planned to shut these down in the second half of the year, we have contracts on the vdc side to run out and that then we'll be shutting them down.
jeff zekauskas -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. and when you totaled up your, i think it's a $105 million transition costs and additional working capital for lake city in 2020, would there be more in 2021 in terms of building working capital or would we be done?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
assuming that the business level at lake city from the army remains at a constant level we would be done.
jeff zekauskas -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay, great. all right, thank you very much.
operator
and our next question will come from arun viswanathan of rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great, thanks, good morning. you guys delineated the price impact around $250 million, but just curious on the volume side, last year when you provided guidance in q2 and q3 you thought that volumes had provided over $100 million uplift in the second half. i guess, did that materialize and if not, is that something that we could look forward to when markets recover?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
that did not materialize. we said that the economic climate for us weakened throughout the year and that weakness accelerated in the fourth quarter. so i think from our perspective, especially if you look at some of the chains we serve on the chlorine side, urethanes, we would hope very much that there is a potential uptick in 2020 on a volume -- perspective.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. so just, just going with that i guess, in the past you provided different walks to mid cycle ebitda in $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion range of $1 billion of annual ebitda, is that i guess still within the realm of possibility? and what would it really take, it seems like there has been not a large amount of capacity additions in chlor alkali, you guys are potentially shutting down a facility? or i guess are you surprised at all that pricing has been so difficult in many of the products, especially things -- if supply is tight right now. and you're still not able to achieve some pricing. i know that demand has obviously been weak, but is there anything other than a weak demand realizing or resulting in this weak price capture? thanks.
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
from our perspective, we believe it is weak demand that is driving the prices down. you asked what it would take to get back up into the $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion, we talked about, we experienced $450 million of negative price on caustic soda plus the epoxy resin chain in 2019 versus 2018. and if i add that back to the ebitda of 2019, we actually exceeded 2018's ebitda. all the things [indecipherable] obviously, they are not.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
right. and then just lastly, just going back to the industry structure question, i guess why wouldn't there be any further transactions. when i look at operating rates i guess in the mid 80s and then the potential for a relatively attractive north american production base. it would seem that some players may want to and maybe from an international standpoint or whatever it is in the caustic and you could see more consolidation. do you expect more consolidation in this space? and would you be in a position to drive that? thanks.
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i think it is from our perspective, highly unlikely that olin given its current market share in north america could participate in the consolidation.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and our next question will come from john roberts of ubs, please go ahead.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
thank you. back to frank's original question on china. would you hazard a guess as to how much of the cost of capacity in epoxy capacity in china is operating at below normal rates right now?
james a. varilek -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
this is jim, that's a pretty tough, tough call to make. i would say that there is a, they did extend the chinese new year, they extended that and they do have plant -- their plants down. i can't give you a number on that, but i would just say that there is -- there's obviously more shut down than there traditionally is even though you are in the winter time periods. that's, that's about as good as i can do. john.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
okay and then just accounting question here, todd. on the $75 million for the vcm contract change, i assume that's primarily the expected margin on the ethylene that you're going to get, what's the revenue change associated with going to consolidating to bcm sales and how much depreciation do we put against that $75 million. can we just take the $493 million and straight line it over 20 years?
todd a. slater -- chief financial officer and vice president
so i'll start with the back and work my way forward. yeah, the $493 million divided by 20 will be the amortization. that's right. we've not given a guide on revenue, but the revenue effect will be higher than the $75 million. that is clearly a net number.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
okay, thank you.

",,,2020-02-05 10:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good morning, and welcome to the olin corporation fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] after today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [operator instructions] please note that this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to logan bonacorsi, olin's director of investor relations. please go ahead, ms.
logan bonacorsi -- director of investor relations
good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. before we begin, let me remind you that this presentation along with the associated slides and the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks will include statements regarding estimates of future performance. please note that these are forward-looking statements and that actual results could material -- could differ materially from those projected. some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from our projections are described without limitations in the risk factor section of our most recent form 10-k and in yesterday's fourth quarter earnings press release.
a copy of today's transcript and slides will be available on our website in the investors section under past events. the earnings press release and other financial data and information are available under press releases. with me this morning are john fischer, olin's chairman, president and chief executive officer; pat dawson, executive vice president and president of epoxy and international; jim varilek, executive vice president and chief operating officer; and todd slater, vice president and chief financial officer. we will begin with our prepared remarks and thereafter, we'll be happy to take your question.
i will now turn the call over to john fischer, john.
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you. logan, and good morning everyone. i will begin today by reviewing olin's full year 2019 results. then i will provide an overview of each of our business segments and conclude with some comments on our near-term and long-term outlook for olin and the markets in which we participate. with that, let's turn to slide 3.
during the fourth quarter of 2019, olin reported adjusted ebitda of approximately $173 million, which resulted in full year 2019 adjusted ebitda of $941 million. this level of adjusted ebitda reflects the challenging macroeconomic environment that developed during the year and worsened during the fourth quarter. in particular, the chlor alkali products and vinyls business experienced a broad based weakness in demand from urethane, agricultural, refrigerant, alumina and pulp and paper customers.
the epoxy business also faced weaker demand from automotive, electrical laminate and industrial coatings customers. as you can see from the chart, the lower product demand put downward pressure on pricing, which was the driver of the lower year-over-year adjusted ebitda. the deterioration of pricing during 2019 in our chlor alkali products and vinyls business was approximately $450 million from 2018 levels, and the deterioration in our epoxy business was approximately $260 million. there were a number of factors that help partially offset these price declines. lower raw material costs of approximately $130 million in our chlor alkali products and vinyls segment, primarily related to lower electricity and ethylene costs. we realized lower raw material costs in the epoxy business of approximately $215 million primarily benzene and propylene.
olin accelerated its ongoing activities to lower our cost structure and to improve our efficiency. operating and administrative costs in 2019 were approximately $90 million lower than 2018 levels. as a point of reference, since late 2018, olin's total employee and contractor headcount was reduced by approximately 6%, and in an additional reduction of approximately 4% is expected to incur in 2020. now we'd like to take a more detailed look at the quarterly results for each of our business segments starting with chlor alkali products and vinyls, which is shown on slide 4.
fourth quarter 2019 adjusted ebitda for the chlor alkali products and vinyls segment was $142.5 million, representing a 46% year-over-year decline. as previously discussed, this decline was driven chiefly by the declines in product pricing. for the fourth quarter, caustic soda pricing in olin system declined approximately 24% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. at the same time, year-over-year ethylene dichloride experienced power -- lower pricing of approximately 23%, and hydrochloric acid pricing declined approximately 40%. partially offsetting this year-over-year pricing pressure was the improved cost performance as well as the lower raw material costs that i just discussed.
now let's take a closer look at caustic soda pricing, which is on slide 5. during the fourth quarter and into january 2020, caustic soda prices continued to move lower as demand weakness in the manufacturing sector persisted. at the same time chlorine operating remained -- rates have remained relatively steady primarily due to strength in the vinyls sector, which increased the supply demand imbalance that has existed for much of the past 15 months. the caustic soda price decline has been particularly pronounced in the export market where pricing indices were down more than $80 per ton since the beginning of october and approximately $200 per ton since the end of 2018.
export caustic soda pricing has declined to levels last seen in 2010. domestic pricing while lower was more resilient due to support from a relatively stronger domestic demand environment and the overall cost to serve this market. a portion of the fourth quarter and january declines in the price indices will be experienced on our system as we progress through the early months of 2020.
let's now talk about our epoxy segment, which is shown on slide 6. epoxy's business -- olin's epoxy business generated adjusted ebitda of $36.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, which represented an 18% decline from the level achieved in the prior year period. the year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower resin pricing due to lower demand in our key markets, a trend that has challenged the business for the last 15 months. partially offsetting these market conditions during the period were lower raw material costs primarily benzene and propylene and lower operating costs driven by our ongoing productivity efforts. that said, price declines outpaced lower raw material costs resulting in further margin compression for olin as we close the year.
the epoxy segment generated $154 million of -- in adjusted ebitda for the full year 2019. while not the year-over-year improvement that was originally anticipated, it was a strong performance in the face of the challenging market landscape. we -- and we continued to believe that the strength of the epoxy business is chlorine integration and potential -- and in the potential earnings power for this part of our business.
looking now at global epoxy resin prices, which is shown on slide 8. during the fourth quarter, liquid epoxy resin pricing continued to decline in all regions. the average global epoxy resin pricing declined 20% over the course of 2019. ongoing demand weakness from global automotive, global electrical laminate and industrial coatings customers has led to global price erosion.
we also believe economic deceleration in multiple geographic regions has led to cautious buying behavior and inventory management by customers during the period. now let's turn to our winchester segment on slide 8. the winchester business continued on a positive trend, posting its second consecutive quarterly year-over-year increase. fourth quarter of 2019 adjusted ebitda was $12.5 million, which represents a 33% improvement. this was the result of higher commercial military and law enforcement volumes and favorable commodity and operating costs. lower year-over-year pricing partially offset these improvements.
2019 also marked the first year-over-year increase in annual adjusted ebitda since 2016, which was the last year of surge buying in the industry. this improvement was driven primarily by a reduction in commodity and operating costs, lower operating cost, result of ongoing cost reduction efforts in the business. moving now to our outlook for the full year 2020, which is on slide 9. as you all know, olin is primarily a commodity chemical producer with limited ability to influence pricing in large global commodity markets. given the uncertainty surrounding pricing for our chlor alkali and epoxy products and the significant and rapid impact of price changes can have on our earnings, olin will no longer provide annual adjusted ebitda guidance.
we will continue to provide our planned maintenance turnaround costs schedule, pricing sensitivities for certain commodity chemical products and other key metrics, which are included in the appendix section of our slide presentation. we do expect the weak underlying demand fundamentals in our chemical businesses to persist through at least the first quarter of 2020. we are entering the year challenged by lower chemical pricing. january 2020 pricing for caustic soda, ethylene dichloride and other chlorine derivatives as well as epoxy resins are below 2019 full year averages.
if these levels of prices are maintained throughout 2020, the impact of pricing on 2020 results compared to 2019 would be in the $250 million range. during january, we have seen demand across our chemicals portfolio consistent with fourth quarter levels. we expect lower raw materials in both our chlor alkali products and vinyls and epoxy segments to be -- in 2020 compared to 2019. the lower costs are related to electricity, ethylene, benzene and propylene. we will continue to focus on the variables within our control by working to reduce operational and administrative costs and expect them to decline in 2020 compared to 2019.
we are also anticipating an increased contribution from our winchester segment, primarily driven by the uplift from the lake city us army ammunition contract beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. as we have previously discussed, our winchester business secured a multi-year contract with the us army to operate the lake city army ammunition plant in independence, missouri. upon completion of the one-year transition period, we expect this multi-year contract will drive a significant increase in annual profitability for winchester starting in the fourth quarter of this year. we estimate increased annual revenue of between $450 million and $550 million, and corresponding increase in annual adjusted ebitda of $40 million to $50 million. i would like to underscore the long-term -- now like to underscore the long-term outlook for our chemical businesses, which is on slide 10.
in spite of the weaknesses we are currently experiencing, we continue to believe that market fundamentals will be supported and bolstered by long-term structural forces in the chlor alkali supply and demand. in fact, we continue to believe that there will be demand growth for the chlor alkali sector on both sides of the ecu. to date, there has been minimal global capacity additions and announcements of additions to meet this projected demand growth. and as a reminder, in december, olin announced chlor alkali products' capacity reductions. the us will continue to enjoy a sustained energy and feedstock advantage over the rest of the world. current industry economics do not support world scale chlor alkali capital investments and ultimately over the long-term supply and demand balances will tighten resulting in upward pricing momentum for olin's caustic soda, chlorine, and chlorine derivative products.
similarly in the epoxy business, we see global demand growth and minimal capacity additions. before i turn the call over to todd, i'd like to emphasize that olin remains on very solid financial footing. in 2020, olin expects to generate positive cash flows after the payment of the normal quarterly dividend and before the one-time investments that todd will discuss. and this assumes the full year negative impact of no change in the current product pricing and no positive cost offsets.
with that, i'll turn it over to todd.
todd a. slater -- chief financial officer and vice president
thanks, john. and good morning everyone. let's turn to our full year 2019 cash flow detail, which is on slide 11. we generated approximately $252 million of free cash flow in 2019. starting with our adjusted ebitda, $941 million, which is in the far left of the waterfall chart, we deduct $36 million in cash tax payments, which are almost all attributable to earnings in foreign jurisdictions.
column 3 reflects our capital spending of $386 million, which includes annual maintenance capital spending and the investment associated with our multiyear information technology integration project of approximately $56 million. as we've previously discussed in 2017, we began a multiyear project to implement new enterprise resource planning, manufacturing and engineering systems across the chemical businesses. the project includes the required information technology infrastructure.
now turning to the fourth column, one-time items include information technology integration costs and cash restructuring costs of approximately $100 million. this includes approximately $49 million of it integration project cost that i just spoke about, and approximately $28 million of duplicate it costs being incurred during the transition. these costs were partially offset by $20 million of pre-tax proceeds from the sale of an investment in a non-consolidated affiliate during the first quarter. the next column represents our cash interest expense for 2019.
as of december 31, we had approximately 5% of our debt at variable interest rates. in the next column, we had a $11 million decrease in working capital in 2019, primarily as a result of lower accounts receivable attributed to lower level of sales in the fourth quarter of 2014, which was offset by a reduction in the sale of receivables under our factoring program. in the far right column, we had $252 million of free cash flow.
now i'd like to move to olin's investment requirements in 2020, which we will review on slide 12. in order to complete several initiatives to improve long-term cash flow for olin, 2020 will include investments that are outlined on this slide. the final ethylene tranche payment of approximately $493 million at year-end. this will provide ethylene a producer based economics needed to supply the new vcm contract, which will commence at the beginning of 2021. a total of approximately $110 million for the capital, project cost and duplicate it costs being incurred during the transition of our multiyear information technology integration project. this project is winding down.
by the end of 2019, approximately 30% of olin's chemical users were successfully converted to the new systems. during 2020 most of the remaining chemical users will be converted to the new systems. olin expects to refinance the high-cost bonds, which were assumed during the 2015 dow acquisition, and will become callable in the fourth quarter of 2020 with the call premium of approximately $42 million. finally, olin will incur transition costs and working capital investments required for the new lake city us army ammunition contract.
when finalized, these necessary and value creating investments will be a catalyst for improved cash generation beginning in late 2020 and fully in 2021 and beyond, regardless of the market environment. the cash flow benefits are highlighted on slide 13.
in 2021, we expect incremental annual cash generation of approximately $250 million from the initiatives that i just discussed. the refinancing of the high-cost bonds are expected to reduce interest expense by $50 million to $70 million annually. winding down of the multiyear information technology project will save approximately $110 million between capital and expense. the vinyl chloride monomer contract which is transitioning from the toll manufacturing arrangement that's been in place since the acquisition to a direct customer sale agreement beginning on january 1 of 2021.
the vcm -- the vcm facility is one of two operations that has the most significant impact on our chlor alkali products and vinyls results. the full year effect of the new lake city us army ammunition contract and finally one initiative announced in december and was not discussed on the previous slide, and they expected $75 million [phonetic] reduction in operating costs from the permanent shutdown of a chlor alkali plant with a capacity of 230,000 tonnes and olin's vinylidene chloride production facility in freeport, texas. these closures are expected to be completed before the end of 2020. these closures will allow olin to optimize its chlor alkali operations and cost structure in freeport, texas. $35 million not $75 million.
these cash flow enhancements of approximately $250 million provide significant incremental cash flow to olin independent of industry conditions. now i'd like to conclude with olin's priorities for free cash flow, which is on slide 14. during 2020, our priorities for free cash flow will be returning capital to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend, refinancing the high cost debt in late 2020, and funding the essential investments required to enhance our businesses that we just reviewed.
finally, on friday, january 24, olin's board of directors declared a dividend of $0.20 on each share of olin common stock. the dividend is payable on march 10, 2020 to shareholders of record at the close of business on february 10, 2020. this is the 373rd consecutive quarterly dividend to be paid by the company. operator, we are now ready to take questions.

[operator instructions] the first question comes from don carson with susquehanna financial. please go ahead.
don carson -- susquehanna financial -- analyst
thank you. a couple of questions. todd, on the financing of the $493 million payment to dow for the final ethylene tranche, how do you anticipate funding that? and at current rates and access to markets, are you still anticipating calling your high-yield bonds and refinancing those?
todd a. slater -- vice president & chief financial officer
don, the as far as the dow bonds, they do, as you know, become callable in october, but they are not due until 2023 or 2025. given the lack of visibility in our outlook for our chemical businesses, we will continue to evaluate all optional uses of cash in this environment. as far as the dow ethylene payment, we would fully expect, based on our liquidity and availability under the revolver and the expansion of our ar securitization, ar factoring and the various other items that i had just went through in our prepared remarks, to be able to fund the dow payment at the end of the year.
don carson -- susquehanna financial -- analyst
and john, a follow-up on caustic outlook. saw that the index went up $20 for april. what's your expectation for may and june? and if you could sort of expand on what kind of price strength you see in caustic as we swing back to from chlorine overweighting to caustic overweighting?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, i think our view of it is reflected by the price increases we announced. we have a $60 price increase out there for may one and an $80 price increase out there for june 1. and as i said in the remarks, we're looking at 70% to 80% allocation on caustic soda as we speak. so i think we, at least in the short run, are bullish on caustic pricing.
don carson -- susquehanna financial -- analyst
thank you.
operator
the next question comes from hassan ahmed from alembic global. please go ahead.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
good morning, guys. just a question around what you guys are seeing in terms of chlor alkali or chlorovinyls sort of capacity restarts, particularly in china. obviously, all of this chatter out there about china sort of beginning to open up again and the like. but obviously, the cost curve today is quite different. oil has come down, come down hard, but clearly, that doesn't impact the chlor alkali market that much, particularly keeping in mind how coal-exposed chlorovinyl production is in china. so just would love to hear your thoughts about, are there facilities that you're hearing about in china, which are delaying their restart, curtailing their restart, maybe even considering sort of shuttering some facilities and the like? just your thoughts, china-specific about the supply situation and maybe a little more on the global side of things as well.
james a. varilek -- executive vice president & chief operating officer
this is jim. it's a bit of a choppy picture, as you might imagine, in china. i think that there were some initial restarts with some of the chlorine and chlorine derivatives being a little bit stronger. so there were some there was restarts and so forth. but then you also hear about restarts and shutdowns that have taken place. so i think china is exactly where you would expect them to be, which is trying to restart and gradually refilling supply lines and so forth. and that's up and down, as you might expect, in some of the chlor alkali side of things.
i don't know. i think that around the world right now in terms of operating rates, you hear operating rates that are in the 75% range or so. and it's interesting that, that seems to be something that you hear in a lot of different regions. so i don't have a lot of specific insights inside of china, but very choppy, which is exactly what you would expect.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
understood. understood. and as a follow-up, on the raw materials side of things, again, coming back to the oil theme, oils come down. a lot of people faring that there'll be fairly deep sort of production cuts on the shale side of things. and associated with these oil production cuts, maybe the natural gas market tightens and nat gas prices go up a fair bit. how are you guys thinking about nat gas as it pertains to you guys as a raw material? i mean, are you in the camp that you think that maybe in the near- to medium-term, natural gas prices do go up? and what are your thought processes about maybe even locking hedging or locking into sort of prices as we see them where they are today?
todd a. slater -- vice president & chief financial officer
hassan, this is todd. as you may know, we do hedge natural gas as a proxy for our energy. as you know, 70% of our energy cost comes from natural gas. generally, how we are hedged is about a quarter out, we are very heavily hedged and that we have a rolling hedge program to insulate us from price spikes. you would think we've taken advantage of some of the low prices and the low futures that you saw late in the first quarter. and so we are a hedger, and that process has continued.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
thanks so much guys.

the next question comes from kevin mccarthy with vertical research partners. please go ahead.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
[technical issues] percent. to the extent that you have gleaned some market intelligence, are your competitors on similar levels of order control at this point for caustic?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
kevin, would you repeat the question? we didn't hear the first part of it.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
yes. apologies. the question related to your order control level for caustic soda in the range of 70% to 80%. just wondering if your competitors are similarly in a position where they have to adopt similar programs and restrict supply of caustic at this point on similar levels.
james a. varilek -- executive vice president & chief operating officer
kevin, this is jim. yes, i think that everybody is in some restrictive some level of restriction. that's what you're seeing. you see the pullback on the chlorine side of things. obviously on pvc, extreme pullbacks there. and that imbalance, that was favorable to the chlorine side of things some months ago is now shifting to the other side of that. so very low chlorine demand, vinyls demand and so forth is pulling everything back. so everybody's on some degree of limitation on a going-forward basis.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then i had a second question for todd on the liquidity side. on slide 11, i didn't see any mention of a $1.2 billion delayed draw term loan facility. is that facility still available to olin? and if so, perhaps you could address what degrees of freedom you might have available to you in terms of how to deploy any proceeds from that.
todd a. slater -- vice president & chief financial officer
kevin, the delayed draw term loan is available to olin. as the current agreement stands, it is available only to call the dow bonds. but as you heard us comment in our we're evaluating everything, including alternatives available under our senior credit facility.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
thank you for that clarification.
operator
the next question comes from mike sison with wells fargo. please go ahead.
mike sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
so quick question on the on slide five in terms of the u.s. caustic demand by end use. the areas that you have flat, urethanes, auto, alumina, inorganic, it seems to me that a lot of other companies are saying those are down. so maybe could you give a little bit of color why that could be flattish in 2q?
james a. varilek -- executive vice president & chief operating officer
mike, this is jim. yes, i think what we're trying to do here is to get the momentum or the change that's taking place. and so you might talk about alumina or so forth that's been down. that's why we have it yellow here. it's remaining relatively steady to where it has been. so what you should take away from this really i mean, the whole takeaway from this slide is simply that on the left-hand side of the chlorine demand, there's a lot of red, there's significant pullback and so forth, whereas on the caustic side of things, there's a lot less concern. it doesn't mean that demand hasn't dropped, but on a relative basis, the caustic side of the equation is increasing. so it's more of a momentum chart than anything that and again, the max takeaway is more red, more yellow on the left-hand side, which has heavy pullback as opposed to the caustic side, where you've got some resiliency.
mike sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
understood. and then it's probably difficult to answer at this time, but when you think about the longer-term view for caustic and chlor alkali, and hopefully, we get out of these doldrums pretty quickly, how do you sort of rebuild some of the chlor alkali ebitda power? and i don't know if there's sort of a normalized level you think you should be at, at some point in time. and obviously, i'm not asking for exactly when. but how do you see that segment sort of rebuilding the ebitda over time?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i would go back to what we've presented in february of 2019 in our investors day, where we talked about the long-term structural situation within the industry, where when you get into whatever a normal environment, whenever that might be, you're going to get demand growth on both sides of the molecule that are not going to be supported by supply. and i actually think an event like we're undergoing right now where you've got a significant pullback in demand is going to lower the probability of additional chlor alkali capacity getting built in the near term.
mike sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
thank you.
operator
the next question is from neel kumar with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
neel kumar -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my question. i was wondering if you could just help frame for us the different moving pieces for the second quarter. what type of headwind do you expect from edc with prices going off quite a bit over the last month or so? and do you expect that as well as lower chlor alkali operating rates to largely offset the benefit from the $20 caustic price improvement in april, i guess, before considering any potential may or june increase?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
what i would say about edc, neel, is that the majority of the edc that olin sells is sold under contract. so the prices that you've seen published, we are going to experience on a lag basis. we really only sell in the spot market opportunistically. and obviously, at the prices we've seen recently, that wouldn't qualify as an opportunity. so i think the negative from edc for us in q2 is not going to be quite as dramatic as it might look like. there is obviously a demand question, and we talked about lower demand pretty much across the portfolio. i would say, at the end of the day, i think worst case, edc and the other negatives on chlorine side will offset the better caustic and the first tranche of caustic.
neel kumar -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then based on previous downturns, how long do you expect the demand imbalance between chlorine and caustic to last? is there anything different with this downturn with respect to how end market demand is evolving that may allow to persist beyond that typical duration?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
what i would say about this downturn past compared to the prior ones is this was very abrupt. i mean, i don't think anybody's ever experienced a ""global stop"" on the economy. usually, there was we experienced cyclical wind down of chlorine demand where housing starts to weaken before the broader economy. that takes place over 12 to 18 months, and we ended up in a 12- to 18-month period where caustic was tight and then the broader economy rolled over. and then typically, although this didn't happen in post-2008, chlorine recovers first. i'm not sure what how any of this necessarily comes back and in what sequence. i would just say, caustic demand at its core is more resilient than chlorine demand at its core.
neel kumar -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
operator
the next question comes from frank mitsch with fermium research. please go ahead.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
yes, good morning. i really appreciated the heat map on slide five. john, i want to come back to the comment about 70% to 80% order control on caustic. is that was that just an april comment or is that for the entirety of 2q? and can we assume that you don't have any spot availability on caustic right now?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i think based on the outlook that we have for q2, we will remain on order control for the entire period. and your comment on spot is absolutely accurate. we have no spot to sell.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
all right. and todd, i wanted to come back to the comment about perhaps not prepaying the notes that are due or that are callable in october. i understand that everybody's visibility is very poor right now. but given the fact that there is some financing in place to take those out, i mean, more is it more likely that come year-end, those will be retired? or how do we think about the probabilities? and i understand it's kind of difficult given the visibility but i just wanted to if you could offer a little more color, that'd be great.
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
frank, this is john. i think the other thing we need to keep in mind here as we look forward is there's a pretty significant bond call premium that goes with that, which is an immediate use of cash versus a long term. it takes us over a year to get the benefit of the bonds on a net cash basis. so that's the other element that we have to look at, is where are we from a cash perspective. and previous question or asked about the dow payment, which is obviously due at the end of the year, which is a big number.
todd a. slater -- vice president & chief financial officer
frank, the dow bonds are not an all-or-nothing call. you can call any portion of that $1.2 billion.
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
and you can call it at any time.
todd a. slater -- vice president & chief financial officer
right. after october 15.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst

operator
the next question comes from eric petrie with citi. please go ahead.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
it's interesting that in the u.s. and europe, caustic prices are going up. but i was taking a look at china caustic soda export prices, and they've actually trended lower to the low $200 per ton range. so do you see any export arbitrage from china into rest of world and taking share and potentially putting a cap on potential price realizations?
james a. varilek -- executive vice president & chief operating officer
eric, this is jim. i spoke earlier about the dynamics that are taking place in china. and china did start up, and they had some they ran some of the chlorine, chlorine derivatives, and the caustic market was not there initially, so they did do some exports. now what you've seen over the last month is that the export market in asia in general started off low and it moved up about $70 over the course of the month of april. so i think what you're seeing is that a little bit of excess caustic that there was in china worked itself off.
china is a relatively small exporter in the whole scheme of things relative to what they used to be. they reduced their exports by about 60% over the last three to four years. so and only the plants on the coast can actually export. so you may see something, a parcel here or there show up, but i don't think it's going to impact the shortness and the dramatic pullback that we've seen on operating rates over the next few months. so that's the view. it's a bit mixed but it's important that you look at the trend over the course of the month of april.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
okay, helpful. secondly, a competitor announced a plant shutdown for three weeks due to weak chlor alkali market conditions. could olin consider doing the same or fast-tracking your closures at freeport, texas?
james a. varilek -- executive vice president & chief operating officer
i think that what we're going to do is basically take a look at the demand. i mean, we're already i mean, we're already we already said that we're on order control and so forth. we look at our assets all the time. and what we're going to do is to take a look to see how demand materializes. we're really only a month or so into this severe downturn, and so we'll assess what we need to do over the next several months.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
thank you.

the next question comes from mike leithead with barclays. please go ahead.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
thanks guys and good morning. and i just wanted to return to slide five and maybe ask mike sison's question in another way on the caustic soda side. i guess, i understand the resilience for packaging or detergent applications, but i'm struggling to see how that bottom 40% in the chart that's going into autos, aircrafts or construction is not meaningfully falling off in 2q when u.s. gdp is minus 30%. so can you just give us more color on what you're seeing in your order book for caustic in some of those more cyclical end markets?
james a. varilek -- executive vice president & chief operating officer
i'll specifically address the alumina, aluminum markets. and quite honestly, those markets have been relatively soft for the last one to 1.5 years. and so we're not seeing any trend change from where they have been. in fact, they've been relatively consistent. and i think you'll hear that is that and whether it's in latin america, whether it's in china, wherever the alumina plants are, they're actually running consistently. so that's what we're saying. there's not a change relative to where they have been over the last few quarters. clearly, automotive has been down for some period of time as well. so although it's certainly yellow, it's not a major change from where they have been operating. so that's the way to read the chart.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
got it. okay. that's helpful. and then question for todd. you obviously highlighted a number of different levers you're pulling to free up liquidity, but you haven't talked about the dividend at all. so i guess how sacrosanct do you consider paying the quarterly dividend?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
this is john, and i'll answer that question. i'd start by saying the dividend decision is a board decision. it's not a management decision. i would say also that if you look at olin over a long span of time, the dividend has been a key component of our shareholder value proposition. and obviously, we paid a quarterly dividend for something in excess of 90 consecutive years. so i would never say never, but i would say it is a key component of our shareholder value proposition. management and the board are aligned on that. and we obviously just declared the normal dividend that will be payable in june.

the next question comes from john roberts with ubs. please go ahead.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
thank you. and i'm glad you're all well. it's been a while since winchester was the largest operating earnings item in our model. does social distancing impede your ability to interact with the current lake city people? and are you reimbursed for any additional cost there if it slows you down? and i couldn't remember, is lake city highly automated like your new plant? or is it very people-intensive like your old plant?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
the lake city plant was built by the army in 1945. it looks much more like the old plant than the new plant. the social distancing within the plant is not as big an issue as you might think because it's the pieces of equipment are relatively well spaced to start with. and that plant, plus all of our plants, are undergoing temperature monitoring on the way in. so there has not been a big issue there, and we have not been constrained in terms of our ability to interact. we had most of the people signed up that we need to go forward on october one well before we actually entered into the restrictions we're living under today.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
right. and then the $75 million for the vcm contract, how is that impacted by lower oil? so ethane is obviously much less advantaged. it might be disadvantaged temporarily here. but is that a shintech degradation to earnings or an olin degradation to earnings if ethane is less advantaged?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i'm not going to discuss the details of the contract other than to say, the biggest piece of the contract is that there's a pretty significant contract minimum for olin. and as we look at the contract over the span of 10 years, which is what the contract is for, we think an average return on that contract is $75 million.

the next question comes from travis edwards with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
travis edwards -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, good morning and thanks for the time. quickly, we can appreciate the benefits of taking over that vcm contract. and i guess, just as we're looking at ebitda sensitivity and liquidity for our estimates for 2020, just wondering, is there any scenario in which you would or could delay that payment and maybe push it out further and just take it over later? or is that, for sure, happening in 2020?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i would say, i think for any number of reasons, we would prefer that, that payment happen.
travis edwards -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. okay. that's helpful. and then also kind of appreciate that there's a lot of uncertainty around market conditions over the next couple of months. you mentioned a few factors that you're considering to improve liquidity, but maybe just hoping to get a bit more color on how you're thinking about those various levers in the context of the financial covenant that you have, the maintenance covenant that you have, just as you're thinking about upcoming cash outflows. i guess, maybe worded another way, what gives you confidence in your ability to fund some of these larger outflows just while remaining in compliance on that front? any color there would be really appreciated.
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i guess i would say very broadly that the financial or the agreements that are in place with our bank group, we are we have we work with our bank group on a regular basis. and they are aware of the situation we're in. we're aware of the situation we're in. and there's a great deal of cooperation to ensure that the payments that need to get made, get made.
travis edwards -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks for the color. appreciate the time.

the next question is from patrick fruits with bank of america. please go ahead.
patrick fruits -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you. on. does the 2020 working capital reduction of $150 million include the onetime lake city working capital build of $80 million? i.e. in other words, it would have been negative $230 million reduction without the lake city build?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no, it does not include that.
patrick fruits -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and secondly, can you comment on the driver of the significant increase in other current liabilities in march versus december, please?
todd a. slater -- vice president & chief financial officer
yes. roger, this is todd. that is the current portion from moving up from long term to current, the dow ethylene payment.
patrick fruits -- bank of america -- analyst
understood. thank you very much.
operator
the next question comes from brian lalli with barclays. please go ahead.
brian lalli -- barclays -- analyst
hey, good morning guys, how are you. but may be just a quick follow-up. i know it's been asked a couple of times. but on the existing $2 billion facility with the $1.2 billion delayed draw. if i could just dig in a little bit. is it fair to say that the maintenance covenant at this point might be an issue? and that if you did get to october, do you expect you'd be able to draw down on that? or maybe or would you assume that there might be some tightness in that we would need to potentially see an amendment from your banking group, maybe allows for some ratio headroom versus a smaller facility size with no direct plans on that refi? i know it's been asked a few different ways, but i just want to follow up.
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
the way the facility is structured today, it would not have an effect on the covenant because we would draw that down, and it's specifically designed to be used to call the dow bond, the bonds that were issued with the dow transaction. so it'd be neutral on debt. i think the question...
brian lalli -- barclays -- analyst
but i guess to follow up on that, i mean, if you were to use those proceeds, it wouldn't you're saying it wouldn't impact the ratio? and i guess if that's the case, is there some reason why you wouldn't do it? i do appreciate the cash outlay for redemptions, but obviously, those are expensive and the loan is much cheaper from an interest expense standpoint. i just want to kind of get your thought process around potentially delaying some of that, again, appreciating the conservative messaging around uses of cash.
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i guess i'd come back to what we've said several times, and we said it in the remarks. the outlook that we have today is very unclear and we don't know what things are going to look like in october.
brian lalli -- barclays -- analyst
okay. got it. and then maybe just one quick follow-up. you mentioned the high-yield bond market being accessible. again, would generally agree with that. i guess, how might we think about your interest level in coming to the high-yield market? and to that end, would you maybe be open to talking about how much secured capacity you might have if you chose to use that as an avenue? obviously, those deals that have been fairly topical over the last month, as you'd imagine, come with lower interest expense. is that something you're thinking about? and how much would you have in terms of room under your various agreements as you think about liability management moving forward?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i would say we listed all of the things we're looking at as options to enhance and ensure liquidity over both the near term and the longer term.
brian lalli -- barclays -- analyst
okay, understood.
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
understand. thanks.
operator
the next question comes from alex yefremov with keybanc. please go ahead.
alex yefremov -- keybanc -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everyone. thank you for providing the 70% to 80% caustic soda allocation number. if we assume that the typical allocation would be 100% or a little higher, can we then assume that your volumes in the second quarter could be down roughly 25%? or if not, how should we think about sequential volumes in your chlor alkali segment?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, we said that volumes were going to be down. but we also talked about the fact that we've had we have more turnarounds in q2 than anything else. so volumes were going to be down anyway.
alex yefremov -- keybanc -- analyst
but just is there any way to quantify that, maybe including or excluding the effect of the turnarounds? is that 25% math that i just went through your 70% to 80% allocation compared to a typical 100%, does that is that a reasonable logic to apply here or not for some reason?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i don't think, as it relates to q2, it's reasonable because of the magnitude of the turnarounds that we have.
alex yefremov -- keybanc -- analyst
okay. understood. and then is there any way you could quantify your epoxy volumes in the second quarter, maybe if you look at your april order book compared to q1? or from in any other way?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
what we said was, and this is the best quantification we can give, is we expect we started to see volumes for may and june decline. and i would say prior to that, the volumes were relatively similar across january through april.
alex yefremov -- keybanc -- analyst
understood. thanks a lot.
operator
the next question is from matthew deyoe with bank of america. please go ahead.
matthew deyoe -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning. in the spirit of assessing avenues to boost liquidity, i wanted to ask about winchester. if that business recovers and you start booking profits against lake city, would you look at monetizing that maybe later this year or next year as a way to generate cash? i know in the past, you've considered it not core.
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
what i would say is everybody in olin would admit that there is no synergy between a commodity chemical company and the winchester business as it's configured today. i would tell you that it is vitally important to the long-term success of winchester to affect an orderly transition and start-up of the lake city contract. and that is what we're focused on right now.
matthew deyoe -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, fair enough. and if i look at slide 12, you listed a number of kind of discrete tailwinds for next year's cash flow in $200 million, but those numbers add up to a number much higher than $200 million. so i'm just wondering if there's some kind of offsetting headwind to cash flow that were not listed? or that was maybe the math there? or maybe i'm just missing something.
todd a. slater -- vice president & chief financial officer
this is todd. the numbers listed there include pre-tax items as well as capital. so the incremental cash flow generation of $200 million is an after-tax number, real cash in our pocket to be able to utilize.
matthew deyoe -- bank of america -- analyst
thanks, sir.
todd a. slater -- vice president & chief financial officer
thank you for the clarification.
operator
the next question comes from arun viswanathan with rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great, thanks, good morning. hope you're all well. i guess, i just wanted to ask about caustic soda pricing. you noted some recent momentum due to lower operating rates, which could continue in the near term. i guess i just wanted to understand the dynamic between domestic contract pricing and export pricing. so in response to an earlier question, we noted that asian prices were in the $200 to $300 level, and we know that contract prices here are considerably above that in the $500 to $600 per ton level. could you just remind us why that is? and what supports the domestic contract price so high? i guess, included in that, maybe if you could just weave in your thoughts on why that would continue to be the case in potentially a new lower-cost environment with the reduction in oil and potentially a reduction in coal that's coming?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
the export price in asia is not a delivered price to the united states or delivered cost to the united states. you are probably looking at, depending on where you're shipping from, $150 of ocean freight. that would deliver it to a u.s. port. then you'd have to put it into a terminal, you'd have to get it out of the terminal and incur another shipment to get it to the majority of the customers who are in the mississippi river valley, etc. so that is why the arbitrage from china is not as evident as you might think.
and that is very similar to the reason we always believe that the export price, in general, from the u.s. gulf coast can be lower and not tear down the u.s. domestic price, because the export price is put it on a boat and send it some place where it gets unloaded, versus delivering to a customer who takes 10 railcars of caustic somewhere inland in the united states every day. and that's a different logistics trail with a different cost structure.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and again, just to understand this, have you seen any change in the cost curve with the reduction in oil prices that we've observed over the last month or two?
james a. varilek -- executive vice president & chief operating officer
no. i think your last comment was last month or two. so i don't think that there's a dramatic change in cost curves or anything that take place in a very short period of time. so we'd have to see whether anything is sustained or not. but not in the short term.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay, thanks.s

operator
good morning, and welcome to the olin corporation first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to steve keenan, olin's director of investor relations. please go ahead, steve.
steve keenan -- investor relations
good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. before we begin, let me remind you that this presentation, along with the associated slides and question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks, will include statements regarding estimates of future performance. please note that these are forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected. some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from our projections are described, without limitations, in the risk factors section of our most recent form 10-k, the first quarter of 2020 form 10-q and in yesterday's first quarter earnings press release. a copy of today's transcript and slides will be available in our website in the investors section under past events. the earnings press release and other financial data and information are available under press releases.
with me this morning is john fischer, olin's chairman, president and chief executive officer; pat dawson, executive vice president, corporate strategy and international; jim varilek, executive vice president and chief operating officer; and todd slater, vice president and chief financial officer. we will begin with our prepared remarks, and thereafter, we will be happy to take your questions.
i'll now turn the call over to john fischer. john?
john e. fischer -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, steve, and good morning, everyone. the response to the coronavirus did not have a significant impact on olin's results in the first quarter of 2020. the epoxy business did have mandatory manufacturing plant closures and operating reductions in asia, which reduced first quarter 2020 epoxy segment earnings by approximately $3 million. these epoxy resin manufacturing plants had resumed operations by the end of the first quarter of 2020. all olin manufacturing facilities worldwide are currently operating, with the exception of those undergoing planned maintenance turnarounds. our operations are among businesses that have been considered essential by government and public health authorities.
i will begin today's presentation with olin's view on near-term market dynamics, followed by a discussion of the key highlights from olin's first quarter, then close with a detailed review of each business segment. during the second half of march and into april, olin began to experience reduced demand across our chemical portfolio. chlorine demand from urethane and isocyanates customers has declined, and there have been discussions of extended outages later in the year, especially in the isocyanate space. hydrochloric acid has experienced a significant decline in demand, tied to weakness in the oil and gas sector. ethylene dichloride, which is an export product for olin, has also declined, and we expect epoxy resin demand to decline in may and june from first quarter levels.
the lower demand levels and major planned maintenance outages in the first and second quarters for chlorinate organics, vinyls and epichlorohydrin have caused chlor alkali operating rates in our system to decline from 2019 levels. while sales of bleach and chlorine into disinfectants have been strong and are expected to remain so, the near-term demand outlook for our chlorine portfolio is unclear. the lower operating rates have reduced caustic soda supply in our system below the level of demand, and we have implemented order control at the 70% to 80% level across the regions in which we operate. we believe the recent price increase announcements are supported by these market conditions. the winchester business began experience increased commercial demand during the first quarter, and that is continuing. this improved demand, combined with the fourth quarter start of the lake city army contract, should result in a meaningful year-over-year increase in winchester's 2020 adjusted ebitda.
with that, let's turn to slide three.
during the first quarter, olin recorded adjusted ebitda of $122.8 million. during the quarter, olin experienced onetime events that reduced adjusted ebitda by approximately $13 million. the unplanned events included a european phenol supplier force majeure that reduced epoxy resin production, the canadian rail blockades that forced the shutdown of our canadian chlor alkali, and the covid-19-related plant closure and operating reductions in asia that i mentioned. lower chlor alkali product pricing for edc, hydrochloric acid and caustic soda was the primary driver of our lower quarter-over-quarter adjusted ebitda. chlor alkali segment pricing was approximately $26 million lower sequentially. the lower chlor alkali pricing was partially offset by pricing improvement and lower raw material costs in epoxy and improved winchester results. first quarter 2020 adjusted ebitda also included approximately $50 million of planned maintenance turnaround costs. as a point of reference, fourth quarter 2019 planned maintenance turnaround costs were approximately $27 million.
now i'll provide a bit more detail for each of our business segments, starting with chlor alkali products and vinyls on slide four. first quarter 2020 adjusted ebitda for our chlor alkali products and vinyls segment was $84.2 million, representing a 41% sequential decline from the fourth quarter of 2019. this reduction reflects declines in product pricing and higher maintenance turnaround costs. for the first quarter of 2020, caustic soda pricing in olin's system declined approximately 8% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. at the same time, ethylene dichloride experienced approximately 14% lower pricing sequentially, and hydrochloric acid pricing declined by approximately 25%. the business experienced overall demand in the first quarter of 2020, similar to fourth quarter 2019 levels.
the second quarter chlor alkali products and vinyls adjusted ebitda will include approximately $40 million of costs associated with planned maintenance turnaround at our vinyl chloride monomer facility in freeport, texas. now let's take a closer look at the changing chlor alkali, chlorine and caustic supply demand balance, and that is on slide five. as we have discussed on previous calls, in 2019, chlor alkali products and vinyls business experienced an imbalance in demand that favored chlorine. operating rates were driven by stronger construction and durable goods demand and relatively weaker caustic soda demand. this resulted in caustic soda pricing declines throughout 2019 and into the first quarter of 2020. current indications are that the imbalance that we have seen over the last 1.5 years in favor of chlorine is reversing. we expect chlorine demand into vinyls, urethanes and isocyanates to decline significantly, reducing north american and global chlor alkali industry operating rates. as the chart indicates, there will be a relative demand shift as chlorine applications pull back and key caustic soda demand applications are less impacted. the combination of reduced operating rates and shifting demand is expected to lead to caustic soda favorable imbalance.
now we'll look at caustic soda pricing on slide six. during the first quarter of 2020, industry caustic soda prices continued to decline, and olin's caustic soda pricing declined approximately 8% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. however, we believe caustic soda pricing reached a positive inflection point during the first quarter, reflecting the tightening of caustic soda supply and demand. export caustic soda price indices increased sequentially by 6% during the first quarter and an additional $85 per metric ton in april of 2020. domestic caustic soda pricing indices increased by $20 per ton in april. olin has announced additional caustic soda price increases totaling $140 per ton for may and june. we expect lower north american chlor alkali industry operating rates during the second quarter to reduce the caustic soda supply, which is expected to support improved caustic soda pricing.
now let's move to the performance of our epoxy segment, which is on slide seven. during the first quarter of 2020, olin's epoxy business generated adjusted ebitda of $33.2 million. our european epoxy business experienced a force majeure declaration by phenol supplier during the first quarter, which reduced epoxy resin and epoxy resin precursor production at our stade, germany facility. the epoxy business also faced the manufacturing plant closures and operating reductions in asia due to the covid-19 virus. these issues reduced our 2020 epoxy segment earnings by approximately $10 million. the epoxy business was able to partially offset these first quarter challenges through sequentially higher epoxy volumes, higher product pricing and lower raw material and operating costs.
in the second quarter, the epoxy business is expected to experience weakening demand from its automotive, industrial coatings and oil and gas-related customers in both europe and north america. lower raw material costs, primarily benzene and propylene, are expected to provide an offset to these anticipated lower resin volumes. finally, the second quarter 2020 epoxy adjusted ebitda will include approximately $15 million of costs associated with the planned maintenance turnaround at our freeport, texas epichlorohydrin plant.
we will now look at liquid epoxy resin prices, which are shown on slide eight. during the first quarter, european and north american liquid epoxy resin pricing improved sequentially from fourth quarter 2019 levels due to tight supply conditions. the lower raw material costs, primarily benzene and propylene, together with an expected weaker resin demand environment in europe and north america, are expected to pressure our proxy resin pricing during the second quarter. moving on to our winchester business, which is summarized on slide nine. for the third consecutive quarter, the winchester business experienced year-over-year improvement in segment earnings. in the first quarter of 2020, winchester experienced a 20% increase in sales compared to the same quarter last year, resulting in a 31% year-over-year increase in first quarter adjusted ebitda. winchester experienced a $20 million increase in sales to commercial ammunition customers and a $10 million increase in sales to law enforcement and military customers. the first quarter of 2020 represents the strongest first quarter in commercial demand since 2016. this level of improved commercial demand has continued into the second quarter. reflecting this improved level of demand, winchester's commercial ammunition backlog has more than doubled since this time last year. our ammunition plants are currently increasing operating rates to meet this stronger demand. finally, winchester announced price increases ranging from 4% to 6% across its product line.
moving to slide 10, i'll provide an update on winchester's lake city project. winchester is now five months away from assuming operational control of the u.s. army lake city army ammunition manufacturing facility. this multiyear contract is expected to increase winchester's annual revenue by $450 million to $550 million, and contribute adjusted ebitda of $40 million to $50 million. during 2020, olin expects to incur approximately $20 million to $25 million of transition costs and invest approximately $80 million in working capital as part of this contract acquisition. this worldscale facility will benefit from more than a century of winchester operational knowledge and experience. likewise, winchester will benefit from the scale and the incremental ammunition production capacity offered by this facility and its dedicated workforce.
and with that, i'd like to turn the call over to todd slater, olin's chief financial officer. todd?
todd a. slater -- vice president & chief financial officer
thanks, john. we have placed a premium on preserving and enhancing our liquidity, given that the near-term demand outlook for our chemicals business is unclear. we've initiated several ongoing actions that we believe will mitigate partially mitigate the impact of the economic decline on our financial performance and also enhance our financial position. several of these actions and our liquidity resources are included on slide 11.
our cash and cash equivalents at march 31 were $195 million. olin has senior unsecured revolving credit facility with commitments of $800 million, which is undrawn. during the first quarter of 2020, we expanded and borrowed $150 million under our receivables financing agreement. and during april, we expanded our receivables financing agreement by an additional $100 million. we also have the ability to increase our accounts receivable factoring arrangements, which ultimately can accelerate the timing of cash receipts and enhance our cash position. neither of these receivable programs impact our senior credit facility debt ratio covenants.
we are continuing to evaluate all sources and uses of cash, including expanding our leasing portfolio, alternatives available to us under our senior credit facility, early retirement of outstanding debt and the ability to access the high-yield debt markets. we have no required debt repayments until august of 2022. our debt profile is comprised of manageable towers of debt with staggered maturities in future years. we're executing a strategy to improve our working capital and manage our balance sheet to maximize our financial flexibility. during 2020, olin expects to reduce working capital by approximately $150 million, which would result in an approximately $250 million of incremental cash flow from march 2020 levels. we are forecasting capital spending to be in the $250 million to $275 million range in 2020, which is approximately $125 million lower than prior year levels. based on our current outlook and lead time to implement, we expect an additional reduction in capital spending in 2021.
in late 2020 and beginning in 2021, we expect incremental annual cash generation of approximately $120 million i'm sorry, $200 million from the initiatives on slide 12. the vital chloride monomer contract is transitioning from a toll manufacturing arrangement that has been in place since the acquisition to a direct customer sale agreement beginning on january 1, 2021. the vcm facility is one of two operations that has had the most significant impact on our chlor alkali products and vinyls results: the full year effect of the new lake city u.s. army ammunition contract and the expected $35 million reduction in operating costs from the previously announced permanent shutdown of our chlor alkali plant with a capacity of 230,000 tons and olin's vinylidene chloride production facility both in freeport, texas. these closures are expected to be completed before the end of 2020. and these closures will allow olin to optimize its chlor alkali operations and cost structure in freeport, texas.
and the winding down of the multiyear information technology project to integrate the acquired dow chlorine products businesses will reduce spending by approximately $110 million between capital and expense. these cash flow enhancements of approximately $200 million provide significant incremental cash flows to olin, independent of industry conditions. finally, on thursday, april 23, olin's board of directors declared a dividend of $0.20 on each share of olin common stock. the dividend is payable on june 10, 2020 to shareholders of record at the close of business on may 11, 2020. this is the 374th consecutive quarterly dividend to be paid by the company.
operator, we are now ready to take questions.
",2020-Q1,OLN
0.8269,,,,":
operator
thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] the first question is from michael leithead from barclays. please go ahead.
michael leithead -- barclays -- analyst
thank you, guys, and good morning. scott, you've talked a bit about your new value first selling strategy for the past few quarters here. so please give us an update on how your customers have broadly responded to this, as well as perhaps interactions you've seen in the market from your competitors in response to this?
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, ok. yeah. i mean, thanks a lot, mike. look, i mean, we won't comment on competitor reactions, ok. but what i would say about customers is, i mean, clearly, this is challenging for them and we certainly understand that. however, at the end of the day, they recognized that we are a critical part of their future growth and they want us to be successful as well. and that means, we really do need to lift these materials up to reinvestment economics. so yeah it's been challenging, but it's been progressive.
michael leithead -- barclays -- analyst
got it. that's fair. and then, i appreciate a lot of your focus and comments are focused on kind of olin specific actions, but curious if you could just kind of walk through what you're seeing in your key product markets in terms of kind of demand recovery? and maybe if you look across your portfolio, where you think the greatest pricing opportunity is today?
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, i would just comment generally and then i'll ask damian in and pat to make some comments here. but i would say that general industrial demand has still been fairly weak and that's going to play itself out to our favor in the future. in specific areas though, it's been quite good.
so with that, let me ask pat from epoxy to make a few comments and then we'll ask damien to say about capv.
pat dawson -- executive vice president and president, epoxy & international
yeah. mike, this is pat. i think on epoxy, when you start out and you look at the demand side of things, we've seen sequential improvement in our demand since june month-on-month and certainly quarter-on-quarter.
so the demand, quite frankly, where we sit today and you got to remember, demand is really driven a lot around industrial coatings, automotive, electronics, wind energy. quite frankly, we're back in a lot of those segments to pre-covid demand levels. so we're sitting here, but almost in february and the demand looks good.
the other thing that has been encouraging on demand is the fact that china has been very robust. and i think the demand of epoxy in china is probably as good as we've seen it for a while. but mike going back less than 24 months ago, when we had our investors day, we were showing them that the overall industry, supply demand fundamentals for epichlorohydrin, which is a major raw material going into making epoxy resins. along with epoxy resins, we're already in the mid-80 type op -- industry operating rate. so, this is nothing new. it is just simply been the industry getting tighter.
and now coming out of covid, we see things very tight. it's given us pricing traction that started, quite frankly back in september, october and has only built in momentum through the end of the year. and we see that momentum continuing here in the new year and right through the first quarter, so there's increases out there. there's public, in the public domain that have been announced. we're seeing good traction on that. and we see the fundamental is very good.
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
alright. domi?
damian gumpel -- vice president, chlor alkali products and vinyls
yeah mike, i thank you for the question. when we look across the board, across the capv portfolio and tell you that as we look here in '21, we have a good upwards momentum here on across the board in all our product groups. obviously, caustic is a big one as we look at economy trying to open up again, manufacturing activity increase, pulp and paper activity increasing some more, alumina, aluminum by any external indicators are poised to have a rebound in '21 over '20. so clearly, caustic is, we see signs of caustic improving over the course of the year.
if you look on our merchant chlorine business, you look at titanium dioxide and ionic demand, the polyurethanes and other areas, we continue to see what we -- what -- exactly what pat saw on his side. we see demand starting to, really start to come back in the second half and we continue to see that well into '21.
we see our chlorinated organic business also showing rebounds with applications in the pharma, water treatment, refrigerants, also following back on their cylinders. and then lastly, with our bleach business continue at elevated level, for use in the disinfectant, but then you start getting in the second quarter when the seasonal demand. so, really, in summary, i can tell you that our view right now is that looking ahead, the demand looks very good for both sides of the ecu for our portfolio.
michael leithead -- barclays -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
the next question is from kevin mccarthy from vertical research partners. please go ahead.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
yes, good morning. couple of questions on winchester. what is your expected contribution from the various price increases that are flowing through your business in 2021? and then, secondly, if we look at history, oftentimes the year following an election is such that demand sort of softens relative to the election year itself, where there's a lot of strains. and based on your commentary, it sounds like your outlook is very positive. so i was wondering if you could address each of those two things and help us to put it into context with regard to your outlook?
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, sure. kevin, i mean, just the general statement is that winchester results are going to continue to improve and continue to improve throughout 2021. the pricing right, without an absolute number, we've put pricing and achieved basically a 100% of that pricing on at least four occasions over the last six months or so. so in terms of the profit improvement that you see in that business, its probably the leading driving factor. and then, the fact that we also have lake city as part of our portfolio is also another leading driving factor.
in terms of election and looking out, i mean, really the fundamentals have shifted for that business, which is different than it's ever been before. i mean shooting participation is way up and we expect that to continue as a long-term trend. so my point here is, this is not just a 2021 phenomenon. we expect that business to do much better throughout a number of future years.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
okay, that's helpful, scott. and then, second question if i may on epoxy. clearly, there is a tremendous amount of pricing strength in recent months. and i was wondering if you could help us understand how much of that is due to olin's change in strategy around the ecu profit contribution index, relative to exogenous market dynamics, such as various competitor outages in asia, any color around that would be really appreciated.
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think pat will provide some color here. i mean, i would just preface it by saying in our epoxy business, it certainly is part of our strategy to first and foremost with value across the whole ecu first, and epoxy is a significant part of that. but then epoxy has its own landscape fundamentals that pat is exercising a lot of activities around. so, pat?
pat dawson -- executive vice president and president, epoxy & international
yeah. kevin, i would say, first of all, we are very active around upgrading where we decided to place epoxy resin into our targeted applications and customers around the globe to drive the best returns for the ecu. of course, i take a look at it with different mindset changes that -- i've got to compete and make sure that i can get enough chlorine to put into the epoxy chain. and so, if i'm not improving my returns to the ecu here internally, damian will take that ecu and place it somewhere else. so that's a different -- puts a different perspective and a different color on our sense of urgency and the sharpness of which we evaluate, where we're going to place that epoxy, if could say into our targeted applications.
also kevin, we've talked a number of times about the fundamentals of epoxy and the fundamentals of epichlorohydrin, which is a key raw material. and since the reinvestment, economics haven't been there in the industry for epi or a lot of the base liquid epoxy type resin business, there hasn't been any capacity added. so if you work off of this discussion we had less than 24 months ago at the investors presentation, i think you're just seeing the normal occurrence of a market that hasn't been invested in from a additional capacity standpoint, i think the other thing, kevin, that you're seeing a little bit more color around china, if you recall a few years ago they were really cracking down hard on environmental regulations enforcing those regulations, which i think was great. i mean, i think that was good for the industries, good for china. but i think that took some capacity out that may have not been so transparent and that's what -- that's why you had probably the longest-running arbitrage, we've ever seen on the price to ler in china versus ler outside of china.
but that gives maybe a little color of what's going on here.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
thanks for that. and congrats on being the star of the show.
pat dawson -- executive vice president and president, epoxy & international
yeah, it feels great, kevin. appreciate that.

the next question is from hassan ahmed from alembic global. please go ahead.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
morning, scott. scott, as i take a look at some of the commentary, near term wise that you've given and sort of compare in contrast that with the full year 2021 guidance that you had given, call it in early november, it seems that things have certainly improved a fair bit since then. and as i take a look at the guidance you gave, it was $860 million on the low end, $1.06 billion on the high end and we are already at a run rate of $1 billion annualized in ebitda. so i was just wondering whether you'd sort of update that guidance in light of some of these sort of improvements that we've seen through the course of q4 and some of the early indications that we are seeing of, a certain degree of strength in 2021?
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, thanks a lot hassan. i mean, i would say that we really are updating that guidance here and we've tried to be really clear that first quarter, the average of first half continues to do better and certainly the full year. i mean, the reason that we're updating that guidance sum is because our model and just to restate it, principally it says that look, our market participation is set by the weak side of the ecu. translation is that we don't sell into poor quality markets and we do activations up and down our chain on both sides of the ecu and if you ever get a chance to look at slide number 12, it just says we move our business from the green points to the blue points by running in that way.
so i guess my point is we are having success in doing that and there is still a lot of things that we can do to take off some of that handcuffs that we have and we see us -- see ourselves being more successful at doing that throughout 2021. so that's the reason that we've updated our guidance sum.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
very helpful. and as a follow-up. really appreciate slide 15 where obviously you're talking about sort of over 600 active projects that you guys have started in 2021 and as i was going, sort of down the list of projects that you guys mentioned, a series of, sort of capacity closures and the like, but as sort of-- you're thinking about all of these projects, how are you thinking about, sort of potentially certain asset sales as well?
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
i would say in terms of asset sales, right, that's not necessarily part of our near-term agenda. we're more concerned with immediate productivity and better cost performance that we can get from actually closing some assets that are underutilized. but i do think jim could buy from us some good color on the overall productivity program and how that is evolving.
jim varilek -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
sure. hassan, one of the things that we -- important pillar obviously of our success here is productivity. we're talking about $50 million to $100 million of net savings for 2021. i think this is the epitome of controlling our own destiny. this is something that we absolutely control, is our own costs and our own our own productivity. so we've been very active, we stepped up our activity in the fourth quarter, where we increased our project portfolio by 20% during the fourth quarter, we completed a large number of products, over 900 projects for the year, then actually working to our baseline cost for 2021, and then of course we're being aggressive with over 600 projects as we start the first quarter of this year. and so we're really making a concerted us effort to control what we control on the cost side and help open up the margins as we're successful on the commercial side. and you can see the variety of projects, this is a broad-based pro -- this is a very broad-based program. it's virtually in every aspect of our company, whether it'd be structural with asset closures that -- like you see on the list or whether it's raw materials, or rail car management or sales, tax or association cost. every single element of the company, every person in the company is responsible for productivity and that's really what we're stepping up and on the structural side, with some of these closures you see the vdc and overlap closure and our ecu plant closure that's going to happen in the second quarter that we're moving forward with, there's some other things that we're doing on the structural side and of course we're going to continue to look at our capacity, the ecu capacity. that's under utilized and we're going to continue to scrutinize that and as you can see we've made decisions in the past and we'll make decisions here in the future.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst

the next question is from aleksey yefremov from keybanc. please go ahead.
aleksey yefremov -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
thank you, and good morning, everyone. scott, you mentioned 10% improvement in pci in the first half, if i understood it correctly. how should we think about margins on that, should we just take essentially, sales in the chlor alkali and epoxy segments and assume a 10% margin on that?
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. hey, alex, thanks. i mean, that's a good question, right. i mean, we've set this ecu pci as not only the number one indicator of our success, but our commitment to our plans. so if you think back to what i said on the third quarter earnings call, i said that that ecu pci represents about 75% of the business that this company does. so it's really only excluding our winchester business and excluding our aromatics business, right. so you can imagine, just as a rule of thumb without having an exact math formula that you can take 75% of our revenue and then think about what our contribution margins or our variable margins might be and then you get to a 10% improvement in the ecu pci over the first half, so it averages some amount, a little less than 10% and that should be a significant chunk of improvement that happens through our profitability, through the first half of this year.
aleksey yefremov -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
and thank you, scott. and that is relative to what basis? to fourth quarter or back half of '20?
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
no, i'm saying there will be a 10% improvement in it from where we finished the fourth quarter at.
aleksey yefremov -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
understood. thank you. and then you also mentioned a $1.5 billion ebitda level. is that something that you see as sort of near-term target, but not 2021 or something that you were thinking could be achieved in 2021 already?
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
that wasn't our 2021 target, but that comes along really not too far after that and therefore that was still in my comments around, we're really looking forward to talking about what happens beyond that as well, but it's a little bit after 2021.
aleksey yefremov -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
and last question, if i may. cintec announced expansion and it looks like it includes vcm capacity growth in excess of their pvc growth. you have a contract with them, selling vcm to those company, how protected are you within your contract is cintec obligated to buy volumes from you and for how long?
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and so, i probably won't comment directly on the very specifics of that. but what i would say, in general is expansions like this, particularly this one, they're really expected and needed, especially in this time frame, right, three years away. so that's because of demand growing on both sides of the ecu. and we certainly don't expect any negative impacts out of that and all of that is planned for.
aleksey yefremov -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
thank you, scott.
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer

the next question is from mike sison from wells fargo. please go ahead.
michael sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
hey, guys. really good, nice results there. scott, and just on a curiosity, when you think about the third quarter ecu 99.6% and then the 106.2%. how much of that was really you guys making the changes and then, obviously, when you look at the consultants index of the ecu went up. so i'm just trying to understand, how much of that or may be all of it potentially was, what you got, what you've done so far?
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks a lot mike. thanks for the question. and yeah, i mean, we're all very focused on controlling our own destiny. and if you think about the way we're operating, it may certainly be disruptive compared to what has happened in the past. so certainly, we driven our own results to this point and when you're acting in that manner, i think opportunities present themselves that otherwise may not have come up. in other words, those happenings before that we did turn into opportunities get turned into opportunities.
and the way to think about this business because there's so many different markets, it's co-production, we have derivative chains, is that there is opportunities that come up every day, regardless of whether in one product area demand characteristics are improving or declining. and now, we're positioned to take advantage of those all the way up and on the way down.
michael sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
got it. and then, just a follow-up on winchester. when i've been to cabela's or such, you can't really find winchester ammo or anybody's ammo for what its worst. so are you looking to expand capacity, and then when you look at the pricing at these retail stores, it was 3x in november, maybe 4x in some cases. are you locked in those type of prices for this year? and maybe just a quick reminder, how much is commercial and law enforcement that way sort of understand the mix there?
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. yeah, sure. i mean, mike, i'll probably just start at the back end of that. if you think about the mix of the business, its not that far from being 50% military, 50% commercial with some law enforcement mix into that. those are really, really rough numbers though. in terms of capacity, i mean, we've just of course acquired a lot of capacity with the lake city operation, but we continue to run that hard. and instead of expanding capacity, what we are doing is looking to optimize that capacity, so that we do the right things for unit margin.
in terms of whether we're locked into a lot of things. our government business or our military business is more steady, but commercially, even over the last six months, there has been certainly three or four price increases. and so we have the abilities to change the price as we need to change price. in fact, we have a february price increase that's on the table right now, that really impacts nearly all of our commercial business or a lot of it anyway.
michael sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
great. thank you.
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
all right.

the next question is from frank mitsch from fermium research. please go ahead.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
thank you so much. nice end of the year and if i could translate mike's question. he was really asking you guys to ship them a couple of boxes. so i guess that what the genesis was for his question.
but if i could say on winchester, obviously very impressive $45 million of ebitda. how do we think about the contribution from lake city versus heritage winchester? we would have modeled in something like, i don't know $12 million or to maybe $15 million at most for lake city in the quarter. so i'm just trying to understand how that played out, how do you think that's going to continue to play out?
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. sure. hi frank, yeah. look, i mean, our improvement was due principally to two things and you're right. one of them is like steady and the other one was certainly better commercial performance and productivity performance across winchester. so you can sort of think of those two things as sharing that improvement to get to that $45 million number. and we're going to continue to build on both of those. lake city will be better than we said, but it will really be because of our team's actions once we have lake city. and so, that $45 million that you referenced really becomes the low quarter in the next five quarters.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
wow. very, very helpful, thank you so much. and if i could just ask a question on the chlor-alkali side. given the fact that you're not selling it to poor quality markets and indicated in the release that your volumes in chlor-alkali were lower year-over-year.
i was wondering if you might be able to quantify was it, was it low single-digits, mid single-digits, down double-digits, either sequentially or year-over-year, however you want handle it, just so we have an appreciation for how much is that business is benefiting from the pci versus the volume side of the equation there?
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, no, sure. may be damian will answer this question.
damian gumpel -- vice president, chlor alkali products and vinyls
yeah, sure. frank, good to talk to you. i would say that, when we look at, if you look at our performance over the back half for the year, the contribution from pci more than outweigh any headwinds from lower volumes or costs. so as i sit next to pat and jim here, we're working very closely together. the productivity gains that jim has done, as i said led the way, really creates a lot of air cover for the commercial organizations to go out and put value over volume at risk knowing that we're constantly and deliberately working our cost down. and then, if we look at our activations, as scott mentioned, let me just give you a few data points here. as we purposely move in q4, against the weak cost end market, we placed less caustic soda than we otherwise, maybe has the ability to do. and so, we purposely kept caustic soda off of our participation.
we did the same thing with edc as well. we made edc in-conjunction liberating caustic soda, while the caustic soda is weak, that means that we're going to play to that weak side, that also means we're going to limit our edc. and we see that our built, our demand for edc that work more than outweighed our desire to supply.
we were purposeful in activating around that and looking to achieve ever increasing values on edc. same goes for our bleach business, where we are now, several off season price increases in bleach in q4 and we achieved those and we've negotiated higher value contract for us for the totality of 2021.
we did that in our gco business, where we announced price increases in q4 against strong volume, purposely held some volume back as well there to activate around that and in any case, when we were the only ones with the price increase on the table, we achieved the price increase and got the volume. so very purposeful set of working through our costs, but being very much in charge of our own destiny as it relates to being willing to put develop the value over the volume. i think our fourth quarter results showed that that model had some very good and positive returns.
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
frank, frank, if you think of that price is at least 3 or 4 times depending on what comparison you want, the penalty associated with volume. again, it is much more about margin enhancement than the issue on volume, that well outweighs it.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
got you. very helpful, thank you so much.
operator
the next question is from vincent anderson from stifel. please go ahead.
vincent anderson -- stifel -- analyst
yeah, thanks, and good morning everyone. so you talked about epoxy having to compete for chlorine internally which is interesting. i don't normally think of those as an asset light business and so without seeing anything specific to epoxy, highlighted on slide 15, i was just interested in getting some color in terms of how much more fixed cost do you feel like you can get out of those to facilitate the kind of flexibility you're talking about.
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, thanks a lot. i'll just take a quick shot at this. i mean, look, we have room out of the company to tight fixed cost, and that's pretty widespread. what we haven't really trying to do at least for external purposes, is to narrow that down to business-by-business. i would just sort of close that point by saying, look, we're going to get $150 million to $200 million of gross productivity, which translates into that net $50 million to $100 million and there is opportunities across all the businesses to do that.
vincent anderson -- stifel -- analyst
okay, that's helpful, thanks. and yes, scott, you teased out some asset light moves. i think you called them that if i'm interpreting it correctly, could shift the portfolio a little bit. with the improvement in base free cash flow going forward, really starting now, are there any areas in chlorine derivatives, or maybe some small acquisitions could have an outsized impact on ecu optimization?
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. yeah, the answer is yes. i mean, it's not impossible. of course, on our principal strategy when we get about $1.5 billion of ebitda will to be -- will be to get more molecules underneath our umbrella, and what that might mean just sort of as a teaser to the future, a little bit, right, it'll -- it won't be just trading activities it won't be just production activities either, and it won't be just marketing activities either. it's going to be more than any of those put together and it's probably going to be something the industry has never seen before and may be disruptive, just like our model is disruptive to conventional thinking right now.
vincent anderson -- stifel -- analyst
okay. lot to think about there. i appreciate it.
operator
the next question is from neel kumar from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
neel kumar -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. in terms of the $1.5 billion of ebitda, i know you mentioned it not a 2021 target, but can you just provide how many years out, that could be essentially a tangible goal, and can you just talk about what are some of the underlying assumptions needed to get there and how much of the increase is under your control versus perhaps being more market driven.
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, yeah. thanks a lot, neel. yeah, i mean. it is two or three years out, right. we haven't put a specific timeline on that, but i think the more interesting answer to your question is that we have everything that we need to get to that number. so it really is all about executing this differentiated model across the company. so we don't need anything else, and that's also why we could run $200 million of capital for many years in fact, to be able to support our business model.
neel kumar -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. it's very helpful. and then just for chlorine. i think it's been up to $200 per ton out there in terms of price increases. can you just give us a sense of how much of the chlorine portfolio has seen that price increases? and then it seems that ihs has only recognized a portion of those increases. what do you think that's not all been recognized, so far by the ihs?
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. well, i would just say that -- i probably can't answer why ihs didn't see -- probably a good question for jim, actually. for us, we are still unwrapping ourselves from certain commitments that we have to follow through on. so in terms of merchant chlorine. we still have, maybe the minority but a minority growing share that we can instantly change price on, and we're working to improve that.
operator
the next question is from matthew blair from tudor, pickering, holt. please go ahead.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt -- analyst
hey, good morning. i had a few questions on epoxy. so it seems propylene and benzene costs move up quite a bit in january, of course, ler price have soared about $0.27. could you just walk through the moving parts here, and all things equal, would you expect to see unit margin profitability increase in epoxy in q4 versus -- sorry, q1 versus q4?
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so i think pat will give you a little color on that. he'll probably just sort of cut to the chase and get to the answer on that without too many moving parts.
pat dawson -- executive vice president and president, epoxy & international
yeah. yeah, matthew the short answer is yes, we are going to expand margin in q1 versus q4 and yeah, that's a short answer.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt -- analyst
sounds good. and then pat you previously touched on strong demand end markets and epoxy like wind in autos. i think the price gains are just pretty remarkable given that aerospace is likely still a big drag. so could you talk about how much of a headwind is aerospace today and i guess how much upside down the road, it would present if aerospace normalized?
pat dawson -- executive vice president and president, epoxy & international
matthew, i think you have to also fill oil and gas into that aerospace as well. so while we've seen the recovery that i talked about in our demand, i mentioned earlier, which we're pretty much back to where we were last year at this time. without aerospace, to your point, and without oil and gas and also without the full recovery in a lot of industrial coatings and so guys cover all the big coating houses. and so i think there is more, more upside here to the demand. the other point i did mention is that we really saw a lot of customers and their customers' customers take inventories down really to low levels at the end of last year, which is not uncommon. but we think inventories are at pretty low levels here going into the new year as well. i think that bodes well for ongoing traction that we have seen late last year and that we're seeing here in q1.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt -- analyst
great. thank you.

good morning.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
appreciate the comment on the 30% of merchant chlorine transitioning away from industries. could you quantify at all for the rest of the portfolio, excluding caustic soda, how that traction has made progress in the year-end? damian, do you want to comment on this?
damian gumpel -- vice president, chlor alkali products and vinyls
yeah. so good morning, eric. we continue on a very deliberate approach here that in terms of looking for our contract openers, canceling your evergreen contracts, pulling contract renegotiations forward, both across chlorine and caustic soda to move away from these arbitrary, sometimes they'll take third-party indices and move toward something that puts our controlling in our own destiny and so we fully expect to continue to move along that. we achieved -- every new contract moves us closer and closer to that goal that scott has outlined and we have achieved that -- everything that we are hoping, that we were able to open and then negotiate in contracts here in the second half of the year across all of our molecules, we achieved that. so much more to come here, but we're very active on that front.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt -- analyst
okay. and for my follow-up, u.s. gulf coast edc prices have doubled to $600 per ton. is olin running full out or not because of lower caustic net-backs? and then, are there any other chlorine derivatives that are right for the bottlenecking capacity?
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. yeah, and so -- this is scott. i mean, what i would say is that you have to think about how we are running our model and we said we're not going to sell into poor quality markets and therefore we're not selling so much into the caustic world right now. because these things are co-produced, we go back and look at chlorine and basically that says we're not selling as much chlorine into certain markets and that means every derivative has to compete. clearly, edc is becoming more competitive for that chlorine. but i just don't want to walk away from this q&a and people think that we're running the assets hard for where we are, because we're not at the moment. those are running more than maybe some other derivative assets might be. it's all connected together.

the next question is from steve byrne from bank of america. please go ahead.
steve byrne -- bank of america -- analyst
yes, thank you. you've mentioned you have underutilized ecu capacity and that it's under review. i'm concerned -- my question is really about what are the options you're considering? is it likely that you'll shutter capacity and keep it so to speak warm until demand warrants bringing it back on stream or have you looked at the technical feasibility of retrofitting electrolyzers to instead of using a salt brine use fresh water and produce hydrogen or to use a lithium chloride brine and produce lithium chloride and chlorine. have you looked at those options as an alternative?
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. hi, steve. no, the option we're looking at and i think highly likely is a permanent shutdown of some of ecu production capability, just like the other shutdowns that we're doing are all permanent shutdowns. and with regard to your other questions, i mean, we just have so much more value to deliver and lift in terms of our current businesses. the the answer to your question is no, we're not looking at any kind of changes in chemistry at the moment.
steve byrne -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. i know $10 a kilo for hydrogen, seems like a pretty high value option. but i did want to drill into your productivity initiatives. is this a program that you've modified since coming on board scott? i mean and can you comment on the 600 projects that you have under way. how would you characterize, how much of this is kind of top-down versus bottom-up? and if it's coming from, broadly within the employee base, what is your approach to incentivizing all and employees to contribute to this pool of productivity ideas?
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
well, look, i would just say that no, it's not me, it's the team doing this. as far as how the team is doing that, jim is going to answer in just a minute. i think the answer to the question is why the employees would be incentivized to do this, is basically because they love olin and want to see olin be really successful in the future. and like i said in my opening, i mean, i'm just so proud of this broader team for really jumping in and originating things. jim, do you want to add anything?
jim varilek -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yeah. what i'll add is that, what we've really done is we've broadened out the program and intensified the program. so we've had productivity in the past, but now it's -- we're literally driving it down to every employee. so on a weekly basis, for instance, at it end -- at the end of a particular week or a shift, some of the folks that are actually operating the plants will get together and say, what did we learn this week at what do we think that we can do better, so and lower cost. and then, they take those ideas and we actually follow-up on those. so that's an example of the kind of thing that even every operator of a plant on the shift or what we're doing, it doesn't matter whether we're closing the books or any price off from the company. we evaluate on a regular basis. what isn't being done well, what did we see that could be done better or save money and then we actually put it into a project and we follow-up on it. so it's a grassroots all employees-based type of program. and then, we elevate them up, then we follow through on the projects.
steve byrne -- bank of america -- analyst

the next question is from john roberts from ubs. please go ahead.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
thank you. scott, olin acquired k. a. steel a long time ago, as a way to get control of more caustic molecules. would that be an example of the type of things that you're thinking about? i know you're thinking about other things in addition to that, where that's not the kind of thing you're thinking about in terms of controlling more molecules?
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, john. right. i mean, i would just say that that could be an example, right? it would be one tool of that. i think, there's a lot of ways to have more molecules flowing through our sphere of influence then doing complete acquisitions though that, probably this industry hasn't seen them added together, right?
they're seeing one-by-one. but in terms of its uniqueness being setup around a model where we go out and do that which will drive growth for many years to come for olin. it will probably be a bit more sophisticated than one-by-one steps.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
and then, secondly, sequentially from third quarter to fourth quarter, your ecu index moved up about 6% and your ebitda on relatively stable volume moved up about 13% for the segment. is that about the right leverage that we should think about kind of a 2-to-1 move in ebitda versus the index.
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, it's probably -- for the level we're at right now, it's probably ok. i mean, as rule -- clearly there is a lot of other things in play in terms of productivity and turnarounds and all of those things, but its certainly indicative.

arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great, thanks. good morning, congratulations on all the progress here. i guess, i just wanted to ask the progress question a little differently. so last quarter, you laid out $50 million to $200 million bucket for optimizing the ecu value. are you -- do you feel like you've achieved maybe the midpoint of that on a quarterly run-rate basis at this point or are you leaning toward the upper-end? and then, secondly, when you think about the move from $250 million to $375 million, say on a quarterly run-rate basis of ebitda, where do you feel like you achieve that $375 million? is it maybe exiting q4 '21,i know that you're not achieving the full $1.5 billion in '21, but do you think you can get to the run-rate of that maybe in late '21 or early 2022?
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
no, i think the answer -- arun, the answer to first part of the question is, that's a little bit of why we are showing a bias to increase what we're forecasting for next year, is that we are leaning beyond the midpoint of that bucket that you referred to. so can you restate, you used the number $375 million and i'm not sure what that number is, i kind have missed it. can you restate what you were asking?
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
well, i was just implying that if you say $1.5 billion on an annual run-rate ebitda basis, maybe that's $375 million a quarter or slightly above that, that's what i was referring to.
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, ok. yeah. i mean that of course is probably two to three years out where we get to that kind of run rate consistently. i mean, are we going to have to reach a point where we touch in the 300s to demonstrate that we have the capability sooner than that? i think we will.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay, great. and then just lastly on leverage, there is a target to get to 3 or so by the end of next year. what -- beyond that, i mean, do you feel like that's the right level for you guys to remain at or would you see you going even lower? and if you remain there, how do you see priorities of cash used? thanks.
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. yeah, todd do you want to answer that?
todd slater -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. sure. arun, we're targeting to be in that 3 times range within the next 12 months. clearly from the leverage -- from the leverage free cash flow of $0.025 to $0.035 a share, we've talked about that will help us, we're going to use that cash to continue to pay the dividend and to reduce debt. we just paid the $120 million in jan -- this january. now the next targeted debt that we have is the $500 million of the 10% bond, it's due in 2025. we're targeted to try to pay those off are fully in 2021. so that's where we're headed. and as we move beyond 2021, clearly we would like to see debt come down a little bit and then we have opportunities for cash as we continue to generate.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks.
operator
the next question is from travis edwards from goldman sachs. please go ahead.
travis edwards -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey there, thanks for the time. i appreciate the color on the business. maybe quick follow-up on the capital allocation side. and i guess at the risk of coming across on record from last quarter, but just on those 2025, i think you've been clear and have proven that-- with the free cash flow you are allocating toward debt reduction by taking out the 23s. i was just wondering, is there anything as far as sort of market environment, credit market support that would exchange how you're thinking about allocating that cash flow, not necessarily toward debt reduction, but maybe coming to market, instead, with your debt trading in the 4% range and those -- the coupon on those being 10%. anything that could -- i guess is there anything in the environment that could change, that would help you rethink or lead you to rethink how your -- how you would address that debt?
todd slater -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. we obviously always look for opportunities to be mindful of ways to reduce our interest cost. however, we also balance that with the amount of free cash flow that olin generates and we need pre-payable debt. so clearly, we are targeting prepaying that $500 million of 10% bonds if possible this year.
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, and just to add on that. todd is exactly right. i mean we're going to go after that $500 million this year. a large part of that certainly comes from our operating cash flow and then we'll do some clever things to get the rest of it.
travis edwards -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. appreciate the time.
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yep.
operator
the the next question is from roger spitz from bank of america. please go ahead.
roger spitz -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you and good morning. for 2021 working capital is-- unless you said this earlier, do you expect that to be a source of use of cash and to what extent?
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i'll just quickly answer it. i mean, we're going to use a little bit of cash for some working capital and that's all factored into it. when we say we're going to get levered free cash flow at $2.50 a share to $3.50 a share, that's all factored into it. it will be a slight use of cash in 20-- 2021.
roger spitz -- bank of america -- analyst
perfect. and i'm wondering back on epoxy, with the hexion premise force majeure in europe, how much is that driving the spike in this -- at the ler versus say, perhaps less chinese import pressure into europe because of stronger demand in china and stronger demand overall? thank you.
pat dawson -- executive vice president and president, epoxy & international
yeah, roger. this is pat. i would say that that force majeure that you referenced is more of a minor issue compared to the bigger issue i mentioned earlier around overall demand and demand out of china.
roger spitz -- bank of america -- analyst
thanks very much, pat. i appreciate it.
pat dawson -- executive vice president and president, epoxy & international
yep.
operator
as there are no further questions, this concludes our question-and-answer session. i'd like to turn the conference back over to scott sutton for closing comments.
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. yeah, thanks. i mean, just in closing, i'd just like to say that olin is going to continue to win our way to a differed valuation, which means we really have to lift olin people high and you might be interested to know that we also host internal progress calls each quarter facing our own internal analyst and it's slightly off-cycle with this call but we call them something different, we call them lifting calls and we have three lifting business units and the leaders of those business units report on our engagement, our drive, our initiatives and progress, similar to what i do here on earnings calls. so we'll look forward to discussing that topic more with you on future calls as well. so thanks a lot for joining us today.

good morning and welcome to olin corporation's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i'd now like to turn the conference over to steve keenan, olin's, director of investor relations. please go ahead, steve.
steve keenan -- director of investor relations
thank you, jason. good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. before we begin, let me remind you that this discussion, along with the associated slides and the question-and-answer session that follows will include statements regarding estimates or expectations of future performance. please note that these are forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected. some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from our projections are described without limitation in the risk factors section of our most recent form 10-k, the third quarter 2020 form 10-q and in yesterday's fourth quarter earnings press release.
a copy of today's transcript and slides will be available on our website in the investors section under past events. our earnings press release and other financial data and information are available under press releases.
with me this morning are scott sutton, olin's ceo; pat dawson, president, epoxy and international; damian gumpel, president, chlor alkali products and vinyls; jim varilek, olin's coo and todd slater, olin's cfo.
call will begin with some brief remarks and thereafter we will be happy to take your questions. i'll now turn the call over to scott sutton.
scott m. sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yes, thanks, steve, and hello to everyone. i'll kick off my comments by saying just how proud i am of our entire olin team for bucking traditional stale paradigms. our fourth quarter results demonstrate the team's resolve and leadership. olin people are masters of the ecu and we are prioritizing value first, above all else, across the entire ecu, not just in one or two products. that means we don't sell excessive volumes into poor quality markets. instead, we withdraw supply and we generate purposeful activations on both sides of the ecu, up and down our derivative chains, resulting in margin improvements on both sides of the ecu.
slide number 12 in the appendix demonstrates this activity and effect. in fact, maybe the most important slide we have ever published is slide number 12. our model also rejects the notion that this business must be deeply cyclical and will always have its co-products moving in opposite value directions, thus generating mediocre ecu returns over the cycle. it is not cyclical and is quite steady when olin does not push excess volume and chase the poor quality side of the ecu down across an inflection point on slide number 12 into an over-supplied swamped of poor pricing.
now, turning your attention to slide number 3, olin's quarterly ecu profit contribution index chart, even though the global chlor alkali market configuration is in the poorest state for olin, in other words when strong, back integrated pvc production, which olin does not directly participate in, pushes out lots of co-produce caustic into a weak caustic demand environment, really the emphasis being on the weak caustic demand point here, we still sequentially lifted our ecu pci by lifting margins across chlorine, edc and virtually every chlorine derivative while simultaneously not allowing olin caustic to decline in price as much as industry indices would have anticipated.
the ecu pci shows our commitment to quality and our adjusted ebitda improvement shows the result of that commitment. i will also comment here that our fourth quarter adjusted ebitda result is pure as there are no non-recurring items included.
and speaking of quality and moving to slides 4 and 5, winchester delivered the best quarterly performance in the business's 155-year history with even better quarters expected throughout 2021. the olin winchester team relishes its commitment to support both the u.s. war fighter and the more than 55 million of us who enjoy shooting sports. these things are woven into the fabric of america and we expect that elevated shooting sport participation is here to stay. u.s. military modernization initiatives are expected to create additional opportunities for winchester as well.
so wrapping up my opening comments with slide number 6, our first half quarterly average ebitda should be better than the fourth quarter of 2020 across every business. note that we do have a number of turnarounds in the second quarter to contend with and we expect a 10% improvement in the ecu pci across the first half.
here are some key points specifically for the first quarter. point number 1, epoxy will be the star of the show and is expected to surpass our prior quarterly ebitda record as the team lifts the permanent earnings foundation of that business to match the value of our product offering. point number 2, our merchant chlorine net-backs go to a multi-year high, following our fourth quarter activations, which included shifting an additional 30% of our ongoing business away from arbitrary external trade indices.
point number 3, our broad productivity gains start to show up as our fourth quarter project pipeline grew by 20%. we start 2021 with 633 active projects. please see slide number 15 in the appendix for some more detail on that. point number 4, the early redemption of $120 million of the high cost acquisition bonds this month was funded a 100% with cash from operations, as was the additional $100 million of bonds repaid last october. through a combination of improved adjusted ebitda, disciplined capital spending and debt reduction, we expect our net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio to improve to roughly three times within the next 12 months.
so looking out just a bit beyond 2021 we have the team, the skill, the operating model and the assets we need to achieve at least $1.5 billion in ebitda. additionally, we have adjusted down our forward annual capital spend requirements to around $200 million, reflecting a better match of our physical plant assets to our model. this adjustment in turn enhances our levered free cash flow and that cash flow inflection point should be clearly evident in 2021. at the same time we rinked $1.5 billion in ebitda, global ecu supply demand fundamentals are likely to be improved and olin will expand our strategy to incorporate fixed asset light structural moves to take us to the next higher ebitda level, as more molecules move through our sphere of influence. those moves are likely to be just as disruptive to conventional paradigms as is our current model.
we will look forward to speaking with you in the future about the next ebitda tranche above $1.5 billion and those supporting activities. so that concludes my opening comments and so operator, we're now ready to take questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from hassan ahmed with alembic global. please go ahead.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global inc. -- analyst
good morning, scott. great numbers, very good guidance, but particularly i like the sort of accelerated debt paydown side of things. now as sort of you guys mentioned that you should be sort of approaching less than two times net debt to adjusted ebitda by year-end. and you also sort of called out the phase four side of the evolution at olin. just wanted to sort of dig a bit deeper into what exactly phase four may look like in terms of deployment of capital. how should we be thinking about m&a? would it be upstream or downstream? and how should we be thinking about share buybacks?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks a lot, hassan. i mean, yes, you're right. i mean toward the end of this year, we end up somewhere at debt-to-ebitda ratio between one and two actually. and that's why we're introducing this phase four publicly now is that we're pulling those activities forward. and i do think m&a can be a part of that. on the other hand, there are some investments that we can make in this phase three of parlaying, too, as we get into differentiated alliances and actually invest in things like working capital to be able to expand the presence of our model. so we have all those things. we are absolutely focused right now on rightsizing our balance sheet and really right conditioning our balance sheet. but hassan, there'll be a lot more to come on phase four. we just haven't fully introduced it yet, and that will be the subject of some future calls.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global inc. -- analyst
understood. understood. and as a follow-up, again, one of the things that you talked about was ending the cycle pattern, as you guys called it. so we understand what you're doing. and obviously, going out, selling into the stronger market, sort of avoiding certain weekend markets and the like. i just wanted to get a sense of what you're seeing on the competitor side of things. i understand it's an oligopoly. but is the market continuing to be disciplined? how should we be thinking about that? because obviously, one of the risks that arises is that you guys may be doing everything right, but there could be some market share gains, there could be some price cutting games. i mean could you just give us a better sense of beyond olin, what you guys are seeing in terms of the landscape?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hassan, of course, it'd be hard for me to comment on competitors and so forth. it's easy for me to comment on what olin is doing as we've really worked ourselves through solving this ecu conundrum, where our market participation is really set on the weak side. and so in doing that, we just don't cross downward inflection points. we only cross upward inflection points on our value curve. and so what that takes you to, hassan, if you think about it, i know there's lots of publications out there and you see the quotes that somehow our capacity utilization is around 80%. but when you're talking about having to run a coproduction scenario, basically serving two or more different needs with one production rate, that 80% has the effect of a 90%. and in fact, you're not going to see us be able to run above 90% because these are challenged assets to run as well. so i just submit that our actions are meeting 80% to be closer to 100%. so maybe not a direct answer to your question, but i will say, our discussions have evolved more toward value with customers than anything else.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global inc. -- analyst
very helpful, scott. thanks so much.
operator
our next question comes from alex yefremov from with keybanc. please go ahead.
alex yefremov -- keybanc -- analyst
thank you and good morning everyone. scott, you were talking about epoxy margins moving toward 30% in the medium to long term. if margins are this high, i assume part of this equation is the price. how do you think competitors and industry, in general, would respond to this? what level of reinvestment economics are we in this position? and do you just see more capacity amount?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. alex, thanks for the question. and i'll turn it over to pat here in just a moment. we probably won't go into the competitor action there. but i would just start pat's comments for by saying that we actually have a long way to go to get to that 30% adjusted ebitda, but it's totally within our scope and range. so pat?
pat dawson -- executive vice president and president, epoxy and international
alex, i would say why not 30%, because i think if you look at the performance properties of epoxy and the fact that there's really not any clear substitutes for epoxy in terms of this performance and the value that it brings to customers. it should be able to command these kind of returns. i think also, you look at our leadership position and the space that we occupy, vis-a-vis competitors, that's more of an upstream, midstream space and the way we can monetize our epichlorohydrin in the form of liquid epoxy resin. i think those leadership positions are very strong. i think, also, we have a number of opportunities to parlay that you see on slide eight, that upstream position and the opportunities that, quite frankly, are already in motion, whether we have the option to toll produce, the option to make versus buy, the option to produce more if we can get the value for that. i think we have a lot of optionality there. so that's the way we look at it. and we're really working to accelerate those parlaying activities as we move early into the game here toward that 30%.
alex yefremov -- keybanc -- analyst
and just as a follow-up, scott, you mentioned, you expect third quarter ebitda to continue improving sequentially. we had a lot of disruptions in the u.s. gulf coast, as you well know. how do you expect pci -- ecu pci to behave from the back half? do you think it will start coming down at some point in the third to fourth quarter from q2 level?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, i mean, i would say our improved ebitda performance is going to be a reflection of an improved ecu pci as well. but what i would say, there are going to be points in our future that, perhaps, we exist through a quarter where we have to make some adjustments in how we're set up as we're running our model and that can lead to potential declines in the ecu pci. but they're going to be short lived because what they do is position us for the next phase of growth that we have in that ecu pci and in our ebitda.
alex yefremov -- keybanc -- analyst
thank you.
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yup.
operator
our next question comes from mike sison with wells fargo. please go ahead.
mike sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
hey guys. a really nice start to the year. i guess, scott, when you think about 2022 and the sustainability of the earnings that you're seeing here in '21, and i know it's a little bit early to give specific guidance, but it does sound like there is potential that '22 ebitda could continue to go up from '21. can you maybe walk through some of the things that you will do under your control to do that? and what needs to happen to keep that progress?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. mike, thanks. and so we have given fairly narrow guidance for 2021, considering where we sit right now, and that's at $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion. and what i said was, look, 2022, it's going to be a positive stepping stone going above that. so we haven't given specifics on that. but some of the items that will help us, right, we've listed out on that slide four. but i would add to that, mike, and i would just say that when you think about supply demand fundamentals looking out a year from now, especially around the ecu, they only improve. and at the same time, we continue to improve and enhance our unique model. and i think when you put those two things together, they underpin all of those activities that we've listed out on slide number four.
mike sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
understood. and then just a quick follow-up. i think you mentioned that the ecu pci will get to about 200 in 2q. is there any way to help us understand how much of the improvement from whatever, let's say, the 100 in the third and fourth quarter is kind of your new business model? and how much was the tightness in normal -- in supply and demand?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, sure. just for clarification, mike, because that index really represents the variable margin of 75% of our company, right. movements in that ecu pci make a very big difference in our profitability. and so what we've said is we've got to move that index up close to 200 to get in the range of $2.5 billion of ebitda. so while i wish it would happen in the second quarter, it's not going to get to that level. so that's kind of where that item sits.
mike sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
great. thank you.
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yup. sure.
operator
our next question comes from kevin mccarthy with vertical research partners. please go ahead.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
yes, good morning. scott, as i listen to the commentary and having read the slides, it seems to me that when we hear about alliances, tolling agreements, bartering, etc., that you're going to be looking for what i would call capital-light solutions to growth as opposed to building, let's say, new greenfield or brownfield capacity. is that correct? or am i over reading into the signals here?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks a lot, kevin. i mean, no. i mean, that's correct. i mean we do have a next path to growth that is capital light. and in fact, we are already engaging in those activities, right? you heard when pat had answered an earlier question that we're doing things like tolling some of our scarce upstream materials into liquid epoxy resin, for example, so that we can service our customer base. and there's just a lot of opportunities to do that across our complete portfolio. so those are the things that we can pull forward the fastest to support growth, right? there's other things we can do beyond that. i don't really see greenfield expansion as part of our future. there could be limited brownfield expansion dependent on the alliance opportunity that we might have, but yes, it's a low capital, near-term growth strategy that will complement with that phase four structure.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
okay, that's very helpful. and then secondly, i'd be interested to hear your updated thoughts on international trade. normally, when prices rise in a parabolic fashion, what would happen is we'd see imports to exploit a physical arbitrage opportunity. in today's market, we've got all kinds of chaos and friction in global supply chains. are you more insulated from trade threats today? and what -- if so, what do you think that means for olin's profitability?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, i'll start this, and then i'll ask damian to add a little bit to it. but our winning model is a very active model. and so we participate in global trade at the right moment with the right products. so we're an active participant in that instead of just being subject to reactions that may develop from that. but damian can probably do a better job with that than i did.
damian gumpel -- vice president, chlor alkali products and vinyls
kevin, just to dovetail on the comment. i would tell you that the way our model is really set up right now is regardless of the stimulus that is put on us, where there's some changes in trade flow, demand flow and use flow, we just adjust to it and not have to mitigate from it. and so as we saw -- just to give you a brief list of examples, we saw, globally, on the vinyl side, a lot of strong demand, a lot of people running for that stronger side, and we're running toward our weaker side of caustic. it didn't mean that we pooled like our participation of caustic, but we look, globally, at where there were pools of available material. and we have done some things in purchasing products from regions that we -- in our prior models, our prior paradigms, we haven't done before. and so by doing that, we were able to effect the participation strategy on our ecus that we wanted to do, but we still met some desires, customer growth and reactions to be able to serve them and their demands ramped up, and we did that in a very fluid and efficient way. so that's just one brief example of kind of the way we adjust to really any curveball or fast ball that comes our way.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
okay. thanks so much.
operator
our next question comes from frank mitsch with fermium research. please go ahead.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
thanks so much. nice results. i just wanted to drill down a little bit more on to the chlor alkali side of things. on slide five, you mentioned that the model fits across millions of additional pounds. and yet you took the decision to shutter 50% of the mcintosh diaphragm capacity. can you talk through the decision behind doing that?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, yes, sure. i mean, this is scott. i'll start. frank, yes, by the way, just for clarification, our model fits across millions of additional tons of material, not just millions of additional pounds of material. just a -- i mean, we do business, we were selling roughly 14 million tons a year. so it's maybe not that far-fetched to think that we can grow at that kind of level. and yes, i mean, look, when you think about the capacity announcements that we've had in terms of shutting down, they were underutilized assets, right? and the reason that they've been underutilized assets has been because of the way we run our model. we said we're not going to participate in poor-quality market. so therefore, as one example, not participating in a poor-quality caustic market means we don't have need for that asset anymore, so we're going to right size our balance sheet to be much more nimble in the future. and that's what it's about. it's not an indicator that demand is weak or weakening. in fact, it's just the opposite.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
understood. and listen, i mean, obviously, the winchester ebitda really jumped off the page, and much of that is lake city is humming along. i mean, when you originally bought that, the indication was that you had about $50 million of ebitda per year, but it looks like it's heading that per quarter. can you talk through what you're seeing with your lake city business? and have we repealed seasonality in ammunition because, obviously, an incredibly strong 1q result.
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, yes, thanks. i mean i would say, actually, lake city is doing as we intended and as we said, maybe just a little bit more. you've got to remember that we integrated it very fast, right? and not only has it become part of our military business but also part of our commercial business. so the performance improvement that you're seeing is across the whole business, ok, after we made the acquisition. and the team did some fantastic work to really go out and optimize our whole supply chain and our whole approach to the market there. and i mean, demand stays strong, and it's really a result of the fact that the sport of target shooting is growing quite a lot, and it continues to do that, and you see us or you will see us start to use the winchester brand to grow that sport of target shooting. and we're doing bangs like. we just had supported the winchester sporting plays, ladies cup. ladies' participation in target shooting is one of the fastest-growing areas, and we're going to be a big player in that.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
got you. thanks so much.
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure.
operator
our next question comes from jeff zekauskas with jpmorgan. please go ahead.
jeff zekauskas -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thanks very much. in the light of your ebitda ambitions, is the pattern of your capital expenditures over the next several years different? that is, is it higher than $200 million a year? and you spoke of buying various assets to fill in, i don't know, tactical or strategic gaps. how much might that cost, roughly?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, yes, jeff, i mean, i would say, in general, for the next few years, we're in that $200 million a year range for capital. but what i would also complement that statement with is the fact that some good opportunities are going to come out of our activities as we move into phase three of parlaying and potentially phase four, structuring. i know you get the phase four structuring piece of it if we did do some targeted m&a. but even in phase three, we may have the opportunity to invest in a different way and, therefore, we might use some of our levered free cash flow to do some of that. but in general, it's going to be $200 million a year, at that level, for the next few years. maybe jim, who's next to me, wants to comment on why we can stay at that kind of level in the base business.
jim varilek -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yes. we're looking very hard at our asset base on a continual basis. a lot of it is about productivity and what we need to run and what we don't need to run. and you've seen the progress that we've made on productivity, some of the asset closures and so forth. that actually reduces the amount of capital that we have to spend, maintenance dollars, fixed costs and so forth. and also the fact that we're now running to the weak side of the ecu. so we look at things a little bit differently than we used to in the past. so at $200 million, we feel like we've made heavy investments in the early part of the building phase, and now we're reaping the benefits of those investments, and so our capital requirements are going to be in that $200 million range for the next few years.
jeff zekauskas -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. and then for my follow-up, how much were your caustic soda volumes up or down sequentially and year-over-year in the quarter?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, i'll pass this to damian. again, i'll just preface it a little bit with the movement of volumes relative to a prior time period in one product are almost inconsequential to our results, right? it's how we use all of those activations to deliver the best value across the whole ecu and all of our derivatives that utilize parts of the ecu. damian can give you something that's probably a little more specific.
damian gumpel -- vice president, chlor alkali products and vinyls
jeff, i'll probably end up saying just another layer to the onion that scott just peeled, in that it really doesn't matter what -- well, the answer is they're lower than they were to any relevant period, but that's a result of our model.
jeff zekauskas -- jpmorgan -- analyst
right. how much lower?
damian gumpel -- vice president, chlor alkali products and vinyls
lower.
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we weren't going to specify those.
damian gumpel -- vice president, chlor alkali products and vinyls
they were purposely -- it was purposely lower. we pulled out of low -- pool of low-value liquidity, wherever they are in the world. so we pulled out of -- in the past, we've said we were at a certain part level of participation on the export market, and if the export markets are weaker and you see where the pricing has been in the globally traded market, that's clearly an area that one can pull back from. and there were others as well. so lower, lower by decision, lower purposely. and it's an area that we still look at managing. we're going to always take a fresh look at what is the relative strength of one side of the ecu toward the other. the ecu is not a zero-sum teeter-totter. we completely break away from that paradigm. and we just played -- we're just going to keep playing to the lower side and the lower side is still caustic soda relative to everything else on the chlorine side.
jeff zekauskas -- jpmorgan -- analyst
lower by 10%. is it as much as that?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
jeff, i mean, what i would tell you is that it actually takes a lot less volume movement than you might be anticipating to keep from moving across a pricing inflection point. and i'll just sort of refer you back to slide six.
jeff zekauskas -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay, thank you.

our next question comes from arun viswanathan with rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. congratulations on the great results here. so first off, i guess i just wanted to understand what you're seeing in the market right now. it looks like you are seeing some uplift in caustic soda pricing as well. what do you expect for caustic soda pricing over the next, say, two quarters or through the rest of this year?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
damian, you want to grab that one?
damian gumpel -- vice president, chlor alkali products and vinyls
sure. i mean the short answer right now is, well, if you look at -- at a high level, the historical trends in association is that caustic trends, where the economy, economies are opening up and so forth. but again, to us, it's a simple equation that goes right back to the ecu. and caustic soda remains the weaker side of the ecu regardless of any upward trend that can be seen with the aforementioned economic recovery, and we still look to manage our participation based on which side is relatively weaker than the other.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. great. and then could you also elaborate on some of your plans moving forward? would you potentially consider opportunities to move more downstream and to, say, pvc? or could you also comment on your participation in edc?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, sure. this is scott. i mean, look, we're not -- we're certainly not looking to move downstream. there's so much opportunity in where we participate today that you're likely to see us do things that complement our existing business. yes, we already go into edc. actually, we're the world's largest merchant marketer of edc as well.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
and then if i could just ask you to comment on overall supply/demand trends. do you think demand has structurally improved in this market? or -- and do you feel a little bit more optimistic about the next several years on demand? or is it still relatively going to follow industrial production for ecu?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. i would just say it's starting to get better, right? it's not super great today. but every month, every quarter seems to generally get a little bit better. and that's been our outlook, anyway, is that demand continues to improve. and certainly, relative to supply, that gap continues to widen.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks.
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yup.

our next question comes from matthew blair with tph. please go ahead.
matthew blair -- tph -- analyst
hey, good morning. congrats on the great results. so it's been reported that one of your competitors will be restarting some chlor alkali capacity after shuttering it for about a year. obviously, a different approach than what you've been taking. but scott, i was hoping that you could just kind of address that. and how do you think about this as the potential risk to the industry that capacity growth might be a little bit more than expected?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, matthew, thanks. yes, i mean, of course, i won't comment on specific competitors and their actions. but what i would say is that factored into our plans, right, is a few that, yes, there will be some supply added over time. it's just that all of that announced supply is likely to be a lot smaller than the growth in demand. and when you marry that up with the fact that there's still a lot of core quality markets out there and, certainly, there's a lot of value left to lift in the ecu, which informs us about how we're going to run olin and what assets we're going to have in our future portfolio, then i only see the overall outlook as positive. so the simple answer is, look, we certainly expect there to be some supply expansions out there.
matthew blair -- tph -- analyst
sounds good. and then i was hoping you could share any more details on just other chlorine derivatives that were especially strong in the quarter, other than edc, which has some pretty transparent pricing. on our sources, it looks like hcl pricing was up more than 100% quarter-over-quarter. but could you just offer any more commentary on what you're seeing on that chlorine envelope?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. well, i mean that chlorine envelope is most of our company. so i'm going to let damian probably make comment or two on something, and then pat might want to add on to his epoxy comments, being a key chlorine derivative for us.
damian gumpel -- vice president, chlor alkali products and vinyls
yes. matthew, i'll refer you to a couple of slides. i'll refer you to slide 17, the appendix showing our heat map, and then refer you to a slide also at the back, slide 21. and both of those, when you put those together, you see pretty widespread interest in olin chlorine and chlorine derivative for a very broad spectrum of end uses. you see continued momentum of -- and request from customers for olin's ability to supply. i'll go back to hassan's comments or questions at the beginning. he asked about are we seeing things -- a question around maybe market share. i will just tell you that our customer forecasts are still for volumes throughout the rest of the year that are higher than our forecasted ability to supply them. so that should give you an indication as to the robustness of the chlorine side, which, of course, is going -- to my earlier comments, is still relatively stronger than the caustic side, so we'll continue to manage the ecu around that. but across gco, hcl, bleach, merchant chlorine, it's all those green lights in the heat map, and i'll pass it over to you, pat.
pat dawson -- executive vice president and president, epoxy and international
yes, damian. i mean, i'd say from an epoxy standpoint, we do sell some of our upstream products into wastewater treatment and municipalities for water treatment. and we've seen that really continue to improve on demand. and from an epoxy resin standpoint, you look at civil engineering, construction, automotive. even though there's been the semi chip shortage, we've seen improvement coming back there. appliances, electronics, we're starting to see maybe a little bit of life again in oil and gas, which uses fusion bonded epoxy for pipelines and areas like that, machinery. a lot of machinery is coated with epoxy. so i think it's back to what scott said, we've seen good month-over-month improvements. but we think we're still very much in the early innings of this demand recovery. we think there's more coming based on some of these end-use markets i just mentioned.
matthew blair -- tph -- analyst
great. thank you.

next question comes from eric petrie with citi. please go ahead.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
hi. good morning.
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hi.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
just looking at your chlor alkali sales exposure by region. over the last couple of years, it's gone from 65% u.s. based to 75%. and that part of the strategy due to the higher netbacks? or how do you see that over time going forward?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, look, i mean, we -- there's lots of opportunities to flex that there. it's just that, certainly, the activities that we've had globally enhanced our business in north america. look, it's a high-level statement, but i think in the future, you'll see us do more business even outside of north america as we really expand and parlay our model.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
okay. and then maybe a question for pat. how much epoxy goes into higher-value versus the low-margin end markets? where do you want to get that down to? and then is there a difference in profitability between regions currently?
pat dawson -- executive vice president and president, epoxy and international
yes, eric, i think if you look on slide eight, we talked about where we're increasing our supply and the high-margin performance coatings. i mentioned civil engineering earlier, formulated-type systems. and certainly, that value over volume orientation that we have is putting more into those types of areas and applications. and there's places where you have low margins in industrial coatings. wind energy has been an area that's been growing, but we've pulled back from some of the low end of that business. and then some of our upstream bleach stocks, we're definitely doing less business there because the value is not there. i think geographically speaking, one of our leadership advantages that we have is we have a lot of flexibility as to how we flex product between the regions. and that's a pretty dynamic process that we use all the time around our activation. so i wouldn't say any one geographies. i don't pay attention to that so much strategically as i do where the opportunities come up to create more value and to juice up our return to the ecu.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
okay. and then lastly, scott, maybe to help us track the progress of the value-first equation and then moving away from indices and higher activation. how much of your 14 million tons that you sell have undergone this change, the strategic change?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, i would just say, if you think about that sort of roughly 14 million tons, i mean, we're left with a very minority part that is still attached to an index directly. and we've still got some hurdles to get off indexes or at least some of indexes by the year-end, and we'll still have some that will continue into next year, particularly in some areas like merchant chlorine, where it's really completely nonfunctional. but after that, we're completely away from in the indexes.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from mike leithead with barclays. please go ahead.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
okay. great. thanks. good morning guy. i guess, scott, a question on the long-term ebitda outlook. i think last quarter on the call, you talked about $1.5 billion being a target level, maybe two years out or so. obviously, the hurricane and market tightness is helping you get there this year. but it seemed like $1.5 billion was roughly where you thought the earnings power of this business could get to over time. and now three months later, you're telling us that it's maybe $1 billion higher than that. so i'm just trying to better understand maybe what's changed over that time, whether it's better confidence in the pricing power, the commercial success you're having? just why has the long-term earnings power of the business moved so much higher over the past three months?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, thanks. yes, i would just say, look, the fundamental factor of good early performance is that the whole company and the whole team is being really successful at running our model. and there's lots of momentum there, and there's lots of runway left there. fundamentally, that's what's going on. i would say that, look, we've talked about other numbers, of course, $1.5 billion, $2 billion, $2.5 billion. i mean these are all just points along an upward curve. there's no cap on this business, right? i'm sort of unwilling to say that we get to a cap or we see any kind of near-term limitation. and so there's just a long runway here. one day, we'll be talking about different numbers as well, but i thought it would be sort of too scary to put up $3 billion today.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
got it. no, that makes sense. and then maybe just a follow-up question on capital spending, tangential to jeff's earlier question. but i think you're guiding capex the next few years to $200 million. and your danda runs around $600 million, which is a much lower ratio than most companies. so can you just talk about how you're able to sustainably achieve that? or would we expect danda to start to move lower toward that capex number over time?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. i'll tell you what, i mean, todd is going to explain why we have such a discrepancy there. go ahead, todd.
todd slater -- vice president and chief financial officer
yes. one thing to remember, mike, is a big portion of our depreciation and amortization is amortization. and included in that amortization are those upfront ethylene payments for 20 years of cost-based ethylene. so amortization is well over $100-plus million a year on those agreements. and so when you look at d and a, that's part of the difference when you may compare us to other people, is those large ethylene investments we made all the way back starting in '15 and were completed in the summer of last year.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you guys.
operator
our next question comes from john roberts with ubs. please go ahead.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
thank you. did you sell any electricity or ethylene during the quarter instead of using it internally?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, yes, john. we did have a gain, right? we called it out as a onetime gain. and that gain is essentially associated with the fact that we buy energy in advance. and i think you're very aware of our gas hedging program. so during the hurricane, because we were ordered to shut down, we had no way to utilize what we had already bought. so we just sold it back.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
so you didn't make electricity there. you just sold the gas back?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
that's part of it. yes, we're not itemizing everything that goes into that $99 million gain because there's a lot of puts and takes there. but yes, that is part of it.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
okay. and then has the pricing dynamics in the ammo industry changed since we now have a duopoly after the breakup of remington?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, look, i mean the remington event happened some time ago. there's quite a lot of producers of ammunition out there. we happen to be the largest and demand continues to grow. and that has been the fundamental change in the pricing dynamic is that this has just become such a large wholesome family sport, where 55 million of us are out there doing sport target shooting, and that's the biggest change.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
how much was price up year-over-year in winchester?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. we didn't give a percent on that, but volume has a lot to do with our growth year-over-year, primarily because of lake city. and then pricing is at least as much as that volume grows.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
thank you.
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
our next question comes from steve byrne with bank of america. please go ahead.
steve byrne -- bank of america -- analyst
yes. thank you. with respect to this 30% ebitda target in epoxy and the shift more downstream and less of the upstream commodity sales. do you have the commercial relationships in those downstream resins and/or the production capacity to move more of the feedstock material into those downstream products? or will this require some acquisitions?
pat dawson -- executive vice president and president, epoxy and international
yes. steve, this is pat. first of all, let me just course correct you here a little bit. really, our sweet spot is in the up and the midstream part of the epoxy value chain. we don't go nearly as far down in that chain as to say the questions that you were asking. we certainly have all the right channels to market in place today, to monetize and to really exert our leadership in it up and midstream. so i would just say just a little correction in how we view that chain and where our strengths are.
steve byrne -- bank of america -- analyst
so you can get to 30% ebitda margins by selling epi and cumene and bpa and so forth and not move downstream?
pat dawson -- executive vice president and president, epoxy and international
no, steve, that's -- again, part of the equation, is the strength in the upstream. but that midstream, we have many channels as to how we monetize the epichlorohydrin and the bisphenol a. so that's where we have a lot of channels, a lot of optionality, a lot of optionality to parlay. so that's pretty broad reaching as you move down into that midstream.
steve byrne -- bank of america -- analyst
and then just curious about the margin on epi. if you look about your broad platform of chlorine-containing derivatives, where would you put epi in the ranking of all of those chlorine-containing products? i mean if you look at the margin difference between your two segments, i'm just curious where that epi would fall in the ranking.
pat dawson -- executive vice president and president, epoxy and international
yes. i don't think we're going to get into the rankings of epi versus derivatives of where we put that epi. epi, make no mistake, is a strategic pillar to our upstream, and it's a strategic pillar as to how we parlay down through the midstream into those various end-use markets where we're prioritizing our value, right, over volume. i think the other thing to keep in mind, steve, is when we had our investors presentation back in february 19, one of the headlines on my slides were in that epi and ler supply demand projected to be tight by 2021. and so we're just entering this phase of what we've been saying for the last two years of what we saw coming in this sweet spot of ours around this up in the midstream and parlaying these things that we talked about on slide eight. so i think those kind of fundamentals bode well for our ability to get to this 30% ebitda in epoxy.
steve byrne -- bank of america -- analyst
and then, scott, just one quick one on your sustainability slide. kudos for you for putting out your scope one and scope two emissions. we understand you also have an emissions reduction target for 2030, just curious as to whether you have a strategy to get that 10% reduction, whether you're already well on your way, or do you anticipate some capex-intensive projects to achieve that goal?
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks a lot for recognizing that. and you're right. i mean we did have that target by 2030, and we're way ahead of that target right now. in fact, that was referenced from our baseline year of 2018. we have already achieved an 8.4% reduction in their carbon emissions intensity. in other words, how much is -- is associated with every ton that we sell. so we're well on our way to exceeding that target.
okay great. hey operator, why don't we take one more question. we're about to run out of time.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from angel castillo with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
angel castillo -- morgan stanley -- analyst
alright. thanks for taking my question. so just one last one on price within the chlor alkali. just thoughts as to how much of it was actually driven by all of the outages that we've seen globally, whether it's both in chlor alkali and epoxy versus your own kind of self-help initiatives and the pricing initiatives. and yes, if you could just break that down, that would be helpful.
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean most of it is our self-health initiatives. there may have been some acceleration, but this really goes hand-in-hand with our actions and our contract strategy. damian, why don't you go in.
damian gumpel -- vice president, chlor alkali products and vinyls
sure thing, angel. so i would tell you that regardless of the outside market condition, our self-help just takes a different form. so as we look at a kind of, going forward with -- as we continue to deploy this model, it's going to be less and less dependent on outside factors. so we just kind of drive again how we want to manage our ecu participation, play to the weaker side. and as we pivot and kind of think going forward here, all that just means is that we'll just want to keep, as we talked before, controlling our own destiny. that just means more flexibility for us. we may certainly engage in a different approach on contracts, with more selectivity on the number of contracts we choose to enter. we certainly want to partner with winners. but within that, there'll be a lot more selectivity and optionality for us in terms of the -- how many contracts we enter into, their duration, their volumes, definitely more dynamic pricing because that will now play into the next level of sophistication with this model that we have really good traction on.
angel castillo -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's very helpful. and then on the epoxy margins, you noted that you expect them to improve sequentially in the second quarter. i was just curious, does that contemplate, i guess, the meaningful pickup in benzene prices and/or as you think about where raw materials are moving, how should we think about that within your guidance?
pat dawson -- executive vice president and president, epoxy and international
yes. angel, listen, we feel very confident in the fact that we've had good pricing momentum. we've seen that pricing momentum continue here in april. there's publicly announced increases out there for may that are also getting good traction. so we feel very good about the sequential improvement in our margins and the sequential improvement in improved returns to the ecu.
angel castillo -- morgan stanley -- analyst
very helpful. thank you.
operator
this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to scott sutton for any closing comments.
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks a lot. i mean i guess in closing, i'd just like to repeat what i said in the fourth quarter earnings call. i mean olin is going to continue to win our way to a different valuation, which means we've got to continue to lift olin people high. so thanks a lot for joining us today.

good morning, and welcome to olin corporation's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to steve keenan, olin's director of investor relations. please go ahead, steve.
steve keenan -- director of investor relations
thank you, sarah. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. before we begin, let me remind you that this discussion, along with the associated slides and the question-and-answer session that follows, will include statements regarding estimates or expectations of future performance. please note that these are forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected. some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from our projections are described without limitations in the risk factors section of our most recent form 10-k and in yesterday's first quarter earnings press release.
a copy of today's transcript and slides will be available on our website in the investors section under past events. our earnings press release and other financial data and information are available under press releases. with me this morning are scott sutton, olin's chief executive officer; pat dawson, president, epoxy and international; damian gumpel, president, chlor alkali products and vinyls; jim varilek, olin's chief operating officer; and todd slater, olin's chief financial officer. scott will begin with some brief remarks, and thereafter, we will be happy to take your questions.
i'll now turn the call over to scott sutton.
scott m. sutton -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, steve, and hello to everyone. look, i'm super proud of the olin team for their passion, results and for their optimism for our future. because of their optimism and success, i have the opportunity to pull forward our value creation formula story. first of all, olin is on track to deliver more than $1.8 billion of adjusted ebitda this year. one proof point to that track is that second quarter adjusted ebitda is expected to exceed first quarter adjusted ebitda, excluding uri onetime impacts, even though we have significant turnarounds in the second quarter. the third quarter adjusted ebitda should also exceed the second quarter. so it is time to start projecting toward a higher adjusted ebitda of $2.5 billion and above in future years, the emphasis really being on the above.
for clarity, 2022 is expected to be a positive stepping stone toward that direction. some key activity to bridge that gap to $2.5 billion are shown on slide number four. but maybe slide number five tells a more comprehensive story to that $2.5 billion and above. olin is quickly moving through four phases of evolution. we have already discussed the first two with you on prior earnings calls, and we are currently in phase two, the leading phase, as we enhance our unique model of optimizing value first across the whole ecu. think of leading as solving the ecu co-production conundrum by setting our participation to the weak side of the ecu, anticipating potential value inflection points and then activating to achieve a desired response.
shortly, we'll be looking to take our innovative model and apply it across multiple millions of tons of similar molecules and parlay the model into a much larger business. all kinds of commercial strategies will be employed in this phase three of parlaying, including bartering, sophisticated trading and differentiated alliances to better serve customers. simultaneously, olin will be preparing for phase four, structuring, as we look to take proceeds from our cash flow machine and invest them in a smart way to expand our beneficial footprint. please don't miss our internal equity price target in the lower corner of that slide. okay. let me pull back to today a bit and fill in some key activities and results.
slide number six shows that in the first quarter, we matched our market participation to the weak side of the ecu. in other words, we sold less caustic, which not only allowed us to hold up caustic value relative to the fourth quarter, but more importantly, allowed us to significantly expand value throughout our chlorine and chlorine derivatives chain. i think the lift in the ecu pci shown on slide number seven clearly shows the positive results. that value impact was also significantly expanded by the innovative actions taken by our epoxy team, as shown on slide number eight. olin is the world's leader in epoxy and our wins continue to stack up as we place our offering with key customers and into key applications.
look, i would also like to highlight the updates made to our olin esg scorecard in the appendix slides. we are generally delivering to many of the commitments made in our sustainability report, but we still have a lot of work to get fully on track here. again, this demonstrates the team's comprehensive passion for olin's broader contribution. so before opening this call up to qanda, let me wrap it all up into contemporary value on slide number nine. our team's shared success in leading and running toward parlaying is forecasted to generate roughly $1.1 billion of levered free cash flow this year, which is the current stock price represents a yield of roughly 16%, really attractive, considering we're just in the early stages of our push for shareholder value delivery.
okay. i mean that concludes my opening comments. and operator, we're now ready to take questions.

[operator instructions] and the first question today will be from mike sison with wells fargo. please go ahead.
mike sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
hey, good morning. nice quarter. scott, just curious, when you think about the ecu pci improvement in q2 to 192 versus the 147.6, how much of that do you think was sort of the strategy versus kind of industry pricing just going up?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
well, i think our strategy is to move olin's pricing as we run our models. so i mean, those things are just intimately connected, mike. i mean we're taking very specific actions and trying to telegraph those actions in advance so that the world understands that this is a purposeful activity.
mike sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
got it. and then you had mentioned in the opening remarks, acquisitions. anything in particular you think would make sense for olin as you look at those opportunities down the road?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
mike, i mean, we still have some work to do in this area, clearly, as we move toward that phase for structuring. but what i would say about potential acquisitions, we'll be looking for something that essentially adds another layer or a box around our matrix. and when we were able to improve the value of that acquisition, it's significant enough to impact our performance all the way back to the fundamental ecu. so that will sort of be our main criteria to go after acquisitions.
mike sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
great. thank you.
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
thanks, mike.
operator
and the next question will come from hassan ahmed with alembic. please go ahead.
hassan ahmed -- alembic -- analyst
good morning, scott.
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
hi, hassan.
hassan ahmed -- alembic -- analyst
scott, question on chlor alkali products. sequential sort of margins over there, sequential ebitda over there, q1 to q2. i mean adjusting or scraping away the uri sort of favorable impact, if i took a look at the margins, the margins were relatively flat quarter-on-quarter. ebitda was up, call it, around $17 million. and this is despite you guys calling out higher ecu contribution sequentially. and if i took a look at the slides and heard your comments probably, you talked about sort of lower volumes.
so the question really is despite these favorable pricing trends, margins were relatively flat, ebitda was up slightly. i'm just trying to understand the sort of negative volume impact properly. how much of that was you guys actually sort of taking out volumes from the system versus i keep hearing about supply chain disruption impacts, logistical sort of issues and the like in the quarter? so if you could just parse those out as they relate to the volumes.
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yes. i mean, thanks a lot. i mean the way we would answer that question basically is that, look, we're -- i mean we're running our model, which is focused on value over volume. so what you saw happen in the second quarter is, of course, our pricing went up, our ecu pci improved. but the reason that you sort of see the margin issue there in capv is we did have some fixed cost issues that won't repeat themselves in the third quarter, so we've addressed that item. absolute profit up, margins kind of flat, understood to be because of the fixed cost and that doesn't continue, hassan.
hassan ahmed -- alembic -- analyst
understood. understood. and as a follow-up, on the raw material side of things, obviously, we've seen higher natural gas prices as it relates to the epoxy segment. we've seen sort of higher benzene and propylene prices. so as you have given your guidance for the second half of the year, how are you guys thinking about sort of raws? how are you managing those sort of higher prices? and as you've given your guidance, if raws do come down, could that be the source of a tailwind above and beyond what you guys have guided to?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yes. i mean, some of those things you mentioned really impact our epoxy segment quite a lot. so i'll ask pat to answer it.
pat d. dawson -- executive vice president and president of epoxy & international
yes. hassan, i think, first of all, raw material costs, the hydrocarbon costs have really never had a big impact on the epoxy business. we deal with those pretty easily through our value chain. so i wouldn't really -- i'm really not concerned about what happens with hydrocarbons given our ability to pass those costs along and to manage those costs within our system. and of course, we do have options to make versus buy in our key raw materials around things like bpa, phenol and even epichlorohydrin.
hassan ahmed -- alembic -- analyst
very helpful. thanks, guys.

the next question will come from jeff zekauskas with jpmorgan. please go ahead.
jeff zekauskas -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thanks very much. how do you see changes in global epoxy supply and demand now that prices have elevated? do you think that it will invite new competitors in? or some of your competitors may extend capacity? or you think it will take quite a long time?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
thanks, jeff. i mean i'll just start it out and then pat will give a little bit of color on maybe some specific areas of demand. but generally, jeff, i mean, demand is superb and improving across multiple segments that epoxy goes into. pat, do you want to give a little color?
pat d. dawson -- executive vice president and president of epoxy & international
yes, jeff. i think if you look at some of the major markets, we have a variety of markets that we sell into, the biggest markets being around industrial and performance coatings. but we also -- electronics is very important to us. automotive and, of course, between automotive and electronics, they get intertwined with electrical vehicles and a lot more printed circuit boards being put into electric vehicles and that plays to our strength with what we do in electrical laminates in asia. appliances, very strong. oil and gas, we're seeing oil and gas improving. there's more demand coming in oil and gas for fusion-bonded epoxy resins.
and then, i don't know, jeff, if you caught this or not, but the marine coatings have been very pretty much, pardon the pun, dead in the water for the last, i'd say, five years. in shipbuilding, container ships or orders for new container ships in the first five months of this year were nearly double the orders for all of both 2019 and '20. so this is demand for epoxy that is yet to be realized but will come in 2022 and 2023.
jeff zekauskas -- jpmorgan -- analyst
i guess for my follow-up, there have been so many outages in the united states because of weather in chlorine and caustic, which has tightened supply/demand balances. if we don't have outages to come and the industry gets back up to normal rates of production, do you think the supply/demand balance in chlorine will change in 2022?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yes. i mean, jeff, this is scott. i mean, i guess two points. number one, we're running our model. and so we control supply/demand characteristics of our business. that's point one. but even if you fast forward to 2022, ecu demand growth outstrips ecu supply growth. same exact thing in epoxy and epichlorohydrin, right? demand growth far outstrips supply growth. and if you take that to our small caliber ammunition business, winchester, you see exactly the same phenomena as well.
jeff zekauskas -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay, thanks so much.
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
sure.

john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
thank you. what's the range of your chlorine realized prices? and is it fair to say that including the tio2 and the dow contract, about half your volume in chlorine is locked into these lower-priced contracts?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yes. i mean we have a -- yes, thanks for the question. i'll ask damian just to comment a little bit. at a high level, we have a really broad range with a lot of opportunities. damian, you want to give some color?
damian gumpel -- vice president of olin and president of chlor alkali products & vinyls
yes. sure thing. john, good morning. yes, we've talked about in the past that aside from the 30% of the ecus that are on this long-term cost-based arrangement, the remainder of our merchant chlorine, we've said that we've moved a significant portion off of indices and put them within our own destiny. and we still have a ways to go, but even within this quarter, we achieved moving another significant chunk of this volume off of the rearview mirror, arbitrary indices and stepped up the value of that chlorine into its true reflection of its market value in our system.
so still a way to go, but this second quarter through everything we've done in running our model, we've achieved yet another milestone step for us on our way to put more of our ecus back into our own -- chart our own destiny with them as we prepare for 2022 and beyond.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
and then i guess i don't understand the primer market that well in the winchester business. how big is primers as a percent of winchester or however you want to characterize it? and what's going on with pricing on primers? because that's something we don't observe in the market.
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
go ahead, brett.
brett a. flaugher -- vice president and president of winchester
sure. there's really two manufacturers of primers in the us right now, winchester is the largest. one of the things that we've taken a strong look at is our past practices and the complicated nature of building primers and the high start-up costs of getting into the primer business. and we're exploring strategies that will help us get full value out of our primer manufacturing capabilities.
operator
thank you. and the next question will be from frank mitsch with fermium. please go ahead.
frank mitsch -- fermium -- analyst
hey, good morning and congrats. as i look at your epoxy results in the second quarter and the guidance for a higher third quarter in that business, i mean, we're starting to talk about an $800 million ebitda run rate. i mean, is that the sort of neighborhood that we should start thinking about for the epoxy business?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yes. thanks a lot, frank. i mean, this is scott. look, what i will say is we're just not up to our target yet. and so we have some work to do in that business, right? we put a target out there of 30%, which maybe, at the end of the day, gets exceeded, but we still have some work to do, so gets you to a range.
frank mitsch -- fermium -- analyst
okay. got you. and then if i think about the ratchet principle, that almost implies a continued upward pci. you're getting close to that 200 level on the ecu pci that we've talked about in the past that is necessary for a $2.5 billion ebitda. is something like that nearer term than perhaps we thought before? what are your current thoughts about getting to that kind of that midterm target?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
well, i mean, frank, i mean, that's what we're working toward. what i will say is the ecu pci has moved up, and we're going to continue to work on moving it up. most of the growth of that has been from the derivative businesses we have. and if you think about the lynchpin products that i talked about, so the two that go into that ecu pci, our elemental chlorine and epichlorohydrin.
i'll just say right now that neither one of them sell in the merchant market anywhere close to reinvestment economics, so we have some room to move there. but we've also got some period of time to work our way out of certain handcuffs that we have today. as damian said, we're making some progress on that.
frank mitsch -- fermium -- analyst
perfect. thanks so much, scott.

paul staudinger -- keybanc -- analyst
this is paul staudinger on for aleksey. is it possible that you may look at extending the 10-year supply agreement of 30% of your ecus earlier than 2025? and then just a follow-up, could you discuss the size of the squad weapon opportunity? thanks so much.
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yes. yes. thanks a lot, paul. look, i mean i would just say, for those 30% of our ecus, that ends in 2025 and any option is accretive for us. and what i'll do, i'll ask brett to answer the second part of that.
brett a. flaugher -- vice president and president of winchester
sure. thanks for the question, aleksey. since we've taken over lake city, we've been highly involved in the next-generation squad weapon program. it's hard to define the scale of it right now, but it's large. it's more than just making ammunition at lake city. we have to support the army in building out a whole new infrastructure. we're active in that today. we do believe by about 2024 that that will ramp up extensively and really go throughout the whole contract period for us at lake city. so it's a big program for the army, and we're highly involved in that right now.

thank you. and the next question will be from kevin mccarthy of vertical research. please go ahead.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research -- analyst
good morning. scott, i appreciate you're a lot more focused on value versus volume. nevertheless, the volume side has been quite volatile lately really across the industry. and so if i think about the third quarter versus the second quarter, what kind of volume uplift might we see in chlor alkali and vinyls? and what kind of benefit would you anticipate relative to superior fixed cost absorption, for example? maybe you could just kind of talk through some of the force majeure declarations and operating rate changes that are kind of running through your business right now.
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yes. thanks a lot, kevin. i mean, you're right. of course, we're focused on value over volume. i don't think in the third quarter that our volumes would be lower than they are in the second quarter. but what i will add on to that is the fact that we're getting traction in our phase iii of parlaying, so essentially applying our model to molecules that aren't necessarily made on our assets but flow through our business and run through our matrix. so there's likely to be some additional growth in that.
so what we're trying to do, kevin, is we're really matching up. we're going to drive for value, yet we have a thematic to be able to still grow the company without having to build new assets. that's where we are.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research -- analyst
okay, thank you for that. and then secondly, with regard to winchester, it looks like your sales were up, i guess, 110% in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. can you help us with how much of that uplift would have been attributable to price versus volume? and then on the pricing side, are there additional price benefits that you would anticipate in the third quarter sequentially versus the second quarter?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yes. on the winchester revenue being up, i mean, it's a mix of both, right? it's priced across our complete business, including the new business at lake city. but it's also that volume that comes from lake city and being able to utilize that some. if you look at our pricing chart in the back of the presentation, you'll see that we have announced another price increase in winchester for the third quarter on some products. so that will be partially effective through the third quarter.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research -- analyst
perfect. thanks a lot.

and the next question is from josh silverstein with wolfe research. please go ahead.
josh silverstein -- wolfe research -- analyst
good morning, guys. we're just looking at the ebitda guidance for next year to be at least up year-over-year. can you talk about the different business units? what you're expecting there? i imagine epoxy is probably moving higher with the margins. but anything that you can kind of break down by the different business units would be helpful.
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yes. i mean we didn't give -- i appreciate the question, but we didn't give a breakout by business of what's expected there. but the reality is, i can indirectly answer your question by saying that in each business, fundamentals did better. and in each business, we have a specific set of actions that are likely to add value as well.
you've heard -- just to give examples of it, you've heard the team speak to some of those, right? we release ourselves from more contractual restrictions in capv. we work the upstream linchpin product more in epoxy and we're going after more recreational shooters in our winchester business by growing the pie, not taking share as well. so you might have a view that it's broad-based.
josh silverstein -- wolfe research -- analyst
got you. that's helpful for that. and then just as far as free cash flow deployment for next year, you guys are doing the $1 billion of debt reduction this year. is there more balance sheet cleanup for next year? or can you start to think about stepping up the return on capital profile using cash flow for m&a? how are you guys thinking about that $1 billion potentially for next year?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yes. no, we have a number of options we're thinking about. todd, do you want to give a little bit on that, yes?
todd a. slater -- vice president and chief financial officer
yes. no problem. i mean if you think about it, where we sit in 2021 today, we're generating $1.3 billion of free -- levered free cash flow. that's a cash flow yield of around 18% based on our current stock price. clearly, we're going to use about $1 billion of that to reduce debt. and by reducing debt today, that really frees the balance sheet up to provide flexibility going forward to accomplish those structuring activities, including m&a and parlaying activities as we are. but parlaying activities are obviously much more capital light.
josh silverstein -- wolfe research -- analyst
is there any necessary, i guess, balance sheet cleanup for next year? or can you really just redeploy all that $1 billion for those other activities?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yes. i'll jump in, todd. and so this is scott. i mean part of it will go toward structuring activities, assuming we're successful at finding some targets that complement our model there. we'll be exploring some other options as well. there's not a lot more debt that we necessarily intend to take down, but we will be exploring other ways to get value for shareholders. look, i mean, at the end of the day, if this phenomena of multiple compression keeps happening in our stock price, our equity becomes the best return for us. it sits at an 18% return right now.
josh silverstein -- wolfe research -- analyst
got it. yes, that's what i was trying to get out. all right. thanks, guys.

and our next question is from arun viswanathan with rbc. please go ahead.
arun viswanathan -- rbc -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. congrats on the results. so yes, i guess, first question, just real simply, could you just reiterate or describe the impact of natural gas on your business? there has been some inflation there recently. is there any hedging that we should be aware of? or what's the impact there?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yes. hey, arun, thanks a lot. i mean, yes, we do hedge. i mean, todd, do you want to give a little more?
todd a. slater -- vice president and chief financial officer
sure. arun, in the near term, we are very heavily hedged. so as you've heard from us before, about a quarter out, we are fairly heavily hedged. so we have a high degree of cost certainty in sort of a rolling four-quarter basis. so your comment about natural gas, natural gas clearly is coming up lately. you really won't see -- unless that is sustained, you will see that in our results over the next year as our hedges start to roll off. and back in the deck, we said the dollar change in gas is worth $50 million of cost.
arun viswanathan -- rbc -- analyst
great. and then, this is a follow-up, so i guess what i'm hearing from you is the primary market is a little bit of a bottleneck within winchester that potentially could be a value creation mechanism for you guys. is that the right way to think about it? and if you could maybe, how would you characterize the bottleneck in chlor alkali, vinyls and epoxy? what are the kind of the linchpins there?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yes, sure. i mean the primer -- our primer business is certainly a linchpin for us. and like brett said, there's limited suppliers of that and we haven't fully exercised that yet. but as our business grows, certainly, we're going to use that to support our business. in the other -- in the chemicals business, epichlorohydrin is the key upstream material for liquid epoxy resin. there's only one producer of that in all of the americas, and we're also the leading producer in europe as well. so by driving value of that key upstream intermediate, we can drive value across our whole downstream portfolio in epoxy and so you get a large value boost.
the same sort of thing applies to elemental chlorine. if there's one key to this company that lifts more value than anything else, it is that continuing value lift of elemental chlorine and using that elemental chlorine according to the best return to the ecu across our broad downstream derivative portfolio, not just in our capv business but also in our epoxy business as well.
arun viswanathan -- rbc -- analyst
great, thanks. and if i could just ask one more quick one. have you had any impact from the container shortages globally? is that something that's a pressure point now? or do you see that not as an issue for you? thanks.
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yes, sure. i mean from a supply chain, there's been some impact that we've been able to deal with. but the neatest impact is the future impact in pat's business of epoxy, where new ships are being built. many new containers to be utilized on these ships, all those things are coated inside and out with epoxy. so it's actually a forward positive impact.

and the next question will be from eric petrie with citi. please go ahead.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
hey, good morning, scott.
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
hi, eric.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
i wanted to ask about your comment on chlorine supply in the tio2 industry. what are the pros and cons? and are these producers that securing other supply or just not -- or just resistant to paying higher price for chlorine?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
well, no, i would say that that whole industry gets chlorine from olin that is far undervalued, and we have commercial arrangements today that keep that chlorine far undervalued relative to any other opportunity that we have for that chlorine including, in many cases, just not selling it at all. so there's a value uplift opportunity there
and i guess what we're saying is we're just not going to be in the business of that supply in a big way in 2023 because we're going to -- if we have to continue supplying according to the terms that we have today, it essentially means that we're going to match that supply up to a future decision around the capability to supply, so that's what we're doing.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
helpful. and then as a follow-up, i think seasonality in 2018, 2019 third quarter and the fourth quarter resulted in ebitda lower by $100 million. what are you seeing this year based on your order books and inventory supply?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yes. well, like we say, third quarter is expected to be better than second quarter. you might compute from our guidance of at least $2.1 billion in the full year that it's possible that we face a few challenges there in the fourth quarter that had to do with some seasonality. but i'll say, supply chains are empty, so we've still got a lot of work to do there to see the final story.

the next question is from angel castillo with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
angel castillo -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you for taking my question. congrats on the quarter. i just wanted to, i guess, expand a little bit more on the net productivity. your slide showed $100 million for 2021, and i believe the range was previously $50 million to $100 million, so you continue to do very well here and a lot of initiatives underway. so curious, one, can you expand on the comments of the additional underutilized capacity under review? and then just how should we think about net productivity for the remainder of the year and going into 2022?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
sure, i'll turn that question to jim.
james a. varilek -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yes. thanks for the question. you're absolutely right. we have been successful with our program. we've got a very broad-based program. we've got over 1,200 different active projects across every geography, every division, every function. so we've got the whole company involved in productivity, so that's a positive. we did remove the bottom end of the range as we made progress against the program. so we have a $100 million target out there right now.
and as far as capacity, you can see on the slide that a lot of the projects and a lot of the productivity projects are related to capacity. and looking at scrutinizing capacity for high investment, high costs, underutilized, and we're not going away from that. so even though we've made some progress up to this point, we're going to continue to evaluate all of our assets for the value they're delivering, the investment that they require, and we'll make decisions as we go forward.
angel castillo -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you. and then just i wanted to follow-up a little bit more on the, i guess, that last question around the fourth quarter. it sounds like it's -- is the right way to read that, that there's just conservatism kind of embedded in that fourth quarter, just given the visibility into the market heading into, i guess, the next couple -- next few months? or is there anything else, i guess, to consider there as we look at the overall guidance? because i guess the way i'm looking at the guidance, it implies the continued step-up of ebitda from the $559 million this quarter.
so just looking at it from that perspective, it would seem to suggest that 2021 could be $2.2 billion or higher, if you kind of continue the steady improvement, which puts 2022 even higher. so just, i guess, a little bit more color would be helpful around how to contextualize that.
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yes. yes. thanks. i mean, look, our guidance is at least $2.1 billion for the year. i don't know -- i wouldn't say it's conservatism when we think about the fourth quarter, but we are heading into a fourth quarter where market dynamics and market fundamentals are different than maybe many years in the past. in fact, they're slightly better than many years in the past.
so that sort of normal seasonality or downturn that you get, we're working hard to mitigate that. the only reason you may sense some conservatism is we just don't want there to be a mistake. if we run into a little gully on the way up the mountain to adjust our model in a time of a little bit of seasonality that the external world sees that as us heading down a trough, which absolutely isn't the case as we've said about 2022.
angel castillo -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you.

good morning. thanks for taking my question. scott, asia caustic soda prices have been improving in july. they're currently about $60 a ton above the q2 average. do you have any more color here? and does this provide support for us caustic price increases?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yes, sure. thanks for the question. i mean in general, of course, we don't overly focus on one product. we're always focused on improving the whole ecu. but let me see if damian can give us a little bit of color about what's going on there.
damian gumpel -- vice president of olin and president of chlor alkali products & vinyls
sure thing. matthew, caustic soda in the second quarter, we did see demand starting to pick up as it tracks general economy pickup, particularly in north america, and we did see some activity pick up in europe as well.
but generally speaking, while supply/demand fundamentals of caustic soda did improve, and we have seen prices starting to reflect that, clearly, that supply/demand situation in caustic is still relatively weaker than the supply/demand configuration we see in chlorine. so albeit, sequentially, caustic fundamentals on their own are showing improvement and even through third quarter as seen by some recent price increase announcements, caustic soda still remains the weaker side of the ecu, and we continue to run our model against that weaker side.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt -- analyst
got it. and then on slide 6, where you mentioned that you're completing the 10-year contract term for 30% of your ecus. so that 30% applies to your volumes, right? can you give us a general idea of what kind of ebitda you're getting off that 30%? would it be like less than 15% of your ebitda?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman

matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt -- analyst

the next question is from mike leithead with barclays. please go ahead.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
great, thanks. good morning, guys. first question, i think on your longer-term outlook in 2025, you mentioned some options, including redirecting the contracted ecus to significantly lowering your carbon footprint. so i was hoping you could flesh out a bit more what you meant by that comment.
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yes. i guess what i said is that that's a lot of volume. you just heard me say it's cash value destructive. it ends in 2025. we're not producing that volume. certainly, our carbon footprint goes down and it also turns out being accretive to us from a financial standpoint as well. so it's like a win-win.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
got it. okay. that makes sense. and then second question, i think diluted share count is up about 4% year-to-date. where should we expect that number to finish the year? and relatedly, you've highlighted m&a opportunities, but you've also made pretty clear in your slides, you think your shares are more than 50% undervalued. so once debt paydown is complete, how should we think about accelerating buybacks versus m&a?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yes. well, todd will make a comment on that first part of the question. maybe i'll comment on the second part.
todd a. slater -- vice president and chief financial officer
yes. yes. our outstanding shares have increased this year, a little over two million shares. as you can see through the cash flow statement, we've had some option exercises this year and that generated about $50 million of cash flow for olin this year. when you look at our absolute level of share count, we are still well below where the share count was post the shares that were issued back in 2015 for the dow acquisition.
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
and on the second point, i mean, clearly, any acquisition we do, it's going to be more than, of course, going out and buying ebitda. there's got to be quite a lot of synergy value but the direct synergies would be just a smaller part of that. the larger synergies would come from the fact that we expand this interlinked matrix where we're able to execute multiple activations on any given day and get a response somewhere else in the matrix that maybe no one expected that is able to lift olin's value.
so we'd have to be able to get significant uplift. what that will compete with right now, of course, is our levered free cash flow return per share, which again, is 18% or 20%, whatever it is today. so that's a hurdle right now to put the money in growth acquisitions.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
got it. thanks, guys.

and the next question is from steve byrne with bank of america. please go ahead.
steve byrne -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you. scott, you mentioned pricing on both sides of the ecu have improved. my question for you is how has mix shift driven that? you have these numerous buckets that you move the chlorine atoms into -- and how have you -- how has that changed to drive up that value? and more importantly, how much more could it change? you mentioned the merchant sales on tio2 is just one piece, but are you able to move significantly more in various buckets than you have so far?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yes. i mean, thanks a lot for the question. i mean, the answer to both of those is sort of the same. how much has it contributed? how much can it contribute in the future? and the answer is a lot to both. this is our model. we're moving things around every day and letting the weaker side of the ecu guide our market participation in looking at our complete derivative change about which one is delivering the most value on any given day. we only expect to be able to expand our capability to do that in the future, not only through our activities today, but through our parlaying activities and through our structuring activities as well.
steve byrne -- bank of america -- analyst
and then maybe a similar question on the epoxy business. have you shifted volumes either more downstream or upstream? and how does that shift get reflected in your pci algorithm? i mean, you're moving some portion of your -- of the chlorine side of the ecu into that business, and that business is generating more profit. is that reflected in your pci?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yes. i mean, pat, do you want to give a little color?
pat d. dawson -- executive vice president and president of epoxy & international
yes, steve. i think, first of all, we've got a lot of flexibility in this prioritization of value over volume within the epoxy value chain, right? so -- and we have a lot of flexibility. obviously, we've got a lot of flexibility on our pricing as demonstrated here over the last three months, six months or a year. so we have a lot of flexibility to do that. and i think on mix, we look across that whole portfolio of epoxy from upstream epi and even converting that phenol into bpa. we've got options there that we're discovering.
and then we have a lot of optionality of where we place that epi molecule, and we monetize it in the form of liquid epoxy resin, converted resins. we systematize that ler into things like laminates, wind energy, so a lot of flexibility. and then the last part of that mix flexibility is around merchant versus captive. so that's kind of the way we think of it. it's a pretty dynamic grid of where we can extract the best value across that whole chain.
steve byrne -- bank of america -- analyst
and do your decisions get reflected in that pci?

the next question is from travis edwards with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
travis edwards -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for the time. i wanted to follow-up on josh's question earlier around capital allocation. if you had 1.5 times leverage this year and ebitda is in the same ballpark next year or better, presumably, leverage improves further. but i'm curious, when you talk about freeing up the balance sheet to engage in m&a opportunities or shareholder remuneration, is there a sort of range of leverage you plan to manage to as you consider these opportunities, specifically when commodity conditions may not be as favorable?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
todd, do you want to comment?
todd a. slater -- vice president and chief financial officer
yes. travis, we think about the absolute level of debt. and you heard the comments earlier, with the actions we're doing in 2021, that really gets us in the range of where we're looking for maybe a little bit more next year, but it's -- we're down to the absolute level of debt, not necessarily a leverage target.
travis edwards -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then a separate question, but i guess somewhat related is -- look, a potential path to an investment-grade rating has been occasionally brought up in our conversations around olin. but regardless of your desire or the probability of that happening, i'm curious, are there even specific quantifiable benefits to business fundamentals, again, separate from the general, more favorable issuance costs? but are there specific benefits to actual business fundamentals, renegotiating terms, etc., if you have an ig rating?
todd a. slater -- vice president and chief financial officer
well, we generally, and we've said this before, is we target to operate our business with investment-grade metrics. and i think we're well on that pathway as we continue to repay debt this year. and so we -- it's our view that the business fundamentals within olin and how we want to operate, operating with investment-grade metrics is critical for us as we move forward.
travis edwards -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thanks for the time.
operator
and the next question is from roger spitz with bank of america. please go ahead.
roger spitz -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you. i have two. the first is can you articulate your latest view on your desire to achieve ig ratings from the agencies rather than just operating with ig metrics?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
todd, do you want to continue on that?
todd a. slater -- vice president and chief financial officer
yes. roger, this is todd. we want to operate with investment-grade metrics. we have never stated that that was a -- publicly that that is a goal of the company to become investment grade. we want to operate with investment-grade metrics, and we think that what we're doing with the balance sheet to delever gives us the flexibility as we move forward.
roger spitz -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you. my second one is you're clearly changing the chlorine caustic ler pricing paradigm in a very significant way. what has changed for you to be successful, i mean, clearly, it's your will and drive, but is there any other change in the industry dynamic that is allowing you to turn this paradigm on its head in an extraordinarily positive way? thank you.
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
well, i mean, i wouldn't say it's industry dynamic. i would just say that olin is controlling its own destiny and changing its own outcome. in other words, we're the leader in elemental chlorine. we have a contrarian model that we are focused on every day to go get the value. we have a list of clear actions, and we've identified elemental chlorine as the number one driver of this company's overall value evolution. and it is a ratchet and a linchpin because of that, and that's how we treat it. and when you focus on it that much, you're going to liberate a lot of value.
roger spitz -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. thank you very much for your time.
operator
[operator closing remarks]
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yes. okay. yes. thanks a lot. i mean i guess what i would say in closing is that olin is really focused on two main activities right now. the first one is lifting up all our olin teammates who are doing just a great job. and the second one is that we're continuing to print wins and demonstrate success so that we can, in turn, demonstrate that we deserve a higher valuation. so with that, thanks a lot for joining us today.

operator
good morning, and welcome to olin corporation's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note, this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to steve keenan, olin's director of investor relations. please go ahead, steve.
steve a. keenan -- director of investor relations
thank you, chad. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. before we begin, let me remind you that this discussion, along with the associated slides and the question-and-answer session that follows, will include statements regarding estimates or expectations of future performance. please note that these are forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected. some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from our projections are described without limitations in the risk factors section of our most recent form 10-k and in yesterday's second quarter earnings press release. a copy of today's transcript and slides will be available on our website in the investors section under past events.
our earnings press release and other financial data and information are available under press releases. with me this morning are scott sutton, olin's ceo; pat dawson, president, epoxy; damian gumpel, president, chlor alkali products and vinyl; brett flaugher, president, winchester; jim varilek, olin's coo; and todd slater, olin's cfo. scott will begin with some brief remarks, after which we will be happy to take your questions.
i'll now turn the call over to scott sutton.
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yes. thanks, steve, and hi, everybody. look, i mean, the most important data to know today is our own employees are accelerating our success. so we're going to use this earnings call to forecast just a bit further down the runway as well and keep up with our team's momentum. as previously forecasted, the second quarter adjusted ebitda did exceed the first quarter adjusted ebitda by $119 million or 27% excluding the onetime benefit from winter storm uri in the first quarter. we also forecast that the third quarter adjusted ebitda will exceed the second quarter as well, and we expect our full year adjusted ebitda result to be at least $2.1 billion. so opening up with slide number three in the presentation, 2022 is a positive stepping stone for olin, principally because we will grow the number of knobs in our hands via expansion of our interlinked matrix of activation nodes. the various combinations of activations across the interlinked matrix are what lifts olin's value. generally, the first order of effect of a singular activation is unseen. however, the second or third order effect from multiple activations is what lifts the whole olin tide.
fundamental to that rising value tide are our three linchpin products: elemental chlorine, epichlorohydrin and ammunition primers. our pricing in those products is a ratchet. our pricing only turns one way and does not reverse. if necessary, we will sell zero volume into the freely negotiated market to preserve our ratchet principle and the value of our broad downstream chains based on those linchpin products. across all our businesses, supply chains are closer to empty than full. and in 2022, we expect demand growth to outpace supply growth. continuing to slide number four. in 2022, we should gain traction in our next phase of parlaying and potentially surface some acquisition opportunities to complement our differentiated model. and in doing so, use the funds from the olin cash flow machine to deliver more value to our shareholders.
on slide number five, that parlaying activity is new in 2021, but we do have some accomplishments to catch up on and report beginning here in the second quarter, which reached an annual run rate of about 500,000 tons of molecules made on somebody else's assets but now running through our matrix. we will share a tracking mechanism to report on our progress in this important area as we move into 2022 and beyond. in my opening comment, i said we would forecast just a bit further down the runway.
so on slide number six, we are calling out a few discrete upsides beyond 2022. i will just note that we have a lot of elemental chlorine, a linchpin product moving into the titanium dioxide space. we won't be supplying large parts of that industry in 2023 as we move that chlorine volume into higher-margin end users or completely take it out of our system. in 2024, we expect winchester's participation in a next-generation squad weapon program to become significant.
and we have brett flaugher here, our winchester president, with us today, if you have some questions about that or about our expectations to continue growing the recreational shooting pie as well. and finally, in 2025, the 10-year cost-based sales contract term representing 30% of our ecus is completed as well, and all options are accretive for olin. some options substantially reduce our carbon footprint as well as we evolve our esg scorecard targets. pulling back to today a bit, please see slide number seven and number eight. as our mastery of the ecu conundrum solution continues to improve, we matched our market participation to the weaker side of the ecu, caustic, and pricing on both sides of the ecu improved versus the first quarter, the first time that pricing on both sides of the ecu moved in the same direction since we have articulated this contrarian model. not surprisingly, the olin ecu profit contribution index lifted again.
moving to slide number nine. i hope you noted that winchester's second quarter adjusted ebitda improved to $115 million, so in addition to our future participation in the army's next-generation squad weapon, we are embarking on a plan to wrench some of the 175 million adults and part of the 45 million youths who don't participate in target shooting today by using the winchester brand to grow the overall pie. so before opening the call up to q&a, let me call out a few key elements at play in the third quarter on slide number ten.
first of all, fundamentals are good. we started off the third quarter with our model positioned to participate less in the weaker side of the ecu, caustic. but as we move through the rest of the third quarter, we will adjust our configuration depending on which side of the ecu is weaker relative to the other side. we relished that opportunity to add another proof point to our model and demonstrate that we deserve a higher valuation. epoxy continues its upward adjusted ebitda margin march as it is now at 22%. and winchester improves its value equation even though we expect commodities cost to be sequentially higher in the third quarter.
that concludes my opening comments. and operator, we are now ready to take questions.

thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] and the first question comes from hassan ahmed with alembic global. please go ahead.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
good morning, scott.
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
hi hassan.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
scott, wanted to touch on some of these natural gas price escalations that we've seen, not just in the us but globally as well. so on the us side to say if you could sort of talk through how you guys have dealt and what was a pretty tricky quarter and continues to be a tricky 4q in terms of the hikes we've seen in natural gas prices, and if you could also talk about what you guys are seeing in terms of the cost curve impact with natural gas price escalation in europe and the power curtailments we are seeing in china as well?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yeah, i mean. sure. for us, we have a couple strategies to manage the local issue, i mean, one is we have a pretty strong hedging program, where we have some amount of it hedged out into the future, which helps protect us. the rest of it is absolutely 100% covered in product pricing and every day we get more ability to recover that on an instantaneous basis as we get out of some of these contracts that keep us in handcuffs. i think the more important one is maybe your second one, i mean rising global energy cost is actually a plus for olin. and that's because trade flows get more expensive and trade movements get more volatile and that's just fits right into our model of lifting the value of these olin scarce resources.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
very helpful. and as a follow-up, scott, obviously, now you're guiding to net debt to ebitda being around one time by the end of the year and it's very helpful, we're talking about $10-plus in eps. and you touched on sort of share buybacks and m&a and the like as being meaningful contributors. as we look at 2022 with the balance sheet now as clean as it is, how should we be thinking about capital allocation, particularly if you could dig a bit deeper into the thought process with regards to sort of meaningful share buybacks as well as m&a?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yeah, i mean, sure. look, i'll cover one element and then todd will cover most of it but a good bit of that is going to go toward our grow brands and i suspect maybe there'll be some other questions through the call and we're happy to talk about how we go out and grow the company. so that's certainly a part of it. todd, do you want to cover those?
todd a. slater -- president and chief financial officer
yes, you're right, the side as we delever the balance sheet, that does provide a lot of financial flexibility to accomplish the structuring and parlaying that we've been talking about, scott just referenced. going forward, we would expect to target in that 40% range of our levered free cash flow as shareholder rewards. that includes the dividends and opportunistic share buyback as we go forward.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
very helpful. thank you so much, guys.
operator
the next question comes from mike sison with wells fargo. please go ahead.
mike sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
hey, good morning guys, nice another great quarter. scott, i mean, i'm just curious, it sort of feels like given how well your results have come in in this year, you're sort of in the ninth inning of your transformation and -- but you sort of talked about a lot of things that can continue to improve. so just curious where you think you are, you have only been here a year, it's been a good year. just what else do you think could be done to continue to improve the company?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yeah. hi, mike, and thanks. yeah, i mean, i would say the team here at olin has a long runway in front of it. i mean, all we've done so far is put a bit of a disruptive model in place which is highly complementary to the fact that for the foreseeable future that demand growth actually grows faster than supply growth. there is a lot more to come beyond that. i would say, if you think about business by business a little bit, here, we are in winchester about to embark on a shoot united program to go out and grow the number of people doing sports shooting immensely and brad will get an opportunity to talk about that hopefully later in the call. in epoxy, some of the systems and some of the high-growth areas like mobility that we provide are starting to take off. maybe more importantly, we've set ourselves to the point where we are a buyer of ecus out there and there is global product and asset liquidity available and we're just getting started on that program of accessing that to go out and grow our business, and then of course, we'll complement that with inorganic acquisitions. so that's sort of how the runway shapes out.
mike sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
got it. and then as a follow-up, the first half year, a little bit above $500 million in ebitda, second half year in the $700 million range. when you think about the volatility or maybe just the kind of the delta between the quarters, is that $500 million to $700 million sort of the -- a range that you can keep your ebitda within, and is that sort of the potential for next year as we think about doing better?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
well, i think the reason, mike, that you made, you see those differences is because we're just getting good at practicing our model and every day we continue to get more knobs that are under our control, reference some of the remarks we made about getting some of our materials more open and freely negotiated as opposed to being tied to trade indices. so the reason that that early volatility has been there and it's kind of been a one-way up volatility there is just because we're getting better and expanding our model. i think when you look out in the future, of course, we're saying, the 2022 will be better than 2021 and there may be some time periods where we have to shift which side of the ecu sets our market participation because today the weak side is still caustic.
mike sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
the next question comes from alex yefremov with keybanc. please go ahead.
alex yefremov -- keybanc -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everyone. scott, you mentioned at the renegotiations in the slides, can you provide any details what percent of your merchant business is up for renegotiation, could also maybe size up the merchant epi business as a percent of revenue or percent of your capacity?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yeah. so i think i heard your question, i mean, at least on the chlorine side, we continue to make progress, getting that opened up and we expect at least by 2023 that that's essentially opened up. but we'll have to see how discussions go over the next quarter four's. we haven't really shared just how big our epi business is in relation to the rest of it, because it's not that important, the size of the epi business. what is important is that it is the linchpin that is such value across our whole epoxy chain and olin is focused every day on lifting the value of that scarce resource. pat, would you have anything else to add about epichlorohydrin?
pat d. dawson -- executive vice president and president of epoxy & international
yeah, i think the other thing to keep in mind about epi is we have a lot of flexibility between the merchant market and our captive production we have -- we have multiple knobs on that, that we can activate to bring more value to that whole epoxy value chain.
alex yefremov -- keybanc -- analyst
okay, understood. thank you for that. could you discuss parlaying activity for edc as well. what is involved here, and how would you describe this opportunity?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yeah, i mean, damian will make some comments on parlaying of edc. just on the broader topic, i would just say, we're continuing to be successful developing that program. and if you think about many of our products, chlorine, caustic, bleach, edc, epoxy and epichlorohydrin, in the third quarter, we had success at parlaying activities around all those. damian, do you want to talk about edc?
damian gumpel -- vice president of olin and president of chlor alkali products & vinyls
sure. thanks, scott. from an edc standpoint, at olin, we have a large presence in merchant edc, of course, we can touch -- reach customers all over the world with our physicians in the us gulf and we have expanded our parlaying network there as well because we have customer demand now in europe, africa, obviously, india, southeast asia, northeast asia, latin america, and our ability to complement our own supply with supply then happens to be available at certain opportunistic times in the world, so it's allowed us to get to bring that product closer to the customer and realize some some value there from the ability to help them turn that material into their pvc end-use product that's serving the other growing markets. so our ability to get closer to customers with our parlaying network of that is -- that translates into into value for olin that we realize going forward.
alex yefremov -- keybanc -- analyst
thanks a lot.
operator
the next question comes from kevin mccarthy with vertical research partners. please go ahead.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
good morning. scott, you've talked about in epoxy segment margin goal of 30% in the past and this morning i think you threw out $1 billion as an ebitda goal for the segment. what do you need to do in that business to get there from here? what are the two or three sources of incremental improvement, recognizing that the business has already come a long way? what additional runway do you see in '22 and beyond for upside in epoxy?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yeah, i mean we just need to keep the activities going that we've already started, but pat can expand on those a little bit.
pat d. dawson -- executive vice president and president of epoxy & international
yeah. kevin, epoxy, i would say is really -- it's epoxies at the right time, at the right place, and what i mean by that is if you look at the mega trends and you look at the demand for epoxy in these different segments, right place, right time, right. so you look at composites and lightweighting, epoxy enables that. you look at wind -- wind systems, decarbonization, right place, right time. electrical laminates, e-mobility, adhesives that are used in e batteries, epoxy, right place, right time. so i think what you're seeing is, we've got the infrastructure in place, we've got the commercial organization in place and really we can go across the whole globe around these applications extracting value, where we see value can best be extracted. but kevin, i think we're in a great position to be able to complement what we have already been doing and to keep building value around a lot of these mega trends at play right in the wheelhouse of how epoxy brings value to the market.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
okay. so it sounds like less strategic and more just riding the sources of demand improvement that you outlined pat.
pat d. dawson -- executive vice president and president of epoxy & international
well, i'd say strategically make no mistake that epichlorohydrin and the scarcity of epichlorohydrin in the multiple knobs we have there is much more strategic going forward than it has been in the past and i would say that we even have opportunities in aromatics of what we do in phenol, acetone and cumene to bring this contrarian model into place, so that could be very strategic to our future as well.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
understood. and then secondly, if i may. scott, i just wanted to ask about slide 8. this is something you've talked about in the past, breaking the cycle pattern. just was wondering if you could put a finer point on it. i appreciate the analogy used, the waves on lagoon, ripples on an ocean and so forth, but even specialty chemical company sometimes suffer a down year, if you were to look out over the medium term, three years to five years, what would it take to cause a down year in your mind for olin, is it shift from weaker side to stronger side of the ecu or an economic recession or something else that would precipitate a cyclical change for the company?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yeah, i mean even just going back to your first question where you had kind of said, are you just riding the wave? i mean, i would make no mistake about it. i mean, we're heavily focused on value over volume and if there is any way if it's a wave that olin is creating. so you're exactly right on number on slide number 8 there. we're trying to represent that this is no longer a cyclic business. there was a cyclic business because olin made it a cyclic business and we completely changed how we are doing business now. this is structural work that is going on and not only that, there are structural dynamics that have changed in the marketplace. we have a reasonable view out five years, right. and every single place we look, demand growth exceeds supply growth.
so could there be down quarters? that is not impossible. but i do want to reiterate that you know if we have to ship which side of the ecu is setting our market participation, that's a relatively short term, i doubt that you may or may not see, that is not a year-long type of shift. we've taken the business from being a little bit slower to being very nimble to go out and make sure that we do what we need to do to make sure that we get significant value from olin's scarce resources.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
thanks so much. that's helpful.
operator
the next question comes from frank mitsch with fermium research. please go ahead.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
thank you and congratulations on another solid quarter. you made an announcement yesterday about shoveling some capacity in alabama. could you talk about the decisions behind that where you think this leaves the chlor alkali market in a supply and demand balance?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yeah. thank you, frank. and we won't comment on the market. the decision was strictly driven by the fact that we're still undervalued there and we're just not going to sell into low value markets. i mean, i can tell you where it leaves olin's supply demand balance and that is in a place where we're positioned to go out and why you see use at the right time to support growth in our downstream derivatives and will likely be a smaller participant in the merchant market going forward particularly in those places where we're going to be compelled to continue to supply through next year on trade indices that actually don't reflect the market value of the products.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
okay, got you, got you. and as i look at slide 12, the ecu profitability in contribution index, that is an investment banker's dream. i mean, it's just an absolute hockeystick. where do you see that going into 4q and in 2022?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
well, every day, we're focused on lifting value and that is one measurement that has everybody in the company together. so we're focused on continuing to move it up. again. i want to reiterate that there maybe a quarter or two where we have to draw flat spot in it to make sure we're positioned right to continue to lift olin's value. but yeah, we'll continue to move it up, i mean, damian, in your businesses, what do you think about fourth quarter here?
damian gumpel -- vice president of olin and president of chlor alkali products & vinyls
yeah sure, i mean, we certainly can see a continuation of the trend where the chlorine side remains relatively stronger and a portion that scott mentioned as contracts that's gone away, we highlighted on our first slide that we shifted more contracts away from index to really negotiate it. there is a step-up in value there that we're achieving as well. so we continue to see that momentum play through as chlorine remains strong. the rest of the chlorine portfolio in my division is a complement past point on the epoxy side, continues to -- we continue to achieve value, and of course, yet, the positive side has had a group, there are certainly some increasing areas of high [indecipherable] and we spoke about the energy issues that are disrupting those trade flows and so we're seeing positive growth as well. but net-net, the ecu continues to move up, is reflected in the pci. we expect that to continue, but chlorine certainly continues to drive those -- a stronger side of the model.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
terrific. perfect. thank you so much.
operator
the next question comes from jeff zekauskas with jpmorgan. please go ahead.
jeff zekauskas -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thanks very much. i was looking at your cost of goods sold which i think was $1.68 billion and in the second quarter, it was $1.71 billion. why did cost of goods sold go down sequentially? i would have thought your raw materials would have been higher. did you simply ship lower volume, is that the effect, or can you explain that?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yeah. hey, jeff. yeah, sure. i mean, look, it's at least in one of our businesses. we had some amount of lower volumes, if you remember, and at the end of the third quarter, hurricanes, other logistics issues and so forth slowed down volumes a bit there, so that's probably the main driver. todd, can you talk about that?
todd a. slater -- president and chief financial officer
yeah, no, i think that's absolutely the case. i mean, we commented in the deck, you can see chlor alkali products and vinyls line was down sequentially. really that was a result of hurricanes. so that's why you saw lower cost of goods sold.
jeff zekauskas -- jpmorgan -- analyst
great. and then in your -- just in your third slide, he said he shifted another 10% of merchant chlorine to freely negotiated and now less than one-third of volume remains under index. so if all of that -- the remaining volume that was under index is now you know at some market contract, what's the annual economic effect of that?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
jeff, i would just say without trying to itemize product-by-product that the impact of getting more of our merchant chlorine out from index is important, the more important part is that it leaves our whole portfolio of chlorine derivatives. now if we were to get the remaining third out from under index, it would have a fair economic impact to olin. but i'll just say we don't expect to hold on to that complete one third of volume that remains under index because some of those customer segments aren't going to be receiving chlorine from olin because we're stuck with having to supply for one more year at some value, that isn't representative of the market. so we will lose some of that volume.
jeff zekauskas -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay, thank you very much.
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
sure.
operator
the next question comes from josh silverstein with wolfe research. please go ahead.
josh silverstein -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks, good morning guys. just wanted to go back for the capital allocation discussion from before. obviously, this year was a big year for debt reduction. can you just talk about maybe the capacity for buybacks next year, what you're thinking about for a minimum amount of cash on hand versus debt reduction. and then what would be left over for potential m&a versus buybacks?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yeah. i mean, todd will expand on this a little bit. i mean, what i would say to set the stage for his explanation is that right now buying back stock represents an immediate return of about 20%, so you can expect this to be a significant part of our forward program. todd, that's for you.
todd a. slater -- president and chief financial officer
that's right, really if you think about 2021, our first priority has really been to pay down debt and we're targeting $1.1 billion of debt reduction this year, so far, about $850 million through the first three quarters, we've taken a lot of high cost debt out of our system now and we will plan to reduce debt further here in the fourth quarter. so that would get us down to about one times range. ultimately, we're probably targeting gross debt in the $2.5 billion range. to answer part of your question, josh, where we're really targeting gross debt is in that 2.5 range. and as we said earlier, we're going to focus on our financial flexibility to enable us to do restructuring activities, which would include m&a as well as parlaying and we are targeting 40% -- right in that 40% range of our levered free cash flow toward shareholder rewards including the dividend and buybacks.
josh silverstein -- wolfe research -- analyst
that's helpful and then just on the $2.5 billion ebitda level, i mean this was previously suggested it can be done in a few years from now, is that the new forward to think of. and where do you think, given the portfolio and an asset base right now, what could that new number be to be upside?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
well, i mean, we will keep working to move ebitda. i mean, this year, we will get pretty close to that, pretty obvious, i think next year, we've absolutely said that we will lift ebidta over this year. we are evolving to also setting targets based around eps and so we have a fairly short-term goal of $10 a share and we'll look at where we go from there.
josh silverstein -- wolfe research -- analyst
all right. thanks guys.
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
thanks.

the next question comes from john roberts with ubs. please go ahead.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
thank you. it seems like the dow contract is still one of the largest opportunities going forward. does that contract all open up at once or does it open up in phases over time, and if it's the latter, could you talk about how far out the longest part of that contract goes?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
i won't give too many specifics on range mix with a particular supplier customer, but what i will say because it's in the public domain already and it is a material item is that our major ecu supply that we're doing at cost ends in 2025, and so there'll be options and each and every option will be cash accretive to olin.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
okay and then hassan earlier [technical issue] specifically at the production and to get a lot of the chinese caustic [technical issue] making of any export [technical issue].
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
i'm sorry, i missed the question, it just went quiet. i don't know it's on your end or our end. anybody, still there? hey tom, can you hear us?
operator
yes, i can hear you. would you like to go to the next question?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yeah, for some reason, we just lost it.
operator
yeah, it sounds like his phone's line disconnected. all right. the next question comes from arun viswanathan with rbc. please go ahead.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. congrats on the continued strong results here. so just wanted to ask on your comments that '22 will be better than '21. your slide 13 has positive price momentum in across all of your businesses pretty much, so assuming that continues, just given your comments that you continue to focus on value, do you expect each of the segments to show higher ebitda or how should we think about that comment in the context of the segments? thanks.
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yeah, no, i think that's fair. each and every segment should show better results in 2022 relative to 2021.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great, thanks. and then, just another question on the cost curve, you obviously moved up the values here on the ecu, how much of your capacity would you say it's still kind of not up to your standards on value. and is there anything that you could do to change that, i mean, is there any debottlenecking. i know you have the $100 million in productivity, but anything that you would focus on to think about changing that situation? and again, how much of your capacity would you say is still maybe could be ready for shutdown? thanks.
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yeah, i mean, when you think about -- you think about it from a capacity standpoint, i would just start out in 2025 clearly 30% of our capacity gets the zero return today. so that's certainly a big chunk. if you take that out, we still have some work to do, it's not necessarily a cost issue though. i mean i think our manufacturing and supply chains have done just a great job driving productivity and flexibility in our assets. it's more still a market value issue and while a lot of our derivatives are starting to get to the point of reinvestment economics, if you look at what we sell into the merchant market, so take the ecu elemental chlorine and caustic, they go into the merchant market, there is still some work to do there to lift those up to a point that we did somewhere close to reinvestment economics.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks.
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
sure.
operator
the next question comes from eric petrie with citi. please go ahead.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
thank you and good morning scott.
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
hi eric.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
you disclosed roughly 850,000 tons of ecu capacity as a share. just a question on strategy, do you expect to parlay and close one amount or how do you see that going forward?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yeah, i think i'll let maybe damian answer this question.
damian gumpel -- vice president of olin and president of chlor alkali products & vinyls
sure, i mean, [indecipherable] we still see that it's about following that volume that's out there and the liquidity that's out in the market, we believe there is still pools of that available globally that we can -- that we can leverage of course that these tradables do become disrupted. you know, it has cost impact to other areas, we're going to capitalize on that with our cost position. but we also see -- as we look at these mega trends and the demand that is clearly growing across that fully use our ecus and derivatives, partly ecus are going to play a bigger and bigger role in our ability to break those ecus into our system, allow us to be more flexible with how we derivatize our chlorine across areas like epoxy, across [indecipherable] space, across our intermediate organic -- even back to the elemental chlorine. so we have opportunities here to flex our own merchant chlorine and derivatize that and pull other ecus into the system as well, all for the purpose of lifting and enhancing the value of ecus into the customers that we serve.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
helpful. and then, on the one-third of volume in chlorine that remains under index, how much of that is related to tio2 in the market and how does that step change that during the next year?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
well, i mean, i would just say, part of it is, goes into tio2 and that's some part of the market. we're not going to be serving out in 2023. and so part of the volumes that no doubt are related to this shutdown that we just announced in mcintosh alabama.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
thank you.
operator
the next question comes from steve byrne with bank of america merrill lynch. please go ahead.
steve byrne -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes, thank you. you have the slide that illustrates the relative value between chlorine and caustic and i appreciate the concept, but your business is so complex. it's clear that that chlorine value is not a data point on here. but likely a very wide range. epi, for example, perhaps a year ago, might have been at the bottom end of that range in value to you of chlorine. is it fair to say that it is now among the highest value end markets for chlorine for you. the reason i ask is, is it getting to the point where you think there is risk of capacity expansions of epi in the market either competitors or customers back integrated?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yeah. thanks. i mean, look, yeah, a lot of chlorine and chlorine derivatives have moved up. i would say we have a long way to move epi because it's certainly not at the high end of that range today. could it move up to a point where it supports reinvestment economics? it's certainly not impossible. do we expect to see expansions out in the future, whether it's at epi or even on the ecu side of the business? yes, we expect to see some things get announced because otherwise the world's not going to have enough of those scarce products. once those expansions are announced, i keep in mind that there is still likely a four-year gap where demand continues to grow faster than the supply. so the only way that changes, if there is -- if there are just multiple announcements of multiple expansions that continue over the next 10 years.
steve byrne -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
and then when we look at pricing on some of these chlorine derivatives like pvc versus edc, both of them have ripped but you've got about maybe at $0.60 a pound difference between them. is that fair to you that downstream pvc garnered not much of a margin versus edc or is that compelling to you to want to move in that direction?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
well, i mean we are, of course, the largest part supplier of edc and so that's a material that we've moved up in value, i think sort of the recent movements of pvc, it's not going back maybe across six-month to nine-month window. if we're not looked like there were some risk of it coming down, where by the way, we had a number of activations around edc to make sure that at least olin's portfolio do not go down. then you saw pvc move back up. i would just say that i think we have some room there. clearly, the fundamentals for pvc look good longer term and there is a margin lift that pvc gets over the edc and i think we're positioned to take advantage of that.
steve byrne -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you.
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
sure.
operator
the next question comes from matthew blair with tudor pickering holt. please go ahead.
matthew blair -- tudor pickering holt -- analyst
hey, good morning. congrats on the great results, i wanted to circle back to the capital allocation. so based on your 2022 ebitda guidance, it seems like you should be able to generate at least $1.6 billion of free cash flow next year and you mentioned 40% to shareholders. that will be about $600 million. that remaining $1 billion, so we think of that as dry powder for m&a either like transformational m&a or bolt-on m&a because it seems like a pretty significant amount?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yeah, i mean, you looked -- the numbers certainly are that far off. so, i mean you're exactly right, i mean we'll have options for that, part of it is in acquisitions. part of it is also to support our parlaying activities where we go out and use global product and asset liquidity because we will have some needs for various logistics capabilities as we do that. that's really low capital, it's very light touch in terms of capital, but i just wanted to complete the picture.
matthew blair -- tudor pickering holt -- analyst
sounds good. and then previously, i think it's hard to either sell or spin winchester just due to either like valuation or taxes or maybe a mix of both, in today's environment, it seems like esg is just a bigger part of the picture. so, has anything changed and i guess could you just provide an update of how you see winchester fit in the portfolio over the long term?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yeah, well, i mean this is a great business for us, it still has a lot of legs, and i'm going to ask brett to speak here in just a moment about our shoot united movement, but if you were to bright the business now just a little bit and you've got 55 million to 60 million people do export trading now and it is the fastest growing new sport really in the country now, so, and now we've got this program that we're about to roll out to go out and increase the pie, brett, do you want to talk about shoot united?
brett a. flaugher -- vice president and president of winchester
yeah, just to add a little bit to what scott said, the 60 million people that participate now really participate for the main reason to stay with family [indecipherable]. you know the addressable market is over 200 million people of all demographics and ages. what shoot united is sophisticated communication strategy to introduce all those fun facts and great things about the recreational shooting sports to those 200 plus million people.
matthew blair -- tudor pickering holt -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
your next question comes from roger spitz with bank of america. please go ahead.
roger spitz -- bank of america -- analyst
thanks very much. following yesterday's announcement, how much diaphragm capacity do you have left in short chain ecus?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yeah, yeah, i mean, we probably won't quote an exact number, but what i will say is almost half of our capacity used to be diaphragm-based. and with that announcement, we have totally tightened out about 885,000 something like that ecu times. so we took out a good chunk of it, but we still have a lot.
roger spitz -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and can you comment on chlorine value and volumes into bleach, is it starting to fall versus other derivatives as we move out of the pandemic or is people still reaching all services they can touch?
damian gumpel -- vice president of olin and president of chlor alkali products & vinyls
this is damian. let me take that question and thanks for it. clearly, we have seen bleach values go up and in concert with the smart moving across the ecu. bleach is also a scarce product, the largest merchant bleach producer we clearly have seen the dynamics play out, chlorine and ecu values have moved up in bleach, but clearly much more room. as you know bleach is used into disinfectant and wastewater treatment areas, you know, continues to grow and be more value to need it, and so we're still poised with a long runway in front of us to capture value for this specialty product design properties into great markets.
roger spitz -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
[operator instructions] the next question comes from mike leithead with barclays. please go ahead.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks, good morning guys. i guess just first on the -- you touched on inorganic or acquisition opportunities. can you maybe just flesh out what you're looking for there. just help us with either in terms of size. are you looking for geographic or new product expansion, just give us a sense of kind of what you're going after there?
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yeah, sure. i mean if i had to sum it up, i would say we're looking for assets that really complement our model. so i mean, that opens up a lot of possibilities. you could imagine that we're able to acquire ecu capability, although that may not be necessarily north american focus, there is a lot of opportunity for us to expand into other geographies. another complement to our model would be derivatives, just like we have a coordinated derivative chain and we have an epoxy chain and we go part of the way down vinyls, there is other chains that certainly feed off [indecipherable] metal, chlorine and those would be great complements to our model, whereby we get a lot more knobs to turn across our matrix and get value back to ton one that we have today. the other thing i would say it's also not impossible that we discover that some of those things that have a direct complement to our model that actually our commercial attitude might apply to other businesses as well that we might acquire. so we're thinking about all of those possibilities.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
that's great and then maybe just for a follow-on digging into the epoxy strategy a bit, if i look at slide 7, there's a lot of talk or discussion around engineered solutions. is it fair to say that you're trying to kind of ultimately sell less of the [indecipherable] commodity, liquid epoxy and try to push it more downstream, it's kind of [indecipherable] epoxy dispersions things like that, if you could just flesh out kind of where the strategy for epoxy, that'd be great.
pat d. dawson -- executive vice president and president of epoxy & international
yeah, mike, this is pat. and when you look at the epoxy value chain, we make money across that whole chain very interlinked as to how we make our money there. so with our epichlorohydrin like i say, we have multiple knobs on how we monetize that epi. whether it's selling into the merchant market. if we get value there or we back out of the merchant market and we take that epi and convert it more to liquid epoxy resin to monetize it or we can take that liquid epoxy resin and further convert it to a solid epoxy resin or other converted resins or we can take that liquid epoxy resin and systematize it into things like wind systems or formulated products or blend. so, mike, we need that strategically, we need that whole chain to be able to have the maximum value over volume choices. that's really what we've been doing and we will continue to do in future.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
great, thanks.

good morning and welcome to olin corporation's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [operator instructions]. following today's brief opening comments, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [operator instructions]. please note, this event is being recorded.
i would now like to turn the conference over to steve keenan, olin's director of investor relations. please go ahead, steve.
steve keenan -- director of investor relations
thank you, tom. good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. before we begin, let me remind you that this discussion along with the associated slides and the question-and-answer session that follows will include statements regarding estimates or expectations of future performance. please note that these are forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected. some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from our projections are described without limitations in the risk factors section of our most recent form 10-k and in the third quarter earnings press release.
a copy of today's transcript and slides will be available on our website in the investors section under past events. our earnings press release and other financial data and information are available under press releases.
with me this morning are scott sutton, olin's ceo; pat dawson, president, epoxy; damian gumpel, president, chlor alkali products and vinyls; brett flaugher, president, winchester; jim varilek, olin's coo; and todd slater, olin's cfo.
scott will begin with some brief remarks, after which we will be happy to take your questions.
i'll now turn the call over to scott sutton.
scott m. sutton -- president, chief executive officer and chairman
yeah. thanks, steve, and hello to everybody. i'm pleased to report the olin team has once again proved to be the most unique and agile in the industry in meeting the clear expectation of our shareholders. again, i just have to say that the solid performance by the complete team sets me up to be able to focus on the items that drive our future which are enhancing our contrarian value model, turning our ratchet on undervalued products, call in to grow accretive capital allocation, building out our interlinked matrix of activation knobs, growing shooting sports participation and lifting all olin people.
this is a company that is focused on continuing to grow adjusted ebitda and coupling that with balanced capital management to deliver more than $10 of earnings per share in the near future. so i'll make some brief commentary on a few slides and get to the q&a quickly. 2021 is expected to be a solid result for olin for the reasons shown on slide number 3. while the longer term fundamental of demand that grows faster than supply is starting to be exposed here in 2021, our leading actions to get a higher value for our scarce resources is proving to be successful.
current highlights of that success are that we continue to exit business that was based on non-negotiated pricing allowing our product chain mix with the intended impact from purposeful settings of our interlinked matrix of activation nodes start accelerating the value capture of epichlorohydrin and drive expansion in shooting sports participation with our shoot united movement. while there maybe some end-of-year holiday slowdowns, which are really supply driven, not demand driven, and some seasonality that result in a sequentially flattish fourth quarter results, we still expect 2022 to exceed 2021. the reason thematic for better results in 2022 is shown on slide number 4. the minor reason in our thematic is that the previously mentioned demand growth versus supply growth dynamic just gets better and better across all our businesses. more people are enjoying shooting sports, demanding clean wind energy and expanding their homes to have us.
the major reason in our thematic is that all of olin's activities are designed around a foundational cultural principal of only selling into value. we know who we are. in october, we took the decision to close some more undervalued assets and simultaneously used other existing global asset and product liquidity to grow olin's value. as our own ecu assets are getting rightsized, we are a global buyer of ecus to satisfy our higher value products demand. even though we have grown our earnings for five consecutive quarters and delivered a levered free cash flow that is approaching 20%, we still must show that our performance will continue to improve, but maybe more importantly, we must demonstrate our ability to manage uncertainty and volatility.
slide number 5 has an illustration. olin has three substantial businesses, each with a meaningful contribution to segment earnings. for reasons that we previously discussed, the winchester, which is shown in red on the slide, consumer and defense business offer solid and sustainable growth. for reasons we will discuss in just a moment, the epoxy, which is shown in green on the slide, engineered materials, offer differentiated growth as we expand margins in that business. the chlor alkali products and vinyls industrial essentials are largest organic and inorganic growth opportunity.
we expect the chlor alkali segment results to be slightly volatile across a brief transitional window when we have a model profile shift between the relative strengths on the two sides of the ecu. we think of the net company volatility as ripples on a deep ocean, not waves on a shallow lagoon. we should control our destiny here.
continuing with the theme of good fundamentals on slide number 6, our perceived old world chemistry has new world application and value. i won't read all of these mega trend multipliers, as i'm sure they're familiar to you, but instead jump to slide number 7 and hit on the differentiated growth profile of epoxy. epoxy sets itself apart from other engineered materials by offering nearly non substitutable performance. almost every end use category is growing faster than global gdp. consider the outlook for more and larger wind turbines for clean energy, consider the outlook for electrical laminates for the new mobility trends and broad electrification trends, consider the outlook for infrastructure expansion and replacement and so on.
even though we recognize the value of this business in epoxy resin sales and in epoxy systems sales, the value driver is really epichlorohydrin and we will be expounding on our globally leading epichlorohydrin position in future earnings calls. we expect it won't be long before our epoxy business delivers greater than $1 billion of ebitda and carries the same enterprise value that all of olin carries today, more representative of a highly engineered materials company.
finally, i will close on slide number 8. we are going to start talking more about eps in conjunction with ebitda and segment earnings. we are advancing in our evolution and expect our activities in debt reduction, refinancing, share repurchases and m&a to be big contributors of forward value and that value shows in eps. no doubt that a majority of our forward discussion will center on leadership, our linchpin products, great supply demand fundamentals, parlaying and lifting olin people, however, new ways to create shareholder returns are evolving for olin and help us earn above $10 of earnings per share.
so that concludes my opening comments and tom, we're now ready to take questions.

[operator instructions] today's first question comes from hassan ahmed with alembic global. please go ahead.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
good morning, scott. 
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, hassan.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
a question on 2022 ebitda guidance, the $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion that you guys have guided to. look, as i took a look at slide 16 i mean where you listed all the different products that you guys have. i mean apart from aromatics, it pretty much seems that you guys have price hikes on the table for q4 and q1 across the board ex aromatics, of course. so i'm sitting there thinking that with you guys logging $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, slightly north of $2.5 billion in ebitda in 2021 and that $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion seems pretty conservative if most of those price hikes take effect.
so i mean, am i thinking about these things the right way?
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
well, hassan, if you look at exactly where we are today, right? we're being successful at lifting price and lifting product value, but there's been some caution around market quality, so we're not participating as much. so in addition to not participating as much in a little weaker market, we're also not operating our facilities as much as we might as well. so we're additionally buying material or product liquidity out of the marketplace to satisfy our needs. so those are some current offsets to what's going on with pricing.
but to your point i mean the only way that we end up at a $2.5 billion mark is for these gully conditions that we're in right now to continue. the outlook looks better than that.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
yup. makes complete sense. and i also appreciated the sort of five-year levered free cash flow guidance of $8 billion that you guys gave in talking about being able to buy the company within five years at those rates. so my question is, when i parlay that with the supply demand outlook that you guys gave, obviously, demand, majorly outstripping supply growth, right, which to me means obviously, there'll be a resilient sort of earnings trajectory on a go-forward basis.
you won't really see much volatility, which obviously means that, that should have a positive impact on your valuation multiple, right? so my question really is, with the outlook the way it is for supply demand, do you feel that quarter after quarter, as you guys keep sort of showing resilient sort of earnings, you will get a sort of bump up in your multiple? or at some stage, do you just sit there and get frustrated and say, i'm just going to move away from the public domain.
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
well, yeah, i think you saw that in fourth quarter of course we bought back a number of shares. we're leaning into that even harder. the scenario is set up where 2022 is likely better performance than 2021 and 2023 is likely better performance than 2022. so even in 2022, we're looking at levered free cash flow liberation of about $1.6 billion.
so just call that $10 a share. so it's greater than a 20% yield. i mean, i think the dilemma we have is that the forward valuation set up is for an imaginary cliff. that cliff just doesn't exist.
so yeah, i think we have a great opportunity. it's the best investment we have is to buy ourselves.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
i like that imaginary cliff analogy. thanks so much, scott.
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
our next question today comes from mike sison with wells fargo. please go ahead.
mike sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. i guess my question is can you maybe help us better understand when it makes sense for olin to produce caustic or edc versus sort of trading it, procuring it? i know -- and maybe how much volume sort of goes into that calc. i mean, obviously, you're going to still produce a lot.
but is there sort of a swing volume that you will sort of move around to make that trade? and then, what do you think the benefit was in the fourth quarter in terms of either margin or ebitda?
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. sure. hi, mike. i mean, look, sometimes it's just more effective to buy.
i mean, i get your question on how do you know how much, right? and a lot of things go into that analysis for us. but any time we see signs of a poor quality market developing we're likely to pull back a bit. and you may have noticed that we do have a slide in the deck now where we're trying to give some quantification around that. so in the fourth quarter, it was roughly about 12% of our sales volume and that is sales volume for any products that are ecu-oriented or ecu-based derivatives, which is most of our volume.
i think that number got up to about 12%. so in the fourth quarter, mike, the direct benefit of that is a benefit, right? i mean that cost us a lot to do that. but what it is, is a benefit for the future. it's a benefit for 2022 because we're just not going to sell it to a poor quality market and we're going to continue to improve the value of the ecu and ecu derivatives and that's not a one quarter play.
we could have not made those moves in the fourth quarter and produced a bigger result, but that could have led to a lower outcome in 2022 and 2023. so there's a lot that goes into that.
mike sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
got it. ok. and then just as a follow-up on your ecu calculates, more than doubled since you've been presenting it. you continue to say it's undervalued.
at what level will you say it's fairly valued or above? and then when we get to that level where you think it's, where you're getting the right value for your volume. is that sort of the number where you consider maybe adding some capacity given that demand is going to be a lot stronger over the next couple of years?
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
well, yeah. i mean the value has become better. i would say it gets even more fairly valued when there's recognition that, again, there's no imaginary cliff there that we've set it at a value that doesn't cycle up and down, then we'll feel a bit better about it. as far as adding capacity, right? we don't have plans to be adding capacity through an organic means.
in fact, we're practicing a bit at our parlaying activities because when we do grow and we have a number of growth vectors in place, we'll rely on that skill that we're developing today to go out and access liquidity in the world that is actually produced on others assets to support our growth.
mike sison -- wells fargo -- analyst
got it. thank you.
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
and our next question today comes from jeff zekauskas with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
jeff zekauskas -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks very much. is edc a more challenging opportunity in 2022 because of the deterioration in asian pvc prices?
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
hey, jeff. that's a good, good question. and so we've seen this movie before. in fact, in the middle of 2021, there was a point where you saw some deterioration in pvc pricing, which tended to drag some deterioration in edc.
but again, when we see a core quality market developing, we just don't sell into it. and maybe we go out and buy some material to satisfy needs or we redirect those molecules to other places in our ecu chain, which is exactly what we did in the middle of the year. so here, you sort of see the same scenario happening where pvc in asia is coming off some. and so we have to adjust our model in real time, which we've done.
you don't see the same phenomena affecting pvc in north america and europe, though.
jeff zekauskas -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
if pvc prices in north america and europe came in, wouldn't that represent additional challenges? and when you redirect your molecules away from edc, where do you direct them to?
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean you're right, jeff. i mean that could present some other opportunities, right? so there we have to shift our model dynamically and we would reallocate to potentially other areas. and there's lots of other areas to reallocate to.
but it's very possible that we slowed down a bit on one side of the ecu. and even though we're not redirecting more molecules into the marketplace, we are getting a lot more value from the other side of the ecu. in fact, caustic could turn out to be really good in that scenario.
jeff zekauskas -- j.p. morgan -- analyst

our next question today comes from kevin mccarthy of vertical research partners. please go ahead.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
good morning. scott, i was wondering if you could elaborate on your outlook for winchester along three lines volume outlook, pricing and costs for 2022 versus '21?
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure. i mean of course volume is solid in the winchester business and we have certainly a heavy commercial backlog already. but on top of that, right, we have an initiative called shoot united where we're going out and trying to grow the total number of participants in this wholesome sporting activity. if you just look at what happened in 2020, there are effectively 8 million new shooters added to the roles.
and if you look at what happened in 2021, there was nearly 6 million additional new shooters added to the role. so now we're up around 60 million people in this country enjoying the sport. in fact, it's one of the fastest-growing high school sports in the country. so what we're going to do is go out and grow participation.
so we expect volume to stay strong, right? i won't say that we'll have large multiples of volume expansion because we're running pretty hard in that business already. as far as pricing goes, we have another price increase on the table here in the first quarter. a lot of that will go to offsetting some cost increases that we do have, especially across our metal's portfolio.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
ok. and then tempted to ask you about the sequential trends in epoxy. prices have hung in quite well, i think, as the fourth quarter progressed. how are you thinking about sequential earnings taking the cost side into account?
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think we've called out that we expect net-net, our total chemicals earnings to be close to flat going into one quarter versus fourth quarter. in epoxy, we are facing some cost pressures, just like we are in some of our other businesses. but that's the business where we're pressing our model harder than any other place, right? there were some signs of poor quality conditions temporarily developing, especially in the northern hemisphere in the winter time when there's not as many coatings needed. so we did slow down our rates and we did execute some parlaying activities.
and what we're really doing there is just trying to bridge through that gully because really, if you think about demand in 2022, it's absolutely robust. and you think about the categories of that, marine coatings look good, composite work and light-weighting and automobiles, wind blade activity for turbines very, very bullish there and infrastructure isn't going to hurt us at all either.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
very helpful. thanks a lot.
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
sure.

and our next question today comes from frank mitsch with fermium research. please go ahead.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
good morning, gentlemen and nice end to the year. i noticed that there was a press release that you guys' shutdown a bleach facility out in the west coast. i was wondering, if you could talk about the factors behind that and what your general outlook is for the bleach market?
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure. we did shutdown or we've announced the closure of capacity in a facility there in northern california. and the reason we did that is just that bleach is undervalued there. we still have a lot of bleach capability left across the country, but it's undervalued and gives us the opportunity to allocate those ecus back into higher-value applications.
so that's the reason for it.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
got you. that make sense. totally in keeping with your philosophy. and given the undervaluation of your shares and clearly, buybacks are going to play a nice role here in 2022.
i was wondering, if you guys consider giving some thoughts on accelerated share repurchase program.
todd slater -- vice president and chief financial officer -- analyst
right, this is todd. i think as scott may have mentioned earlier, as you saw in the fourth quarter, we bought roughly $184 million worth of stock early in 2022. you should expect olin targeting a key use of our free cash flow toward share repurchases and probably leaning in a little heavier than what you saw in the fourth quarter.
frank mitsch -- fermium research -- analyst
ok, got you. understood. thank you.
operator
and our next question today comes from arun viswanathan with rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. yeah, congrats on all the progress. i guess, i'm just curious maybe you could just walk us through some of your statements earlier, you said that there were 17 ecu plants that potentially demand would be necessary over the next several years.
where are we on replacement cost economics right now? does it make sense that some of those plants start to get announced pretty soon? and if not, would you expect maybe some brownfield operations to or expansions to get announced as well? how are we thinking about new capacity year?
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. hey, arun. yeah, i mean if you could build an isolated ecu plant, right? we're starting to get closer to reinvestment economics. but the reality is that doesn't make a lot of sense to do that just because of the challenges around elemental chlorine.
so you really have to attach it to or build a complete integrated complex. and right now, an integrated complex, it's unlikely to match reinvestment economics. but i would just say that that's not even the biggest driver here now. i mean there's so many esg considerations on where the energy being the biggest input for chlor alkali plant comes from.
and so it's challenging to make a decision to increase your carbon footprint. so now you've got the added cost of renewable energy as well that goes into those investment decisions. so i would say it's not improbable, i guess, that there could have been some expansions on the table that might not be on the table anymore just because of the esg trends.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks. and as a follow-up, maybe i can just ask a question on epoxy. there has been a notable improvement in epoxy margins over the last year or two.
i guess, do you see this level as kind of the new structural level of earnings power within that business? should we expect margins to remain north of 20% on an ebitda basis from here on? are you kind of implementing a similar ratchet strategy of preserving value in that business as well?
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. our expectation for margins in epoxy is for them to expand from where we are in the fourth quarter. and there's just -- there's just so many upsides in that business. we haven't fully implemented our model across the upstream part of that business.
but the great fundamentals around some of the demand factors that i talked about before, especially as we bridge this fourth quarter and first quarter gully that we're working ourselves through, i expect midyear that business to be rocking.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok, thanks.
operator
and our next question today comes from steve byrne with bank of america. please go ahead.
steve byrne -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes. scott, these comments you just made about the challenges to building an integrated ecu complex would seem to be even greater for your customers and thus their interest in back integrating into chlorine would be extremely low. and that's what seems to enable you to use your epi business since you should also downstream into epoxy, you leverage that to drive these tolling agreements with these epoxy customers. could you not also do that with edc.
if you got into the pvc business, you could leverage that edc position with a nonintegrated pvc customers or potentially mdi since you're also into aromatics or chlorosilane. or do you see opportunities to do this and leverage that chlorine business you have and your customers' lack of interest in back integrating?
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks a lot for the question, steve. yeah, and look, you're exactly right. i mean, this is an upside for the company.
and you're going to hear us shift more of our discussion with these growth vectors. and one of the growth vectors that we will be talking about is the one i mentioned in some of my opening comments where this is an area, in other words, upstream vinyls being edc and vcm where we have significant extra capability and certainly incremental capability, where we might could match up very well with the right pvc leaders. and that same thing can apply potentially to other chlorine derivatives. and this is a great way to grow the company.
steve byrne -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. and i also wanted to get your update on some of these legacy chlorine contracts that you've talked about not renewing on expiry. did some of those roll off at the end of the calendar year and are there more to go on that?
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yes. some of them did roll off. so we've set those back to freely negotiated. and there's still some more that we have that continue throughout 2022.
but now it's the minority of our business is still attached to sort of the nonfunctioning type of index out there.
steve byrne -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and our next question today comes from john roberts at ubs. please go ahead.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
thanks. on slide 6, the parlay volume tracker, how diversified is that today across the opportunities or is it relatively concentrated? and could you talk a little bit more about what winchester is doing there? is that -- i think it's largely russian imports into the u.s. of ammo? is that what they're doing? is this something else?
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
well, your first question, right, how diversified are we across the chemicals business. we're quite diversified. there may be one or two of our products where we don't necessarily do parlaying activities, but it's actually very broad based there. and we had just put a few examples on the slide.
as far as winchester forgoes, the phenomenon going on with russian imports, right? and russia has been the largest importer of ammunition. of course, their import -- additional import permits are terminated. so there's a phasedown of imports that would be allowed to come in from russia. that's actually not the volume that we purchased for our needs.
we purchased some other imports for our needs. so out in the future, we're likely to be a little bigger player in purchasing imports and there's likely to be total less imports as well because of -- that the country not accepting russian imports out in the future.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
ok. and then what's the strategy for the aromatics assets? i'm guessing they're among the lower return assets in your portfolio.
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. well, i mean aromatics is an important upstream business for us. in fact, we have one of the largest fuming plants in the world, produce phenol and acetone and bpa. and some amount of all of those we sell into the merchant market.
some other amount we use in our downstream businesses and we just haven't talked a lot about it. the production of phenol and acetone is very interesting. it's a lot like the ecu, right? they're co-produced. and we haven't applied our coproduction commercial model yet -- fully yet to phenol and acetone.
of course, we're not near as large a player. we're not the leader in that business, but we do expect to get some upside out of advancing that.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you.
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
sure.

and our next question today comes from eric petrie with citi. please go ahead.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
hi, good morning scott and todd. 
todd slater -- vice president and chief financial officer -- analyst
hi. good morning.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
can you talk a little bit about the opportunity that you have to sell caustic soda in the evs and battery, the cathode? how large of an opportunity is that? and are those customers asking for a greener caustic soda?
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
well, yeah, the opportunity continues to grow. and a lot of the opportunity has to do with mining activities or extraction activities for lithium and other metals that go into battery. so that's on a fast upward trajectory. today, it's not a massive part of our business.
but more than likely, if you look in the range of five years-ish, maybe a little bit longer, it's actually going to be one of the larger consumers of caustic in the world. and it's one of the items that is driving ecu demand growth and why demand growth is certainly climbing faster than supply growth. it's an important area for us.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
ok, helpful. and then as you run your models for this year, how much could your volumes be down? and similarly, do you expect kind of your parlay volume to stay in this low to mid-teens range?
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
no, we haven't of course given a number on whether volumes will go down. net-net across 2022 versus 2021, you shouldn't think that our self-production volumes are going to decline because that's actually unlikely that, that happens. i think in our parlaying, our purchasing activities of third-party liquidity, that will change quarter to quarter depending on how we're running our model. i'm doubtful that it goes much above this sort of 10% to 15% range that you see it in now.
but in any quarter where that some weakness shows up, that's when you'll see it peak to those levels.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
thank you.
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
and the next question today comes from alex supremo with keybanc. please go ahead.
unknown speaker
thank you. good morning, everyone. scott, you earlier talked about epi -- sorry, on one of the slides, you show epi continuing to rise. do you think -- sorry, pci continuing to rise.
do you think pci will be up in the first quarter? and then should we expect a plateau or continuing increases in the pci in the rest of the year?
todd slater -- vice president and chief financial officer -- analyst
alexy, this is todd. we would expect the ecu pci to continue to improve in the first quarter of 2022 from the fourth quarter. and obviously, as we're running our model, it is all about value. and so you should expect that, that is going to be the key area of focus as we move from where we are today into the rest of 2022.
unknown speaker
thanks, todd. and the second question is on epi. you've earlier talked about potentially big repricing opportunity or value enhancement. can you talk about progress here? and also, if you have any legacy contracts here similar to chlorine that may go beyond 2022?
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure. i mean on epichlorohydrin, i'll just start with the fact that, yes, we do have some legacy contracts. and just like chlorine, we're working our way through that. we're not as far down the path as we now are on chlorine with the calendar year turning over.
but what i will say about epichlorohydrin, right, it's -- we're likely to participate less in the merchant market relative to our chlorine merchant market participation. i mean it really is about using that epichlorohydrin as a scarce resource that's really valuable to olin's downstream operations and that's where most of it gets directed.
operator
and our next question today comes from matthew blair at tudor, pickering, holt. please go ahead.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt and company -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking my question. so going back to the ev discussion. do you have a number on how many pounds of own products you could eventually put on an ev compared to how many pounds that you currently put on an ic vehicle?
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so i don't have the -- it's a good question. i don't have the exact number. but the one consideration there, right, is that even in internal combustion vehicles, the amount of controls and electronics has continued to grow.
so even on those, the need for printed circuit boards, i.e. going back to copper clad laminate, going to epoxy has continued to grow. the good news is on -- that on evs, it's probably double that as well. so the trend is positive in both areas.
there's nothing but good news there for epoxy that goes into, call it, printed circuit boards. the only limitation we really have now is driven by supply chain issues and in supply chain issues around chips that go on printed circuit boards.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt and company -- analyst
right. right. ok. and then is there any update on your chlorine sales into the tio2 market? have you shifted away from that market or are you starting to get higher value into that market?
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
well, we've changed our supply mix somewhere that's still an area where it's a lower value outcome for us. so we have changed our mix a bit. but we've also been successful being able to get more value there as well.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt and company -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
and our next question today comes from angelo castillo with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
unknown speaker
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my question. scott, just a question on what we've been seeing around epoxy. i think traders versus and maybe talked a little bit more about potential risk of imports and you talked about a poor or i guess a weaker quality market and maybe more activations around the epoxy business.
so curious, as you think about the go forward and reducing the cyclicality of the segment and the business overall, how do you prevent from becoming a little bit more or i guess having more like a marginal producer where you're reducing your operations and incentivizing others to import more product into any given region?
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yes. in epoxy, i mean what's happening now? i wouldn't want you to sort of extend that into a permanent pattern for the future, right? there's been a large value change in the epoxy chain. and then you sort of run into end of the year winter in the northern hemisphere scenario. and that's what we had called out in our third quarter earnings is that, that would happen in fourth quarter and it did.
so when these things happen, you do have the opportunity to go get slugs of material that come out of asia. but those are always temporary and they're going to be temporary again. and we are getting ourselves partnered up with the right customers for the future. and it's not about just epoxy resin.
i mean no doubt demand for epoxy resin is certainly growing. and there can be some supply expansions in the epoxy world as well. but it all goes back to epichlorohydrin. most of those supply expansions are limited by epichlorohydrin, which is where we focus a lot of our landscape activities on.
unknown speaker
that's very helpful. thank you. and then one thing that struck me, i guess, was you mentioned becoming the largest ecu buyer. so as we think about your ratchet strategy and continuing to increase the value of your ecu.
i guess, how do we balance that with -- if i think about olin as a buyer or the largest buyer of ecu. i would imagine that, to some degree, then you benefit from lower value. so where is the balance of continuing to drive higher value but also becoming a larger buyer of the product globally?
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
well, sometimes, it's just more effective to buy. and i want to repeat something that i had tried to clarify earlier. today, we're in that position of buying or parlaying because it supports our model and it certainly helps us bridge a bit of a gully here. but in the future, that's a great way to grow the company without spending excessive capital.
unknown speaker
understood. thank you.
operator
and our next question today comes from mike leithead with barclays. please go ahead.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks. congrats on the quarter. just one for me today.
i wanted to follow up on hassan's earlier question, maybe a bit more directly. so scott, in the slides now, you're confident you're going to get $8 billion in free cash over the next five years, which is more than your market cap today. and i think you laid out a fairly compelling rationale for that. and for whatever reason, when i look at your share price trading at a 20% cash yield for each of the next five years, i think the market valuation is saying they don't believe you're wrong.
so if the public market won't give you credit and i don't mean this to be flippant. but why not just take yourself private? i mean, the back-of-the-envelope lbo math is extremely compelling with that level of cash flow if you're confident you're going to deliver that.
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. yeah, i appreciate your question. and yeah, exactly right. i mean, in theory, you can buy ourselves back either immediately or over some time.
look i mean the only way that i can really answer that question is just to say that we are the best value for the use of our own cash at the moment and we've been leaning into that and we're going to lean into that a bit harder.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you.
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
and our last question today comes from roger spitz with bank of america. please go ahead.
roger spitz -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you very much. do you have a target of how short you'd like to be in ecus or a target range?
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
you said how short we want to be in ecu? well, i would just say this, that just because we have ecu capacity doesn't mean that we necessarily run it, right? we have reduced our ecu capacity in fact, by about 850,000 ecu tons a year because it was undervalued. we'll always have the ability at the right value to move around by 5% or so. but we're not necessarily going to use that capability to service a market unless that's a growth market. but i think giving answer to question because we'll be the largest buyer, net buyer, there's a point in our future with the combination of what we produce and buy is larger than our capacity.
and that's likely to be a permanent feature going forward. so i hope i answered your question.
roger spitz -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i mean, you did. but i'm trying to figure out whether that production and buying is at -- are you 5% short or you want to be 25% short?
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
well, we haven't given a number on where we are today. but in our future, we want to lean toward being more short.
roger spitz -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. the other question i have is you stopped selling to tio2 producers. tio2 producers, you may have heard on some of their calls, say, well, we'll just build chlor alkali. does that have a risk to start slide in the global market with caustic if they start building chlor alkali for their own chlorine process needs?
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
well, i would just say that the world is going to need more chlor alkali and it's not on the world's agenda right now to build more plants. so somebody's got to build. we'll see.
roger spitz -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you very much.
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
and as there are no further questions, this concludes our question-and-answer session. i'd like to turn the conference back over to scott sutton for closing comments.
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. no, i would just say thanks to everybody for joining us today. appreciate it.

good morning and welcome to olin corporation's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note today's event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to steve keenan, olin's director of investor relations. please go ahead, steve.
steve keenan -- director of investor relations
thank you, rocko. good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. before we begin, let me remind you that this discussion, along with the associated slides and the question-and-answer session that follows, will include statements regarding estimates or expectations of future performance. please note that these are forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected.
some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from our projections are described without limitations in the risk factors section of our most recent form 10-k and in yesterday's fourth quarter earnings press release. a copy of today's transcript and slides will be available on our website in the investors section under past events. our earnings press release and other financial data and information are available under press releases. with me this morning are scott sutton, olin's ceo; and todd slater, olin's cfo.
olin's business presidents will rejoin our first quarter earnings call. scott will begin with some brief remarks, after which we will be happy to take your questions. i'll now turn the call over to scott sutton. 
scott sutton -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, steve. 2021 was a solid year for olin. i'm extremely proud of the complete olin team for establishing that this company can deliver expected profitability and cash flow.
driving that 2021 performance stake in the ground was critical to our future improvement as there were many temptations to a falling back into a historical peak trough experience. however, we resisted all of those temptations and instead demonstrated the commitment to our leadership model of lifting olin system value above all else. now, and as called out on slide no. 3, it is time to demonstrate that we have broad control over improving our value delivery in 2022 and that we have multiple 2022 and 2023 growth vectors in all three of our businesses.
as shown on slide no. 4, we set our market participation according to the weaker side of the ecu. and consequently, we were able to lift our value on both sides of the ecu through 2021. we won't sell into a poor quality market.
and in fact, we are pressing that principle more than ever heading into 2022. as shown on slide no. 5. instead of choosing to produce and sell incremental volume and negatively impact our market quality, we are instead reducing our capacity utilization and purchasing product liquidity from the market to satisfy our participation level.
this is one tool to prevent a traditional negative cycle for olin and bridge to the future favorable supply demand structural thematic. slide no. 6 shows our increased purchase of global liquidity as our parlaying activities grow. for the moment, those parlaying activities primarily serve to complement our leadership model of lifting our system value.
but those activities will additionally serve olin well in the future as we grow and we require volume produced outside of our asset perimeter. the favorable supply demand structural thematic is upon us. and as shown on slide no. 7, as the world appears to be underinvesting in ecu capacity on the order of 17 world-scale ecu plants over the next six years.
this forecasted underinvestment comes at a time when clear positive demand megatrends solidify, as shown on slide no. 8. this same scenario impacts epichlorohydrin as well as base ecus. moving to slide no.
9, the impacts, activities and outcomes for olin are clear. the forward structural thematic suggests demand growth is much greater than supply growth. we have taken many actions to improve our system value and we expect to become the world leader in global liquidity as well. the result is that olin defeats the cycle, expects to deliver $8 billion of levered free cash flow over the next five years, approximately equal to our current market capitalization and achieves the improved valuation multiple we deserve.
all three of our businesses succeed and materialize in their clear growth vectors. winchester grows a shooting sports participation via the shoot united mission and grows its military business via the demands of the next-generation squad weapon. epoxy grows its upstream value impact in both aromatics and epichlorohydrin and grows its downstream value impact via additional engineered solutions volume into clean energy, composites and infrastructure. and capv becomes the largest buyer of global liquidity and grows by matching our significant excess vinyls upstream capability in edc and vcm with the right pvc players.
these and other growth vectors will become a key subject of future earnings calls. none of this is 100% possible without a platform that is sustainable at olin. we must have the right esg program. so we have decided to raise the bar on some of our targets shown on slide no.
10 after having met many of our initial esg goals earlier than targeted. there is more to come here as our stakeholders continue to ask for enhancements in our esg public profile and we will continue to upgrade our contemporary scorecard on slide no. 11. so that concludes my opening comments.
so rocko, we're now ready to take questions.
