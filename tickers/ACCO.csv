(operator instructions) and our first question is from bill chappell from suntrust. your line is now open.
bill chappell -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
thanks. good morning.
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
good morning bill.
bill chappell -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
just a couple country questions. first on the u.s., kind of, maybe you talked about a little bit earlier back-to-school. i mean can you give us some quantification and maybe qualification of why that would be the case and if that bodes well for a better back-to-school season if you were to have products on shelf earlier?
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
we believe that the back-to-school season will be good from a sell-in perspective. obviously we don't have visibility to sell out yet. but based on customer orders, we believe that we'll see growth this year, sell-in growth this year compared to last year. roughly similar to what we saw last year, we saw a 2% growth last year and we kind of anticipate about that level of growth this year.
we're also seeing that customers are requesting shipments earlier than they did last year. so we anticipate that q2 will be larger from a relative weight perspective, but maybe offset some in q3. again, we have less visibility into q3. so, overall, we're very pleased with where we are with back-to-school, we believe would be a good season then we anticipate a pretty good q2.
bill chappell -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
and then sticking with the us, i mean, you -- where do you think we are on kind of de-stock from some of the key retailers. i mean do you expect another round effectively q -- 4q or are we largely past that?
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
i think -- i think overall we're pretty much done bill. inventory is at fairly low levels with the customers. the only thing to pay attention to for us, probably in the q4 time frame is what happens with staples and essendant, since they are now one company and leveraging, certainly leveraging back-ends. there may be some additional action that they're taking, but we haven't heard anything yet and we haven't seen anything yet. so, for now things are in a good position, but we're still paying attention to this stuff.
bill chappell -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
got it and then last one for me, just on australia. i mean that's been a challenging market for at least a year now. and so just trying to understand has something changed or we're just bouncing along the bottom or obviously you're taking some more -- more strategic actions and cutting costs there. so i'm just trying to get a -- get a sense of where it stands and even if there's a sign of it we'll start to improve it at any point this year.
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
yeah. australia has been a difficult market for at least a year. there have been two major customer consolidations there. so there's a bunch of inventory take out action that is -- that is happening in that market. and the australian economy overall is fairly muted, as neal mentioned in his prepared remarks. the back-to-school season which just ended was weak overall, not just for us but for the industry overall. so we think australia will have muted growth for the next year or so and we are we are preparing for that by just fine tuning our cost structure to make sure that our costs are aligned to the revenue projections that we have.
bill chappell -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
got it. thanks so much.
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
thank you bill. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question is from hamed khorsand from bws financial. your line is now open.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
hey good morning.
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
good morning.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
so first off on the kensington line, is that just an anomaly within the quarter? are you seeing progression in those orders from, let's say, q4 of last year, q1 of this year and then going into q2?
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
no, it's not an anomaly at all. we've seen consistent growth out of kensington, at least for the last 18 months. in 2018 we saw double digit growth there and in q1 we're seeing double digit growth. so, you know, as we've -- we've reworked that line to move away from the consumer market and focus on the b2b market. we also got out of -- from a lot of commodity products and moving on to more value added products. we fine tuned our go to market, we fine tuned our product development. and it's -- it's bearing fruit. so we're seeing good results and we anticipate that we will have a good year from kensington.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
okay. and then as far as the inventory balance goes, it went up (inaudible) between q4 and q1. is that all back to school?
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
it's mostly back-to-school. there is some inventory that's associated with us pre-buying raw materials ahead of projected tariff increases and some inventory step up just because of the cost inflation, but the majority of it is back to school.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
okay. do you think you have better controls over your costs because you have this much inventory right now?
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
well, yes, certainly we have -- we have inventory most of the inventory shipped for back-to-school, so if they're changing in cost they will not effect us.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
no, what i was asking, like, as you deplete these inventory levels, how much of a buying power do you have with your vendors right? i mean, do they give you better deals or are you forced to take higher prices because you're not buying as much anymore this year?
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
i don't think our ability to negotiate has changed at all, hamed. i don't anticipate any dilution of our buying power as a result of us holding inventory. i think we're in a good place.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
okay. and last topic was on europe. i know that it's a lot of fx there. how much traction do you have as far as you know growing (inaudible) further from a sale synergies -- synergy standpoint, without -- with -- on a constant currency basis?
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
i'm very pleased with our results in europe. i think, the team there is doing great. as neal mentioned, we've had the highest growth. they are at 3.5% -- organic growth at 3.5% that we've seen in a very long time, i can't remember how long. you know, it's hard to predict the future but we are in a good position to continue to grow the business and i think the team is executing really well, not just on the revenue side and growth side, but also on the synergy side. so if there's one business that's operating on all cylinders for us it is definitely europe.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
okay, thank you.
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question is from william reuter from bank of america merrill lynch. your line is now open.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
morning guys.
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
good morning, bill.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
so it seems like for the last couple years we've seen better back-to-school trends than the underlying growth rates that we're seeing in north america in general. can you help me understand the difference between the trends during that period and then the remainder of the year?
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
sure. the -- the back-to-school business is largely driven by mass merchant and e-tail channels. those channels are healthier, they're -- they are being better growth overall. they're getting the consumer traffic and as a result they are doing better and we're doing better. and the categories they sell, specifically consumer categories or school categories, are also faster growing than some of the office categories specifically, you know, storage and organization for example. so we've talked now for several quarters that our north american business is going to be more weighted toward q2 and q3 and more challenged in q1 and q4, just because of the seasonality of the business and which channels get to participate in which -- which parts of the year. so it's natural that businesses are doing -- back-to-school is doing better and it's natural that we do better during -- during that time of the year. did i answer your questions?
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
you did. absolutely. and then with regard to your outlook for inflation of -- of inputs, you mentioned that you've pre purchased some of your inputs ahead of what could be potential tariffs. what is the outlook in terms of the inflation you're seeing on a dollar basis globally for 2019 if we include transportation as well as your other inputs?
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
we are -- we are projecting inflation, year-to-year inflation. the costs right now are fairly stable, i would say from q4 on. but if i look on a year-to-year basis, it's still fairly significant. if i look at north america, for example, we're talking about probably in the $30 million incremental range. and we are projecting inflation in emea and international as well. we have taken pricing action as we normally do to offset the impacts of commodity inflation. so from a margin perspective, i still expect this to be -- a gross margin perspective i still expect this to be in that 33% to 34% range, that we gave guidance on.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
still (multiple speakers) inflation we saw last year was actually impacted the very back end of the year. we got the annualization of that, inflation hasn't necessarily got any worse. it's just it's much higher than it was at the beginning of the year. and obviously for half of our business, they buy a lot in china in usd and sell in their local currencies. and particularly places like europe, we've had a big currency movement that's also inflationary for them in terms of cost of goods.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
that makes sense. and then just lastly, if you could provide a little bit commentary around m&a and what you're seeing right now in terms of i guess the amount of opportunities, i guess valuations (ph) and whether they seem attractive to you at this point? thanks.
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
yeah. there's really nothing new to report, same as we discussed before. the funnel remains robust. opportunities are there. we think we have total funnels, probably $3.5 billion of opportunities, only a portion of which are actionable, but it's certainly big enough to move the needle for us. but we're being very disciplined in how we go about it and if we find something that makes sense from a strategic and financial perspective. we certainly have the capacity to act on it. but we also have a good business, good organic business and can grow shareholder value just by driving organic growth and margin expansion.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. i'll turn to others. thank you.
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
thank you, bill.
operator
thank you. our next question is from chris mcginnis from sidoti & company. your line is now open.
good morning. thanks for taking my questions.
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
good morning, chris.
operator
i was wondering -- just a follow up on australia. when you talked about the industry consolidation there, is that similar to what north america experienced. can you just elaborate a little bit on that? thanks.
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
i would say it's actually probably worse than north america experienced. you had number two and number three, biggest customers were merged and then probably number four and number five merged as well. so you have real consolidation going on, especially in the commercial channel in australia. and those customers are obviously working through their integration activities and taking a bunch of inventory out.
so australia has their local issues that they're working through from a market perspective. we have really good market position, we have very broad distribution there. i'm very happy with our business in australia overall but as the customers consolidate and the industry evolves, obviously, it has affect in our business.
operator
sure. and then i think you referenced maybe some concern in q4 around staples and essendant. have they been -- is there any only concern of, now that they have more buying power they are coming to, you know, asking for price concessions.
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
chris, that happens every day with every (multiple speakers). yes, of course, that happens and we expect them to do that. but we run our business for our shareholders. and i have a lot of confidence in our ability to do what's right for our shareholders. it may take us a quarter or so to respond, but as we're seeing with the q1 results, we do respond and we adjust and we react and we reorient our business in such a way that it delivers for our shareholders. so i'm very confident in our continued ability to do that no matter what happens with staples and essendant.
operator
i appreciate that. good luck in q2. thanks for taking my questions.
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
thank you, chris.
operator
thank you. our next question is from kevin steinke from barrington research. your line is now open.
good morning. in terms of the price increases you implemented in january. just wondering what the realization was on those price increases as you were able to get pretty much everything you asked for and should we see more benefit from pricing, as we move throughout the year?
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
the answer is yes and yes. yes, we got everything we wanted. it takes time to see the realization of price increases because not everything happens specifically on january 1st. there is a progression through the quarter of when some of the pricing goes into effect. so we saw, i believe, 2.9% in the first quarter. but we do expect to see incremental effects from pricing in q2 in north america, as it's fully now rolled out, effective end of q1. so yes, we will see incremental benefit.
operator
okay great. and then it sounds like mexico had a good quarter. i know conditions were a little more challenging in mexico last year. i believe due to a customer changing its -- their inventory management strategy. are we kind of past that headwind now and what are you expecting for the rest of the year in mexico?
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
yes, kevin. you're exactly right. we had a customer that was taking a lot of inventory out, especially in the first half of last year. so we obviously anniversaried that situation, we don't have that anymore. mexico did have a good quarter. it was especially driven by our acquisition that we made in july of last year by the barrilito branded products. i expect mexico to have a good year. we don't have the inventory headwind that we faced last year and i expect mexico to deliver good growth.
operator
great, great. that's all i had. thank you.
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
thank you, kevin.
operator
thank you. our next question is from joe gomes from noble capital. your line is now open.
good morning.
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
good morning, joe.
operator
i just wondered, if you might be able to talk a little bit, you know, some of the other channels. you know what kind of growth rates we're seeing there? what percentage of the business they take out, specifically like amazon and e-tail overall and maybe a little bit more color on the dollar store channel which is something you've talked about in the past and how that is growing?
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
sure. let me start with our biggest channel, which is independents. independents have done really, really well. it's a majority of our business in europe. they're taking share there. it's a majority of our business in brazil. they're taking share as well. and independents had a really good quarter in north america as well. so that channel is doing extremely well and taking share from some of their larger competitors. e-tail continues to grow fast. we had really good growth internationally with e-tail. it was a little bit slower in north america as we work through some of the pricing implementation issues in north america.
mass is doing well. it's very customer specific. but overall, mass is doing well and we seem (ph) to see mass take customer share, take consumer share in the overall industry. from a dollar store perspective, we are fine tuning our participation in dollar stores. we had rapid growth last year. it's still a fairly small part of our business. less -- certainly less than $10 million a year, but fairly a rapid growth last year. but it was very margin dilutive for us. so this year we are fine tuning our assortment to make sure that we could have profitable growth.
so i expect this year to have less sales in dollar store but certainly delivered more gross profit dollars to the company than last year. and oss, office product superstores, it really depends on the particular customer that we're talking about. some of them are more in the consolidation mode and driving more private label and others have played that game. it did not deliver the results so now they're more embracing branded products and growing with us. so overall, there are puts and takes in that channel. and then the other channel that we're seeing good growth in is direct to consumer channel.
we have an existing roughly $40 million business that is growing and plus we're introducing new products and new categories that are primarily targeting direct to consumer channels to reach the consumer. and we recently issued a press release about trusens, a line of air purifiers that we launched a couple of months ago. and those products are going primarily through direct-to-consumer channels. so overall we're seeing good growth in the majority of our channels and some consolidation in the kind of more mature channels. and by the way, this is no different than the industry overall. there's all these channel shifts that are happening from specialty retail to mass retail from retail in general to online. and it affects us like it affects everybody else.
operator
okay great. thanks for that. and i was wondering if you could just provide a little more color on the brazilian tax reserve. what is going on there, is there the potential for more. do you think that you've covered it with the recent one that you took in the quarter. any additional detail there would be appreciated? thanks.
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
let me give you -- i should -- neal will give you a short summary, but i would also encourage you to read both the 10-k and the 10-q which will be published later today which will give you a more robust description. but neal will give you a quick high level summary. go ahead neal.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so first all this dates back to our acquisition of the mead c&op business and taking tax depreciation within the business, which predated our ownership. and what we have fundamentally is a dispute that we knew would take a long period of time to resolve. we just completed for some of the years that are in dispute the administrative court proceedings and now moved to the judicial level. when you make that transition there is a natural increase under brazilian law of the potential penalty if you lose. obviously, we are fighting because that's not our anticipation. there is one more year where we are still in the administrative courts and therefore that size of the liability will change and every year the liability does increase because we have to add interest to it and it's tended to then be offset because fx has reduced it. so you get interest in fx every year, but there will be one more step up for one more year of the dispute that will occur as and when that transitions to the judicial level. and it's probably going to be at the judicial level for many, many years. so this is nothing that's going to have a result anytime soon.
operator
okay great. thanks for that, appreciate it. thanks guys.
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
thanks, joe.
operator
thank you. our next question is from brad thomas from keybanc capital markets. your line is now open.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning everybody. i got on a couple of minutes late from another earnings call, so i apologize if this has been addressed. but i wanted to just talk a little bit more about the profitability in the north america business. was encouraged to see those results and i'm hoping boris you could just share a little bit more about the opportunity to continue to enhance margin and improve operating income dollars in the north american business?
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
yeah. in north america, as we said over the last couple of quarters, we saw a fairly significant inflation last year. big cost increases and we weren't able to adjust pricing on a timely basis due to the commitments, contractual commitments we have with customers. so we raised prices twice in north america in the last several months, once in october of 2018 and once in q1, starting in january of 2019. you're seeing margin expansion and recovery of margin as a result of that. we expect incremental benefit just due to the pricing working its way through all of the customers, incremental benefit in q2 as well.
and right now we're seeing the inflation, the cost stay fairly muted in north america. so if things stay as is we will not be needing to do another price increase until probably next year. i mean obviously there is inflation so i do anticipate a price increase next year but we'll be -- we should be all set for 2019. in addition in north america, we've taken incremental productivity and cost reduction actions, both in 2018 and in 2019. and the team has been implementing those and as a result of that we're seeing improved manufacturing efficiencies as well as lower sg&a in north america. so margins have expanded. profitability has improved. and given what i'm seeing from north america and the earlier back-to-school that we anticipate in north america, i think, in the near term the margins will continue to be very, very good in that region.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
that's great. so just to address the back-to-school sell-in,you've alluded to some of the different channels you sell to and some of the changes that are happening. but i guess as you try to net it all out, boris, do you think this year's sell-in for back-to-school you all are share gainers across the industry and have a better selling than last year or is it similar or worse, how should we think about it?
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
the sell-in should be better than last year. we anticipate roughly 2% growth from last year. so we do anticipate better sell-in. share gain would depend on what the market does. so i can only tell you that in hindsight. i can't predict what the market is going to do, but i'm very happy with our sell-in position. and we also said in both prepared remarks on the call that we anticipate back-to-school shipments to be earlier this year than we did last year which should benefit q2.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. and then on the -- on the trusens air purifiers, i thought the march (ph) looks very well done. how do you think about the revenue opportunity for that category and how much it might be able to contribute to growth?
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
you know it's a very big category. we estimate the category to be around $2 billion and it's growing at about 13% per year. this is worldwide. obviously, we just entered the market so we're very small but it has an opportunity to be a big category for us. we -- we've just been selling the product on our own site and through amazon for the last few weeks and we're very, very happy (technical difficulty). we also began to sell in canada and in japan in the last few weeks and we have a plan to roll it out in europe and the rest of the world in the second half of the year. so we have high hopes for it. the product is great. i think we've -- the team has done a great job with marketing and merchandising it on our website and we're excited and well, we'll see what happens. but the opportunity is large. we just have to deliver.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
it's very helpful. thank you, boris.
thanks, brad.

following our prepared remarks, we will hold a q&a session. now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to boris elisman.
boris elisman -- acco brands corporation
good morning, everyone. i'm pleased to report that the year got off to a solid start, with higher constant currency sales, stable comparable sales and improved margins, driven by a great execution in north america, continued organic growth in emea, a good back-to-school in brazil and strong performance of the recently acquired global business in mexico.
we were disciplined and implemented price increases, which is enabling us to begin to recover the lost margin from inflation and tariffs. and we started to see some benefits from the additional cost reduction actions we began late last year. while q1 is still our smallest quarter, the stronger start gives us confidence in meeting our goals for the year.
i'm going to begin my segment commentary with north america. sales in north america declined at a much lower rate than what we saw in the back half of 2018, down 3.1% on a reported basis and 2.5% on a comparable basis. as orders in the wholesaler channel stabilized and we saw a double digit growth in kensington computer products and modest organic growth in the canadian market. the decline that we experienced was due to the timing of orders and the continued effect of the lost placement of certain calendar products last year.
overall, we continue to manage the channel transition well. q1 is typically a challenging sales quarter in north america and i'm very encouraged by our strong start. in the second and third quarters, the faster growing channels such as e-tail and mass merchants, carry a higher proportion of sales due to back-to-school shipments. our initial view on our north america back-to-school season is of sales growth to be consistent with prior year, when we had a good back-to-school season overall and grew sales 2%. in addition, we expect to ship back-to-school orders earlier this year. overall for the year, we still expect north america sales to decline low single digits.
beyond sales, north america operating margin increased, as new pricing started to recover higher product costs and due to tight management of expenses manufacturing and distribution efficiencies and as the incremental cost reduction initiatives we put into place late last year and early this year, began to take hold. overall, i am pleased with the improved performance in our north america business and the execution by our team.
turning to emea. once again, this region delivered strong top and bottom line results. while reported sales declined 5%, entirely due to currency, comparable sales increased 3.5%, as we continued to see the positive sales effects of cross-selling legacy acco and esselte products, and due to new product launches.
the sales and marketing teams have done a great job in this region. in addition to strong go-to-market execution, the operations teams in emea have continued to deliver. excluding a $1.6 million adverse impact of foreign currency, emea's underlying operating income increased, driven by cost savings and synergies. i remain very pleased with our european results.
results in international segment were again mixed. we had a good quarter in brazil, with growth in tilibra notebooks during a strong back-to-school season. we did well in mexico, driven by the strong performance from the recently acquired barrilito business. the results in brazil and mexico were more than offset by the declines in australia. the overall market in australia is soft and we continue to work through the impact of customer consolidation.
in total, i am pleased with our start to the year. as we enter the early phases of the back-to-school season in north america, we have taken prudent steps beginning in q4 of last year to pre-buy raw materials in certain inventory to secure availability and avoid further tariff and inflationary increases.
we also began production of manufactured back-to-school products earlier to maximize our product availability during the peak season. these actions in combination with anticipated earlier back-to-school shipments, had an impact on our operating cash flow this quarter and will continue to have some impact in the second quarter. this is consistent with our expectations, as communicated on our call in february. with a full year, we continue to target $165 million to $175 million of free cash flow. now, i will ask neal to give you a more detailed look at the corner. neal?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, boris, and good morning, everyone. first quarter sales decreased 2.9% due to the adverse impact of foreign currency, which more than offset growth from the goba acquisition and growth in emea. we had a net loss of $0.6 million or $0.01 per share. this included a $5.6 million adjustment tax expense related to a reserve for our brazilian tax dispute that needed to reflect a step up in potential liability as we enter the judicial courts, and also included $3.2 million of restructuring and integration charges.
adjusted net income was $8.8 million or $0.08 per share, similar to last year, despite a $0.03 headwind from fx, a higher adjusted tax rate and higher interest expense.
gross margin improved 50 basis points to 31.9% and adjusted gross margin improved 60 basis points to 32%, primarily driven by cost and synergy savings, as well as price increases. sg&a expenses were down in the quarter and as a percent of sales were lower by 80 basis points on a reported basis and lower by 50 basis points on an adjusted basis.
improvement in adjusted sg&a ratio was primarily due to the cost savings and acquisition benefits. all in, operating income increased and operating margin expanded 160 basis points on a reported basis and 100 basis points on an adjusted basis. our adjusted tax rate was 33.3% in the quarter and reflects the geographic mix of earnings and the small quarter. we still expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be in the 30% to 31% range.
turning to some additional details of our segment results. in north america, segment sales decreased 3.1% and excluding currency, decreased 2.5%. pricing added 3.5%. volume was lower due to the timing of orders and the loss placements of calendar products that began last year as boris mentioned.
despite the lower sales, a strong gross margin and lower sg&a drove improved operating performance in the quarter. north america operating income margin improved 240 basis points and on an adjusted basis increased 230 basis points. the increase was driven by cost savings and pricing actions.
in our emea segment, sales decreased 5% due to currency, which reduced sales by nearly $13.5 million or 9%. comparable sales increased 3.5%, the strongest rate we've seen recently, driven by growth mainly in computer products and shredding due to new products and cross-selling. the timing of easter was also a benefit as it was later this year, falling in q2, whereas last year we felt some effects in q1. emea operating income was adversely impacted by 1.6 million of foreign currency. excluding this, emea operating income increased and margin expanded due to cost savings and synergies, which offset higher product costs.
international sales increased 1.5% due to the goba acquisition in mexico, which added $11 (ph) million in sales. excluding the acquisition and the impact of currency, sales declined 4%. we continue to see good results out of brazil where the back-to-school season was strong. mexico also had a good quarter, aided by the great performance with the barrilito branded products that we recently acquired. however, as boris noted, australia results were lower. the overall market is soft in australia, back-to-school was soft and customer consolidation continues to play out. international segment margins contracted, driven by australia. we are further reducing our cost structure in australia in order to better weather conditions there.
heading now to our balance sheet and cash flow. our inventory balance is up $105 million year-over-year, driven mainly by lost q4, as we forward bought materials to secure supply or new product launches and mitigate the risks of both known and anticipated inflation, including tariffs.
we also expect back-to-school to be more seasonally weighted to our second quarter this year requiring the earlier production of certain products. we expect inventory to further increase for the seasonal peak in q2 but then to step down in q3 and further in q4, particularly as we do not anticipate repeating the q4 2018 advance purchases. we used $61.3 million of net cash from operating activities and including capex of $7 million. therefore, our free cash flow was a use of $68.4 million in the quarter.
the large cash outflow was expected as we paid for the increased inventory. we expect less cash use in q2 of this year than we had in q2 of 2018. but it will still be a seasonal outflow as back to school ramps up. in the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of stock for a total of $10.5 million and paid $6.2 million in dividends. for 2019, we still expect free cash flow of $165 million to $175 million, with our cash generation in the third and fourth quarters. we are reiterating our revenue, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow guidance for the year. and, as always, we have included certain assumptions in our slide deck on page 13.
with that, i'll conclude my remarks and move on to q&a, where boris and i will be happy to take your questions. operator?

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of bill chappell with suntrust. your line is now open.
bill chappell -- suntrust` -- analyst
thanks. good morning. boris, just want to dig a little bit further into the north american performance and kind of what you're seeing. and maybe if you can break down what you're seeing out of the category. do you expect back-to-school to be kind of, as a category, to be up year-over-year this year? is it more share gains? and mainly, i mean i understand the pricing benefit, but trying to understand the volume and then what you expect over the next -- as we move through back-to-school season.
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure, bill. the growth that we saw in north america has been very broad across many categories and many channels. we saw growth in mass and oss and in e-tail as well. we got bigger placement for five star, hilroy, kensington, gbc and quartet brands. and we also gained a lot of private label business for back-to-school. and remember, from a compare standpoint that's one of the things that we lost a year ago in back-to-school. so we're set up for a very good back-to-school and, as neal mentioned in his prepared remarks, we expect the growth to be stronger than 2% that we experienced last year. given our 9% growth in the second quarter, i certainly do believe that we took share. i don't think that that market is growing at that particular rate. but we're set up for back-to-school. obviously we'll have to see what happens during the season. the season is just starting so it's a little bit too early to comment on that.
bill chappell -- suntrust` -- analyst
and is the thought or the hope that oss is finally less -- not enough of a drag to offset kind of the gains you're seeing in the other channels and maybe we're through the multi-year consolidation impact?
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
that certainly is the hope. and we have seen that especially in the second and third quarter when mass plays a much bigger role in our seasonality. we're seeing the pressures from oss consolidation to be a lot smaller in those 2 quarters, and then in the first and fourth quarter they typically are larger. but certainly as other channels become a bigger part of our mix, the negative effects from oss consolidation will be felt less. it is important to reinforce that we did see growth in oss in this particular back-to-school sell-in, in this particular q2. it wasn't across all customers and channels, but overall if i combine all the sales we did see growth in q2.
bill chappell -- suntrust` -- analyst
got it. and then last one just back on europe. maybe a little more color and what's going on. and i can't remember the exact impact expected from brexit, but as we look over the next few months, i know you have a meaningful u.k. business and how you're expecting that to affect the p&l.
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. europe had a difficult compare versus a year ago. we grew a lot a year ago. we had a couple of one-time things happening a year ago that boosted revenue. we moved a warehouse so we shipped ahead of that. there was the european privacy law, gdpr, that was launched in may of last year and then drove a lot of shredder sales in may -- in june. and also we had a, well, kind of a holiday shift that benefited q1 and took away from q2. so that affected european sales. we are seeing a slowdown in the u.k., to your point. so we do expect that brexit will affect sales to some effect. the good thing about our business in emea is that u.k. is now a much smaller percentage of our sales. it used to be around a third of our sales in europe. now it's down to 10%-12%. so we believe we can be flat for the year despite some of the challenges that we expect to be in the u.k. associated with brexit.
bill chappell -- suntrust` -- analyst
got it. thanks so much.
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks bill. thank you.

our next question comes from the line of brad thomas with keybanc capital markets. your line is now open.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
good morning boris. congrats on the nice quarter here. i wanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions on north america if i could. i guess just to ask it directly, do you feel like there were any timing nuances in terms of the timing of shipments that occurred? because i know sometimes there can be some shifting between 2q and 3q in orders. and how is that playing out this year?
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. that's a good question, brad. we don't think that the shifting was significant. there's always shifting, as you mentioned, between q2 and q3, and some customers want it a little bit early, some customers want to be a little bit later. but whatever it was this year was not really significant to change our view that the back-to-school we think would be better than it was last year, the back-to-school growth will be better than it was last year.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
and then just putting it into context. i mean this is a very strong 2q in terms of north america growth. do you still believe you can grow sales in north america in the third quarter? or do you think this may make a tough bar for posting growth in the third quarter specifically against what is a pretty easy comparison in the third quarter last year?
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no, we think back-to-school season will be good. so we always aspire to grow. we achieved our results in the first half in north america. it was an especially strong q2. we believe we can grow in q3. q4 becomes more challenging; one, because we have a little bit less visibility in q4 and, two, as i mentioned, that's where the more challenged customers become a bigger percentage of sales. so growing significantly becomes more difficult.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. and then some of the new products clearly seem like they're having a strong launch and getting some traction out of the gate. i mean when you think about new product introductions, i mean are they big enough to kind of call out as a specific percentage of sales and worth calling out as how much they contributed here to this quarter? or are they still more in their infancy at this point?
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it really depends. the products that i mentioned, if we look at shredders that were launched very early in the year, we achieved sales in the millions of dollars so certainly it has an impact on the first half revenue. some of the other products that we talked about, such as trusens, a foton 30, those launched in the middle to end of q1 so, talk about $518 million in revenue, it doesn't really have a huge effect on it.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
that's helpful. congratulations --
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
but the growth has been significant, brad. the growth has been significant and the trend is up to the right and certainly we hope that at some point in time we'll be calling out the exact amounts that are delivered by those products. so, yes.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
that's great. thanks again.
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question comes from the line of chris mcginnis with sidoti & company. your line is now open.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my questions.
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you chris.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
nice quarter. i was wondering if you could just maybe comment on the wholesale market that you serve into and how that's performing. and is that picking up? or are you still seeing some kind of headwinds with the consolidation?
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. if you remember last year we had a lot of inventory being taken out of the wholesalers, u.s. wholesalers. we've seen that normalize and we're seeing a normal operating performance out of our wholesale channels, actually on a global basis. so there's nothing unusual about the pattern that -- sales pattern that we're seeing with wholesalers.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
great. and then secondly just with the change with the credit facility. any thoughts about changing to maybe a more consistent strategy on the share repurchase?
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
could you elaborate on that, chris?
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
just with the change in the credit facility. i mean obviously you've been pretty proactive with share repurchase figure of cash before. now that opens you up or frees you from that. is it maybe more consistent in the sense of you're going to dedicate a certain amount of free cash flow to share repurchase a year?
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
right. so just as a reminder, we refinanced our facility, as chris mentioned. and from a practical standpoint, as long as our leverage stays below 3.25 we don't have any limitations on share repurchases. we expect in q2 and q3 to be above 3.25, which means we're limited to $75 million, but limitation to go away in q4. and we don't believe we'll be buying $75 million in the first 3 quarters anyway. so we won't have a, from a practical standpoint, the limitation on our repurchases. and then from a strategy standpoint, we remain opportunistic when it comes to share repurchases. if the price is right, we will be buying more shares, and if the price gets high, we think that from a shareholder return perspective, we can probably deploy our money better somewhere else.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti and company -- analyst
thank you very much for your time today.
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you chris.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of kevin steinke with barrington research. your line is now open.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
good morning everyone. i think when you initially gave your outlook for 2019 there as an assumption that there would be some degradation in sales volume just due to the significant price increases you were implementing. i mean it doesn't sound like that's been the case, but have you seen that at all in reaction to the price increases?
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, you're correct, kevin. we assumed pretty much a 1-to-1 offset between pricing and volume and we have not seen that. so the effect of the price increases has been -- the negative effect has been less than we anticipated.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay, that's good to hear. and then neal mentioned somewhat of a headwind in the fourth quarter from accrual of incentive compensation. just how should we think about that in terms of a margin impact for the remainder of the year?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it was a $7 million, or close to $7 million release we had last year, which we won't have this year. so it's literally it's a $7 million impact on q4 operating margin.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
thanks. that's all i had.
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you kevin.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of hamed khorsand with bws financial. your line is now open.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
hey good morning. just a few questions here. could you just talk about on the back-to-school that you're seeing the volume increase for, is that coming in with a higher asp than what you've usually been accustomed to as far as what your customers are buying? or is this low asp kind of business; it's just volume-driven kind of revenue?
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's a combination of the 2. we have raised prices on those products that were affected by inflation and tariffs. so on those products, we are seeing a higher asp. but we also won incremental private label business, which is typically more commodity, low asp business. we haven't -- i don't think we've done analysis, neal, of the overall portfolio asp. but i believe it would be a combination of the 2.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
okay. and is that commoditized business that you're opting for winning, is that purely just to run your manufacturing at an efficient rate? or why are you going after that business?
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's a profitable business. it gives us marginal profit dollars, good for our shareholders, yes. and i've talked about it before. we look at that business opportunistically. if it's accretive to our bottom line, we would do it. if not, we won't do it. it's not strategic for us in nature, but given the incremental revenue and profit dollars, when we can get it we want it.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
then on the accounts receivable, is there any credit quality issues here? or has there been net terms extensions? just if you could just provide some color as far as the increase.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
the increase is fundamentally driven by the higher sales. and so you've also got the acquisition of goba, which year-over-year makes an impact on the a/r balance. but the biggest issue is just high sales in the second quarter and the timing of those sales, which, as you would understand, with back-to-school being a big constituent part, they happen late in the quarter and so they will just end up on a/r at the end of the quarter.
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
and dso days are comparable to last year so we don't see any kind of incremental risk.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
okay. and my last question is just on that product warranty comment that you made. is this new products that you had issues with? and could you provide some aspect of what the impact was and if there was any manufacturing delays because of this product warranty issue?
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. we had some quality issues in europe on some of our products. so we had to some reserves associated with that. the products are fairly new. they were not launched this year, but they were a fairly new subset of a line. so we're working through that. we think from an impact to the end user standpoint as well as the financial reserve standpoint that's all already incorporated in our numbers beyond this. but it did affect our results especially for emea second quarter.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
thank you.
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line william reuter with bank of america. your line is now open.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
hi guys. this is mike on for bill. can you talk about the potential impact of a 25% tariff on the list 4 items?
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
which one are you talking about? there are so many of them. are you talking about the $300 billion one that people are speculating about?
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
yes.
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
so obviously if tariffs are raised on the remaining chinese imports, we would have to pass through those tariffs on to the consumer. neither us nor we believe other manufacturers there can absorb a 25% cost increases, is what this would be. and we would have to pass it on. we don't think that it's likely that these $300 billion will be implemented, but if they are we will pass them on.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
and is there any estimation about the dollar value of that?
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
if you look at the tariff impact that is already in place, which is roughly the same amount, it's on the order of $28 million. so basically you would incur another $28 million in additional costs if the other $300 billion would come into play and we would have to recoup that $28 million in additional pricing.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
the likelihood of it impacting this year, though, is getting low just given the way the calendar is working and how long it takes us to be able to implement price increases. so the effect is always at least a quarter out from whenever anything occurred.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
got you. and then lastly, could you talk about what you're seeing in the m&a pipeline and how you guys are looking at valuations right now?
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
as i commented before, acquisitions are a core part of our strategy as we try to change the profile of our business toward faster growing categories, channels and geographies. we are very disciplined in our approach. there's lots of potential acquisitions out there, but we're disciplined in our approach and we only act if it makes sense from a return on invested capital perspective for our shareholders. beyond that, i can't comment on any specifics.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
thanks so much.
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question is coming from the line of hale holden with barclays. your line is now open.
hale holden -- barclays -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my call. i had 2 questions. in the slide deck, you called out enabling independent dealers to increase direct purchases to become more price competitive. i was wondering if you could give us some more color on what you're doing with the independent dealers in the u.s. and what the opportunity set was there.
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. we launched a program a few months ago to enable independent dealers to buy directly from us in economic order quantities if they want to, and therefore they can avoid the wholesaler margin and be more competitive with e-tail. and the program has been very successful. we had a lot of adoption. dealers still have a choice whether they want to buy through a wholesaler or directly from us. and a lot of them make those decisions based on not just pricing, but the credit availability and some of the other factors, warehouse space, etc. but we have seen a positive uptake on that program. we have more dealers buying direct from us, which allows them to compete more effectively with their competitors. and just as an aside, we have very successful independent dealer initiatives in emea where the majority of our sales actually do go directly to independent dealers and not through wholesalers. and as a result, our dealer business and overall business in emea is very healthy and robust. so what's happening in north america, in a way, is mimicking what we've done in emea over many, many years.
hale holden -- barclays -- analyst
you had also called out good sales flow through to the wholesalers or expectations of that in the back-to-school. so i assume that there's been sort of no blow-back to you from that channel.
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no. i mean obviously wholesalers want to have dealers buy directly from them. but our sales with wholesalers have been growing. albeit, it's because they were taking inventories down last year so the compares are a little bit easier. but no, we haven't seen a lot of blow-back from wholesalers on that.
hale holden -- barclays -- analyst
got it. and then my second question was, in europe i think the office superstore is a pretty small component of what you're selling into, but we had seen headlines earlier in the week that one of them was -- had a factory that was not providing support to them. and i was wondering if that was an issue for you guys at all or not.
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, the environment in europe is very different, as you said. superstores are a very small percent of the business in europe and, because they're such a small percent of the business in europe, we effectively can offset some of the headwinds that we've seen from them over the last several years with growth through other channels. so yes, we're aware of all the happenings in europe. we don't think it's going to have a material effect on our business there.
hale holden -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you so much i appreciate it.
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of karru martinson with jefferies. your line is now open.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
just following up on the wholesalers, has there been any change really with the essendant being integrated or being assumed by staples' parent?
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we haven't seen the effects of that combination yet in our business. we anticipate, obviously, that something will happen, but we have not seen it yet.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. and just with staples and launching private label of a number of brands, how does that change the aspects? is private label still kind of the category entry point that you always thought it was? or has that changed?
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no, nothing has really changed. i mean staples has had private label for many, many years. they just now branded it something different than staples. but the strategy is not that much different. so we don't think it's going to have any different impact than it has had over the last many years in our business.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. and just lastly, in terms of freight and shipping, kind of what's the outlook there?
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
did you say, karru, freight and shipping?
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
exactly.
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we have seen rates rise. and that's a continuation of what we saw last year in the second half; similar issues in terms of shortage of truckers and digital metering, etc. so they are still at the elevated levels. they're not increasing at the same rate that we saw last year, but they certainly are not going down.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. thank you very much guys appreciate it.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of joe gomes with noble capital. your line is now open.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
thanks. good morning guys.
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning joe.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
most of my questions have already been asked. but one of the things you mentioned was that you're looking at doing some more insourcing to your existing plants. i wonder if you could give us a little more color on that. how much can you do? what type of products are you pulling back? anything in there would be appreciated.
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. so if you look at -- tariffs affect different categories unevenly. they're causing us to actually outsource in some categories because it's cheaper to buy a finished product than to import raw materials which are affected by tariffs and then build it in our factories. on the other hand, in a category like binders, it's now more effective to manufacture them in our facilities than to import finished goods from asia, from china. so binders specifically, we'll look into insource more. but on some of the categories like glass boards we're actually manufacturing less and bringing more from asia.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
okay, great. and then i don't know if you could give us the impact. i know last year we talked a little bit about the lost calendar placements. i was wondering if going into this period whether you regain those placements or not.
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, we've seen the lost placements anniversary in q1 of this year. it didn't really have an effect on our q2 sales. and we're hoping for incremental placement and incremental share in the q3 and q4 timeframe. so the negative effects are behind us and we're hoping for positive effects in the second half of the year.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
okay. great. thank you.

operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the second quarter 2019 acco brand corporation earnings conference call.[operator instructions].
i would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, christine hanneman, senior director of investor relations. you may begin.
christine hanneman -- senior director, investor relation
good morning. this is christine hanneman, senior director of investor relations. welcome to acco brands second quarter 2019 conference call. speaking on the call today are boris elisman, chairman, president and chief executive officer of acco brands corporation; and neal fenwick, executive vice president and chief financial officer. slides that accompany this call have been posted to the investor relations section of accobrands.com. when speaking about quarterly results, we may refer to adjusted results. adjusted results exclude transaction, integration and restructuring costs and reflect an adjusted tax rate. schedules of adjusted results and other non-gaap financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures are in today's earnings release and the slides that accompany this call.
due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts, we do not reconcile our forward-looking adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow, net leverage ratio or adjusted tax rate guidance. forward-looking statements made during the call are based on certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results could differ materially. please refer to our press release and sec filings for an explanation of certain of these risk factors and assumptions. our forward-looking statements are made as of today and we assume no obligation to update them going forward. following our prepared remarks, we will hold a q&a session.
now i will turn the call over to boris.
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning. we reported record second quarter sales and adjusted eps, continuing our strong performance of the first quarter. sales rose almost 7%, excluding currency translation, led by the strong back-to-school sell-in in north america. profit growth was driven by sales and excellent control of expenses. i'm very pleased by our execution year-to-date and while we will always have areas to improve, our results show that our strategies are bearing fruit and delivering good revenue and profit growth. let me remind you of our strategic imperatives to drive profitable growth, the path we've been on for the last few years. we're diversifying our geographies and channels organically and with acquisitions to have a larger presence in faster growing countries and channels and to have less dependency on any one customer.
we are focusing more on the end consumer, investing more in consumer-centric brands and categories organically and through acquisitions and are choosing routes to market that are more closely aligned with where consumers want to shop. we're developing more products within users-driven innovation as demonstrated by our recent launches of trusens air purifiers, foton 30 automatic laminators, kensington sd7000 surface pro docking stations and rexel momentum and leitz iq shredders. we're laser-focused on reducing unnecessary costs in the business and improving the productivity of our resources. our lean six sigma based productivity programs generate substantial savings every year that are either reinvested in the business or returned to shareholders.
we're diligent about execution, always the most difficult part of any business, but something that we at acco brands do well every quarter and especially this year. and lastly, we're prudent stewards of shareholder capital ensuring that we invest in areas with good shareholder return, and this include acquisitions, or returning capital to shareholders. we have been working on these strategic vectors over the last few years and have delivered good revenue, eps and cash flow growth. our record results this quarter are another confirmation that our strategies are working and that we are capable of generating profitable growth in a challenging environment.
now let me turn the call over to neal for a review of segments, guidance and other financial commentary, and then i'll join him in answering your questions. neal.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, boris. good morning, everyone. we posted record sales in the quarter, up 4%, based on price increases across all segments and volume growth in north america driven by strong back-to-school sell-in. we also reported record second quarter adjusted net income of $36.3 million, or $0.36 per share, based on higher operating income offsetting a $0.02 negative impact from foreign exchange and the higher tax rate. as shown on slide seven, gross margin was 32%, down slightly due to unfavorable product mix in north america and international and one-off expenses in emea. sg&a expenses as a percent of sales were down in the quarter to 18.4% from 20% last year primarily because of good expense management and leverage from higher sales.
operating income increased to $61 million from $52 million and operating margin expanded to 11.8% from 10.4% last year. on an adjusted basis, operating income increased largely due to cost savings and higher net sales. our adjusted tax rate was 29.7% in the quarter. we still expect our full-year adjusted tax rate to be 30% to 31%. now let's turn to some details of our segment results. net sales in north america rose 9% driven by pricing of 7.5% that was needed to offset input inflation and tariffs. volume contributed 1.5%. we saw growth in almost all channels and back-to-school orders have been strong and sales growth continued with the kensington brand from new products. as we mentioned last quarter, in our second and third quarters the faster growing channels such as e-tail and mass merchants carry a higher proportion of sales due to back-to-school shipment. our initial view on our north american back-to-school season was that sales growth would be consistent with last year when we grew back-to-school sales 2%.
we now expect it to do better than that and anticipate higher growth than last year's 2%. north america operating margin increased to 19.6% from 18.8% driven by cost savings and price increases, which offset inflation and tariffs. for the full year, we now expect north america sales to be close to flat rather than down low single digits. in our emea segment, sales decreased 9%. currency reduced sales by approximately $9 million or 6%. comparable sales decreased due to the timing of easter, which had benefited the first quarter, and higher sales last year ahead of our warehouse moves and from the european privacy law implementation, which led to strong sales of shredders. year-to-date, comparable sales in emea are up slightly. emea adjusted operating income declined $3 million due to lower volume and one-off expenses. we expect european sales to be roughly flat for the year on a comparable basis. international segment sales increased 9% due to the goba acquisition in mexico, which added approximately $12 million in sales. operating income rose significantly on both the reported and adjusted basis from the acquisition and cost savings.
results within the international segment were mixed. mexico rebounded versus last year with strong back-to-school performance in both our legacy business and with the barrilito-branded products we recently acquired with goba. we continued to see good results out of brazil, but it is their seasonally smallest quarter. australia results were lower as the market continues to be difficult with a slowing economy, customer consolidation and lost placements as customers focused on lower price points. going forward, we anticipate continuing strong performance in mexico as well as in brazil as it enters its back-to-school season in the fourth quarter. we also anticipate continuing challenges in australia. overall, including goba, we anticipate low double-digit growth in the international segment for the full year. the goba acquisition impact was all in the first half and therefore the rate of growth in the second half will be lower. let's move now to our balance sheet and cash flow.
we were very pleased that our high inventory levels protected our back-to-school margins, but as we discussed last quarter, it shifted the seasonality of our cash flow. this will self-correct as we collect receivables in the third and fourth quarters without building up the inventory as we did last year. we have not changed our view on the full-year cash flow as we anticipate a significantly stronger second half cash flow than our historical pattern. we used $62 million of free cash flow in the quarter. the large cash outflow was as expected. in the quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares for a total of $27.4 million and paid $6 million in dividends. year-to-date, we repurchased 4.7 million shares for a total of $38 million and paid $12 million in dividends. given our performance year-to-date and our forecast for the second half, we are increasing our outlook for 2019. we now estimate that sales will be at the top end of our original range, which is flat, and this includes a 2% adverse foreign exchange effect.
we are raising the bottom of our eps range and now expect eps to be $1.15 to $1.20 per share including $0.03 negative impact of foreign exchange. we anticipate that back-to-school will continue to be strong in the third quarter. however, the north american channels we are growing in are not as significant in the fourth quarter. in addition, in last year's fourth quarter we released incentive reserves of almost $7 million and given our performance this year, we will be accruing for incentive compensation. therefore, our fourth quarter will be a very difficult comparison. the outlook for free cash flow remains unchanged at $165 million to $175 million. we anticipate year-end net leverage will be down from last year. as always, we have included certain assumptions in our slide deck on page 13.
now let's move on to q&a where boris and i will be happy to take your questions. operator?
",2019-Q2,ACCO

operator
thank you [operator instruction] our first question comes from bill chappell with suntrust. your line is open.
bill chappell -- suntrust -- analyst
thanks, good morning.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, bill.
bill chappell -- suntrust -- analyst
hey, boris, can you talk a little bit more about the back-to-school season, just anything you can give us on kind of sell-through percentages versus sell-in growth that we see. and just was it more company-specific in terms of market share gains or just driven by a good overall kind of back-to-school season?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, bill, for the question. back-to-school was very strong. it's in fact, it's from a sell-through standpoint, it's the strongest that i remember at my time here. the sell-through was up approximately 5% for the season, the overall industry back-to-school was roughly flat. so clearly, we did better than average. and then when i look at the e-tails by customer, it was pretty broad, most of our customers grew in their sell-through with us. it was led by the five star brand. we had much better placement then last year and much stronger end user demand for our key products.
we had a couple of accounts that declined based on just they are -- time and place in the industry, and they are focused on private label, but the majority, and especially, the growing customers including major mass marketer, mass merchandiser and the e-tailers have grown. so the season was very, very strong. and then just to tie it into the sales, as neal mentioned, the sell-in -- a lot of that sell-in for that sell-through happened in q2, where we had 9% growth in q2, and then we got some replenishment in q3 with 3% growth. but the overall season was very, very strong with plus 5%.
bill chappell -- suntrust -- analyst
got it. and so with that in mind, there is -- the inventory levels are in good shape, you don't see a de-stock kind of as we go in fourth quarter or first quarter next year?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no. and that's a very important point. what we've seen actually over the last couple of years is an emphasis by our customers to exit the season clean. so they are trying to sell through more than they buy, because they hold some inventory going into the season. so yes, we feel that exiting the season we're in very, very good inventory shape.
bill chappell -- suntrust -- analyst
yeah. and then just switching quick to foroni, just help me understand it seems similar to the products you have with mead. i thought there was some option to kind of expand that internationally. so is this more of a different product line or is it more of just it was easier or faster to buy that, the leading player versus kind of move tangentially into the market?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no. it's a similar product line, and really the driver for the purchase is the brand. foroni is a very strong 100-year old brand in brazil with very strong consumer allegiance. they are number two player in the market, next to us. we are number one player in the market with tilibra. so this allows us to have number one and number two strongest back-to-school brands in brazil. we're going to continue to push them as two separate brands with separate lines and separate assortments, and we try to create some synergies in the back end.
bill chappell -- suntrust -- analyst
got it. and then last one from me. neal, you talked about incentive comp in the fourth quarter not being released, i just didn't fully understand, is that because you're not hitting your targets or is it because there was a bigger than normal release last year?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it was last year. last year we were not hitting our targets and we released significant incentive comp in the fourth quarter and this year we are anticipating not doing the same thing, i.e, we are anticipating hitting our targets.
bill chappell -- suntrust -- analyst
yeah. okay. so incentive release, i mean, last year there was a reversal. this year there is not, that's the way you think. perfect. okay. thanks so much.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, bill.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from william reuter with bank of america. your line is now open.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning. with regard to the mix of products, which i guess was a little bit dilutive to margins. i guess, can you talk about that, was it some of the new products that are not up to scale at this point in terms of units?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no. the mix was driven primarily by our heavier participation in private label this back-to-school season than last season. as we've talked before, we are fairly tactical with our private label strategy with bid on products, where we can make dollar gross profits and if it's a loss, we don't bid on it. so given all of the inflationary pressures this year and late last year and the tariffs, we participated in more opening price point private label business this back-to-school, which drove revenue, but also diluted our margin. so that's really the mix issue that we're talking about.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
that makes sense. do you think that there is a -- it sounds like if you hadn't participated in this, then your branded product sales would have been down a little bit or i guess they were down a little bit. do you think that there is a strategy from a lot of your customers to shift their mix of products that they offer more toward private label. and i guess, do you expect that to continue?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no. the branded product sales were actually up this season. so if i look at our growth in north america, it is roughly 60%-40%. 60% of that growth was driven by the branded products and may be 40% by incremental private label. so we've done well with branded products, and i mentioned five star which was the fastest growing brand during the back-to-school season of the top 10 brands.
as far as the private label strategy from our customers, as we've talked before, it's very customer-specific. given the change in ownership with a couple of our customers from public to private and private equity backed, there is a little bit of an increased push for private label from those specific customers. our strategy remains unchanged. private label today is around 7% of our global business. and then depending on the year, there'll be plus or minus a couple of points, as i mentioned, as we'll bid on profitable business and we will not participate in unprofitable business.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
all right. it sounds -- that makes sense. and then just lastly, i think when you had talked about list 4 tariffs, previously you mentioned, i think $28 million impact. i guess, how do you expect to contend with this next year? i guess, what do you expect the net impact of those list 4 tariffs is going to be? that's all from me. thanks.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think when you're talking about $28 million, bill, it's 2018 and 2019 combined and that also included inflation. if you look at tariffs, the number is small, it's roughly half of that and we anticipate roughly a similar impact that we saw in 2018 and 2019, with us anticipating in 2020, unless things change, and as you know, things can change on a daily basis when it comes to tariffs. right now, we plan to have price increases on january 1st to offset the tariffs that we know of that are coming on december 15th. obviously us is in negotiations with china. so some of that may change. and if it does change, we'll react to it. if the tariffs go down, we will reduce our pricing of our price increases and if the tariffs continue to go up, we will have to pass those increases through.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. so i guess what that would mean is that 2020 impact would be about $14 million, but more or less you expect to offset that with price, the tariffs are in place, they end up [phonetic] in the same spot on a margin basis?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
2020 is about half of that, it's about $6 million to $7 million in tariffs.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. all right. that's all from me. thank you.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
okay. thanks, bill.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of joe gomes with noble capital. your line is open.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
good morning.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, joe.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the e-tail segment? what kind of growth are you seeing there, what percent of overall revenues is e-tail now making up for the firm?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we track e-tail sales for us specifically, because that's where we get the sell through information and right now or in q2 -- sorry q3 e-tail was roughly 15%, 16% of the quarter. the growth was very strong. the growth is teen percent growth, e-tail continues to take share during the season, both for back-to-school and back-to-college. we have very broad participation in e-tail literally pretty much every sku that we make get sold through e-tail. there's nothing that today at least. they're not willing to carry. so it's a very successful channel for us. it's margin accretive for us, and we love e-tail and we continue to focus on it.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
great.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and it's a lot less developed internationally.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
okay. and i think switching gears for a second here, just kind of want to revisit australia, new zealand in the pelikan acquisition. that market has been under pressure here for our, at least for two years that i've been following the company here. are we getting close to a point, where we might have to start considering whether there is going to be write downs on this business?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i'll let neal answer that writedown question. i'll let him answer that question.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
not that we anticipate at the moment, joe.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
okay.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
just to give you additional color on australia, new zealand, joe. it has been a tough market. you're absolutely right, for the last couple of years, both because of a weakness in australian economy as well as industry specific issue, where you have both consolidation -- de-consolidation is happening on the part of a couple of commercial customers and those customers are reducing their footprint as well as just competitively and not doing well, and they're big customers and when they don't do well, obviously that affects our sales.
but the biggest impact we have felt in australia is on the legacy acco side, not on the pelikan, artline side. so legacy acco has historically participated more in trade products, not end user products and more in commodity categories, as opposed to well-known branded value added categories and that is the part that has suffered the most during the last couple of years, both private label that we historically made for our customers that they are choosing to source directly, as well as the some of the commodity categories, which are just declining. the pelikan, artline, a part which we have acquired, has done relatively well compared to the legacy acco part.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
okay. that's very informative. thank you. and then just one last one from me. if we looked at what the nine-month free cash flow number is, little over $50 million and looking for full year and the $165 million to $175 million, that suggests, it's -- call it a $110 million to be generated in the fourth quarter, and what is your, guys, early thoughts as to -- if that all happens as to how you would allocate that money in the quarter.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so firstly, joe. that's very consistent with the free cash flow generation that we had last year and normally see in the fourth quarter. so right to-date, our free cash flow is only $6 million lower than the prior year. and that's really all driven by paying higher taxes earlier this year, which we anticipated . so we're very confident on hitting our free cash flow target for the year. it's something that we put a lot of time and effort behind to make sure we achieve it. and it's driven by the seasonality of our business.
in terms of how we would deploy that cash, obviously we would continue with what we traditionally do in terms of deployment of cash. so year-to-date, we've spent a significant amount on stock repurchases and on dividends. we've obviously announced an increase in dividend. we have an ongoing stock repurchase program. but one of the big things that we would tend to do in the fourth quarter is pay down debt, because we then seasonally added again in q1 and q2. and so it's part of our cycle and it replenishes our ability to make future acquisitions.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
okay. great. thanks guys. appreciate the time.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, joe.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of chris mcginnis with sidoti & company. your line is open.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my questions.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, chris.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
actually i wanted [indecipherable) that keep on the -- our north american back-to-school, but was there anything specific around five star, was it new product introductions or market share gains that are in the sense of shelf space that helped drive some of them, that strong sales?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we launch new products with five star every year. there are new colors, new materials, new innovations that we introduce. it's literally thousands of skus for the back-to-school season. we've got great placement with major retailers this year. also last year, we introduced a new demand generation campaign focusing on the teens, which are the primary buyers of the five star brand and that campaign continued this year and obviously it resonated with the consumer. so it's all of those things combined that drove a very, very successful back-to-school season.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. thank you. and then just quickly if you could touch on trusens end-of-school [indecipherable) at the discount, where you've seen as you've launched in the first quarter?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. trusens is our air purifier brand we introduced it in february in the us, and then in q2 we started to roll out across the rest of the world. we are incredibly pleased with the ramp up, almost every week we are hitting new records in sell-through in the us, and we have -- we are very optimistic it's going to become a multi-million dollar brand for us. so far incredibly excited about the launch and the opportunity and we're going to be expanding that product line in the future.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions and good luck in q4.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you. thank you, chris.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of kevin steinke with barrington research. your line is now open.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
good morning.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hi.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
hello. so you mentioned that you're encouraged about initial read on the back-to-school season in brazil. and maybe if you could expand on a little bit more on what you're seeing there and then maybe in contrast, you mentioned back-to-school in mexico was a little disappointing. and maybe a little more color on the factors behind their performance?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. brazil continues to do extremely well for us. we had roughly 10% growth in q3 as we are just beginning to ramp up for back-to-school, and all the signals that we're seeing that back-to-school will be strong for us in brazil. so last year we had a very strong back-to-school. we're anticipating that to continue this year. obviously, we have to see what the sales are actually going to be, but going into the season we think we are very well setup.
as far as mexico is concerned, the back-to-school was disappointing, and it's really an economic condition in mexico. mexico saw a contraction in q2. we don't have the numbers on q3, but then q2 saw contraction from prior year. so the economy is not doing well. what we've heard from all the retailers is, that the back-to-school overall in mexico was very soft. and then we've done commensurately with how everybody else has done. so i'd say, it's definitely a more disappointing season in mexico that we're used to. back-to-school does not represent a huge part of our business in mexico. it's mostly drives our new acquisition, the barrilito acquisition. and it was a little bit softer than we had last year.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay. got it. and i believe, you said you expect international segment sales to be flat for the year. i believe that it's down from what you're expecting on the prior call, just in terms of growth, but is mexico a key factor there or any other factors that maybe change the outlook just a bit for international?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. mexico was down a little bit versus our prior expectations, and asia is down versus our prior expectations, both. strength in brazil is consistent with what we were expecting. and then australia, australia's performance is also consistent with our expectations. and it's really mexico and asia that declined our view of the fourth quarter as lower than we had before.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay. thanks. and then you mentioned europe softening economic environment there is what you're seeing, the impact you can find a certain -- countries or as you might expect like the uk or is it, you're seeing something more broad based there in terms of the economic impact?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's a little bit broader than the uk, our biggest country in europe is germany. and german economy has softened both in q2 and q3. and germany obviously is a big trading partner with the rest of europe. so it does affect several european countries. i mean, we're seeing some weakness also in eastern europe as well as countries that are in and around germany and uk. obviously with the brexit uncertainty was weak as well. so the economic softness in europe that we're seeing is broader than just one country.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay. thank you. and then lastly for me, just maybe talk a little bit more about the dividend increase and the thought process behind that and your view of a dividend policy going forward?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. as you know, kevin, we implemented our dividend in the beginning of last year, and over -- when we issued the initial dividend, we said that the strategy is to grow it over time prudently. we want to reward our long-term shareholders with a return. and when we looked at our future projections of cash flow we felt it was the time to increase the dividend. we've been repurchasing a lot of shares. so if you look from a total cash outlay, the gaap cash outlay per year that we projecting even with an increased dividend for the company is about the same as we paid in dividend in all of 2018. so it's not a increased portion of our cash flow. but on a per share basis, it's a nice 8.3% increase in dividend for our long-term shareholders.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay. great. thank you very much.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from hale holden with barclays. your line is open.
hale holden -- managing director
good morning.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hi, hale.
hale holden -- managing director
i have a couple of quick -- thank you. i had a couple of quick ones. you know following up on the european comments you just made, you also made in the text, you did some commentary around us corporate clients pulling back around uncertainty, and i understand you're not giving guidance, but in general, are you thinking a little bit more conservatively on the go forward given what you're seeing from europe and more specifically us corporate clients, commercial?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i think that's fair that we are a little bit more cautious when we look out forward. as neal mentioned in our prepared remarks, the us consumer continues to do well and we have not seen any weakness from the us consumer, but certainly outside of the us, and if you look at commercial or industrial customers, they are becoming more cautious. so yeah, i'd say our tone is a little bit more cautious when we look out to the future.
hale holden -- managing director
and then on the price increase that you are taking in january, i mean, have you -- i guess, socialize that and had additional discussions on it and or do you expect any pushback around it?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we have communicated the price increase or the intention of a price increase to all of our customers. we're working through the details now. there is pushback every time we do any kind of a price increase. so it's normal business commercial negotiations that we do with our customers. nothing unusual this time around.
hale holden -- managing director
and then my last question was, the commentary around leverage being down on a year-over-year basis at the end of the 2019, is that adjusted for the recent acquisition in brazil on the $50 million of financing there, is that including that?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
so on a reported or pro forma basis it should be lower than prior year.
hale holden -- managing director
perfect.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
the acquisition, that's significant in terms of its impact.
hale holden -- managing director
great. and you have to fund now with the revolver, right?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we did.
hale holden -- managing director
good. great, thank you so much. i appreciate it.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you. hale.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of karru martinson with jefferies. your line is now open.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning. in terms of the price increase on january 1st, is that going to -- is there a typically a pull forward of sales and perhaps a little bit of a depressant for the first quarter that we should be looking at?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
you know it depends, karru. historically i would have said, yes, but nowadays given what we've -- patterns that we've seen over the last couple of years, it depends. we have not seen that, for example, last year, when there was a very significant price increase in january. we have not seen any pull forward in december. so i can't really comment on that. we'll see when it happens.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. and realizing that the tariff backdrop can change on a day-to-day basis, where do we stand now on the alternate countries of supply, what's our exposure to china and where have me moved our manufacturing to?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. we've been very aggressive in trying to move our supply chain from china, where it makes financial sense. and it makes sense for most products, where we don't have tooling or just heavy capital investment in china. so a lot of our paper skus, we have been very aggressively moving to other south east asian countries or low-cost countries. some of our -- even some of our tooled products, we are moving to countries like taiwan.
so i expect that our foot print, manufacturing footprint in china will be significantly lower next year than it is this year and then it was past year. so we certainly are not waiting for the tariff policy to be clarified before we move our supply chain, and regardless these moves are semi permanent. i don't want to ever say, permanent, but even if the tariffs are repealed, we don't envision moving the manufacturing back to china, because cost in vietnam and taiwan are also becoming very, very competitive with china, given the inflationary increases that we've seen in china historically.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. and then in terms of the inflation, you talked about $14 million over the '18-'19 period. what's the outlook for raw material, and i would assume that's built into that january 1st price increase?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. outside of tariffs, the expectations for material inflations are fairly muted next year. we don't see the kind of inflation that we saw in '18, which was very, very high and then some of it bled over into '19 as well, especially into the first half of '19. so outside of tariffs, the inflation expectations are fairly muted and we are being fairly surgical with our price increases in the us to only increase prices and those products are exhibiting our increased costs.
outside of the us, the inflationary pressure is coming from the strength of the us dollar. so we are definitely going to be adjusting our local currency pricing in both emea, as well as in international countries to account for the fact that the us dollar is a lot stronger today than it was 12 months ago.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. thank you very much guys. i appreciate it.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of hamed khorsand. your line is open.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
hey, good morning. so first off, i just wanted to get an understanding of the push back you're seeing in europe. is that across the board? is there a specific area in europe that's creating the lower numbers for you.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
so there is a couple of things going in europe hamed. the primary reason is the economic weakness that i talked about, and that's pretty much across the all of emea. it centers around, germany and the uk. but as i mentioned, it's pretty much affects all of the emea. the other thing with emea is just compares versus prior year. last q3 europe grew over 3%. it was a very strong quarter a year ago and that was driven by gdpr and the launch of the shredders that we had in emea and there were two factors there. one is just increased shredding and focus on privacy coordinated with the gdpr launch, as well as just the channel fill. because a lot of our customers were carrying shredders for the first time. so it drove us very significant increase in shredders last year. this year, the stapler [phonetic] is going well and the sales are going well. but from a year-to-year comparison perspective, the sales of shredders are down, and that's another contributor to the 2.3% decline in emea this quarter.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
okay. and then in the us, you were talking about your commercial customers being a little bit cautious. are those the same customers you were targeting as far as getting them as a direct customer?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no. i am talking about the big contract stationers and the commercial arms or office product superstores. the independents, the small independents that were trying to buy from us direct continue to do well.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
and then with these commercial customers, do you have insight into if there's too much channel inventory out there?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i don't believe there is more -- there is a lot of inventory, but they are just buying less, because they are preparing for the future. so when you look at competitive channel dynamics everybody is trying to compete with the most efficient resellers and the most efficient resellers carry very little inventory. so we see that our historical legacy customers in trying to compete with these modern efficient resellers try to carry just-in-time inventory and when they think the demand is going to be down in the future, they reduced their purchasing.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the third quarter 2019 acco brand's earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speakers, christine hanneman. please go ahead ma'am.
christine hanneman -- senior director of investor relations
good morning. this is christine hanneman, senior director of investor relations. welcome to acco brands third quarter 2019 conference call. speaking on the call today are boris elisman, chairman, president and chief executive officer of acco brands corporation; and neal fenwick, executive vice president and chief financial officer. slides that accompany this call have been posted to the investor relations section of accobrands.com.
when speaking about quarterly results, we may refer to adjusted results. adjusted results exclude transaction, integration and restructuring costs and reflect an adjusted tax rate. schedules of adjusted results and other non-gaap financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures are in the earnings release and the slides that accompany this call. due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts, we do not reconcile our forward-looking adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow, net leverage ratio or adjusted tax rate guidance.
forward-looking statements made during the call are based on certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results could differ materially. please refer to our earnings release and sec filings for an explanation of certain of these risk factors and assumptions. our forward-looking statements are made as of today and we assume no obligation to update them going forward. following our prepared remarks, we will hold a q&a session.
now i will turn the call over to boris elisman.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, everyone. and thank you for joining us. i will spend the next few minutes reviewing the highlights of the quarter and commenting on the progress we are making against our strategic imperatives. neal will follow me with more color and details on the quarter and then we'll take your questions.
we reported good third quarter sales and adjusted eps, achieving our objectives for the quarter and building on our strong performance of the first half. third quarter sales were even with last year and organic sales were up 0.5% due to an outstanding back-to-school performance in north america. our north america sales were up over 3% on top of a 9% growth in the second quarter. as we noted last quarter we had very strong back-to-school sell in. the actual consumer sales, which take place in the third quarter, and are the ultimate measure of the success of the back-to-school season, were also very strong. our sales grew mid single-digits for the season, a strong improvement over last year's 2% growth. based on preliminary industry information, overall back-to-school sales were roughly flat that we believe we took share. our market share growth was led by the five star brand, which was the second largest national back-to-school brand in the us, and has the highest growth rate of the top 10 brands during the season.
another highlight of the quarter was our working capital management and cash generation. we entered the quarter with high inventories due to strategic pre buys associated with raw material shortages, anticipated increases in us tariffs on chinese imports, and strong third quarter forecasts from our north america sales teams. because of good north america sales and excellent global working capital management we reduced working capital $141 million sequentially and $20 million versus the same quarter last year.
we set a quarterly record with $183 million of free cash flow generation. we feel confident in our ability to reach our target free cash flow range for the year and to grow our free cash flow over the long term. overall, i am very pleased with our performance year-to-date. our results continue to show that our strategies are working.
now i would like to give you an update on our progress against the six strategic imperatives that we've been working over the past few years to drive profitable growth and increased shareholder value. we discussed the strategic objectives last quarter and they include diversifying our geographies and channels, focusing on the end consumer, developing products with end user driven innovation, reducing unnecessary costs, executing with excellence and disciplined capital allocation.
during the quarter, we purchased foroni, a leading provider of notebooks and school and office products in brazil. foroni expands our presence in the attractive brazilian market and in faster growing school categories. we now have two leading school product brands in brazil. the acquisition also further diversifies our customer base. the integration is going well and we expect foroni to add $35 million to sales and be marginally accretive to eps this year. foroni is our fourth meaningful acquisition in four years, as we are successfully reorienting our portfolio of brands, channels and geographies to grow faster and with better margins.
slides 6 and 7 in our deck gives you details on foroni and the other three acquisitions. we will continue to look for additional acquisitions that will provide growth in geographic or category expansion at a reasonable price.
last time we spoke about end user driven product innovation, and i mentioned several product ranges that we introduced in 2019. these products include air purifiers, an automatic laminator, a docking station for the microsoft surface pro and high-end shredders. in the first nine months, we have generated over $7 million in sales for these new products and we're just beginning to ramp up.
moving onto our productivity initiative, we will continue to generate substantial savings from our programs. each year, we target approximately $30 million in productivity improvements, and in the third quarter, we're on track to deliver close to $40 million in savings, most of which have been reinvested in the business.
finally, an update on capital allocation. neal will go through the specifics, but in the quarter we significantly reduced our debt and continued with share repurchases. yesterday, our board of directors approved an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.065 cents per share. the increase is payable effective in the fourth quarter.
with that i will turn the call over to neal for a review of the segments, guidance and other financial commentary. and then, i'll join him in answering your questions. neal?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, boris. good morning, everyone. before i move to the quarterly results, i would like to start with a perspective on the north america back-to-school season, which covers both the second and third quarters. taken as an entire season, we did well. as boris already mentioned, second quarter sales rose 9% and third quarter sales rose 3% with our eps change following the sales pattern. in total, the second quarter and the third quarter eps are $0.02 over prior year. the third quarter is down $0.02, with the second quarter up $0.04 reflecting the relative share of back-to-school shift in each quarter respectively. this is a continuation of the trend seen last year with the second quarter now the stronger quarter for back-to-school.
moving now to our third quarter. comparable sales increased slightly based on solid growth in north america. adjusted net income of $31 million or $0.32 per share was down from $36 million or $0.34 last year. the decline was from lower gross margins in emea and international. our gross margin was 30.8%, down almost 2 percentage point as we had an unfavorable product mix in most areas, cost inflation in our international businesses from adverse foreign exchange and experienced lower cost absorption as we reduced inventory.
sg&a expenses as a percent of sales increased to 19.1% from 18.3%, the increase was relating to higher management incentive expenses based on better performance this year versus last year when we were releasing accruals. in addition, information technology spending increased from our building out of sap in north america.
reported operating income decreased to $49 million from $58 million and operating margin declined to 9.6% from 11.3% last year. on a reported and adjusted basis, operating income decreased due to the lower gross profit and higher sg&a expenses from the factors i just mentioned.
our adjusted tax rate was 27.4% in the quarter as we change certain tax assumptions to reflect the change in our geographic earnings, stronger in the us and weaker in emea and international. for the full year we now expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 29% to 30%.
now, let's turn to some details of our segment results. net sales in north america rose 3% with pricing offsetting input inflation, tariffs and lower volume. back-to-school sell-through was strong and sales growth continued with the kensington brand on the strength of new products. we saw a strong growth with many customers in the e-tail and mass merchant channels, but also had declines with some customers. on balance, it was an excellent back-to-school season.
north america operating margin decreased slightly to 12.4% from 12.8%, driven by lower cost absorption as we reduced inventory and a slightly unfavorable product mix. for the full year we now expect north america sales to be slightly up versus last year.
in emea, sales decreased 7%, currency translation reduced sales approximately $7 million or 5%, worse than anticipated. comparable sales decreased 2%, primarily because of a softening economic environment. emea adjusted operating income of $14 million declined 17% due to lower volume and higher input costs, largely due to weakness of the euro and uk pound which increases the cost of us dollar sourced products that we purchased in asia. gross profit and gross profit margin also negatively impacted by an adverse sales mix and lower cost absorption, also due to reducing inventory levels as well as lower sales. on a comparable basis, we expect emea sales to be flat for the full year.
moving to the international segment, comparable sales decreased almost 4%, the foroni acquisition added approximately $6 million in august and september. australia and asia continue to be difficult markets and mexico, on a comparable basis, is now flat year-to-date, as our third quarter back-to-school performance there was disappointing. brazil continue to grow and is well positioned going into the start of its back-to-school season. international operating income declined on both the reported and adjusted basis from inflationary cost increases and lower volume, and exiting a commodity business in asia. foroni did not impact operating income for the segment in the third quarter. going forward, we anticipate continuing good performance in brazil as the fourth quarter is typically their strongest quarter and that should also be seasonally true for foroni. we anticipate challenges in australia and asia will continue. overall, we expect international sales to be flat on a comparable basis for the full year.
let's move now to our balance sheet and cash flow. as we noted on our last call, we were pleased that our high inventory levels projected on the north america back-to-school margins, but our early purchases shifted the seasonality of cash flow. in the third quarter, we generated a record quarterly free cash flow of $183 million as we collected receivables on sales of inventory that had already been paid for earlier in the year. we have almost closed the gap with last year's nine months free cash flow, and we believe we are back to our normal seasonal pattern.
during the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares for a net $16 million, and paid $6 million in dividends. year-to-date, we have repurchased 7.5 million shares for $58 million and paid $18 million in dividends. more significantly, we repaid $174 million of seasonal borrowings. at quarter end, our pro forma bank net leverage ratio was 2.9 times. as mentioned earlier, we closed on the foroni acquisition in the third quarter. this cost $42 million in cash, plus $8 million of acquired debt, and we expect to have a need for $7 million in additional seasonal working capital for this business.
now let's turn to our outlook. we are updating our outlook for 2019 to include the foroni acquisition, as well as the impact of a lower tax rate and adverse foreign exchange, which has become a stronger headwind as we saw in the third quarter. we estimate that sales will be flat to up 1%, including a 3% adverse foreign currency effect.
our outlook for eps for the year is in a range of $1.15 to $1.20, which includes $0.04 negative impact of foreign exchange, $0.03 year-to-date and another $0.01 expected in the fourth quarter. this is $0.01 worse than we anticipated when we gave our original outlook in february.
the us consumer channels still appear to be doing well for us. but our us commercial customers and the rest of the world are becoming more cautious. in addition, in last year's fourth quarter, we released additional incentive compensation accruals of almost $7 million. given our forecast, performance this year, we do not anticipate releasing incentive compensation in the fourth quarter. the outlook for free cash flow remains unchanged at $165 to $175 million. we anticipate year-end net bank leverage will be down from last year. we have included certain modeling assumptions in our slide deck, on page 13.
now let's move on to q&a, where boris and i will be happy to take your question. operator?

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from brad thomas with keybanc capital markets. your line is now open.
bradley thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi, good morning, boris and neal, and congratulations on a strong fourth quarter and a strong year.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, brad.
bradley thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
i wanted to ask a couple of questions. first, i was hoping maybe for a little bit more color as we think about some of these margin puts and takes. and i recognize that it's not easy to figure them all out across your different channels and countries that you're in. but as we think about pricing and tariffs being behind us, as well as some of the cost opportunities that you still have ahead, how are you thinking about some of those margin puts and takes for 2020, as we think about it on an annual basis?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
if you look at the gross margins, they should be up a little bit just due to the tariff and inflation pressures largely behind us. we will have some inflationary pressures from currency because u.s. dollar is definitely stronger now than it was on average in 2019. we have increased prices in our international regions on january 1st. so, hopefully, we will mitigate the dollar weakness. but it has been getting stronger, dollar strength, it has been getting stronger. so there will be that additional inflationary pressure. but with all of that, i do expect gross margins to be higher in 2020 and sg&a should be a little bit higher as well because as neal mentioned, we have $14 million in incremental incentives to absorb.
so, even though we do have a restructuring program in place and we will continue to drive on productivity, it probably will be a little bit higher as well. so, if i look from a operating margin standpoint, it should be roughly similar to what we saw in 2019. but we do expect less interest, significantly less interest in 2020 than 2019. and we expect fewer outstanding shares as well, so that will drive eps accretion in 2020.
bradley thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
it's very helpful, boris. and if i could follow-up on how you all are thinking about the u.s. channel. it seems to me that the u.s. consumer is relatively healthy. clearly, some of the retailers that you're partnered with on the mass side have had some nice momentum. on the other hand, the office superstores continued to shrink. how are you feeling about the setup here for 2020 in the u.s.?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's likely to follow a similar pattern, brad. we've seen that now for several years and that's why our q1 and q4 are relatively weak because we are more dependent on those channels. and q2 and q3 are relatively strong as long as we perform well in back-to-school, which we've done over the last few years. so, things are kind of going the same way. i'm very confident in our team, i'm very confident in our ability to manage all of this puts and takes. but the situation on the ground, i don't think we'll be any different.
bradley thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
that's very helpful. and if i could squeeze in one more on sort of a topic de jour. as you all assess some of the sourcing that you do from china, can you give us an update on, if you're seeing any issues or expecting issues given the coronavirus?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, i'm sure you recognize it's a very dynamic situation. there is new information that comes in daily and weekly. we don't sell in china. so, the virus outbreak will have no impact on the sell side for us. but as you mentioned, some of our products are manufactured in china. we have not had any supply disruptions to date due to the coronavirus.
typically, we pre-buy additional inventory ahead of the chinese new year, which lasts us for the period of normal factory shutdowns. this year, the shutdowns were one week longer than usual. but now the factories have opened and workers are coming back to work. however, we believe the ramp-up period to get to the normal production output will take longer than usual.
luckily, we are entering our slow selling season from now through april and we're expediting some shipments out of china to make sure that we continue to save the stock.
our north american sales start ramping up for back-to-school in may. about 20% of our u.s. back to school products are manufactured in china. based on all the information we have today and our projections for customer needs and ramp-ups, et cetera, we expect to have good supply for bts. but as i said at the very beginning, the situation is dynamic and this may change.
bradley thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thank you so much and congratulations again.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, brad.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from kevin steinke with barrington research. your line is now open.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
good morning.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, kevin.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
hey, i wondered if you could touch a little bit more on the new product introductions that you mentioned in terms of the shredders and other, the other things you're expanding into. i think what -- can you give us a sense for the size of those in terms of revenue in 2019? and what's the outlook for new product introductions in 2020? will you accelerate that pace or will it stay about the same?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks. thanks for the question, kevin. we've launched several very exciting product lines in 2019. the ones i mentioned are the halo products, the ones that are of significant value-add. and that's trusens, that's the gbc foton 30, that's the kensington notebook dock, and the line of manual shredders under the leitz and rexel brands.
they were launched throughout 2019 and were very successful. we recognized revenue of around $13 million from those products through the partial year of 2019. many of them are still ramping up, because we are introducing them on a global basis. they're nice margin products, so we're very, very pleased with our innovations.
this will continue to expand in 2020. we introduce thousands of new products every year, most of them are seasonal, that are either for back-to-school or back-to-business. but we will continue to introduce these halo products and i expect certainly all of the four lines that i mentioned in terms of air purifiers, automatic laminator, shredders, and notebook docks continue to expand in 2020.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay. that sounds great. and you continue to be really consistent with productivity improvements from year-to-year. it sounds like you're targeting more productivity gains in 2020. can you just kind of give us a sense as to some of the areas where you expect to get those productivity gains and maybe is it still $30 million kind of the ballpark range to think about for this year?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, i think $30 million is a good number to think about. this last year we delivered about $40 million. some of that was driven from the last year, the last full year of the integration initiatives between acco brands and a sell-day. that explains the additional incremental roughly $10 million. this year we're shooting for around $30 million or so, and its thousands of projects that are targeting both cost of goods, logistics, distribution centers, as well as all of the general and administrative functions.
we are also rolling out a -- or consolidating on a single erp in north america in april. and that should enable some additional productivity improvements in the second half of the year. but we don't expect something in the summer. but as that ramps up, we should get incremental productivity improvements in the second half.
this is something that we live with and do every year. it's a focus of every organization. we are a low growth business. so, for us, really, squeezing efficiency out of our operations is really important in order to drive improved profitability. so, we're very focused on that.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
great. you mentioned the erp implementation. you haven't called anything out about it before. but is there any meaningful incremental implementation cost in '19 from that effort that would go away?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no, over the last few years, we've been -- our capital expense been in the $32 million to $34 million range, which is up from around $25 million or so or that we were spending before the last couple of years. that incremental capital has gone into our erp planning and development.
we've talked several times, whenever we give guidance, we're going to be around $35 million, which would include all of our capital needs. so, that was part of it. the guidance that we provided today includes what we are planning to spend on the erp. as we get closer to it, when i give you guys an update after q1, i'll have more visibility about quarterly impacts, because i do anticipate there may be some shifts from q2 into q1. but right now, it's just too early to tell.
so, since we don't give quarterly guidance, we give annual guidance, it doesn't change our outlook for the year. but there could be color within quarters that we will provide you when we speak to you in april.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay, good. and then lastly, maybe an update on australia in terms of the headwinds from customer consolidation that you've been experiencing there. are we may be getting toward the end of that or is that kind of expected to be a continued headwind as we move through 2020?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i certainly expect sales pressures to continue. there is a large customer there that's consolidating. i do expect us to do less business with that customer. and given that they're fairly large, it's difficult for australia to grow if that customer is shrinking.
we are managing australia for improved profitability. australia has taken a few restructuring actions last year and we have a good plan in 2020 to improve our profitability. so, i expect australia to have a better year in 2020, but a better year for me is slightly lower sales and improved profitability.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay. thanks for taking all the questions.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, kevin.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from joe gomes with noble capital. your line is now open.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
good morning.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, joe.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
so, just real quick on north america. i know the overall year looks really good, but the fourth quarter sales were down after two really good strong quarters, the second and third. i was just wondering if you could provide a little more detail and color, what was going on in north america in the fourth quarter and how you guys were responding to that?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure, joe. this is something that we expect every year. as i mentioned on my previous answer, north america is really driven by q2 and q3, because the healthier channels, which are the mass and the e-tail channels are more prevalent and represent a higher mix in the second and third quarters.
in q1 and q4, it's less back-to-school and it's more back-to-business. and there, the share of the business that is driven by more challenged resellers is higher. so, therefore, it has an impact on our business. again, this is something that's normal, we plan for that.
overall, north america was up 3%, which is great, but it's really driven by the success in q2 and q3 and our increased share during back-to-school.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
okay, thanks for that color. and on the, your remarks, when you're talking about channel, you noted that the dollar store channel has declined. and i know, a while back you guys had some positive hope for that channel. i was just wondering what's going on there and where do you see that channel going?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we continue to experiment with the dollar channel. we were pretty aggressive with them in 2018, saw incremental sales, but unacceptable profitability for us. so, we pulled back in 2019 to try to strike a better balance between revenue growth and profitability. and we saw less revenue, but certainly improved profitability in 2019. it continues to be an important channel for us, but we have to get it right. we have to be able to drive profitable sales through that channel.
i think we have a better view on how to do that. i expect that we will have incremental sales through the dollar stores in 2020, but it's not going to be huge, a huge share of our business. it's a nice complement to our overall portfolio. but striking that balance between sales and profitability is important to us.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
okay, thanks on that. and then you also mentioned that you guys have taken some price increases in the international markets. and just wondering -- and due to the strength of the dollar, how does that price your guys products versus some of your competitors? and is that delta getting to a level where there might be some additional trade off in product?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we compete against local competition all the time. so, certainly, the competitive environment is part of our consideration. we look at pricing. we -- past pricing on products that are manufactured in asia and costed in u.s. dollars, that affects most of our competitors as well. so, they have to do similar pricing to us. all of our locally produced products, we price differently because we don't have the same currency inflation going through them. so, it certainly is part of the consideration and our teams, our local teams review that to make sure that in the market, at the end of the day, we are competitive, we can sell, we have a good value proposition to both our customers and the consumers.
so, i feel comfortable where we are throughout the year. if we need to adjust things either up or down, we do that both based on cost of inflation, as well as market conditions.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
okay, thanks for the insight on that. one last one from me real quick. what is the remaining authorization of the stock buyback program?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
neal, do you have that number?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
top of my head, it's north of $100 million. i don't remember off the top of my head the exact number, joe.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well follow-up with you, joe. we have enough, certainly, for this year.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
right. okay. great, thanks guys. appreciate it.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, joe.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from bill chappell with suntrust. your line is now open.
bill chappell -- suntrust -- analyst
thanks, good morning.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, bill.
bill chappell -- suntrust -- analyst
just starting on the top line outlook for north america and then for europe. on north america, i think you said possibly goes backwards. is that all on, i mean, it could be flat to down, is that all on just the roll-off on price or do you expect volume to be flat to down?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i certainly expect volume to be down. price should be up a little bit. overall, i mean, we had a great, great year in 2019 with north america. i expect the back-to-school to be roughly similar. but then, in q1 and q4, i do expect some fall off, again, driven by the decline and more challenge with more challenged resellers. so, i just expect it to be -- we expect it to be slightly down versus our superb year of 2019.
bill chappell -- suntrust -- analyst
and then on europe, is it -- currency is included in that or you expect sales to be just flat as is and then currency? and i guess, anything you can give us on would be helpful.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no, that's right. comparable sales to be roughly flat and then currency will certainly take them down a little bit.
bill chappell -- suntrust -- analyst
okay. and then last one, i guess -- help me understand the $14 million of increased normalized comp in 2020. just coming off of what you're saying is a very good year, i didn't realize or didn't understand. maybe if accruals stopped sometime in 2019 and why they weren't fully paid out and then why there's such a big jump? because i guess it's about $0.10 to eps headwind on variable comp or on normalized comp in 2020. so, maybe a little more color there would be helpful.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, it's unfortunate dilemma, bill. we did have a great year, but some of our incentive objectives were not met during 2019. so, hence, we did not earn our target bonus. so, for 2020, as we plan 2020, we are assuming to earn that in 2020, and that's the $14 million. most of that is driven by annual incentives that were not meant for 2019. so, it's unfortunate, but that's a fact. that's where we are.
bill chappell -- suntrust -- analyst
well, i guess i'm just trying to understand, i mean, you had a 1% overall growth or almost 1% organic growth in '19. you're looking for flat to that, roughly that in 2020. maybe help me understand where you would have missed or where you fell below your expectations?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, if you look at the year, bill, it was fairly uneven between regions, right? so, the overall company is the consolidation of all the regions. north america certainly did better and international or emea. so, emea and international have not met many of their objectives for 2019, which rolls into the enterprise.
and then the other one that we missed, even though we certainly met our free cash flow objectives, that is not a metric in our annual plan. our annual incentives are based on working capital efficiency and we set ourselves a pretty high goal in 2019. and we haven't met that as an enterprise as well, that's about 20% of our total annual incentive. so, as a company, we haven't met that either.
so, it's more of a, i think, a goal setting issue other than a company performance issue. because i think we can all recognize that we did as an enterprise, very well in 2019, but goal setting is a challenge. we do that early in the year when we don't have visibility to the full year. and unfortunately, we haven't met some of our short-term targets in 2019 that hopefully we will get a chance to meet in 2020.
bill chappell -- suntrust -- analyst
okay, i'll leave it at that. thanks so much.

thank you. our next question comes from william reuter with bank of america. your line is now open.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, bill.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, previously you had said that the impact of tariffs in 2020 was going to be $7 million. is that still the number that you expect or has list 4 and 4a decreased in percentage, lowered that number?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's going to be a little bit lower than that. because -- exactly, because the 4b is no longer there and 4a is down from 15% to 7.5%. so, will be a little bit lower than that.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. and then earlier you mentioned that you expected a little bit of gross margin expansion based upon some price increases that would more than offset the tariffs. will this be evenly spread throughout the year? or based upon the timing of implementation of those and tariffs, will we see a little pressure in the beginning of the year that will be offset by expansion later on?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, the gross margin expansion is driven really by international and productivity. there is not going to be so much due to two tariffs anniversarying. and i don't want to provide any color by quarter, bill, because it's so difficult to predict. so, i think, overall, for the year, we're looking at little bit of an expansion, but exactly where it's going to come throughout the year, it's hard to tell.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. and then just lastly, you're near your target leverage ratio. i guess, as you look at the m&a pipeline at this point, how do you view it? do you think you'll be active during 2020? do you think valuations are attractive at these points?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
bill, it's -- anything has to do with acquisitions is very difficult to predict. i can't really comment anything more specifically. acquisitions are core to our strategy. we like what we've done and we like the incremental results that we've delivered to our shareholders due to acquisitions. but we are patient and prudent buyers. we want to make sure that we don't overpay. whether something is going to happen in 2020? i don't know, i can't tell you that.
william reuter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
all right. thank you very much.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, bill.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from hale holden with barclays. your line is now open.
hale holden -- barclays -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking the call. i was wondering -- just to follow up on bill's tariff question. the commentary that 4a, when you step down in, i guess, in the second quarter for pricing, when you give that back or adjust back for your -- with your customers, is that sort of one-to-one on margins, or is there a lag time on how that works? and it sounds like 7.5% of just the 20% from china is a relatively small topline number. i just want to make sure i have the thinking correctly.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, i think you have to understand -- first of all, the actual tariff reduction didn't happen until february. and then we have to work it through our purchase inventory cycle. and so, that's the lag to me. and we do that in the same way when we raise prices. when tariffs go up, we don't raise prices straight away. there's a 3-month lag. and so, we try and match our cost with our selling price. that's fundamentally what we're trying to do. it'll be margin neutral.
hale holden -- barclays -- analyst
okay, great. thank you. and then the only other question i had was, i just was wondering if you could give us sort of an update on what you were seeing in emea, one of the few regions you haven't talked about in the call yet in detail.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
emea had, overall, a good year in 2019. it came on the back of a record year in 2018. we had really a phenomenal year. so, as neal mentioned, we had similar sales, comparable sales to 2018. we were hurt by currency in emea sales and actual u.s. dollars were down 6% because of currency. and then emea had a kind of an unusual year. we had a strong q1, relatively weak q2 and q3 and then a strong q4.
so, we expect a flat business in emea. we have a very strong business there, but the economies, they are slowing down a little bit. so, we don't have expectations for more significant growth in emea in 2020.
hale holden -- barclays -- analyst
there's no shredder impact '19 to '20, like it was from '18 to '19, right?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
that's right. the shred, the privacy laws in europe came out in the second quarter of '18. so, you saw a surge in sales in q2 and q3. and that's what made such a difficult comp in '19.
hale holden -- barclays -- analyst
great, thank you so much. appreciate it.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, hale.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from karru martinson with jefferies. your line is now open.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning. just on for back-to-school, u.s. superstores continue to shrink and consolidate. where do you see that u.s. consumer going? where are the channels of growth that you're seeing?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
superstores are very, very small for back-to-school. back-to-school is really made by three primary players and that's walmart, target and amazon. and that's really has been the case for the last couple of years. and i expect that to continue to be the case. we are very strong with all three of them. they drive back-to-school. that's the reason why we were successful last few years. and again, my expectations that this will continue.
superstores are a bigger player on the business side in q1 and q4, but really marginal for back-to-school.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. and then on the business side, are you seeing expansion from other players or is it still being dominated by staples and office depot?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
on the back the business side, amazon is certainly making inroads, especially with small and medium business. and independents [phonetic] are doing a great job. so, over the last few years, we've seen independents take share on the business side. they are focused on that, the small and medium customer and they do a great job servicing those customers.
so, one of the reasons we did well in 2019 in north america is because independents have done well in north america in 2019. so, that channel is certainly something that we support and pay attention to and we expect further growth from.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
okay, thank you very much. appreciate it guys.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, karru.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from hamed khorsand with bws financial. your line is now open.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
hi, good morning. so, first question i had was, what are your capital allocation plans for 2020? because your presentation slides assumes very small, almost zero share buybacks.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, we don't, we don't really forecast share buybacks in our future plans, hamed. so, you know the history, we purchased $75 million in 2018 and $65 million in 2019. we certainly have the free cash flow to do more in 2020. but exactly how and when, we don't give guidance on that.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
okay. and then is there any indication that you're going to do more of the store brand sales this year?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
can you elaborate a little bit, what do you mean by store brand? oh, private label? got it.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
yes, the private label.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
got it. private label is about 6% or 7% of our sales. we will continue to do private label. i expect that to be a little bit less in 2020 than in 2019. in 2019, we won some incremental private label business, seasonal private label business for back-to-school, which i don't expect to repeat. but other than that, the steady state private label business, i expect it has to continue to participate. but it will be in that 6% range. it shouldn't be higher or significantly lower than that.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
are you assuming some of your input costs stay the same even though there has been some deflationary pressures lately?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we certainly work very hard on it to capture all of the savings from lower input costs. and whatever we can achieve and consolidate, we will take into either incremental profit or into our demand-generation programs. as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, the $40 million of productivity that we achieved in 2019, most of that we reinvest back in the business to drive demand. i mean, it's really important for us to continue to feature our brands, to continue to feature our products. so, we will capture the lower input costs, but a lot of that will go back and drive demand.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
do remember another thing.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
okay.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
at the end of 2018, we forward bought an awful lot of inventory to avoid tariff cost increases. that obviously can't be done again. and so, in 2020, what we've had to do is either work on resourcing those items to different areas or we will be receiving cost increases.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. thank you.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, hamed.

thank you. and i'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. i'd like to turn the call back to boris elisman, any closing remarks.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the 4q and full year 2019 acco brands corp earnings conference call. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. after the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, ms. christine hanneman. thank you. please go ahead.
christine hanneman -- senior director of investor relations
good morning. this is christine hanneman, senior director of investor relations. welcome to acco brands fourth quarter and full year 2019 conference call. speaking on the call today are boris elisman, chairman, president and chief executive officer of acco brands corporation; and neal fenwick, executive vice president and chief financial officer. slides that accompany this call have been posted to the investor relations section of accobrands.com.
when speaking about our results, we may refer to adjusted results. adjusted results exclude transaction, integration and restructuring costs and reflect an adjusted tax rate. schedules of adjusted results and other non-gaap financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures are in the earnings release and slides that accompany this call.
due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts, we do not reconcile our forward-looking adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow, net leverage ratio or adjusted tax rate guidance. forward-looking statements made during the call are based on certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results could differ materially. please refer to our earnings release and sec filings for an explanation of certain of these risk factors and assumptions. our forward-looking statements are made as of today and we assume no obligation to update them going forward.
following our prepared remarks, we will hold a q&a session.
now, i will turn the call over to boris elisman.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us. i will spend the next few minutes reviewing the highlights of the 2019 results and commenting on the progress we're making against some of our strategic imperatives. neal will follow me with more color and details on the full year and fourth quarter, and then we'll take your questions.
i'm very pleased to say that we reported a record year in 2019 for net sales, which rose 1% to $1.96 billion. our adjusted earnings per share were also a record, rising 5% to $1.20. and free cash flow increased $11 million to $172 million, our second highest ever, allowing us to return $89 million to our shareholders, $65 million from share repurchase program and $24 million in dividend payments.
in addition, we reduced our debt $71 million and brought our net leverage ratio down to 2.7 times. much of our success in 2019 was due to the strength and resilience of our geographically balanced business and our nimble responses to rapidly changing market conditions, as we faced inflation from input costs, multiple rounds of tariffs and changing circumstances with channels and customers.
we addressed the higher cost of commodities, logistics and tariffs in a few different ways. first, we pre-brought some of the 2019 inventory in the fourth quarter of 2018. that inventory was already priced for 2019 back-to-school shipments to our customers. we leveraged our balance sheet to avoid some of the impacts from tariffs and successfully brought down those high inventory levels as we sold through the goods in the second and third quarters of 2019.
we also took several price increases throughout the year to offset inflation and tariffs. our pricing lagged the cost increases by approximately one quarter, but we successfully implemented what we needed to offset the higher cost.
finally, we worked during the year to move a sizable part of our supply chain out of china and into vietnam and taiwan. it is very difficult to operate under continually changing external circumstances such as the ones we faced in 2019. and i would like to thank all of our employees whose hard work and diligence allowed us to overcome these challenges and post excellent results.
to further strengthen our business, last august, we purchased foroni, a leading provider of branding notebooks and school and office products in brazil. foroni is the second-largest player in the market after tilibra, which we already own. as a result, we are now a very significant participant in this growing product area in brazil.
the fourth quarter is the largest and most important quarter for us in brazil because of compasses shipments for the back-to-school season, as well as calendars and other data products.
both businesses in brazil performed well, with tilibra growing at 5% in the fourth quarter and foroni delivering better than expected profitability. foroni is our fourth strategic acquisition in 4 years as we continue to focus and rebalancing our portfolio of brands, channels and geographies, to achieve faster and more profitable growth. we will look for additional acquisitions that will provide profitable growth and geographic or category expansion at a reasonable price.
another critical component of our success in 2019 was our outstanding back-to-school performance in the u.s. our five star brand led the way, allowing us to grow mid-single digits and take share in a flat market. the new product ranges introduced in 2019, such as trusens air purifiers, the gbc automatic laminator, kensington docking station for the microsoft surface pro and a full line of leitz and rexel manual shredders, continued to perform very well as the year progressed.
we will continue to focus on growing these lines and enhancing them and other categories with additional innovations in 2020.
moving to our productivity initiatives. we'll continue to generate substantial savings from our programs. each year we target approximately $30 million in productivity improvements. in 2019, we achieved more than $40 million in productivity and integration savings. we have reinvested much of that into our business. i expect another year of solid productivity improvement in 2020.
overall, i'm very happy with our results. our full year performance manifests the fact that our strategy of focusing on growing channels, strong brands, innovative products and productivity improvements, complemented by accretive acquisitions and excellent execution is working.
looking at 2020, our guidance reflects the fact that we expect the environment to continue to be challenging, but we are looking for improved profitability and strong free cash flow.
with that, i will turn the call over to neal, for a review of segments, our outlook and other financial commentary. and then, i'll join him in answering your questions. neal?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, boris, and good morning, everyone. i'm going to focus largely on our full year results. for 2019, comparable sales increased almost 1% based on solid performance in north america. as boris mentioned, it was critical that we raise prices throughout the year to offset higher input costs, including several rounds of tariff increases on chinese imports.
we were successful in doing so, and that is reflected in posting an increase for the full year in both reported net sales and comparable sales. this is the best growth in comparable sales that we've had in a decade. adjusted net income of $122 million was even with 2018. adjusted eps was $1.20 versus $1.14 in 2018. having deployed $65 million of our free cash flow to share repurchases, we benefited from fewer shares outstanding.
our gross margin was 32.4%, a bit above 2018s level. sg&a expenses as a percent of sales decreased slightly to 19.9% from 20.2%. we incurred $5.6 million of higher annual incentive expenses based on our performance in 2019. in 2018, very limited incentives were out.
reported operating income increased to $196 million from $187 million and operating margin rose to 10% from 9.6% in 2018. on a reported and adjusted basis, operating income increased due to acquisitions by a net pricing and cost savings, partially offset by higher incentive accruals.
our adjusted tax rate of 30.5% was higher than we estimated, as the various impacts from u.s. tax reform and, in particular, the areas related to the impact of our foreign earnings have proven more difficult to forecast. and those non-u.s. earnings have triggered higher u.s. taxes. for 2020, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be similar to the 2019 rate.
now, let's turn to some details of our segment results. net sales in north america rose 3% with higher prices offsetting higher input costs including tariffs and lower volume. our back-to-school season was strong with growth in note taking and ring binders.
growth also continued in the kensington brand on the strength of new products in the notebook, docking and security areas. office supplies in calendar items declined. we saw growth in the independent and wholesale channels, which offset some declines in dollar and other regional retail stores. north america operating margin increased to 13.5% from 12.4%, driven by pricing largely catching up with the cost inflation cycle that began in mid-2018. pricing along with cost reductions were only partially offset by lower volume and higher incentive accruals.
for the first quarter of 2020, we expect north america sales to continue to benefit from some of last year's price increases, but our pricing will follow changes in tariffs. for example, we will reflect tariff reductions to list 4a items from may onwards. for the full year, we anticipate north america sales to be down slightly.
now, let's turn to emea. full year sales decreased 6%, almost all of which was related to currency translation. comparable sales were roughly flat as we saw sequential demand improvement in the fourth quarter from the slower second and third quarters, primarily from gains in lever arch files, do-it-yourself tools and computer accessories.
as we have mentioned, emea had a very strong 2018 because of the new privacy law, the increased demand for shredders. so, the comparisons for 2019 particularly by quarter were difficult. we were very pleased that we almost matched 2018 sales by replacing one-time shredder demand from the privacy law with ongoing demand from share gains and new products.
emea gross profit and gross profit margin were negatively impacted by adverse foreign exchange and lower volume. emea's 2019 adjusted operating income of $61 million, declined 10% due to lower sales, adverse foreign exchange and higher input costs. the cost increase was largely due to weakness in the euro and u.k. pound, which increased the local currency cost of u.s. dollar sourced products that we purchase in asia but sell in local currency.
looking at 2020. on a comparable basis, we expect emea sales to be approximately flat for the year. moving to the international segment. full year comparable sales decreased almost 3% because of lower volume, partially offset by higher pricing. the goba and foroni acquisitions added approximately $54 million to sales in 2019. adverse foreign currency reduced sales approximately $19 million.
australia continues to be a difficult market with lost placements and an unfavorable mix, although we saw a slower rate of decline in the fourth quarter. in asia, we are seeing the effects of exiting low-margin product lines. for the year, sales in mexico, excluding the goba acquisition were down slightly.
moving on, brazil had strong sales during its back-to-school selling. as boris mentioned, the fourth quarter is the largest quarter seasonally for both tilibra and foroni, and both performed well. keep in mind that because both brazilian businesses are heavily skewed to the fourth quarter, almost all of the profits there are generated in the second half.
as a result, in 2020, we expect full year ownership of foroni to add approximately $30 million to sales, but add minimal incremental eps. full year reported international operating income declined slightly because of higher restructuring and acquisition related costs. adjusted operating income of $53 million, rose 4% because of the acquisitions, partially offset by continuing difficulties in australia and asia, along with adverse foreign exchange.
for 2020, international sales are expected to be up high single digits with the benefit of full year foroni, growth in general in brazil and mexico and less of a drag from foreign exchange asia and australia.
let's move now to our balance sheet and cash flow. in 2019, we generated $204 million in net cash from operating activities and free cash flow of $172 million. we repurchased 8.3 million shares for a net $65 million, and we also paid dividends of approximately $24 million, returning $89 million to shareholders.
during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 800,000 shares for a net $7 million and paid $6 million in dividends. we also repaid $116 million of seasonal borrowings. at quarter-end, our net leverage ratio was 2.7 times.
now, let's turn to our initial outlook for 2020. we estimate that sales will be in the range of negative 1% to positive 1%, including approximately $20 million from adverse foreign currency exchange and $30 million benefit from having full year foroni results.
our outlook for adjusted eps for the year is in the range of $1.20 to $1.30, which includes $0.03 negative impact from foreign exchange and minimal incremental impact from full year foroni results. we anticipate normalization of incentives and our guidance includes a $14 million headwind as a result.
in 2019, our sales seasonality for back-to-school was skewed toward the second quarter. in 2020 we expect back to school to be more balanced between the second and third quarters, similar to what we saw in 2018. the outlook for free cash flow is $165 million to $175 million. we do not expect to repeat the large cash outflow in the first quarter of 2020 that we experienced in 2019, because we have not pre-bought any inventory. the second quarter, therefore, will see a larger, more normal cash outflow as we build back to school inventory.
subject to any new acquisitions, we anticipate year-end net bank leverage will be at or below 2.5 times. we have included certain modeling assumptions in our slide deck on page 16.
now, let's move on to q&a, where boris and i will be happy to take your questions. operator?

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of william reuter with bank of america. your line is now open.
mary -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. this is mary [phonetic] on for bill. thanks for taking my questions. so just to start you touched on it briefly but can you just expand on the health of your customers and what kind of changes that you've been making to payment terms?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's difficult to say. our customers vary in their profile. we have lots of customers who are very healthy and whose sales are actually up and business is probably going to grow as a result. and we have some customers that are more in the specialty channels and these are customers that are focused primarily on the office supplies business that are likely to be stressed by the current economic challenges. it's hard to paint with a broad brush. customers that we feel are higher risk we are having discussions with and apply custom solutions for their particular environment. and as neil mentioned in his prepared remarks sometimes it means that we will reduce our sales to those customers in order to protect our receivables.
mary -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. and then given just overall weak demand, are you feeling any pressure on price? and if so, what kind of pressure do you expect going forward in this environment?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no, there is no pressure on price. in fact, i think there'll be pressure the other way. the commodity environment is very benign. so we don't see any inflation from the commodity costs, but certainly operating a business in the covid-19 environment requires additional cost, social distancing means reduced productivity. so i think over time, some of these costs, if not all of these costs, will be passed through higher pricing. and it's not just for our business, that will be the case everywhere and i'm sure you're seeing it in retail already where prices have gone up in the last couple of months, but that will come to our industry as well.
mary -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. and lastly just on the e-commerce channels, what kind of -- are you seeing anything specific to what products are being sold online versus what's typically being bought in stores? any demand changes with that or any color i guess for what you've seen with most of these sales going online?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, i mean online is clearly benefiting from in the current environment. we are seeing very rapid growth through e-tail. it's -- in the first quarter it approached triple digits for us and then our own direct to consumer sales were up 17% in the first quarter, so not just third party. i think there is demand -- we're seeing demand online pretty much from every angle. so clearly one of the big benefits in this environment will be online sales.
mary -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. that's all for me. thank you very much.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of chris mcginnis with sidoti & company. your line is now open.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my questions and a nice job on the quarter and thanks for providing some guidance for q2.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, chris.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti -- analyst
can you -- good morning. can you just maybe, boris, just talk a little bit about maybe inventory levels in the commercial side and as states start to reopen have those conversations changed outside of what you saw in april?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, inventory overall right now is pretty low for us and it's low for a couple of reasons. one is there were some supply chain disruptions in february and march from china. so as we exited q1 inventory was in a lower place. and then in april some of that is coming back online. but we expect more of that to come into our warehouses in the may and june time frame.
and as neal mentioned, we do expect to exit q2 with a little bit higher level of inventory because the orders were placed back in q1 and the sales are going to be down substantially. when it comes to our customers, they are taking the inventory down by a lot as well because they are anticipating a lower level of sales. so one of the reasons that april was such a soft month in addition to just lower demand, this incremental destocking that customers are doing as they anticipate lower demand in future months as well.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti -- analyst
okay. okay. and then just on a regional basis, any -- obviously it's a pretty wide range of sales decline for q2. but if you just think about the regions, and if you said that i apologize, but just your thought process through the segments of where you are going to see most pressure.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
clearly north america did relatively well in q1 and we saw weakness in emea and in international. if i look at q2, we expect north america to benefit from back-to-school selling. that's likely to be the strongest part of the business. and then outside of back-to-school selling, if i look at the commercial environment, we're seeing similar trends, similar weakness all over the world. and then seasonally q2 is going to be a pretty low quarter or is a pretty low quarter for emea and most of international as well and that's not likely going to change.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti -- analyst
okay. thanks for taking my questions and good luck in q2 and stay safe.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, chris.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of kevin steinke with barrington research. your line is now open.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
hey. good morning.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, kevin.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
just curious about obviously april was very soft, but did you see any stabilization in sales trends maybe on a week-to-week basis as you moved throughout the month?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's difficult to tell because we don't do a year-on-year compares on a weekly basis. we did see sales were better in the second half, just overall, of april. sales were very, very soft up and through easter as i think a lot of countries used that to really shut down businesses and schools and send everybody on vacations. but then post easter, especially the last week or so we saw some improvement in sales. it's still much, much lower than prior year. we do expect may and june to be better, both because we are seeing some openings in some of the international countries. we are seeing discussion of openings and actually some openings in early may in some of the us states. we haven't seen any business impact of that yet, but certainly there are openings going on.
and then our back-to-school selling shipments are really may, june, july. so with may and june falling into q2, we expect that to help those two months.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay. all right. that's helpful. and that kind of dovetails to my next question here. you mentioned some countries in europe starting to tentatively reopen. i know it's still very, very -- very early in that process, but have you seen any green shoots emerging in your sales trends from certain countries beginning to reopen?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we haven't seen any green shoots yet, kevin, but countries are open and shipping which is a good thing. for part of march and early april, italy and spain, and a couple of other countries were pretty much completely shut down. now they're open. our warehouses are shipping. so, i do expect that we will have stronger may than we had in april.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay. and then you mentioned the strong demand for certain work-from-home, stay-at-home items. can you give us a sense as to how much of your portfolio those items account for and maybe if you've been able to address the out-of-stock items that you mentioned there as well?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. if we look at our sales for those types of products, which is kensington, trusens, derwent, some notebooks, it's probably in the range of 10% to 15% of our portfolio. we are addressing out-of-stock issues. certainly we expect may to be better. but the demand has been so strong that, even as we get additional supply of those products, they go out very, very quickly. so it's a good thing and i'm confident we will resolve the stock issues, but still the overwhelming majority of our portfolio is down significantly in terms of sales.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay. is the china supply chain pretty back close to normal now or is it still -- i think you said ramping up? just what's the state of supply out of china now?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, the china supply chain is close to normal. right now we're just facing typical forecasting issues where we just can't forecast the increase in demand that we're seeing on some skus given the length of the supply chain it takes a little bit to recover. so these are good things. i'd much rather be chasing supply than demand. back-to-school, i feel very, very confidence in but in certain -- kensington or trusens or derwent skus we're still chasing supply.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay. and then just lastly, just talk about the decision to declare a dividend and i assume that you continue to -- expect to continue paying one going forward. it sounds like at least a positive signal of your financial strength. so just curious about that.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, we're very, very confident in our operating cash flow and free cash flow. dividend is clearly a very important part of total shareholder return and the board felt, certainly for q2, that we should be paying a dividend given our view on the company and the future. and the board will continue to evaluate on a quarterly basis, but certainly given the importance of dividends, something drastic has to happen for us to change our view on that.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay, great. thanks for taking the questions.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, kevin.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of joe gomes with noble capital. your line is now open.
joe gomes -- noble capital markets, inc. -- analyst
good morning.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, joe.
joe gomes -- noble capital markets, inc. -- analyst
first question, given as you were talking about you expecting to see prices to rise given some of the extra costs here related to the covid crisis, do you have any fears or worries that that could cause a faster shift to the generic side versus the branded side?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no, i'm not worried about that, joe. i think that the price increases that we're talking about are nominal and the increases are going to be comparable to what everybody is doing. everybody is implementing similar policies and seeing the same cost increases. clearly, we will need to remain competitive. but within all of that scope, i do expect to be a pressure on increasing costs -- increasing price.
joe gomes -- noble capital markets, inc. -- analyst
okay. okay. and could you just remind us what percent of revenue is derived from consumables?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's roughly 50%.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it's approximately half.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. approximately 50%.
joe gomes -- noble capital markets, inc. -- analyst
okay. thanks on that one. and how has it, if it has, the current crisis had any impact on some of the new product roll-outs that you guys were expecting to do this year?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we are still committed to innovation, new product development. some of the shutdowns in china earlier in the year delayed some of the interaction with suppliers that are manufacturing some of these new products for us. so i think some of these products will be delayed by a couple of months as a result.
and then the plus one types of products, so derivatives and some of the minor changes are getting delayed to prior year. as neal mentioned in his prepared remarks, we are reducing some of the capex that supports these less innovative products. but the core group of innovative products is staying on schedule. we are still committed to it albeit there is going to be a couple of months potential slip [phonetic] just businesses not being able to operate as effectively as before.
joe gomes -- noble capital markets, inc. -- analyst
okay. great. thanks for taking the questions.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of brad thomas with keybanc capital markets. your line is now open.
brad thomas -- keybanc -- analyst
thank you. hi. good morning, boris, neal and christine. thanks for taking my questions.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, brad.
brad thomas -- keybanc -- analyst
good morning, boris. i want to jump in on maybe looking at the contribution margin and the deleverage that you all are expecting. i think some quick math, neal, maybe implies 30% to 35% decremental margin on the sales decline in 2q. am i in the ballpark with that? and any insights you'd like to share about how we should think about that flow-through rate as we try and fine-tune our models for the balance of the year here?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, your math is correct, brad. but that's of course after we've taken certain actions to reduce costs on a temporary basis. so the pre-cost reduction decremental rate on margins is actually in the low 40%s. and then obviously, we took a series of special actions to reduce sg&a in the short term as all the paycuts etc. that we've done, which takes it down into the -- around 30%.
brad thomas -- keybanc -- analyst
okay. great. thank you. and then maybe a big picture question here for you boris. just as you all have started to think about what the world looks like as we get back to normal, people are working from home more, so potentially changing office layouts or office protocols. how do you think that affects the industry as you think about a recovery as we move into next year?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, we began to think about those things and we do think that they will -- some of these changes will take place as the world recovers. i'm not sure going back to normal is in the cards yet, but certainly i do expect a recovery of some sorts. and there will be likely more people working from home and more people schooling from home, more people buying through online and convenience channels, less travel, more emphasis on local products and services, probably more awareness of physical and mental health issues and a search for a way to improve both.
so as a result of all of that, we will be adapting to the changes in consumer and channel behavior and it's very likely that we will continue to invest and improve our b2c capabilities around the world, continue to partner with e-tailers, not just with amazon as the obvious leader in that space, but also with a lot of local e-tailers that exist all over the world, transition our sourcing and manufacturing over time to be closer to our selling locations, make additional investments in such product categories as wellness, arts and crafts, computer and school products, change the color waves from more office colors to more home colors, conducive to home environment, reduce the pack sizes and intersizes in our cartons and shipments to facilitate shipments in smaller quantities and more to home locations as opposed to business locations. so those are just some kind of initial thoughts and initial ways we are looking to be more attuned to the current changes in the environment we're seeing. and obviously over time we will learn more and more about the more permanent changes in consumer behavior and we will continue to adjust.
brad thomas -- keybanc -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you so much.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, brad.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of hale holden with barclays. your line is now open.
ed brucker -- barclays -- analyst
the question -- this is ed brucker on for hale. i wanted to ask about the balance sheet. i noticed you gave your long-term leverage target, i guess, maintained it at 2 times to 2.5 times. [phonetic] you're closing it now at 2.8. so my first question, i guess, was on how you plan to get there and the timing on that, whether it being debt reduction or earnings growth in the future? and then what do you expect it to kind of be maybe year-end?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, ed, obviously earnings is the most unpredictable thing between now and end of year because the course of this virus is unpredicted and the response to it. so i'm not going to give any target for the end of the year. we gave the guidance that we felt we could give and clearly to give leverage guidance i'd have to give earnings guidance and i'm not intending to do that.
however, we do not anticipate the virus staying with us on a permanent basis. and so as you move out of this year and you return into normal level of activity, obviously earnings will recover. and once earnings recovers and as we did point out we will plan to pay down debt this year, we will end the year with less debt and we will hopefully see a recovery of earnings and then clearly our leverage target will quickly come back into the right zone.
ed brucker -- barclays -- analyst
thanks. and then for the covenant relief, did you have to give anything up for that? you are -- what seems to be well within given the -- what the leverage covenant was before. was there anything specifically you gave up for that?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
so fundamentally the agreement while we stay within the original terms prior to this amendment, very similar. the only change is a libor base rate in the us, which will come into effect. but outside of that change the only change that occurs is if we go above the old 3.75 leverage cap, in which case we would become constrained from purchasing shares, repurchasing our shares. but we wouldn't intend to do that in the short term anyway we're in that period. so some academic restriction. and obviously there are higher interest rate tiers that apply if we get into that level as well.
ed brucker -- barclays -- analyst
got it. then my last question is on, well, i guess, do you -- are you seeing any additional cost that you're having to look at given what's going on in the plants in relation to the social distancing restrictions or cleaning the plants, etc.? and how do we think about that in relation to the $20 million of cost saves in the second quarter and then throughout the rest of the year?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
the $20 million in the second quarter is all in and includes all of the cost increases versus cost reductions. we are seeing increased cost as we're managing our response to covid-19 and as i mentioned in response to my prior question, some of that will have to pass through in the form of higher pricing and i anticipate those costs not to be short-term costs. i think the way we work is going to change. and that will drive almost necessarily higher costs or lower productivity, which will translate into higher cost per unit. so some of that is going to get passed through in higher pricing.
ed brucker -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks guys.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, ed.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of karru martinson with jefferies. your line is now open.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
when you guys -- when you look at the range of sales down 25% to 40% in line kind of what we've been hearing from others, what are the parameters of what guides that wide range? what has to happen that we come in at the short end and where do we come in at the long end in terms of the pace of opening, the return back to work, school obviously not coming back this spring here?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's really going to be guided by how the commercial side of the business will do. as we mentioned, we saw a very deep decline in april, driven by the commercial side of the business. if businesses start opening up and they start reordering product and it's done in a fairly broad scale, multiple countries, multiple states, then we should track to a lower end of that scale. and if the environment stays similar or if it opens up slower or if it reverts back, let's say it opens up and then a couple of weeks later there is a spike and there's going to be incremental shutdown, that will tend to push it toward the higher decreased number.
the back-to-school, that's a sell-in number. so that's going to be roughly what it's going to be because the orders are mostly in. we're going to ship them in may and june. so that's not going to vary a great deal outside of just the normal what ships in june versus what ships in july thing. but the commercial side is going to have the biggest effect on.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. and then when we look at the positive cash flow for the year, certainly cushion for you guys to continue to pay the dividend. any thought given to bolstering that cushion that you guys have? your leverage is materially low. we've seen there is raising capital just to put cash on the balance sheet as a safety cushion and your thoughts on the capital structure with that?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, we have ample availability under our bank lines. and so at the end of the quarter, we had $450 million of available credit on our revolving credit facility. so we do not anticipate using anywhere near that amount. it was actually increased to allow as m&a firepower. and -- so we have no particular needs to bolster the balance sheet right now. we have ample liquidity and we have ample access to it. so we're very happy with our liquidity position.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
and you alluded to my next question. in terms of m&a, are you seeing some of the smaller competitors out there having financial difficulties? is there stuff coming to market in terms of the pipeline?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i think it's probably a little bit premature for things just to pop up only in the last few weeks, but things obviously will come, just given the financial squeeze that's going on. and there is plenty of stuff out there, the bar for all of these acquisitions has gone up for given what's going on. so we will continue to be very prudent. and the priority for our profit cash flow is delevering in dividends in 2020.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you very much, guys. appreciate it.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, karru.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of hamed khorsand with bws financial. your line is now open.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
hey. good morning. could you talk about if you're seeing any share loss or any competitive pressures from mass merchants using lower priced competitors versus your higher quality products?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hi, hamed. no, we have not seen that. we mentioned -- well, actually we mentioned in the last few years that with private label, we're fairly tactical when it comes to private label and some years we win it, some years we lose it. that's not any different. and those decisions are made probably nine months in advance. so this year, i expect us to be playing a smaller role in private label products than we did last year for example. but again those decisions were made about nine months ago. in answer your question, we're not seeing any incremental share loss. in fact, it's a little bit the other way around. we're seeing some of our customers having a difficult time right now getting some products just given what's going on both due to logistics issues and some liquidity issues. so there could be a near-term incremental opportunity for our products given that we make a lot of them here in the us or in other countries where we do business.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
and how are you managing capacity utilization given that, one, right now it's weak sales, but then eventually with things opening up, how do you adjust that with commercial and school equipment sales? do you have enough inventory for that?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, we don't think inventory is an issue. we have different plants that are focused on making different things. we have some plants right now that are on full or partial furlough as a result of lower demand and these plants are focused primarily on commercial products or end-of-the-year products. and then we have some plants that are focused on back-to-school and they are in full swing, really working 24/7 in order to pre-build inventory necessary for back-to-school.
so we have a very scalable model and our employees have been very supportive during these difficult times and are working with us to make sure that we can adjust our cost structure appropriately given the expected demand trends.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
okay. thank you.

william chappell -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
wanted to just talk more about as we come out of this environment more of -- if you can -- boris you can kind of talk about the business in a recession be it three, six months or even longer, just how it's changed versus the last recession, how you're maybe prepared more or less in terms of products and offering and private label and kind of what the business looks like as we compare versus, seven, eight, nine years ago?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, we think it's a very, very different situation. first of all, we think the nature of this recession is going to be probably deeper than what we saw in 2008-2009 time frame and probably broader affecting more businesses, more countries than the last one did. but we think our business is in a much better shape and much more healthier to withstand whatever will come our way.
we are much more geographically diversified. we have much a bigger part of our business that's selling through mass and e-tail than we did in the prior recession. and we think those channels will be the winners in this particular time and we'll do just fine. much more of our product portfolio is consumables versus durables. and durables in the last recession took a huge hit as businesses just stop buying anything that's discretionary. and we think that in this environment it's likely to happen again. but again, a much bigger portion of our business is consumables and we think that's going to withstand the environment quite well.
i mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're seeing an increased demand in some of our product categories. kensington, trusens, derwent, some of the five star notebooks and many of those things we didn't have before in our portfolio. so i feel very, very confident in our ability to withstand this, the recession however long it lasts. in fact, we look at this as an opportunity to accelerate our differentiation versus competition and to expand the distance between us and other competitors out there. we think that companies will want to consolidate their supplier base. our customers who want to consolidate their supplier base and we think given our strength and our breadth in our brands, they will want to consolidate on to us. so whereas it's going to be very, very difficult and i don't underestimate that. i think from a competitive standpoint, we're in much better shape and this could be actually a good opportunity for us.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the first quarter 2020 acco brands corp earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, christine hanneman. please go ahead.
christine hanneman -- investor relations
good morning. this is christine hanneman, senior director of investor relations. welcome to acco brands first quarter 2020 conference call. speaking on the call today are boris elisman, chairman, president and chief executive officer of acco brands corporation and neal fenwick, executive vice president and chief financial officer.
slides that accompany this call have been posted to the investor relations section of accobrands.com. when speaking about our results, we may refer to adjusted results. adjusted results exclude transaction, integration and restructuring costs and reflect an adjusted tax rate. schedules of adjusted results and other non-gaap financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures are in the earnings release and slides that accompany this call. due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts, we do not reconcile our forward-looking adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow, net leverage ratio or adjusted tax rate guidance. forward-looking statements made during the call, including statements concerning the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on the company, are based on the beliefs and assumptions of management based on information available to us at the time the statements are made. our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and our actual results could differ materially. among the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements is the scope and duration of the covid-19 pandemic, government actions and third party responses to it and the consequences for the global economy and its impact on our business, operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. please refer to our earnings release and sec filings for an explanation of certain of these risk factors and assumptions. our forward-looking statements are made as of today and we assume no obligation to update them going forward.
following our prepared remarks, we will hold a q&a session.
now i will turn the call over to boris elisman.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning everyone. thank you for joining us. i will spend the next few minutes reviewing the first quarter results, but i will spend most of my time giving you an update and our response to the coronavirus and its business implications on the second quarter. neal will follow me with more color and details on the first quarter and provide additional comments on our cost reductions, balance sheet and expected use of cash in 2020. then we'll take your questions.
our first quarter is our smallest quarter of the year. sales were down 2.5% [phonetic] to $384 million. our adjusted eps were $0.07, down $0.01 from last year. these results were roughly in line with our expectations. the year started well but march sales softened, especially in the last two weeks due to covid-19 related business and school closures. april, which is typically the softest month of the year for our business, deteriorated further due to incremental global government mandates and business closures, in addition to the timing of easter.
as we manage our response to the pandemic, our top priority is the health and safety of our employees. in mid-march employees who could do their job from home began working from home. most of our production and warehouse facilities remain open to meet customer demand, as we are designated an essential business in most jurisdictions, although many have reduced staff and hours. we modified operating procedures at our production and warehousing facilities based on government guidelines and have taken additional steps to protect our employees. those steps vary from location to location and include taking workers' temperatures daily, practicing social distancing, wearing masks, additional deep cleaning and disinfecting procedures, quarantines consistent with cdc and who guidelines and adjusting our working schedules as appropriate to space out employee interaction. i want to thank all our employees for their efforts under these difficult conditions.
we have also undertaken many cost reduction initiatives to better align our cost structure with the expected impact of much lower near-term demand. these efforts are in addition to our normal productivity programs. we're doing everything we can in the short term to mitigate the impact of the pandemic to ensure the long-term health and prosperity of our company and our employees.
we just amended our bank agreement to provide additional flexibility to cover the possible impact of covid-19. neal will give you the specifics in a few minutes. our board of directors approved the second quarter dividend payment, which will be paid in mid-june to shareholders of record.
moving on to my comments regarding the second quarter. as many of you know, our north america back-to-school selling occurs mainly in the second and early third quarters. we manufacture over half of that inventory in the us, 30% in vietnam and less than 20% in china. our supply chain is running normally after some minor disruption in february and march in china due to factory closures. we currently don't foresee any significant supply chain issues in meeting back-to-school orders. we were impacted by amazon's decision in mid-march to stop replenishing inventory for what they deemed to be non-essential items. this reduced our march sales by a few million dollars, but in mid-april amazon began replenishing the inventory on many of our items. also in march and continuing to april, we have seen strong demand for products that aid working, schooling and crafting from home.
in particular our kensington docking stations, five star notebooks, trusens air purifiers and derwent art products have been so popular that we have been out of stock on some of these items due to high demand. however, overall demand for the second quarter is expected to be down significantly as many of our commercial customers and schools are closed or their customers are closed and not using our products.
let me now make some comments as to why i believe we are well positioned to withstand the current challenges. our management team has faced difficult economic conditions before and has been working for the last 10 years to create a more resilient company. in 2008-2009, we were primarily selling office products to large office supply stores. today, we're a much more diversified global company. beginning with the acquisition of the mead consumer and office products business in 2012, our strategy has been to expand our global presence, diversify our channels of distribution and add stronger brands and more differentiation to our product portfolio. we pursued this strategy through organic initiatives and with acquisitions. as a result, our business now is 50% consumer with a higher consumables mix, healthier go-to-market channels and a broader range of customers. this makes us better able to withstand economic disruptions which we believe will disproportionately impact the part of our business that is related to commercial office products which is more susceptible to lower demand and channel disruption.
our financial situation is much different as well. in 2008-2009 we were in a weak financial position and it was difficult for us to borrow. we ended 2019 in strong financial shape. and at the end of the first quarter, we had over $90 million in cash on hand and $450 million undrawn and now $600 million committed credit facility. as noted earlier, we also amended our bank debt maintenance covenant which will add flexibility to our facility. we have no debt maturities before may 2024.
given our financial strength and the proactive steps we have taken to reduce costs, we expect to be able to maintain good liquidity as we manage through the current environment. finally, we are an organization that knows how to adapt to change. we will continue to evaluate our business strategy and participation as it relates to product categories, geographies, channels and consumer behavior and we will change, as necessary, as we deal with the uncertainties and near and long-term consequences of covid-19. i'm confident in our market position, our brands, our financial strength, our people and in our management team, which is experienced in dealing with difficult times.
with that i will turn the call over to neal for a review of the segments, our outlook and other financial commentary and then i'll join him in answering your questions. neal?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, boris and good morning everyone. our first quarter reported net sales decreased 3% due to adverse foreign exchange. excluding foroni and foreign exchange, comparable sales decreased 4% as declines in europe and the international segment offset solid performance in north america.
as boris mentioned in mid-march, we began seeing government mandated business and school closures and shelter-in-place orders in many countries in europe, new zealand and several states in the united states. by the end of march, this was widespread. we continue to comply with those and other orders as they evolve. we are considered an essential business in many countries and states. so we have been able to continue manufacturing and shipping in many of our facilities as demand warrants. however, due to soft demand and social distancing requirements, we are currently operating many of these facilities with a smaller staff.
first quarter net income was $8 million versus a small loss in 2019. adjusted net income was $7 million, down from $9 million in 2019. adjusted eps was $0.07 versus $0.08 in 2019. in the quarter we spent $19 million of our free cash flow to buy back shares. our gross margin was 29.2% compared with 31.9% in 2019. the decrease was largely the result of unfavorable fixed cost absorption, largely in north america and an unfavorable product mix primarily in europe.
the reduced gross margin in international was from the inclusion of foroni without which segment margins would have been flat and gross margins for the total business 50 basis points higher. sg&a expenses as a percent of sales decreased to 22.4% from 24.3%. the improvement was primarily from lower incentive accruals as we will not earn any annual incentive bonuses this year in any segment as well as reductions in discretionary spending. the inclusion of foroni, which has both lower gross profit and sg&a than acco's average, was a 30 basis point benefit. reported operating income of $17.4 million was similar to last year's $17.9 million and operating margin in both years was 4.5%. foroni has a negligible impact on reported operating income and margins.
our adjusted tax rate of 30.7% was in line with our anticipated 31% rate for the full year. the lower adjusted rate in this year's first quarter versus last year primarily reflects the tax strategy we implemented to reduce excessive interest levels in certain jurisdictions.
now let's turn to some details on our segment. net sales in north america rose 5%, mainly as a result of higher prices that reflected the full benefit of tariff related increases that occurred last year. we saw a strong sales growth of kensington, swingline, quartet and five star products.
our back-to-school orders were strong and at this point we expect back-to-school selling to mass merchants and e-tailers to be similar to last year. however, we also expect reduced sales to traditional commercial office product channels and other retailers in the second quarter. north america operating income and operating margin grew as a result of the absence of restructuring charges this quarter.
now let's turn to emea. net sales decreased 13% and comparable sales were down 10% due to the impact of covid-19 related business closures. the business was hurt beginning in mid-march as many economies in europe shut down and we experienced a significant slowdown in new orders as well as an inability to deliver to some customers. emea's adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin declined primarily due to lower volume and an unfavorable product mix.
gross and operating margin were further affected by lower absorption and the inflationary impact of the strong us dollar on the cost of asian sourced product costs. these were partially offset by cost savings, including lower incentive accruals.
moving to the international segment, net sales rose 2% from the inclusion of foroni in brazil, which added $14 million. excluding foreign exchange and foroni, comparable net sales decreased 8%. the decline was the result of slowing customer orders due to covid-19 business closures as well as out-of-stock situations in mexico related to chinese supply chain issues.
international reported operating income that's slightly higher than last year due to lower sg&a costs. foroni had an immaterial impact on operating income. adjusted operating income of $6 million decreased as the impact of covid-19 was only partially offset by lower restructuring charges and lower sg&a, including lower incentive accruals.
let's move now to our balance sheet and cash flow. in the first quarter, we used approximately $25 million in net cash from operating activities and $32 million of free cash flow. we repurchased 2.9 million shares for a net $19.1 million and we also paid a dividend of $6.2 million.
the planned use of cash for the remainder of 2020 will be to fund our dividend and to reduce debt. we do not plan to repurchase shares for the remainder of the year. our capex outlook for 2020 is $20 million, much of which is related to north america and it conversion which became operational in early april.
at quarter-end, we had used $150 million of our $600 million revolving credit facility, primarily for seasonal borrowings. the net leverage ratio was 2.8 times. as boris mentioned to address the impact of covid-19, we have undertaken a number of cost reduction initiatives to better align our cost structure with the expected decline in 2020 sales. these initiatives include, one, temporary salary reductions for our executives, our board of directors, senior leaders and our staff worldwide. these reductions range from between 50% to 10%. all of the salary reductions will be in effect until the end of june, at which point we will decide whether or not we will need to continue based on company performance and economic conditions. two, indefinite postponement or 2020 merit increases with a few exceptions where required by law. three, eliminating the 2020 bonus accruals since our original financial objectives will not be achieved. four, furloughs for some of our global employees and temporary layoffs for some production and distribution employees due to lower demand. we have also postponed discretionary spending, including most marketing programs focused on commercial customers and we have delayed some capital improvement projects and some product development programs. we expect these cost reduction actions, when combined with our normal productivity programs, will deliver approximately $20 million in additional second quarter expense savings compared with last year.
some of the actions and corresponding savings will continue for the remainder of the year. others are more temporary in nature. we will evaluate the need to extend, adjust or convert these actions into more permanent changes later in the quarter, depending on the economic and business situation.
now let's turn to our outlook. it is difficult to forecast in this environment and thus we don't know enough to give full-year guidance. it is not our normal practice to give a quarterly outlook, but we are not in normal times. and we have more short-term visibility than long-term visibility right now for our sales and profits.
our sales in april has been very soft and we expect our second quarter sales to be down significantly. our outlook for the second quarter sales decline is in the range of 25% to 40%, including 3% impact from adverse foreign exchange. this is a very broad range because we don't know the pace or the timing of reopenings and recoveries. however, we expect april to be the worst month in the second quarter.
second quarter adjusted eps are expected to be a loss of $0.05 to a positive $0.07 with negligible impact from foreign exchange and foroni. we believe that our seasonal borrowings could be larger because lower sales in april will result in lower collections from receivables in the quarter and we also anticipate an increased level of late payments.
in addition, we did not anticipate such a steep drop in demand when we placed orders for purchased finished goods from asia early in the first quarter which is likely to result in elevated inventory levels at the end of the second quarter. our second-half visibility is very limited, but demand is expected to continue to be down compared with last year, especially in the office products area.
our traditional office products customers are seeing the largest impact with their customers not open or themselves not being operational. we anticipate that a prolonged period of closure may cause financial distress and potential bad debts with some of them. we are actively managing our receivables and will potentially restrict our own sales to mitigate our risk.
for the full year, we anticipate a slowly improving demand level with a wide range of sales assumptions. the business continues to generate a solid level of operating cash flow. while lower sales reduce profit, they also reduce our level of investment in working capital and we feel confident that we will generate at least $120 million of operating cash flow for the full year and with capex expected to be $20 million we will generate at least $100 million in free cash flow.
we also amended our bank debt covenant to give us greater financial flexibility as we manage through this crisis. the net debt to ebitda leverage covenant ratio has been increased to 4.75 times from 3.75 times all the way through june 2021 to ensure that we remain compliant with our covenants regardless of the situation. while we may not need the added headroom, we believe that it was prudent to ensure that we could manage through whatever we need to without concern for tripping a covenant.
in summary, at this point the second quarter back-to-school orders for mass merchant and e-tailer selling are similar to last year and we will monitor the sell-out for back-to-school products in the third quarter as we expect students to go back to school in the fall. there may be some variation in the timing of school openings versus normal, but we do expect most schools will be open in the fall.
now let's move on to q&a where boris and i will be happy to take your questions. operator?

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from chris mcginnis with sidoti & company. your line is now open.
christopher mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my questions, and nice quarter.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, chris.
christopher mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
if we could just -- obviously some pretty strong results. just -- can you maybe just talk about the conversations you're having on the sell-through? i know it's obviously very early, but just maybe with some of the retailers you're talking with, their expectation of how you see that playing out, obviously strong sell-in, but that sell-through is important?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, chris. if your question is particularly to back-to-school sell-through, it's really too early to have any information on that. back-to-school sell-through is just beginning. and we and our retail partners expect it to be later this year, given the uncertainty in school openings. so we don't have enough information on that. our general sell-through which we track on a regular basis is consistent with the comments that neal made. we are seeing pretty good sell-through in large mass and very good sell-through in e-commerce channels, and we're seeing a lower sell-through, a declining sell-through in the commercial channels. but for back-to-school, it's still too early.
christopher mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. and then just as -- obviously, it's a little bit more extended, but just with brazil and kind of what's happening there, the back-to-school in q4 is pretty important for you. can you just maybe comment on what you're hearing there in terms of demand?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. q2 is typically a very low seasonal quarter for us in brazil. normally, we ship some of the back-to-school inventory into the channel in q2. this year, we did not do that. and hence, we saw a fairly rapid decline in sales in q2. we are going to do that in q3 and then we're going to gauge the feedback from the channel and their confidence in this year's back-to-school to see what we need to do in q4. so q3 is going to be pretty important for brazil, we're optimistic. the school schedules have come out, which is a good sign. so there is some certainty that we and our customers know when schools will be reopening in brazil. but again, we'll have to monitor sales, and we'll have to see what happens in q3.
christopher mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
sure. no, i appreciate that. and then just one quick one. just can you just maybe talk about the -- just on the commercial side of the business. obviously, in us, it sounds a little bit more -- a lot more weak than europe. but any indication of that comes back or how that's playing out? and maybe just how much was that down in the quarter, if you don't mind?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
the commercial side of the business in north america was down roughly 50%. so north america overall was down 25%. so you can see how much better the retail in back-to-school did to offset the commercial. in europe, the commercial side was a lot better. and in europe, we're also seeing a very good improvement month-over-month. the reason behind it is that europeans are going back to their offices. offices are reopened, and people are going back to work from the offices. in north america, even though businesses have reopened, most people are still working from home. so until we really see a movement from home into the office, we're not expecting significant improvement in the commercial sales in north america.
christopher mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
great. thanks for the info, and good luck in q3. and thanks again for taking my questions.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, chris.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from kevin steinke with barrington research. your line is now open.
kevin m. steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
good morning.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, kevin.
kevin m. steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
i wanted to talk about the cost savings actions you're taking with regard to making permanent structural changes in reaction to the pandemic. can you just kind of talk about what led to your decision there? what -- how much you expect the demand environment to change longer-term that led to that decision? just kind of the trends you expect work from home to continue more permanently, etc.?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. i'm not sure, kevin, that we're ready to quantify that, except for, we do expect that the recovery is going to be slow. we do expect that sales will be down certainly this year, given that we already had 29% decline in q2, and we're expecting another 15% to 20% in q3. and we'll see -- it's uncertain how things will recover in 2021. but just given the economic impact and the expected slow recovery, we need to take some -- make some structural changes to the business because the revenue is going to be down that much lower. and it starts -- it does start with north america and mexico because we have a more challenging channel structure in mexico and north america. we have very concentrated sales in those two regions.
so we needed to just rightsize the businesses in decisions in q2. i don't think this is the end of it. i think we're going to see how business evolves, and we'll be making additional decisions on reducing cost for the next several months. we'll see what happens in brazil, as we discussed. and it's likely we'll make some additional tweaks in north america as well.
kevin m. steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay. great. and then you mentioned the need to accelerate your continued transition to more consumer-focused, brand-focused company. maybe any thoughts on how you plan to go about that and how acquisitions might play into that continued transition?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. let me just make some comments on the organic initiatives. we talked about certain categories benefiting from current trends, and we believe that they will continue to benefit from the changing consumer preference and the changing channel preferences, and that those categories include wellness and our trusens air purifiers, as well as other products we'll introduce under the trusens brand, arts and crafts, including our derwent color pencils, computer accessories, especially docking station with our kensington brand. and school products have fared fairly well. so we will be continuing to emphasize note-taking in five star.
so we will reprioritize our investments to strengthen those categories and brands and expand the offerings in those brands. if you look at channels, we've seen a very rapid shift from brick-and-mortar to online, both e-commerce sales as well as our own direct-to-consumer sales, where we have that available. so we'll be reinvesting or adding investments to those areas. those will come from lower investments in the declining channels. and all of that was obviously supported by the additional productivity. and cost reductions efforts that we're going to make throughout the business.
if you look at the inorganic growth, we will -- we are continuing to be on the lookout for shareholder accretive acquisitions. but given the reduction in the business, given the increase in leverage that we're going to see this year as a result of that, certainly, the bar for any acquisitions is higher. we will be more judicious. but if something pops up that can move us in the direction of stronger brands, more e-commerce and more direct-to-consumer and can increase the growth of the business, then we will certainly take a look at it. but again, i think we will be more judicious in the near term.
kevin m. steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay. that's very helpful. and then just lastly, i wanted to ask about trusens, the air purifier product line specifically, maybe -- obviously, it's been doing well in this current environment. so how is it tracking relative to your initial expectations? and what's the longer-term outlook that you see for that product line maybe relative to what you thought initially?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's certainly doing a lot better than we thought. we sold more in the first six months than in the whole of last year. and we could have sold more if we had more product, we're still chasing supply on that product line. so we're very bullish on this. we have a lot more product coming in in the second half of the year. we're going to be expanding the category to have other products in the trusens brand. i certainly do expect that over the next couple of years, it will be a multi -- multi-tens-million product line for us. and those are the types of products that i think will move our company forward and will get us closer to the consumer.
kevin m. steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay. great. thanks for the update. and congratulations on the good results in a difficult environment.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, kevin.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from joe gomes with noble capital. your line is now open.
joe gomes -- noble capital markets -- analyst
good morning.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, joe.
joe gomes -- noble capital markets -- analyst
i was just wondering if you might be able to kind of give us a little update or insight into the channels? you talked about some of the faster-growing ones. so during the quarter, if you could kind of quantify what the size of the channel or business that came through the channels on the -- between office superstores, independent, the mass, e-comm, what amount of revenues are the various channels accounted for in the quarter?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i'm not sure i have that information, joe. let me just talk directionally. this is back-to-school season. so in north america, the majority of our sales were made through the big retailers and big e-commerce players. and as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, those did well, down a little bit to a very strong performance last year. and our commercial channels in north america we saw a big decline. it was driven by basically mandated business closures in april and then very slow recovery after that.
in emea, the commercial channels are doing well. and as neal mentioned, we've seen strong recovery. our business in emea is mostly commercial. there's very little retail in emea. so the recovery in emea has been driven by the commercial channels. and by the way, that has continued into july [phonetic]. if you look at australia, performance there, similar to emea, has been a fairly good recovery in australia, and it's been fairly broad, including retail and commercial channels. and in latin america, things are very, very slow just due to seasonality as well as there's just lack of any kind of government support either to the consumers or to businesses during this pandemic. so things are very, very slow to recover.
joe gomes -- noble capital markets -- analyst
okay. talking about the back-to-school, they're kind of split into two, one you have the k-through-12, then you have the college. do you guys have any indication of what percent of your back-to-school sales kind of go to the k-to-12 versus the college. the college seems to be one where there might be more leaning toward that online learning as opposed to going back to campus.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
you're absolutely right. we agree with you that colleges will be likely more in a virtual world -- or many colleges will be more in the virtual world, where many of the k-through-12 will be more in a physical world. a vast majority of our back-to-school sales is k-through-12, and it's probably more like k-through-9. if you get into the later years of high school or in college, certainly, a lot of those kids are using digital learning tools for many, many years now. so it's really not where we've been selling our products. so that's why we believe that will be effective to a lesser extent by some of these decisions by colleges to go virtual because of -- [indecipherable] our sales.
joe gomes -- noble capital markets -- analyst
okay, great. thanks for that, boris. appreciate it.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, joe.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from brad thomas with keybanc capital markets. your line is now open.
andrew -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
hey, good morning. this is andrew [phonetic] on for brad. i was wondering if you could provide an update on price. now that we have a better idea on industry demand and increased covid-19 related costs, do you still see prices potentially increasing in the future given increased covid-19 related costs across the industry?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. i see prices increasing starting early next year to cover the incremental costs associated with covid-19 absolutely. i don't think it's going to be a significant increase because there's been an impact on productivity, but it's not huge, but certainly, i do expect low-single-digit price increase to offset covid costs. and then the typical price adjustments that we have to make to cover the foreign exchange rates. so that's also going to come into play.
andrew -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
okay. understood. and then you noted a negative impact to gross margin from product mix. could you talk about what drove that shift in mix? and how you expect this to evolve going forward?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
probably the biggest effect that we saw from products mix is lower sales of security in kensington because people are not traveling. people aren't going to the office. so there's less of a need to buy additional security locks and much higher sales of laptop docking stations to support the work from home environment, as well as we've won some large bids with governments with laptop docking stations. and security inherently has a much higher gross margin than laptop docking station. so that has really affected the mix of our kensington business and kensington is now a much bigger part of our business because the sales grew 28%, whereas overall sales declined 29%.
so that's probably the biggest effect that we had, right, with the product. neal also mentioned we took some additional charges on obsolete inventory, just given the expected lower sales. and obviously, fixed cost absorption also hurt our gross margins a little bit given the decline in sales.
andrew -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
okay. thank you. that was helpful. that's all for me. thanks, boris.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, andrew.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from bill chappell with suntrust robinson humphrey. your line is now open.
zaki colabawala -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
hi. this is zaki on for bill. thanks for taking the question. just had a quick question on brazil. you mentioned that back-to-school in the us, you kind of expect that to be relatively normal, maybe some changes here and there. but when we think about the margin structure in brazil, if that was to -- if the back-to-school season in brazil was to get pushed back, how do you see that impacting your margin structure? thank you.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. we don't really see the back-to-school season in brazil being pushed back because the school schedules have been released. so there's high confidence in the back-to-school season happening. what may happen is that demand may go down, so just the sales will go down. and we're monitoring very -- that very carefully and depending on what we see at the end of q3, we would be adjusting our manufacturing and distribution headcount to support the peak of back-to-school shipments in q4. so certainly, it may have an impact on our sales. from a margin standpoint, i don't expect a huge impact because a lot of the costs for us are variable. so as long as we pay careful attention to it, which we plan to do, i expect that our margins to be consistent with what we had in the prior year.
zaki colabawala -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
understood. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from william reuter with bank of america. your line is now open.
mary -- bank of america -- analyst
hi. this is mary [phonetic] on for bill. thanks for taking our question. so first, is the decisions regarding how schools will operate this year are still being finalized? do you expect that parents will still be buying their children's school supplies, even if they're learning from home? and would you expect a surge in demand if more schools did return to in-person learning after the holidays?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. we do expect parents to be buying school supplies. even if they are learning from home, the quantity may be different, the mix may be different, but we certainly do expect back-to-school sales to happen regardless. as far as your question about resurging demand if schools reopen, it's kind of late for that, i think. the season is pretty much baked. people make their decisions in the may, june time frame about what they're going to bring in. and given how short and peaky the season in, i'm doubtful that there will be a lot of replenishment regardless because people are going to switch out their inventory for halloween and christmas season, and nobody will want to get stuck with additional inventory.
so i think maybe on the margin, things will potentially be a little bit better, especially through e-commerce. but if you're talking about retail sales, i think the season is pretty much baked, and i don't really expect much variability from a sales perspective, regardless of what happens during the actual back-to-school.
mary -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. and then have you seen any meaningful changes in market share? and if there's anything else notable that you're seeing from competitors? if you could touch on that?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we don't have third-party market share information yet from npd, which is what we use for the us. we'll have that probably next month for q2. so, no news to report there. we have seen some market share information in the gfk in europe. and we're seeing our brands benefiting in the current environment where the consumers are being more discriminatory in what they buy and value seems to be carrying more heft with them. they look to be buying more brands that are focused on quality and longevity and good price value equation. so we're seeing in europe in any way lower private label sales and higher branded sales. and since we're a leader in our categories, we're benefiting from that.
mary -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. that's all for me. thank you.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from hale holden with barclays. your line is now open.
hale holden -- barclays capital -- analyst
thanks for taking the call. i had two quick ones. the $11 million in savings that you're going to reinvest, does that start to flow through in the third quarter or is that more fourth quarter weighted when you start to see that?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, there's an annualized impact. so you could imagine you might get one-quarter of it in the third quarter.
hale holden -- barclays capital -- analyst
okay. thank you. and then, neal, you had also said that your inventory will be down because you guys have shipped into back-to-school in the us. there's no risk to that inventory coming back to you, but it doesn't sell-through correctly?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no. it's sold product.
hale holden -- barclays capital -- analyst
sold product? so, it shouldn't be...
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and we have no -- we don't have any rights of return. so what's sold is sold.
hale holden -- barclays capital -- analyst
perfect. thank you so much. i appreciate it.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, hale.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from hamed khorsand with bws financial. your line is now open.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
hey. good morning. so just wanted to ask you, these restructurings that you've undertaken in the business, are these permanent? and if business changes, do these costs come back? and have you adjusted the business if and when business does normalize?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
these are permanent changes, so we're primarily taking headcount out. we're primarily combining businesses, we're primarily reorganizing businesses. if things are better than we think and they'll recover quicker than we think, then we will adjust our investments in the future as we normally do. this is nothing different. we certainly go through a bunch of what-ifs when we make these changes. these are obviously very important changes not just for the business, but for our people. we do very, very careful analysis, and we have a lot of confidence that we'll be able to manage the upside if that comes out.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
okay. and then, was there any benefit from back-to-school in the second quarter?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
there was a lot of benefit from back-to-school sell-in in the second quarter. the stores just get set in early july. so we really don't see any actual back-to-school sell-out in the second quarter. but starting in late may and certainly throughout june, we ship a lot of products to our strategic customers for back-to-school, and we saw a lot of benefit in the us for back-to-school sell-in in q2.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
and was the discussion with the retailers and the channels that you're selling into just similar as to what you were describing earlier in your pre-made remarks for back-to-school?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i'm not sure i understand, hamed. elaborate....
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
i'm just -- from a product standpoint and what they're purchasing and taking on ahead of the back-to-school shopping period. is it purely everything you've been selling as the five star in the art products and so forth?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, exactly. the five star is our leading brand for back-to-school. so we saw strong shipments of five star products. and also, a lower end of our swingline range, lower end of our quartet range also has some play in back-to-school. we also sell some academic calendars, and those get shipped back-to-school. but five star is really the majority of the business.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
okay. thank you.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, hamed.
operator
thank you. i'm not showing any further questions at this time. i would now like to turn the call back over to boris elisman for closing remarks.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, joelle. and thank you everybody for your interest in acco brands. to summarize, the ramifications we're seeing from covid-19 are very disruptive to our business, but we are confident in our ability to withstand this crisis as a result of the proactive initiatives that we have taken. looking longer-term, we also remain confident about our future and our ability to continue to position the company for growth and strong returns for our shareholders.
have a great day, and we'll talk to you in a couple of months. thank you.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the q2 2020 acco brands corp earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, christine hanneman, senior director of investor relations. please go ahead, ma'am.
christine hanneman -- senior director, investor relations
good morning. this is christine hanneman, senior director of investor relations. welcome to acco brands second quarter 2020 conference call. speaking on the call today are boris elisman, chairman, president and chief executive officer of acco brands corporation; and neal fenwick, executive vice president and chief financial officer.
slides that accompany this call have been posted to the investor relations section of accobrands.com. when speaking about our results, we may refer to adjusted results. adjusted results exclude transaction, integration and restructuring costs and reflect an adjusted tax rate. schedules of adjusted results and other non-gaap financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures are in the earnings release and slides that accompany this call. due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts, we do not reconcile our forward-looking adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow, net leverage ratio or adjusted tax rate guidance.
forward-looking statements made during the call, including statements concerning the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on the company, are based on the beliefs and assumptions of management based on information available to us at the time the statements are made. our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and our actual results could differ materially. among the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements is the scope and duration of the covid-19 pandemic, government actions and third-party responses to it and the consequences for the global economy as well as the regional and local economies in which we operate, uncertainties regarding our geographies, distribution channels and consumer behavior will evolve over time in response to the pandemic and its impact on our business, operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
please refer to our earnings release and sec filings for an explanation of certain of these risk factors and assumptions. our forward-looking statements are made as of today and we assume no obligation to update them going forward. following our prepared remarks, we will hold a q&a session.
now, i will turn the call over to boris elisman.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us. i will spend a few minutes with you in the second quarter results. most of my time will be used for an update on the impact of covid-19 on our business, actions taken in response and implications for the second half. neal will follow me with more color and details on the second quarter and provide additional comments on our cost reductions, balance sheet and expected use of cash in 2020. then we'll take your questions.
second quarter sales were down 29% to $367 million at the upper end of our guidance. our adjusted eps was $0.12, significantly above our estimates, largely from the aggressive cost reductions actions we took worldwide. all things considered, i'm pleased with our second quarter results. while every country is feeling economic effects from the pandemic, [indecipherable] our business in any one country depends on the range of factors, including where it is in the reopening phase, general seasonality of the business, government support, channel structure and others.
in general, the us, emea, australia, new zealand and asia did relatively well, especially as the quarter progressed, businesses reopened and government provided economic support to consumers and enterprises. canada and latin america had a more difficult quarter either due to later reopening in the case of canada or lack of government support in latin america. each month of the quarter improved sequentially in every region, and july has continued that trend.
our second quarter is always driven by our north america back-to-school sell-in. this quarter, our back-to-school results were as expected in the us, down modestly from last year's very strong performance. i'm especially pleased we sell into large math and e-commerce customers, which were comparable to last year. in addition, our us direct-to-consumer sales were up approximately 6%. several of our product categories and brands benefited from work-from-home, distance learning, focus on well-being and home leisure activities during the quarter. we had strong sales growth in trusens air purifiers, derwent colored pencils and kensington computer accessories, especially laptop docking stations. kensington branded products grew 28% in the quarter, and kensington is becoming a leading pc accessories partner for the major players in the pc ecosystem. we also saw good performance from five star notetaking products in the us, and rapid do-it-yourself tools in europe.
while some product categories and channels benefited from the current environment, those focused on businesses did not. our commercial sales were down significantly because of lower demand as many offices and schools closed in march and april because of covid-19 and the pace of the openings has been very different geographically. we have seen improved commercial sales in emea in june and july, but not in north america. most of our production and warehouse facilities have remained open during the quarter to meet customer demand as we were designated an essential business in most jurisdictions. although some facilities had reduced staff and hours, most of our office employees work from home during the second quarter and continue to do so now.
in february and march, we took early actions to protect the health and safety of our employees and to aggressively reduce costs to protect our business in the near-term. now that we have had more time to monitor and assess the situation, we believe that the global economic effects from the pandemic will continue for some time. therefore, we need to make more permanent and structural changes to our business to be successful in the changing world. these changes include additional cost reductions to offset lower demand, more aggressive repositioning of our business toward stronger brands and more consumer-centric product categories and accelerating investments in products and channels such as mass merchants, e-commerce and direct-to-consumer that are benefiting from the changing trends like working and education from home, buying online and greater focus on wellness.
this repositioning includes restructuring, which we initiated in north america and mexico. the $7 million in restructuring charges that we took in the quarter are expected to produce an annualized run rate savings of $11 million, part of which will be reinvested to support the brands, categories and channels that i just discussed. as we're making these changes and shifting from temporary to structural measures, we have also reinstated regular employee pay effective july 1. i want to thank our employees for their hard work and sacrifices during the quarter under very difficult conditions.
neal will give you additional details on the cost reductions that we undertook in the quarter, and that still remain in place. while we've not seen our business improve month-over-month, there is still a lot of uncertainty around when schools will reopen, when offices really open and when the virus will be contained enough for more normal economic activities to take place. i am confident we will withstand the current challenges. our management team has overcome difficult economic and industry conditions before, and we have made great strides over the years to create a more resilient and more profitable company. i also believe we need to take advantage of the opportunities that current environment creates to accelerate our transition to be more brand and consumer-centric company. we are a large diversified global company with a strong balance sheet and we deliver consistent, strong free cash flow.
given our financial strength and the proactive steps we have taken to reduce cost, we expect to be able to maintain good liquidity as we manage through the current environment. we have a long track record of evolving and coming out better and stronger as a valued partner to our customers and consumers, and i expect that to continue.
now, i will turn the call over to neal for a review of the segments, our outlook and other financial commentary, and then i'll rejoin him in answering your questions. neal?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, boris, and good morning, everyone. i'm going to discuss the impacts of covid-19 throughout my comments. those impacts include, among others, the financial and operational effects on our company, customers and end users of our products due to school and business closures, work-from-home orders, government orders and manufacturing, distribution, supply chain and other disruptions from covid-19.
our second quarter reported net sales decreased 29% due to lower demand from the impact of covid-19. as expected, april was our worst month. since then, we have seen good improvements in our sales in each month, including what we have seen thus far in july.
second quarter net income was $5 million or $0.06 per share. adjusted net income was $12 million and adjusted eps was $0.12. in the quarter, we benefited $0.01 from a lower share count. adjusted eps was better than our outlook based on our cost reduction efforts. our gross margin was 30% compared with 32% in 2019. the decrease was largely the result of unfavorable product mix, lower fixed cost absorption and increased reserves for inventory primarily because of lower demand from covid-19 impact.
sg&a expenses were $77 million compared with $96 million last year. sg&a as a percentage of sales was 21% compared with 18% primarily because of lower net sales. as we indicated in our first quarter earnings release, we took many cost reduction actions in response to covid-19 and participated in government assistance programs where we qualified in order to keep employees rather than having to make layoffs or pay reductions.
we anticipated $20 million in cost savings in the second quarter. we achieved $33 million of cost reductions from both short-term and long-term actions. in the second quarter, we took a restructuring charge of $7 million to reposition both our north america and mexico businesses, which includes permanent headcount reductions. those actions are expected to generate a savings run rate of $11 million on an annualized basis. some of those savings will be reinvested in the business.
reported operating income was $19 million compared with $61 million last year, and operating margin was 5% versus 12%. our adjusted tax rate of 28% was better than our anticipated 31% rate for the full year and reflects the impact of where we earned the income. the lower adjusted rate in this year's second quarter versus last year reflects the difference in the geographic mix of earnings.
now let's turn to some details of our segment results. net sales in north america decreased 25%. solid back-to-school sell-in was more than offset by declines in the commercial office products part of the business, largely reflected of covid-19 impacts, as well as timing for part of the canadian back-to-school sell-in that moved to july. in the quarter, we saw strong sales growth in our kensington computer accessories business and trusens air purifiers. north america operating income and operating margin declined as a result of the lower sales, unfavorable mix and increased slow-moving inventory reserves. these factors were partially offset by cost reduction.
we will monitor sell-out for back-to-school products in the third quarter. we expect most students will go back to school in the fall. there may be some variation in the timing of school openings versus normal or combinations of school and remote learning, but we expect most children will need to replenish their school supplies.
now let's turn to emea. net sales decreased 31% to $88 million from covid-19 impacts, which began in mid-march. europe was the first area hit by the virus and has been earlier to recover. we have now seen three months of sequential improvement with stronger recovery in our sales of commercial office products than we have seen in north america. emea posted a small adjusted operating loss as a result of the lower sales and higher bad debt reserves. these were partially offset by cost savings.
moving to the international segment. net sales and comparable sales declined significantly because of lower demand from the impact of covid-19, especially in latin america. mexico and brazil continue to be significantly impacted by covid-19, whereas our businesses in australia and new zealand and asia recovered more each month as the second quarter progressed, similar to what we saw in emea. as a result of very low sales in the quarter, this segment posted an adjusted operating loss of $3 million. results were also hurt by adverse customer and product mix, higher bad debt reserves, and lower fixed cost absorption partially offset by cost reductions. foroni posted a loss of $2 million from the impact of covid-19, and it is also a seasonally low period for brazil.
let's move now to our balance sheet and cash flow. in the second quarter, we used approximately $42 million in net cash from operating activities and had $44 million of free cash outflow. we paid dividends of $6 million and capex was only $2 million. as we noted in our first quarter release, the planned use of free cash flow for the remainder of 2020 will be to fund our dividend and to reduce debt. we do not plan to repurchase shares for the remainder of the year. our capex outlook for 2020 is $20 million, and we have spent $9 million year-to-date. at quarter end, we had used $257 million of our $600 million revolving credit facility, primarily for seasonal borrowings. we also had $129 million in cash on hand. the net leverage ratio was 3.48 times, which is well under our debt covenant.
now let's turn to our outlook. it is difficult to forecast in this environment, because there are so many moving pieces. thus, we do not feel we know enough to give a full year outlook. our second half demand is expected to continue to be down compared with last year, especially in the commercial office products area. we have better visibility near-term and our third quarter outlook is for a sales decline in the range of 15% to 20%. third quarter adjusted eps is expected to be in the range of $0.13 to $0.19. the third quarter outlook includes an adverse foreign exchange impact of 1% to 2% on sales and a negative $0.01 impact on adjusted eps. we expect our cost reduction actions combined with our normal productivity programs will deliver approximately $15 million in additional third quarter expense savings compared with last year.
our third quarter cost reductions include the benefits of recent restructuring decisions as well as actions we took earlier this year, including lower incentive accruals, postponement of 2020 merit increases, suspension of the 401(k) match, furloughs, temporary layoffs and reduced hours for reduced pay arrangements.
we have ceased almost all travel and continue to postpone discretionary spending and some product development focused on commercial customers. we feel confident that we can generate at least $120 million of operating cash flow for the full year and, with capex expected to be $20 million, we will generate at least $100 million in free cash flow. we are experiencing an increased level of late payments from customers in certain areas and have increased our bad debt reserves by $4 million in the second quarter.
our south american and mexican customers, along with the wholesaler insolvency in emea, are the main concerns. we are actively managing our receivables and will restrict our own sales to mitigate our risk, if necessary. inventory should now continue to decrease as we ship the remainder of north america back-to-school products and continue to rightsize our non-seasonal inventory for the anticipated lower demand environment.
now let's move to the q&a where boris and i will be happy to take your questions. operator?

[operator instructions]. our first question comes from chris mcginnis of sidoti & company. your line is open.
christopher mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
good morning. thank you for taking my questions and nice quarter. let me start off -- boris you mentioned some market share gains, can you just talk about the competitive landscape in this environment and your ability to go out and continue to gain share and the strength of that position that you have in the marketplace? thanks.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure, chris. we saw market share gains in several areas. in europe, we gained market share pretty much throughout as we mentioned. our business declined about 2% organically, and certainly, the industry has done worse than that and we have specific information in some countries on categories like shredders, where we've gained substantial market share during the quarter.
if we look at our computer accessories business, kensington, which grew high double-digits globally and over 100% in north america. again certainly, we gained market share there as the industry has not grown by such a large amount and based on our preliminary information, we don't have the final information yet, but based on our preliminary information, we also gained market share in note-taking for our five star products in north america. so it has been pretty broad.
christopher mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
great. and just one quick follow-up. neal i think you mentioned -- you highlighted somewhat, where you're worried about some payables. anything in north america that you're seeing, just when you think about kind of the difficult environment here as well?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, generally north america, australia, asia, emea, with the one exception of the wholesaler insolvency in emea, has returned to normal payables levels.

our next question comes from joe gomes of noble capital. your line is open.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
good morning and thanks for taking the question.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, joe.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
i just wanted to jump to the guidance real quick. so, for the fourth quarter you're talking about revenues down in the 15% to 20% range year-over-year, which is good. the same you had for the third quarter guidance. but you also mentioned that back-to-school has been pushed, you think, into the fourth quarter here. so, just wondering if we're seeing -- going to see some back-to-school sales in the fourth quarter, which we normally don't; why no improvement in the guidance? are you just being conservative, or is there something else there that has you concerned?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks for the question, joe. i think we're being fairly balanced in our guidance. we do expect back-to-school sales and sell-out to be stronger in the fourth quarter, but it's a relatively small part of the quarter. the commercial business in north america, for example, plays a much bigger weight and we expect that to be down because people are still working remotely.
in addition, we had a large deal with kensington in the third quarter which added a lot to the sales in the quarter and we don't anticipate that will repeat in the fourth quarter. so, we think net-net the minus 15% to minus 20% revenue guidance is fairly balanced as all of those things, as well as our anticipation of emea doing fairly well and some back-to-school weaknesses in international.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
okay. and one quick follow-up. thanks for that, boris. i think in last -- the second quarter you had mentioned that you had seen sequential monthly improvement in the top line. did that continue into the third quarter in all the regions, or was that more region-specific in the third quarter about monthly sequential improvement? thanks.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
neal?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so, as a generalism, yes it did, although some months were a little stronger than others just because of when back-to-school shipments occurred in north america. but emea improved every single month in a row. and again, in international, just the mix in different countries is a little different month-to-month. but if you look under the hood, it was more similar to the second quarter, but a steady improvement. so generally, in the two core markets, we did see an improvement. in international, it was more choppy, particularly because of the reimposition of the lockdown in australia that occurred mid-quarter.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
okay, thank you. so, i'll get back in queue.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer

our next question comes from brad thomas of keybanc capital markets. your line is open.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi. good morning, boris and neal. thanks for taking my question. i was hoping you could just share some insights about what you hear as you talk to your customers and they are talking to offices and employees about what it's like when they go back to work. what are you seeing in terms of reorders and restocking at the office? are we starting to see offices place orders and restock inventory? how is it playing out as people have gone back to work really out in the field there?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, brad. we're not seeing much movement there. it's pretty much status quo. we still see the majority of employees in north america, white-collar employees in north america still working from home. and there were expectations of people coming back, for example, in early september after labor day, but we haven't seen that. things are seemingly being pushed out and pushed out. so, in our guidance, we will assume that the environment stays as it is.
it's similar trends internationally. canada is very similar to the u.s.; and in other countries, it really depends on the circumstances. certainly, in europe, more people are going back to the offices at least a few days a week than we're seeing here in the u.s. australia also has a lot of people working from home. so again, our assumptions are things are how they are today.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got you. and boris, just to come back to the question of guidance, obviously each quarter through the year you have sort of a different channel mix and geography mix that's going on that can influence how the enterprise performs. when you think about the different segments, are there any segments or channels where you're expecting a slowdown to occur in the fourth quarter, or is the slowdown in aggregate really just a function of how the mix plays out for the fourth quarter?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, it's really a function of the mix. as neal mentioned in his prepared remarks, the most troubled channel for us is the commercial office channel in north america. and we generally see that being a larger part of our sales mix both in the first quarter and the fourth quarter. and just because of how the numbers come together, that's really the influence that takes the number down from 12% that we saw in the third quarter down to 15% to 20%.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and brad, there's also the southern hemisphere back-to-school, which occurs across basically our calendar year-end. and in brazil, in particular, with the decision to delay school starts until after their own election in brazil, we definitely will see back-to-school push back significantly later, and that means it will push out of q4 into q1.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
yes. and if i could squeeze one more in here. as we think out to 2021, obviously, you'll have some pretty easy comparisons. and hopefully, the world starts to get back to normal. how should we think about the flow-through to the bottom line for you all as you hopefully start to grow sales again and the degree to which some of the costs that you've taken out can stay out? and again, just what kind of a contribution margin you may be able to get from each point of sales growth you can generate next year?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
let me answer the first part of that and i'll let neal comment on the contribution margin flow through. if you are correct -- and that's a big if. if you're correct, if things start improving in 2021, then we still expect q1 to be a tough comp given that last year -- or this year we didn't have covid. we certainly expect, regardless of the improvement, next year to have a covid impact. so, i think q1 will be challenged. but then if things improve, we certainly do expect some growth -- sales growth in the rest of the year.
and i'll let neal comment on the flow-through margin growth or contribution margin growth on sales.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i mean, clearly, brad, there are various things going on within the business. obviously, we're topline-dependent. and the more our top line improves, the more we will leverage the cost base that we have. we have also had a year where some of our costs are temporarily reduced as opposed to permanently reduced. and so, as we come out of this year, there are a lot of puts and takes. i would anticipate having a lot less bad debt, and obviously, inventory reserves to take. they're $11 million after nine months year-to-date, that's a good example. but by contrast, i would anticipate, hopefully we will earn a management incentive next year, which we didn't earn this year.
so, many ups and downs. but generally, as boris said, if our sales continue to improve particularly in q2, q3 and q4, we would anticipate, obviously, leveraging through additional profits.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
very helpful. thank you, guys, so much.

kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
hey, good morning. just wondering how you're thinking about as you look to 2021 incremental actions to reduce the cost base relative to what you've already done?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, thanks kevin. i anticipate we will be reducing our costs further in 2021. very pleased with the reductions we have done so far. but still in some of our geographies we have opportunities to realign our cost structure to the expected side of the business. neal mentioned the difficulties we expect in latin america. so, that's an opportunity for us. and i also think we could continue to streamline how we manage things in north america as well in particular. so, i do expect that there's further opportunities to reduce cost in 2021.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay. that's all i had for now. thanks.

our next question comes from william reuter of bank of america. your line is open.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
hi. in terms of the gross margin pressure, you talked about mix. was this just the large deal that you had with kensington? and, i guess, does that mean that the outlook will be more favorable than what we saw on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
there are a combination of things. so, yes, within kensington that was part of the drag on mix. two reasons really. one, kensington's various highest margin, kind of, commercial products sold less. and additionally, they sold a lot more of contract purchases, which as you would imagine are going to be lower than average margin.
so, that was one of the drivers, but also other things that impacted gross margin were just high, obviously, inventory charges and low absorption in the plants, as we need to kind of get our volumes and our cost structure aligned appropriately in those areas. and so, there were more factors than just what was in the sales mix, which i think is important to understand.
but we do see higher gross margins, typically, in the fourth quarter and we do anticipate that the gross margins in the fourth quarter will be higher than what we saw in the third quarter.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
yes, that makes sense. and then, just one follow-up for me. with regard to the delayed sell-through of back-to-school products, it sounds like you believe that that 70% number of kids learning virtually has improved since then. i guess, when you talk to your retail customers, how have they dealt with the excess of supply? do they think that they're able to sell-through at all this season? and i guess, do you think it might have impacts on 2021 back-to-school in north america?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's a good question, bill. the answer is, it's mixed. it depends on the particular reseller. obviously, retailers will continue to carry the full assortment and continue to sell as demand goes for the back-to-school products.
and with brick-and-mortar stores, some have taken their back-to-school assortments and put it in line, so they will be able to fulfill most of the demand throughout the fall and even winters. and others have put them in storage and that will reset again next year. in those particular cases, we do expect that that will affect -- somewhat affect the demand next year for back-to-school products.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
great. all right. thanks. i'll pass to others.

our next question comes from hale holden of barclays. your line is open.
hale holden -- barclays -- analyst
thanks for taking my call. boris, i had two, i guess for you. the first one is, you mentioned in your script talking about changes in go-to-market for when you get out of the pandemic period. and i was wondering if you could talk a little bit more further about what you're thinking and what potentially that could do to change the margin structure of the company?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, sure. i mean, we're continuing to invest in the channels that are preferred by consumers. and really that means working closer with online resellers, both obviously amazon, but also a lot of the local and regional resellers, online resellers we have throughout the world. and it also means developing our own internal d2c, direct-to-consumer capabilities to be able to fulfill directly for consumers.
so, those are the primary areas. we are going to continue to work with the independent dealers. that's a big channel for us in many countries. they are selling to small and local businesses and their important channel continued to do well. but some of the corporate and commercial resellers who we expect to still be challenged, it means we have to be cautious how much we invest in those particular channels, because we do believe that regardless, their sales will still be down in the next few quarters.
hale holden -- barclays -- analyst
got it. and then my second question is with -- i mean, you guys mentioned that you were gaining share with five-star and kensington. but with industry capacity now pretty high and volumes fairly low, would you expect to see capacity away from you, potentially filled by more private label players or increased competition from private label players, or does just the lower sales volume preclude that?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i think it's a hard question to answer and it really depends on the state of the reseller and the channel. we find that in this environment brands really matter. and we think that one of the reasons we've done well with five-star, we've done well with leitz and some of our other strong brands is that in times of distress and uncertainty, both consumers and resellers prefer well-known, tried and true brands that they're comfortable with, that they know will both sell and they know will be there tomorrow to support their needs. so, that's a big plus for us given our portfolio of strong brands.
on the other hand, we do have some retailers that are just managing for cash flow and margin that have no objectives of growing sales for their stores. they're just trying to service their debt. and those retailers, i think, will be putting in more private label just to manage for the short-term because they don't have any longer-term aspirations to participate in the market.
so, it really depends on the general partner that we're talking about. overall, we're very pleased with how we performed. we think our brands are taking share and we think that given the strength of our brands, that will continue to be the case as we go forward.
hale holden -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you so much.

our next question comes from bill chappell of truist securities. your line is open.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks. good morning.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, bill.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
hey, boris, just a kind of -- if i told you a year ago that 70% of the schools in the u.s. would go back -- going to be virtual for the third quarter, would you have expected sales to only be down 12%?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
so, help me understand --
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
[speech overlap]
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
yes. i mean, is that fairly indicative of the category as well? is it just the preparation, or is it just you feel like you were well prepared for it better than most?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i think we were well prepared for it. i think we have a very broad and diverse product line. we're not depending on any one category or any one geography. certainly, back-to-school is an important season for us, but it's not the only thing that we sell. and some of the back-to-school weakness was offset by our strong performance in kensington, globally and particularly in north america, and very strong performance in emea.
so, you're absolutely right. i mean, with such large numbers of students working from home, one would have expected a much bigger effect on the demand. but because of the diverse portfolio and the diverse geography of the products and channels that we sell to, we're able to offset some of those weaknesses with other categories and other countries.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. and then, looking at the separate side of the business, i mean, i think you alluded to it on a prior question. but as you look at kind of office space in the u.s. and in europe to some extent, shrinking over time, as people go virtual forever or different kind of work methods; are you relooking at your -- that part of the business for the next few years in terms of how to go-to-market there? i know you talked about the next few quarters, but it would seem like some of that business will dramatically change -- sort of, structurally change.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no, absolutely, bill. i think that's an excellent question. and we are. we are looking at that. we think that there will be permanent structural changes in how end users buy products and which products they buy. and we're looking at addressing that both organically by investing in certain categories and certain channels that i already discussed, and investing less in certain others.
and we're also continuing to look at acquisitions. we've talked about this with investors for several years now. we believe that acquisitions are an important part of our strategy to reshape our business to be more consumer-centric, be more end-user driven. and as we think about the future, that's also part of our strategic mix.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. and the last one for me. you might have talked about this, but what's kind of the percentage of, you would say, back-to-school in europe was? because it seems at least at the end of the last year they were all largely back-to-school, and i think in september, i mean, i know it's a later start, that we're getting back-to-school. so, i mean, how is that running -- obviously, u.s. is much worse, but how does that compare versus expectations?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
europe was -- they all went to school. everybody went back-to-school on september 1.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
yes.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
so, it's -- in u.s., it's -- 70% work remotely. in europe, if i look at -- certainly, k-8, it was 100%. maybe some of the laissez and kind of high schools were in a hybrid mode. and certainly, college and universities are more in a hybrid mode. but if you look at primary, middle and most high schools, they went to school 100%.
right now, given the increased spike in covid, i mean, certain countries are relooking at that. but certainly, as far as q3 was concerned for us, there was no impact for any back-to-school delays in europe.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
great. thanks so much.

our next question comes from hamed khorsand of bws financial. your line is open.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
hi. good morning. boris, you have been talking about the change in the product scope this past year ever since covid. do you think you have the right cost structure in place for the consumer-oriented products? and if you were to go back to more office-centric products, what would the cost implications be? and could you make that switch quickly?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i do think that we have the right cost structure in place for either kind. i certainly do expect that as our mix shifts more to consumer, our gross margins will go up and our marketing spend will go up as well. but that's a lot easier position to be and to increase spend of our gross margins rise than to be in a position to constantly reduce costs.
so, i'm glad that we're doing all this work now to have an opportunity to incrementally add spend toward demand generation as we get into the consumer space.
did i answer your question, hamed, or did you have a second part that i didn't answer?
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
the second part, as far as being able to, how quickly can you revert back to the commercial equipment?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we could. we are -- i don't believe we're making anything, any changes that are very, very permanent. although, we do believe that the behavior is changing and we do believe that the demand for these sorts of products is not going to come back for at least a while. it's very difficult to predict what's going to happen a long time from now. but in the shorter to medium-term, we believe that there will be a residual effect from covid in terms of many more people working on a hybrid or remote types of environment. so overall, net-net, demand for some of these in-office products will be down.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. thank you.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, hamed.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the third quarter 2020 acco brands corporation's earnings conference call. [operator instructions].
and i will now hand the conference over to your speaker today, christine hanneman. you may begin.
christine hanneman -- senior director, investor relations
good morning. this is christine hanneman, senior director of investor relations. welcome to acco brands third quarter 2020 conference call. speaking on the call today are boris elisman, chairman, president and chief executive officer of acco brands corporation; and neal fenwick, executive vice president and chief financial officer. slides that accompany this call have been posted to the investor relations section of accobrands.com.
when speaking about our results, we may refer to adjusted results. adjusted results exclude transaction, integration and restructuring costs, and reflect an adjusted tax rate. schedules of adjusted results and other non-gaap financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures are in the earnings release and slides that accompany this call. due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts, we do not reconcile our forward looking adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow, net leverage ratio or adjusted tax rate guidance. forward-looking statements made during the call, including statements concerning the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on the company, are based on the beliefs and assumptions of management based on information available to us at the time the statements are made. our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially.
among the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, are the scope and duration of the covid-19 pandemic, government actions and third party responses to it and the consequences for the global economy, as well as the regional and local economies in which we operate, uncertainties regarding how geographies, distribution channels, and consumer behavior will evolve over time in response to the pandemic, and its impact on our business operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
please refer to our earnings release and sec filings for an explanation of certain of these risk factors and assumptions. our forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we assume no obligation to update them going forward. following our prepared remarks, we will hold a q&a session.
now i will turn the call over to boris elisman.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us. i will spend a few minutes reviewing the third quarter results, including the impact of covid-19 in our business and implications for the fourth quarter. neal will follow me with more color and details on the third quarter and provide additional comments on our cost reductions, balance sheet and cash outlook. then we'll take your questions.
i'm very pleased with our third quarter results. net sales declined at a lesser rate than we expected, down 12% versus prior year to $444 million. that's a substantial improvement over the second quarter, when sales declined 29%. our adjusted eps was $0.19 at the high end of our guidance, as we benefited from relatively better sales and broad cost reduction actions we have taken worldwide.
while the economic environment improved in the third quarter compared with the second quarter, we are still in the middle of the worst recession of our lifetimes, with demand for our products being impacted in many geographies by remote education, working from home, high unemployment, and low business confidence. this makes our third quarter results that much more impressive. they demonstrate the strength, breadth and balance of our global business and product portfolio. we are not dependent on any one area for success, and have done a good job, partially mitigating channel customer or product line declines with growth somewhere else.
the parts of our product portfolio, that are focused on consumers, technology or home usage had strong demand. we saw good sales growth in kensington computer accessories, especially laptop docking stations, trusens air purifiers, diy tools and derwent art supplies. areas that are focused on in office or in school use had lower demand. sales of large whiteboards, bulletin boards, large shredders and laminators, binding machines and binders were soft.
online and technology channels did really well. while traditional brick and mortar stores and resellers were impacted by weaker back-to-school demand, reduced store traffic and lower business demand. we also did an excellent job managing expenses, reducing them by $20 million in the quarter and $63 million since the beginning of the year. again, i'm very pleased with our results.
overall, emea had a strong quarter and north america, asia and australia-new zealand did relatively well. during the third quarter, more businesses reopened, some students return to physical schools, and many governments continue to provide economic support to consumers and companies. as more people return to schools and offices, our sales recovery increased.
in europe, we had the strongest sales recovery, with comparable sales down only 2% in the quarter. despite its current challenges, europe managed the economic impact of the pandemic better, than our other geographies. most european countries have reopened. schools restarted in person on september 1 throughout the area, and many employees went to their offices, at least for a few days a week. but it is not just the improved environment that is the reason of our strong performance in emea. our teams did a great job servicing and calling on customers throughout the pandemic. we stayed open and supported them, where many of our competitors couldn't or wouldn't. as a result, we gained more business and took market share in the third quarter. we saw good growth in the manual shredders, diy tools, lamination and signage products, all categories that are seeing increased demand, due to the pandemic. we also introduced new products, such as partitions, to meet demand for social distancing at the office. i'm very pleased with our results in emea.
north america had a less robust, but still good quarter, especially when considering the environment. third quarter sales were negatively impacted by remote back to school starts in the u.s., industry estimates that 70% of k-12 students in the u.s., were not participating in in-person learning in the third quarter. that number in canada was approximately 40%. this situation reduced demand for school products in the quarter, as more students go back to in-person education in the fourth quarter, we believe the demand for school products will extend beyond its traditional summer season, well into the fall and even winter.
while overall back to school sales were down, we believe we have maintained or taken share in the note-taking category, led by our five star brands. kensington had an outstanding quarter in north america, growing over 100% year-on-year from the strength of a large deal and a strong demand for work-from-home products. our third quarter was down significantly in latin america, because schools are still closed in brazil, and operating remotely in mexico. we expect difficulties in latin america to continue in the fourth quarter, and through the early part of next year. all of our production and warehouse facilities have remained open in the quarter, to the extent necessary to meet customer demand. most of our office employees worked from home during the third quarter, and continue to do so now.
while we have seen our business improve, there is still a lot of uncertainty around when offices and schools will fully reopen, and when the virus will be contained enough, for more normal economic activity to take place.
we continue to adapt our strategy to respond to both challenges and opportunities in the current environment, as we expect the economic recovery to take quite some time. we are assuming a shift in consumer behavior post-recovery, and we are changing product and channel portfolio investments as a result. we are increasing support of trusens, our wellness products brand, by launching specialty air filters, that target flu, allergies, pet odors and smoke. you will see other trusens wellness products launching later this year, and next year, to build upon our strong momentum. our kensington line is also adding new work-from-home items and has a solid pipeline of customer orders. we will be expanding our line of personal shredders, to appeal to increasing work-from-home needs, and we're investing in our direct e-commerce capabilities, to satisfy growing consumer demand for direct fulfillment.
on the other side, we are reducing our investments in some of the commercial office products. such as wide format laminators and large whiteboards, as we expect demand for such products to remain weak. we are confident, we will withstand the current challenges. we also believe, we need to take advantage of the opportunities the current environment creates, to accelerate our transition to a more brand and consumer-centric company. we are pleased with our progress thus far, and we'll continue to work to accelerate the pace of this transformation.
we are a large, diversified global company, with a strong balance sheet and we deliver consistent, strong free cash flow. given our financial strength, and the proactive steps we have taken to reduce costs, we expect to be able to maintain good liquidity, as we manage through the current environment. our management team has overcome difficult economic and industry conditions before, and we have made great strides over the years, to create a more resilient and more profitable company. i expect that to continue.
now, i will turn the call over to neal for a review of the segments, our outlook and other financial commentary, and then, i'll join him in answering your questions. neal?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, boris, and good morning everyone. i'm going to discuss the impacts of covid-19 throughout my comments. those impacts include the operational, financial and other effects on acco brands, its customers, end users of its products, school and business closures, work-from-home remote and hybrid learning, government orders, manufacturing distribution, supply chain disruption, resulting from covid-19. and the actions of acco brands, its customers, and end users have taken in response to the pandemic, including actions we have taken to manage our inventory and credit risk under the circumstances.
our third quarter reported net sales decreased 12%, due to lower demand from the impact of covid-19. as boris noted, we saw strong sales growth in product lines, that focus on work and school from home, such as our kensington computer accessories and trusens air purifiers. the north america back to school sell-out was sluggish, and its commercial sales remain weak.
third quarter net income was $19 million or $0.20 per share. adjusted net income was $18 million, and adjusted eps was $0.19. adjusted eps was at the high end of our outlook, based on better relative sales and our cost reduction efforts. our gross margin was almost 29%, compared with 31% in 2019. the decrease was largely the result of declines in north america and international, from unfavorable product mix and lower fixed cost absorption, primarily because of lower demand.
sg&a expenses were $84 million, compared with $96 million last year. sg&a as a percent of sales was 19%, flat with last year, primarily because of cost reduction efforts, offset sales deleveraging. as we indicated in our first and second quarter earnings releases, we have taken many cost reduction actions in response to covid-19 and participated in government assistance programs, when we qualified, so as to keep employees rather, than implementing layoffs or furloughs.
in february and march, we took early temporary actions to protect the health and safety of our employees, and to aggressively reduce costs to protect our business in the near term.
in the second quarter, we announced a restructuring charge to take more permanent and structural changes to our business, including headcount reductions, which we initiated in north america and mexico in the third quarter. the $7 million restructuring charge that we took in the second quarter, is expected to produce an annualized run rate savings of $11 million.
in the third quarter, we achieved $20 million in total for both normal productivity and additional cost reductions, including, one quarter of benefits from the second quarter restructuring actions.
moving on, adjusted operating income was $35 million compared to $52 million last year, due to lower sales, lower fixed cost absorption, and additional provisions for bad debt expenses. the adjusted operating margin was 8% versus 10%. our adjusted tax rate was 30%. the higher adjusted tax rate this quarter versus last year's third quarter, reflects differences in the level and geographic location of the earnings.
now let's turn to some details of our segment results. net sales in north america decreased 12%. sellout for back-to-school products was hurt by learning in a fully remote or hybrid spaces. as noted earlier, the timing of purchases shifted to later in the third quarter, and we expect back-to-school sales to continue throughout the fourth quarter, as e-tailers and some retailers have retained their back-to-school sets, in anticipation of students purchases continuing.
sales of kensington computer accessories in north america, were more than double the prior year third quarter, because of the shipment of a large contract order. the strong sales of computer accessories, helped to offset the weaker back-to-school sales. as expected, commercial sales remained weak, as many offices in north america were closed or had limited openings.
north america adjusted operating income was $23 million versus $36 million last year and adjusted operating margin was 10% compared with 13%. the decline was a result of lower sales, unfavorable mix and unfavorable cost absorption. these factors were partially offset by cost reduction.
now let's turn to emea, which had a strong quarter. net sales increased 3% to $136 million, as a result of favorable foreign exchange. comparable sales were down approximately 2%, due to the impact of covid-19. these reduced impacts were largely offset by growth in light personal shredders, trusens air purifiers, diy tools and kensington computer accessories. emea experienced a much stronger level of demand in the third quarter, compared with the second quarter, as commercial businesses and consumers were under significantly fewer covid-19 restrictions, and many offices and schools reopened throughout europe. we have now seen several months of improvement, with good recovery in our sales of commercial products. emea posted an adjusted operating profit of $17 million versus $14 million last year, as a result of cost savings. adjusted operating margin was 12% versus 10% last year.
moving to the international segment, net sales declined significantly, similar to the second quarter, because of low demand from the impact of covid-19. mexico and brazil continue to be significantly impacted by covid-19, as many schools and offices in both countries remain closed. the current expectation is that this will continue throughout the rest of 2020, and into the first half of 2021.
australia sales decreased due to the lockdown down of the state of victoria due to covid-19. the lockdown has now been rescinded, and we expect to see improved demand in the fourth quarter. asia sales were down to a lesser extent than in the second quarter. international adjusted operating income was $4 million compared with $11 million last year, as a result of the lower sales. profits were also hurt by adverse customer and product mix, higher bad debt reserves, and lower fixed cost absorption, partially offset by cost reduction and price increases.
let's move now to our balance sheet and cash flow. in the third quarter, we generated approximately $89 million in net cash from operating activities and had $86 million of free cash flow. we paid dividends of $6 million and capex of $3 million. as we noted in our first quarter release, we do not plan to repurchase shares for the remainder of the year.
longer term, we plan to use our free cash flow to fund our dividend, reduce debt, repurchase shares and make acquisitions. our capex outlook for 2020 is less than $20 million, and we have spent $12 million year-to-date.
during the quarter, we repaid $124 million in debt. at quarter end, we had used $134 million of our $600 million revolving credit facility, primarily to seasonal borrowings and had $86 million in cash on-hand. our net leverage ratio was 3.45 times, which is well under our debt covenant.
now let's turn to our outlook; it continues to be difficult to forecast in this environment because there is much uncertainty related to the economy, as well as the implications of new covid-19 flare-ups. our fourth quarter demand is expected to continue to be down compared to the last year, especially in the commercial office products area in north america.
latin america continues to struggle, and we expect brazil's back-to-school season to be smaller and to ship later, with normal december sales slipping into january. australia is likely to improve, now that the victoria lockdown has been lifted, but we still anticipate international to be our most challenged segment.
the recent increases in covid-19 cases in europe is making it the hardest segment to forecast. nevertheless, we currently anticipate that year-over-year, it will still be the least adversely impacted segment.
we don't see a catalyst for additional economic improvement in the fourth quarter. likewise, fourth quarter seasonality in our north american business is skewed toward commercial products, which remain weak. emea typically has seasonally strong fourth quarter commercial sales, which we anticipate will help offset some of the softness in north america and latin america. we are cognizant of the rapidly developing situation of covid-19 in emea and cannot guarantee that it could not also negatively impact our results.
our fourth quarter outlook is a sales decline in the range of 15% to 20%. fourth quarter adjusted eps are expected to be in the range of $0.26 to $0.32. the outlook includes an adverse foreign exchange impact of 2% on sales and $0.02 on adjusted eps. we expect our cost reduction actions combined with our normal productivity programs will deliver approximately $15 million in additional fourth quarter expense savings compared with last year.
with respect to achieving our cash flow outlook, we feel confident that we can generate at least $120 million of operating cash flow for the full year and with capex expected to be below $20 million, we expect to generate above $100 million in free cash flow. we continue to experience increased level of late payments from customers in certain international and export markets, and have increased our bad debt reserves almost $3 million in the third quarter and $6 million year-to-date. our south american and mexican customers, along with the wholesaler insolvency in emea, are the main concerns. we are actively managing our receivables and will continue to restrict our own sales to mitigate our risk as necessary.
in the third quarter, we took a $6 million provision for slow moving inventory, which is similar to last year's third quarter. on a year-to-date basis, it is almost $5 million higher than 2019 levels.
now let's move on to q&a, where boris and i will be happy to take your questions. operator?

thank you. [operator instructions] your first question comes from chris mcginnis from sidoti & company. your line is open.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
yes, good morning. thanks for taking my questions. i know it's very clear. i know it's early boris, but i just want to ask back for maybe the conversations you're having with retailers now and it seems like it should be a bit more positive year than 2019 and hopefully the last year? then i also just want to ask about the change in e-commerce. how does that shift the buying patterns and can you just explain your thoughts around, the back-to-school for north america this upcoming year and any color you can provide on that? thank you.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, thanks for the question, chris. it is a little bit too early for back-to-school, but let me share with you how we're thinking about it. we do think that north america back-to-school will be much more skewed toward physical presence of school children. if you remember last year and we talked about back-to-school, in q3 we said that around 75% were remote, or hybrid and only 25% were going to school physically. we believe that the numbers will probably be reversed. again, this is our -- i currently believe it is a fluid situation by certainly what we are hearing it is pointing that way. retailers do have carryover inventory that they have from last season because the sell out was weak.
so we expect as a result of that and all of the uncertainty they'll be fairly conservative, and they are upfront our purchases and then as they see the sellout they will chase the supply, which will likely benefit domestic manufacturers such as acco brands. so, there's nothing more specific that we can provide at this point, because due to all the uncertainty some of the decisions are being delayed until later times and [phonetic] more clarity is provided. but that's kind of how we're thinking about it, going into it.
as far as e-commerce is concerned, as neal mentioned, for us it was a big winner in 2020 with 17% of growth in that channel for the year. all the trends there continue. we think e-commerce will continue to be a winner in 2021, both overall, but also for back-to-school, they were a big winner for back-to-school as well and that should continue and we are well positioned to benefit from growth in e-commerce, both third party e-commerce players, as well as our own direct-to-consumer sales.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst

and your next question will come from bradley thomas from keybanc capital market. your line is open.
andrew dodd -- keybanc capital market -- analyst
good morning. this is andrew [phonetic] on for brad. i just wanted to talk about, we've all heard the news that staples has proposed to acquire office depot, was wondering if you could remind us how big those customers are to you and what level of risk might there be if that deal came to fruition?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
both customers are less than 10% for us. so you know, beyond that, we don't really provide details, but they are significantly smaller than they used to be. we think if something were to happen there, the risk is very manageable. we are assuming for the next forecasting period, that sales in that particular channel will continue to decline. so if they decline a little bit more, as a result of any potential combination, we think we can manage that pretty well.
andrew dodd -- keybanc capital market -- analyst
understood, thank you. i will jump back in the queue.

and your next question will come from joe gomes from nobel capital. your line is open.
joe gomes -- nobel capital -- analyst
good morning, boris and neal. thanks for taking the question.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, joe.
joe gomes -- nobel capital -- analyst
i was wondering [phonetic], emea had a really nice quarter relative to what's going on here, but toward the end of the year now here into the, obviously into january we were seeing the new stories of new types of virus strains, especially in the uk. just kind of, if you could kind of go over the quarter, did you see monthly sequential improvement and how has that kind of played out so far here in the first quarter? is it kind of stalled due to some more of these new variants of the virus coming out? thank you.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, joe. emea continues to perform really well, continued to perform really well in the second half of the year and that was certainly the case in q4, where their sales were down slightly over 1% versus 2019. there are several factors that benefit us in emea. the fact that we sell to 27 different countries, and we're not dependent on any one to execute flawlessly is a big benefit. very fragmented channel structure is a big benefit.
how the european governments have managed the pandemic, and especially the support they provided to employment to keeping people employed, is a big benefit. the fact that much of our sales, around 40% of our sales in emea take place in germany and germany is one of the countries that best managed the pandemic. and the job that our team has done, both in supporting customers through these difficult times and becoming a de facto go to company during these difficult times, as well as the emphasis we have on growth initiatives in emea and they are fairly broad compared to some of our other regions, so all of those in combinations portend really well for us and we're six weeks into 2021. and that momentum that we had in the second half of the year and in q4 in emea certainly has continued into the initial couple of weeks of about 2021.
joe gomes -- nobel capital -- analyst
thanks for that boris. i'll get back in queue.

and your next question will come from kevin steinke from barrington research. your line is open.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
good morning. neal, in your prepared comments, you talked about the reinstating incentive compensation in 2021 and also growth initiatives this year. and then also the $30 million to $40 million of savings you expect, i'm just trying to get a sense for the size of the incentive compensation and growth initiatives, how much we should expect that to be in terms of increased expense versus 2020?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, i guess the first point is it will be variable depending on our performance, because all of our incentives are, but it is a headwind year-over-year and it's a significant one in the kind of double-digit millions. so closer toward 17-ish [phonetic] million in terms of total headwind assuming that we hit all of our performance targets. and, it's an important piece of the momentum that we expect to see in the business is getting the worldwide teams focused on growing the business again. it's for the full year, obviously, that impact and it will have an impact each quarter, but the business hopefully will be recovering to drive that.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay, great. that's very helpful. thanks for taking the questions.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, kevin.
operator
your next question will come from hale holden from barclays. your line is open.
hale holden -- barclays -- analyst
good morning, thanks for taking my call. i just had two questions. in the slide deck, you called out some commodity costs, headwinds or input cost headwinds and i was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on that? and then, in the presentation boris, you talked a little bit about how reopening in australia had gone well, once victoria had lifted restrictions, and i was wondering, if there are any takeaways we could get from that for what the broader business could look like when restrictions fall away?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure, regarding inflation, and i'll let neal add to that as well, but right now, what we're seeing driving the most inflation is supply chain costs associated with product coming from asia to the other parts of the world. there's a container shortage in china as a result of the imbalance and trade between what's coming in, into china, what's going out of china and that's driving huge increases in container costs and inbound freight and we're seeing that throughout the world, in us and in europe, and in other parts of the world. we expect those costs to stay elevated in the near term. hopefully, they'll decline in the second half of the year, but certainly in the near term, we expect them to stay elevated. that's what's driving the fairly significant inflation that we're seeing right now.
as far as other commodities are concerned, it's been fairly benign, although certainly oil is up compared to the prior year, so that's going to drive some level of inflation. and then, people costs, as neal answered to a previous question will certainly be a source of inflation as well. neal, do have anything to add to that?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, there's one other, which was we saw a lot of currency fluctuations during the year as a whole and so overall fx for us was an adverse drag. and because we source a lot of product in china in or [phonetic] us dollars and sell it in international markets in local currencies, it's a source of inflation in those markets.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hale, i'm sorry, and remind me of your second question, please?
hale holden -- barclays -- analyst
you have talked about reopening in australia and some of the benefits you had seen there when the restrictions fell away i think at victoria, and i was just wondering if there were takeaways for other markets we could think through?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, australia, as many of you know, also is one of the countries that managed the pandemic very well. they have very low incidence of covid. their schools are open, their offices are open. we saw little decline in australia in the second half of the year, a little decline in q4 and in fact that in december their sales were up compared to prior year.
so certainly, we're hopeful that if that's how the world's going to look like, after we recover from covid, that as people go back to the offices, we'll see similar levels of performance and demand. but australia numbers were good in the second half of the year.
hale holden -- barclays -- analyst
great, thank you very much.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, hale.
operator
and your next question will call from william reuter from bank of america. your line is open.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
hi, so my first question is on the cost savings, the $80 million or so that you saved last year, some of those were temporary and some are permanent. have you talked about what component of those may be coming back this year?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, certainly the incentive part that neal talked about is going to come back. some of the -- we also took some salary cuts and that's obviously, is going to come back. and then we also significantly reduced discretionary spend throughout the company with the sales decline and that's going to be variable, if the sales are coming [phonetic] back, then we will invest more. obviously, if things get delayed, as far as recovery is concerned that we will temper down on those expenses as well.
we don't really have it broken down by a proportion of how much is temporary, how much is permanent. as neal mentioned in response to the previous question, most of our anticipated increases in expenses this year have to do with restoring the incentive compensation and then the discretionary expenses will depend on sales.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and then you mentioned freight, i know that logistics in terms of supply chain from asia has been getting a little bit messed up at times. in terms of powera, given the console launches, i would imagine they have some pretty good tailwinds here, and it's important to get product on the shelves. is there any concern that there could be some disruption there that may, i guess, delay sales or eliminate them?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
powera has managed their supply chain fairly well, given what's going on. the lead times associated with some of their products are up to six months or so. so they have to be well ahead of it and they are planning for growth. so they're ordering the products up front. we could always use more product. right now we are really supply constrained versus demand constrained, but kind of given the plans that i've outlined and given what we anticipate to happen throughout 2021, i think powera is in fairly decent shape.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and a lot of the delays in the port in the west coast are starting to reduce, so that's also helping.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
good to hear. all right, i'll pass it to others. thank you.

good morning. with the success of the powera acquisition and certainly the demand being there, what's the outlook for m&a for you guys as you look at your capital structures and kind of getting back to that 2 to 2.5 [phonetic] times target leverage ratio?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, this year we're going to be focusing on delivering the business and supporting our dividend. if there is a small acquisition and when i say small, let's say less than $50 million, that's a tuck-in, that makes sense, we'll take a look at it, but we're not contemplating anything large this year. we'll be focused on integrating powera and delivering the business and then come 2022, we think we will be in position potentially to do more, but right now the focus is on integration and delivering.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
okay and just given the cap structure, the notes 2024 callable, what's your thoughts there?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we wanted to -- what happens in the capital markets all of the time and it's something we're well aware of and as you know, the coal gets cheaper later in the year as well.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
all right, thank you very much. i appreciate it.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, karru.

and your next question will come from hamed khorsand from bws financial. your line is open.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
good morning. i was just wanting to see how much, or how -- the delta between last year sales in 2019 that was harmed because of equipment sales, how much of that do you think comes back this year? and are you planning to increase any of the equipment manufacturing to have adequate supply?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks for the question, hamed. it's difficult to say. we have better visibility near term, that's why we provided guidance for q1 only, and certainly in q1 we don't expect a recovery compared to 2019. we expect the kind of level of sales that we saw, or the trend that we saw in the second half of the year and in q4 to continue in q1. we're certainly hopeful that things will begin to recover in the second half of the year and if they do, and people start going back to their offices that we do expect a recovery in equipment sales as well.
right now, we don't really anticipate that. even if that happens and that recovered to the level of 2019, we think that's a little bit too quickly, but any recovery will be good recovery. that's an important business for us and if it starts growing, it will certainly help with our performance.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i mean just to reiterate that point, in different countries the recovery will be different times. and you know we certainly expect south america to recover slower. and so, we do anticipate a recovering environment all the way through 2022, as i mentioned in my remarks.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
got it. thank you very much.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, hamed.

[operator instructions] your next question comes from jeff hutz from j.p. morgan. your line is open.
jeff hutz -- j.p. morgan. -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking the question. just two quick ones on powera, did you say how powera is doing since you acquired it, meaning in january and february? that's question one. and the second part is, can you remind us, is powera gross margin and ebitda margin accretive, and we know it's growth accretive, but just on the margin front, is it accretive or how does it stack up? thanks.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, jeff. we didn't say, but powera is doing really well in the six weeks since we acquired them, so we're very pleased with their performance and growth. and as far as margins are concerned, i know they are ebitda accretive, very significantly, ebitda accretive. as far as gross margins neal, i'll let you comment on that, whether they're -- powera accretive [phonetic].
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
they're very much in line.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
in line with our averages, on gross margin level.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and part of why their ebitda are accretive is because we left their former owner with all of the fixed costs. so once we're off the transition services agreement, we're able to leverage our fixed cost base, and that's what makes it really incrementally much stronger ebitda.
jeff hutz -- j.p. morgan. -- analyst
great, thank you.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, jeff.

we have no further questions in queue at this time. i'll turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.

thank you, michelle. thank you, everybody for your interest in acco brands. to summarize, while we continued to see impacts of covid-19 in our business in q4, i'm pleased with our overall response and relative results. with the addition of powera, we will continue to transform our business toward being more consumer-focused and are well positioned to benefit from economic recovery, which could occur later this year. we look forward to reporting on our progress at our next call. have a great day.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the fourth quarter and full year acco brands earnings. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference call over to your speaker today, christine hanneman. please go ahead.
christine hanneman -- senior director of investor relations
good morning. this is christine hanneman, senior director of investor relations. welcome to acco brands' fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings conference call.
speaking on the call today are boris elisman, chairman, president and chief executive officer of acco brands corporation; and neal fenwick, executive vice president and chief financial officer.
slides that accompany this call have been posted to the investor relations section of accobrands.com. when speaking about our results, we may refer to adjusted results. adjusted results exclude transaction, integration and restructuring costs and reflect an adjusted tax rate. schedules of adjusted results and other non-gaap financial measures, and a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures are in the earnings release and slides that accompany this call.
due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts, we do not reconcile our forward-looking non-gaap measures. forward-looking statements made during the call, including statements concerning the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on the company, are based on the beliefs and assumptions of management based on information available to us at the time the statements are made. our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially.
among the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, are the scope and duration of the covid-19 pandemic, government actions and third-party responses to it, and the consequences for the global economy, as well as regional and local economies in which we operate, uncertainties regarding how geographies, distribution channels and consumer behavior will evolve over time in response to the pandemic and its impact on our business, operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
please refer to our earnings release and sec filings for an explanation of certain of these risk factors and assumptions. our forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we assume no obligation to update them going forward. following our prepared remarks, we will hold a q&a session.
now i will turn the call over to boris elisman.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us. i will spend the next few minutes reviewing our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 results, including the impact of the pandemic and commenting on the progress we are making against some of our strategic imperatives. neal will follow me with more details and provide additional comments on our cost reductions, balance sheet and cash outlook. then we'll take your questions.
i'm pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year results in light of the pandemic and the current economic conditions. in the quarter, both sales and profits were within our expectations with fourth quarter comparable sales down 16% and adjusted eps of $0.32 compared with $0.46 in 2019. a large part of our adjusted eps performance in the quarter, is the result of many cost reduction actions we took throughout the year. neal will discuss that in more detail in a few minutes.
as anticipated, the fourth quarter sales declined largely as a result of slow sales in latin america and a seasonal swing the commercial channels in north america. in brazil, there was very limited back-to-school business as public schools remain closed. likewise, our mexico business was down significantly as schools and many offices remain closed there as well. as a result, comparable sales in latin america were down 35% versus 2019.
in north america, a resurgence in covid-19 cases in november and december kept offices and most schools closed. this, combined with a seasonal sales swing to slower growing commercial channels were the primary reason north america comparable sales were down 21%. sales of large whiteboards, bulletin boards, large sweaters and laminators, binding machines and binders continued to be weak.
but there were also several bright spots. our products that are focused on consumers, technology or home usage continued to see strong demand. several of our product lines did well all year. our kensington computer accessories, trusens air purifiers and derwent art supplies all sold well as people continued to outfit their home offices, entertain themselves at home, and remain concerned about wellness.
late in the quarter we introduced smart air purifiers and we have other launches on tap in 2021 to build on our momentum in the wellness area, which we think will be a significant category for us over time. emea continued its good performance with comparable sales in the fourth quarter down just 1%. country and channel fragmentation in europe benefits us. in addition, our teams did a great job of servicing customers throughout the pandemic and we believe we have taken market share.
under our leitz brand, which is highly recognizable in europe, we introduced leitz wow and leitz cozy, colorful home office storage and organizational products to take advantage of work from home needs. sales of personal shredders and diy tools remained strong as more people worked from home. kensington products also posted a solid sales gain in emea for the full year with a particularly strong fourth quarter. overall kensington became our top selling brand in 2020 with strong double-digit sales growth, including a significant order [phonetic] referenced in the third quarter.
we were also encouraged by progress in australia and asia as the rate of sales decline in these areas has improved sequentially since the second quarter. during the quarter, we acquired powera and are very excited to have that business under our umbrella. for those of you who may not know, powera is a leading player in video gaming accessories, such as controllers, power charging stations, and headphones.
as many of you may be aware, the video gaming companies introduced the next generation of platforms in late 2020 and another refresh is expected in 2021 or 2022. historically, this has generated strong demand for gaming accessories for a lengthy period following the platform introductions. we anticipate powera will benefit from this for a few years.
in 2021, we are expecting powera sales growth of approximately 15% and ebitda in the range of $55 million to $60 million. we are very pleased to report that our 2020 free cash flow continues to build out [phonetic] coming in at $104 million, including the transaction cost of the powera acquisition.
overall we continue to manage the business well amid a historic pandemic and a difficult economic environment with demand for our products being impacted in many geographies by remote education, working from home, high unemployment, and closed or disrupted business situations.
our business benefits from the breadth and balance of our geographic and product portfolio. we are not dependent on any one area for success and have done a good job partially mitigating channel customer and product line declines with growth somewhere else. while we have seen our business improve in the second half of 2020, there is still a lot of uncertainty around when offices and schools will reopen, which will increase demand for many of our products.
all of our production and warehouse facilities have remained open to the extent necessary to meet customer demand. most of our office employees continue to work from home. we continue to adapt our strategy to respond to both challenges and opportunities in the current environment.
we are assuming a shift in consumer behavior post pandemic and are changing products and channel portfolio investments as a result. this includes making larger investments in growth areas such as video gaming accessories, wellness products, work, learn, or play from home products, and computer accessories while we do think our investments in some commercial office products, such as wide format laminators and large whiteboards as we expect demand for such products to remain weak.
we are a large diversified global company with a strong balance sheet and we deliver consistent strong free cash flow. as such, we are positioned well to take advantage of the economic recovery which we believe will occur later in 2021.
now, i will turn the call over to neal for review of the segments, our outlook and other financial commentary, and then i'll join him in answering your questions. neal?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, boris, and good morning everyone. i'm going to discuss the impacts of covid-19 throughout my comments. those impacts include the operational, financial and other effects on acco brands, our customers, and end users of our products, the school and business closures, work from home, remote and hybrid learning, government orders, and manufacturing distribution, supply chain or other disruptions resulting from covid-19. and the actions of acco brands, our customers and end users have taken in response to the pandemic, including actions we have taken to manage our inventory and credit risk under the circumstances.
most of my comments will be related to our full year results. our 2020 reported and comparable net sales, both decreased approximately 15% due to lower demand from the impact of covid-19. as boris noted, we saw strong sales growth in product lines focused on work from home, such as our kensington computer accessories and trusens air purifiers. sales to commercial channels remained very weak and drove most of the full year sales declines.
compared to 2019, sales to commercial and b2b customers declined 25% accounting for 80% of our sales decline. on the other hand, e-commerce sales rose 17%, while sales to tech specialist channels rose 31%, partially due to a large contract in the third quarter, and retail and mass sales were down 15% due to declines in store traffic.
full year net income was $62 million or $0.65 per share. adjusted net income was $67 million and adjusted eps was $0.70. the primary driver of the year-over-year sales decline were [phonetic] lower volume. factors benefiting adjusted eps where our cost production efforts, better profits in emea, a lower tax rate, lower interest expense and share count.
our growth margin was approximately 30% compared to 32% in 2019. decreases occurred in all segments largely as a result of an unfavorable customer and product mix, primarily because of low demand for certain high-margin commercial products as well as higher import and freight costs and lower fixed cost absorption. these factors were only partially offset by cost savings.
sg&a expenses were $336 million compared with $390 million in 2019. sg&a as a percent of sales was 20%, roughly flat with last year, primarily because of cost reduction efforts. in addition to the savings related to cost of goods, we effectively maintained our sg&a costs to sales ratio despite a 16% reduction in full year comparable sales. that was an outstanding achievement.
as we indicated previously, we have taken many cost reduction actions in response to covid-19 and we've participated in government assistance programs when we qualified in order to keep employees rather than implementing layoffs or furloughs. in the first quarter of 2020, we took early temporary actions to protect the health and safety of our employees and to aggressively reduce costs to protect our business in the near-term.
in the second quarter, we announced a restructuring charge to make more permanent and structural changes to our business, including headcount reductions, which we initiated in the third quarter. in the fourth quarter, we announced additional cost reduction actions. year-end headcount was down 13% versus 2019. when you add it all up, in 2020, we realized $83 million in cost savings from all our various programs.
moving on. adjusted operating income was $128 million compared with $211 million last year, primarily due to lower sales, but also from inefficiencies due to lower volume and additional provisions for bad debt expenses. the adjusted operating margin was 8% versus 11%. our adjusted tax rate for the full year was 26.7% and 22.7% for the quarter.
the lower tax rate in both periods was primarily driven by the us [guilty regulations] issued in 2020, which benefited the company, lower than expected nondeductible executive compensation expense and increased research and development incentives. we anticipate our 2021 tax rate will be approximately 29% as the benefits connected with the executive compensation, and research and development incentives are not likely to repeat.
now let's turn to some details of our segment results. full-year comparable net sales in north america decreased 16% to $817 million. as was the case for the total company, lower commercial channel sales growth in north america declined as many offices were closed or had limited openings. e-tail and tech channel sales both increased, but retail sales were weaker.
sales of back-to-school products for the full year were down approximately 9%. while second quarter selling was strong, the second half sellout of back-to-school products were sluggish. on the positive side, we saw strong sales of kensington computer accessories and powera contributed almost $6 million to north america sales after we closed the deal in mid-december.
full-year north america adjusted operating income was $91 million versus $137 million last year, and adjusted operating margin was 11% compared with 14%. the decline was primarily a result of lower sales, but we also experienced cost inflation, inefficiencies due to lower volume, and unfavorable customer and product mix. these factors were partially offset by cost reductions and government assistance programs.
now let's turn to emea. for the full-year, emea net sales decreased 8% to $524 million with favorable foreign exchange partially offsetting the decline in comparable sales, which were down approximately 10% due to the impacts of covid-19. the reductions in commercial sales were partially offset by growth in kensington computer accessories, leitz personal shredders and trusens air purifiers. powera contributed $2 million to sales. we have seen improvement in emea with several months of less adverse results based on the partial recovery in our sales of commercial products.
in addition, our new lines of storage and organization products, who work from home, have been well received. emea posted an adjusted operating profit of $52 million versus $61 million in 2019, primarily due to lower sales and related inefficiencies. we also took high reserves of inventory and bad debt. these headwinds were largely offset by cost savings and government assistance. adjusted operating margin was 10% versus 11% last year.
moving to the international segment. comparable sales declined significantly, because of lower demand from the impact of covid-19. while all markets suffered in the second and third quarters, australia sales improved in the fourth quarter, as the lockdown in victoria was rescinded and asia sales posted sequential improvements.
mexico and brazil continued to be severely impacted by covid-19, as many schools and offices in both countries remain closed, and the retail and commercial customers that account for the vast majority of our sales in those markets were down significantly. in these markets, e-tail is underdeveloped, so there is no meaningful opportunity to offset the retail and commercial channel decline. the current expectation is that this situation will continue into the first half of 2021.
international adjusted operating income was $19 million compared with $53 million last year, primarily as a result of the lower sales. we also had inefficiencies due to lower volume and higher bad debt reserves in latin america, partially offset by cost reductions and government assistance.
let's move now to our balance sheet and cash flow. we continued to experience a higher level of late payments from customers in latin america and export markets, and our bad debt expense was $8 million for the full year 2020 compared with $1 million in 2019. our south american and mexican customers are the main concerns. we are actively managing our receivables and will continue to restrict our own sales to mitigate our risk as necessary.
in the fourth quarter, we reduced our provision for slow moving inventory, by approximately $4 million compared with 2019's fourth quarter, primarily due to better management and earlier recording of dated product reserves. on a year-to-date basis, total provisions were $17 million, $1 million higher than 2019 levels.
for the full year, we generated approximately $119 million of net cash from operating activities and $104 million of free cash flow, including powera transaction costs of $4 million, and with capex of $15 million. we repurchased 2.9 million shares for a net $16 million, paid approximately $24 million in dividends, and repaid $51 million of debt.
in the fourth quarter we generated approximately $97 million in net cash from operating activities, and had $94 million of free cash flow, including powera transaction costs of $4 million, and $3 million of capex. we used our fourth quarter cash flow to partially refinance the powera acquisition and pay dividends of $6 million.
our capex outlook for 2021 is approximately $30 million. as we noted when we acquired powera and increased our debt, in the near-term, we plan to use our cash to fund our dividend, and to reduce debt. longer term, we plan to use our free cash flow to fund our dividend, reduce debt, repurchase shares and make acquisitions.
at year-end, we had used $343 million of our $600 million revolving credit facility and have $37 million of cash on hand. our pro forma bank net leverage ratio was 4.3 times, which is in line with where we expected it to be after the purchase of powera. given our financial strength and the proactive steps we have taken to reduce costs, we expect to be able to maintain good liquidity, as we manage through the current environment.
now let's turn to our outlook. it continues to be difficult to forecast longer term in this environment, because there is so much uncertainty as a result of covid-19. for 2021, we expect business impacts from covid-19 will continue to vary significantly by geographic region and country, depending upon a range of factors, including how seriously the pandemic is affecting public health in the country, the delivery and effectiveness of vaccines, whether and to what degree businesses and schools are open, and the general seasonality of our business in a country, the nature and level of government support and the channel structure.
we are hopeful that as mass vaccinations roll out, we will see reduced impacts from covid-19, particularly in the second half of this year, when we anticipate an economic recovery. this should continue through all of 2022. out first quarter is typically our seasonally smallest quarter. excluding powera, we expect overall demand in the first quarter to be down relative to 2020, when we saw very little impact from covid-19. this is the last quarter we'll face [phonetic] comparisons with the pre-covid world.
first quarter demand is anticipated to be especially weak in latin america and our commercial products will continue to reflect weaker demand versus the pre-pandemic comparisons. partially offsetting this, we expect to continue to make strong progress on our growth initiatives globally and regionally. we expect to have organic sales growth in emea.
beginning with the first quarter of 2021, we are changing the way we calculate and report adjusted non-gaap results by excluding non-cash amortization of intangible assets. the company has made several large acquisitions over the past few years and has publicly committed to continue to transform its business through acquisitions in the near future.
as a result of our acquisition strategy, we have and likely will continue to have in the foreseeable future, a large amount of acquisition-related amortization expense. we believe that this change will enhance the usefulness of these non-gaap measures to investors, because it reflects the underlying operating results before amortization expense, which is not associated with core operations and facilitate meaningful period-to-period and clear comparisons.
in our attachments to the earnings release, we have restated our 2020 and 2019 non-gaap measures to reflect the new adjustment. our first quarter 2021 outlook reflects our new definition of adjusted earnings. we anticipate a strong first quarter for powera. as such, our first quarter outlook for the entire company is for sales to be in the range of flat to up 4%.
the first quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, are expected to be in a range of $0.00 to $0.06. the outlook includes a favorable foreign exchange impact of 4% on sales and $0.02 on adjusted eps. we anticipate approximately $12 million of pre-tax intangible amortization will be [phonetic] excluded in the first quarter, based on our new definition of adjusted earnings, which represents $0.09 on an adjusted eps basis.
we have reinstated the compensation and benefit reductions we took in 2020. we also are planning to invest more in growth initiatives to support anticipated stronger second half demand. as such, our sg&a expenses will increase in 2021 in all quarters. we expect our productivity programs will deliver a more normal level of approximately $30 million to $40 million in savings for the full year.
with respect to our cash flow outlook, we feel confident that we can generate at least $165 million of operating cash flow for the full year. with capex expected to be approximately $30 million, we expect to generate at least $135 million of free cash flow.
powera, we are not making normal level of free cash flow contribution in 2021, due to the structure of the acquisitions agreement. in late december, we effectively acquired powera without normal levels of accounts receivable and payable. this will be subsequently reflected as a reduction in the purchase price. as we restore normal levels of accounts receivable and payable in 2021, we will see a reduced level of free cash flow from powera as working capital will be abnormally high use of cash. we will return to a normal working capital cycle and free cash flow contribution from powera next year.
now let's move on to q&a, where boris and i will be happy to take your questions. operator?

[operator instructions] your first question is from the line of chris mcginnis with sidoti and company.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hey. good morning, boris, neal, christine. thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a good quarter. can we just start with the strength of powera? obviously up 100%. can you just talk about, is that really just driven from the new consoles, and then maybe, can you break down the growth between north america and emea, and how is the emea integration going? thanks.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, chris, thanks for the question. powera growth is driven by multiple factors. there is the overall growth in gaming and that's been accelerated by the introduction of new consoles released last year from microsoft and sony. so, that's part of it. the second part of it is just supply availability, chip availability. powera has done a great job managing their supply chain, so we have decent product availability and are able to deliver to our customers when some of our competitors, and including first-tier suppliers such as sony and microsoft, can't deliver to all of the demand. and rather, the third primary reason, the team in powera has done a great job servicing customers and taking share and increasing their lead. so for all those multiple reasons we saw tremendous growth of slightly over 100% during the quarter. the integration of powera is going well. we are in the midst of it right now. the plan is to transition from the services agreement with the seller by the end of the third quarter and be completely on our systems, and then we could get exclusively focused on further growth. did i answer all your questions, chris?
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
yeah. i guess, just one more on that, just the growth in north america and emea, were they 100% or can you just maybe break that, i don't know if you can provide that -- [speech overlap]
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, look, i don't have that detail with me. powera's business is 80% in north america. so, north america's definitely driven the majority of the growth. although, emea has done well, it's a relatively small number.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
i appreciate it. i'll jump back in the queue. thank you.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, chris.
operator
your next question is from the line of joe gomes with nobel capital.
joe gomes -- nobel capital -- analyst
good morning, boris and neal. congratulations on the quarter, and again, thanks for taking my question.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, joe.
joe gomes -- nobel capital -- analyst
so, i kind of wanted to follow up a little bit here on powera. you gave some guidance of increasing the expectation from 15% growth to 25% growth, but i mean if we look at what you just projected, neal, you said for the fourth quarter of $50 million to $60 million, if you hit the top end of that, then you really are already at that 25% growth level, and 65% of powera sales are in the second half of the year. are we just taking a more conservative stance here on powera growth or is there something else there that would kind of prevent you from putting out even a greater expectation for powera revenues for this year? thank you.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, joe. so, there is nothing artificial in that number. the -- we certainly will strive to exceed it, obviously. we'll do as much as we can. the only thing you have to keep in mind is a couple of things. the compares will get much more difficult in the second half because there was significant growth last year due to people staying at home and gaming more. so that's one factor to consider. and the other factor to consider is supply. there may be a lot more demand out there, but that just can't be fulfilled because of the long lead times associated with supply. so, i think your math is largely correct. i think we are assuming some kind of supply constraints for the second half and there is a lot of uncertainty with what's going to happen in the second half. but if we are optimistic, then maybe, we'll do a little better.
joe gomes -- nobel capital -- analyst
thank you.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer

your next question is from the line of kevin steinke with barrington research.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
good morning.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, kevin
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
yes. so, obviously, you talked about commercial office sales in north america continuing to be weak, but also 60% of us schools, they're now fully reopened [phonetics]. and i think in the past, you've tied kind of reopening of schools to maybe some eventual return to the office. so, i'm just wondering if there are any glimmers of recovery or hope in the commercial office sales in north america?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
there certainly are glimmers of hope of recovery. we are definitely hearing a lot more companies scheduling dates for returns back to offices. we think a lot of companies will go back in the summer and early fall timeframe. and it will be enabled by schools being fully in-person as well. so, we think there is a recovery ahead of us. we think there is a -- definitely a sales upside ahead of us as things continue and [indecipherable] going to revert back or [indecipherable] take hold. but based on everything we're seeing in the marketplace and hearing from our customers, we do think that north america -- us especially, you know, canada has some slightly different issues, but us, especially, is poised to go back to the office is a lot more [indecipherable] currently. and well, we do anticipate it's going to be a hybrid kind of arrangement. but certainly, we do expect more offices to be in-person than they are today.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay, thanks. that's helpful. thanks for taking the question.

hale holden -- barclays -- analyst
good morning. i had two quick ones. neal, i was wondering, given the growth in powera, if you are where you need to be for working capital or if there is further investment in the current quarter expected?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
quick answer to that one, hale, is: it's a seasonal business and so its strongest sales are in q4, and therefore, as it seasonally grows in the year, we're going to see an increase in working capital. we were also doing our best to bring up our inventory levels of some of their products because of the chip issues that we're seeing in the supply chain. and so, for both reasons, we are quite happy to invest in powera's working capital.
hale holden -- barclays -- analyst
and that actually is my second question is that you alluded to the chip issues that maybe some of your competitors were having, and i was wondering if there is any risk to your sourcing there?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it's why we've been modest about projecting too much growth in the second half for powera because of our end supply questions, and obviously, we expect to improve, our forecast will improve.
hale holden -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, hale.

your next question is from the line of william reuter with bank of america.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning. my questions are, i guess, kind of two-part question on raw material inflation, as well as shipping inflation. so, i guess, do you have an estimate of the aggregate dollar impact of inflation across input costs as well as shipping? and then, how much of that's going to impact this year versus maybe some of it being delayed due to some hedging or for purchases contracting, switching, etc? thanks.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so, i think two different things. one, we're seeing live the shipping impacts. we saw that in q1. and from a purchasing point of view, i think that's going to be a much bigger story from the rising costs that we're seeing for raw materials. to the point you mentioned, we do have contracts with building time delays and we have inventory that builds in recognition delays. and so, for both reasons, what we're going to see is an increasing impact of those costs on our business as the year runs on. and that's quite necessary for us to raise prices in the market to offset. and [speech overlap] you know, basic commodities, they are up significantly.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
yeah. i guess, just on that point, i guess, do you expect that the second quarter is going to see much of that or really will we see the impacts of those in the third quarter and beyond?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, we're going to start to see cost impacts hit the p&l in the second quarter, and then, much more so in the third quarter and beyond.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
great. i'll pass it to others. thank you.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
and just to follow up on that a little bit, bill. as neal mentioned, we have raised prices in april in the us to offset that increased inflation. and we're going to be doing some of that in other countries. and also as neal insinuated, as we go into the second half, we'll also be looking at that and if inflation continues to be high, we'll be raising prices again in the second half to offset the impact of inflation.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, bill.

your next question is from the line of brad thomas with keybanc capital.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital -- analyst
hi. good morning, neal and boris. i got on a little bit late, so i apologize if you covered some of this, but i first want to touch on back-to-school and see if you could give -- so a little bit more color on how you were thinking about the split between 2q and 3q, and how you're thinking about that unfolding in the us this year?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. so let me start. we're very optimistic about back-to-school, being 100% in-person, in the us. there was some uncertainty earlier in the year about how exactly it's going to break, but consensus is emerging and we're seeing that today we've 60% of the schools already being fully in-person. that come august, july, even when some schools start to go back-to-school, we feel very good that there'll be at 100% in-person. with that said, given with that back-to-school, buy orders are made pretty early in the season just given the length of the supply chain, and given the situation last year with -- where they had pretty poor back-to-school. and most retailers were conservative in their upfront purchases. and then we will chase supply when demand materializes early [phonetics].
we had a very good back-to-school sell-in last year. if you remember, north american sales were quite strong in q2 of last year. so we think that from a relative standpoint sales will be -- sales in the end [phonetics] will be weaker than they would have been otherwise just because of the more conservative position that the customers are taking, plus some inventory overhang that someone will have from last year. so, we think there'll be some shift from q2 probably to q3. and there'll be more replenishment in q3. and certainly that we saw last year, but probably, also that we will traditionally see. with all of that, we expect the sell-up to be up significantly. the industry estimates are anywhere from 5% to 25% higher than last year. and also, as neal mentioned, despite some of these shifts, we do expect growth in north american sales in q2 versus prior year.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital -- analyst
that's very helpful, boris. thank you. and if i could add a follow-up on powera, certainly, a very exciting new product to bear business. could you just give us, you know, what's your latest thoughts on how you're thinking about the medium-term, perhaps two-year to three-year revenue opportunity from powera? and how you think about the long-term opportunity for powera?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, this year, we said, we expect roughly 25% growth from powera. if you look at the forecasts from industry analysts, they project a 18% sales growth over the next few years for the gaming industry. so, i don't think it's unreasonable for us to expect that we will grow in the medium term, at least with the market. and from a inorganic standpoint, as we mentioned, over the last couple of quarters, we also think that that gives us a new leg for a potential inorganic growth as well. so, we think it's an exciting and important segment for us. we're happy to invest in it. and hopefully, looking to continue to grow at the rates that we've been seeing.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, and also in the longer term, we do see geographic expansion is a big piece that we can add to that on top of the industry growth.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital -- analyst
wonderful. thank you so much.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, brad.
operator
your next question is from the line of karru martinson with jefferies.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning. just following up on that. in terms of the new leg to invest in, where are you comfortable on your leverage? or do you have to get down back to that 3.5 by -- by year-end to fund the investments, or how are you thinking about that?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
to do something major, karru, we would have to get down to that 3.5 times, at least, or lower. but we are comfortable doing small tuck-ins at the current level as long as they are strategically aligned and financially very prudent. and when i say small tuck-ins, i'm talking about $10 million or less. but, for a major investment of $50 million or more, we'd like to get to 3.5 times net leverage ratio.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. and you guys referenced funding some growth initiatives for the second half, i was wondering is there any more color in terms of the size [technical issues] of those investments, and what they're going behind, other than the powera supply issue concerns?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, most of them will be our new product development and demand generation to support our growth. and the product development will be in the work-from-home, video gaming, computer accessories, art supplies, wellness, all of the areas that we are seeing strong demand in. and demand generation will be in the near term to support those but also support back-to-school in north america. so that's where the investments are going to go in.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you very much, guys. appreciate it.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, karru.
operator
your next question is from the line of hamed khorsand with bws financial.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
hey, good morning. so just wanted to ask about back-to-school. are you seeing any changes in the purchasing habits on the regional side as these schools are going back into the session? and what are your expectations on gross margin as you start to scale up and you go back to normalcy with back-to-school purchasing?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hamed, it's difficult for us to say because right now, the increased demand from end-users will be in primarily service by the inventory that the customers already have. so, we haven't seen a significant replenishment cycle yet. that's still to come. so, it's difficult for me to give you any additional color on a regional basis. beyond that, overall, we are seeing sell-through up for pretty much all of our customers in the us. and what was your second question, i'm sorry?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
[speech overlap] margin, gross margin.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
it was gross margin.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, it's also a tough question to comment on, because certainly with scale, we would expect an expansion in gross margin, plus we think some of the -- hourly [phonetics] absolute inventory accruals will be released as well as volume goes up. but on the other hand, we are seeing increased inflation, raw materials inflation, and we are seeing -- continuing to see logistics and freight inflation. so, how will those things offset each other? it's difficult for us to give you additional color on until we see a little bit more in the quarter.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
okay. thank you.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, hamed.

your next question is from the line of carla casella with jpmorgan.
carla casella -- jpmorgan -- analyst
i'm wondering on the m&a front, if you're seeing any more opportunities out there as we come out of the pandemic? and then, if your success in powera has made your -- made you change the view for -- you might be interested on the m&a front more be it more tax versus the traditional business?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks for the question. there certainly is no shortage of m&a opportunities in the whole thing. as we've mentioned over the last few earnings calls, there's lots of things in play there, both because the pandemic has squeezed some players, strategically, but also because the [technical issues] valuations there are relatively high. so, people want to monetize the opportunity. we have always thought that a trucker's [phonetics] agency would be interested -- interesting for us. we've looked at that for a while. overall, our strategy doesn't change. it has to make sense strategically for the company in terms of distribution, brands, value add, etc. what else has to make a financial sense from an -- accretion for our shareholders. so, our strategy hasn't changed. as i mentioned in my previous answer, to do something big, we have to deliver as well. we have plenty of work on our hand this year to drive organic growth in the business. we think we have lots of opportunity, but we are definitely open to other acquisitions if both strategic and financial criteria are met. and we have the balance sheet to do it.
carla casella -- jpmorgan -- analyst
great. thank you.

[operator instructions] your next question is from the line of joe gomes with nobel capital.
joe gomes -- nobel capital -- analyst
[technical issues] thanks for taking a follow-up. most of my questions have been answered. but, boris, maybe you can give us a little bit more insight in some of the new product introductions that you're thinking about here or looking at? i know, previously you talked about humidifiers as a potential area of interest. maybe you could expand a little bit more on that? thank you.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. in the wellness area, we're definitely looking to expand of the line. you mentioned that previously we talked about entering the humidifier space, that's definitely something we're looking at. we're also looking at more of a commercial delayed air purifiers. today, our products are largely focused on the consumer space and the home space, but we think that there is a sustained need for air purification in the office environments as well, and small businesses, given the pandemic, and just the sensitivity to those topics. that's one big area of investment. work-from-home products is another big area of investment. we think that the world will not go back to the pre-pandemic way of working. we think that because as people return, they will return largely to a hybrid type of situation with people working in the offices a few days a week and working from home a few days a week. so, we think there will be sustained need for work-at-home products. and that includes investments in additional docking solutions, both for traditional pcs as well as for apple ecosystem, including ipads. certainly, investments -- continued investments in powera and video gaming, and expanding that line.
neal mentioned for international expansion for mobile gaming in headsets, and to support other console introduction. and then the other big area for work-from-home is manual shredding. we think there's a huge opportunity there to introduce value products that actually work and don't break after a few months. and also a line of storage products and organizational products for home. we mentioned the [indecipherable] and cosy range that we introduced in emea, which is a big hit. and i think there's an opportunity to introduce that on a global basis. so, there's really not a shortage of ideas for us to invest in the product development. we think we have a great roadmap and i look forward to bringing those to our consumers.
joe gomes -- nobel capital -- analyst

boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us. i will spend the next few minutes highlighting key elements of our first-quarter performance. neal will follow me with more details on the quarter and provide additional comments on our bond and bank debt refinancing. then, we'll take your questions.
overall, i'm very pleased with our first-quarter results. and, in particular, the performance of powera and the continued strength in emea. the 7% total company sales growth, which [phonetics] performed better than we expected, despite comparing a covid19 affected quarter against a mostly pre-covid19 quarter, last year. even more impressive, our sales were 4% above our sales in the first quarter of 2019. first-quarter profits were also better than our expectations. we have been seeing a recovery in emea for the past three quarters, as offices have been reopening and many schools never fully closed. our team did a great job servicing customers, investing in growth initiatives, reorienting toward at-home products, and taking market share. in the first quarter, comparable sales in emea were up 7% with good organic growth from trusens air purifiers, do-it-yourself tools, kensington computer accessories, the [indecipherable] and cosy ranges of organizational products, leitz shredders, and derwent art supplies. we're proud to say that three of our leitz products won a red dot design award. several of the cosy line of home-office items, our premium shredders, which are stylish and quiet, and are designed for home use. and our functional, recycle line of office products in which every product is made with recycled materials.
emea's sales to retailers were up over 80%, and we also saw good sales growth with many independents and tech specialists. north america also had a good quarter, driven by powera. excluding powera, sales declined because of the impact of covid19, but we began to see improvement in march, our sales grew with many retail and e-commerce customers. this is a good sign that there is more demand now for school supplies as close to 60% of k through 12 schools in the us have returned to a fully in-person education, and another 30% are using a hybrid approach. many schools have also indicated they will have an earlier start to the fall semester. this change should bode well for the second half as our customers work through their inventory overhang from 2020. we have adequate inventory on hand to be able to rapidly replenish the stock as needed.
turning to the international segment. australia, new zealand, and asia have been performing better but it will take a while for the entire segment to improve, given continuing school and office closures and a slow vaccination rollout in latin america. we hope to see the beginning of a recovery in latin america, later in the second half and into 2022. we're confident in our strategy. we'll continue to focus on improving sales growth and profitability by shifting our business toward more consumer-centric products. our growth will come from acquisitions such as powera, which i will comment on in a few minutes, and from organic sales generation. our products that are focused on consumers, technology, or home usage saw a strong demand throughout 2020 and in the first quarter. trusens air purifiers, do-it-yourself tools, organization and storage products for home-office use, kensington computer accessories, derwent art supplies, and manual home shredders, all sold well as people outfitted their home-offices, entertained themselves at home, and remained concerned about wellness. we expect this will remain true in 2021 and believe solid performance from this product lines will continue. for example, our trusens product line has grown from an introduction in 2019 to $25 million [phonetics] business, currently. late last year, we introduced smart air purifiers and we have some additional product introductions on tap for later this year, and in 2022. while competition has increased, over time we think the wellness category will be one in which we can establish a significant position.
last year, our kensington computer accessories business received the largest order we have ever had. that means a difficult comparison this year in some quarters. however, excluding that order, the core business is expected to grow strongly as we will continue to introduce new, innovative products. as an example, in the first quarter, kensington introduced the studiodock for the apple ipad pro and ipad air. ipad tablets can be magnetically attached to the docking station in either portrait or landscape modes, and through the dock, connect to a host of peripherals and charging options. a strong testament to our efforts is that the kensington studiodock won at ces innovation award, as well as a red dot design award during the first quarter. turning now to powera. for those of you who may not know, powera is a leading player in video gaming accessories such as controllers, power charging stations, and headphones, that we bought in late december 2020. i am very pleased with powera's results and how smoothly the integration is going. there seems to be a particularly good fit on the people side, with everyone meshing in terms of culture, and with everyone focused on supporting the transition, and powera's growth.
the gaming market continues to exhibit strong growth trends. market intelligence report forecast that between 2021 and 2026, the gaming console industry is expected to grow approximately 18% per year. the amount of time spent by consumers on gaming is increasing, with the global average now over seven hours a week. morgan stanley estimates that mobile gaming users grew 20% in 2020, adding approximately four years worth of new gamers during the pandemic. most analysts believe this is a permanent shift. moreover, in the fourth quarter of last year, sony and microsoft launched new generation console products, which are still popular bt they are having difficulty keeping up with the demand for controllers. so powera is filling that void. powera's first-quarter performance was exceptionally strong, with an increase of more than 100% on its pro forma 2020 sales. while we don't expect that rate of growth to continue, we expect strong sales for the rest of the year. in fact, we now think powera's sales will grow 25% this year rather than the 15% we initially projected.
another element of our overall strategy is to continue to shift our product sales through our growing channels such as e-tail, mass merchants, and direct-to-consumer platforms while maintaining our presence with successful independents and tech specialists. this shift has resulted in more growth of customers such as walmart, target, and amazon, which are among our top five customers, and performed well throughout the pandemic. also aligned with the shift, consumer school and technology categories now represent 59% of our sales and are the fastest-growing parts in our portfolio. moving on, our productivity program is back to normal levels after accelerated cost reduction stake in last year due to the pandemic. we have reinstated merit increases and bonus opportunities, so our sg&a expenses will normalize this year. still, our full-year productivity savings for the year, i expect it to be over $30 million. our free cash flow for this year is expected to be at least $135 million. we intend to use the cash to payout dividend and to reduce our debt. we will comment further on this a bit later.
in summary, our business benefits from the breadth and balance of our geographic and product portfolio. we're not dependent on any one area for success and have done a good job, partially offsetting channel, customer, and product line declines, with growth elsewhere. i'm proud of the way we have adapted quickly to take advantage of the changing environment. we're assuming a shift in consumer behavior post-pandemic and a change in our product and channel investments as a result. this includes making larger investments in growth areas such as video gaming accessories, wellness products, work, learn, or play-from-home products, and computer accessories while reducing our investments in some commercial office products that we expect will remain weak longer-term such as wide-format laminators and large whiteboards, although we expect some post-pandemic recovery. we will emerge from the pandemic as a strong, growing, financially sound company that is ready to aggressively pursue the opportunities ahead.
now, i will turn the call over to neal for a review of the segments, our outlook, and other financial commentary, and then, i'll join him in answering your questions. neal?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, boris. good morning, everyone. as boris mentioned, we saw the initial impact of covid19 hit our emea business minimally only in late march last year. so, it is [phonetics] the last quarter of comparing a covid impacted quarter against one that wasn't impacted very much. our first-quarter sales rose 7% as a result of the powera acquisition. comparable sales declined approximately 13%. powera's sales were much stronger than we expected, coming in at $63 million, mostly in the north american segment, and this compared with pre-acquisition sales, last year, of approximately $31 million. we also continued to see strong sales growth in product lines that focus on work and play-from-home, such as our kensington computer accessories, trusens air purifiers, do-it-yourself, and are supplies. sales to commercial channels remained weak and drove most of the comparable sales decline. compared to 2020 and excluding powera, sales to commercial and b2b customers declined 18%, and retail and mass sales were down 7%. on the other hand, e-commerce sales rose 28%, while sales through tech-specialist channels rose 6%. first-quarter adjusted net income was $10 million or $0.10 per share versus $13 million or $0.14 per share last year. the year-over-year decline was mainly the result of lower volume in north america and international, higher incentive accruals and logistics expense, and higher interest expense associated with the acquisition, that is benefiting eps for our cost reduction efforts and better profits in emea.
our reported profit was also negatively impacted by $14 million of other expense related to the bond and bank debt refinancing, and $7 million due to the earn-out portion of the powera purchase price. in addition, we had $4 million in restructuring charges, $1 million of pension curtailment charges, and $4 million increase in amortization charges, and $2 million inventory step up that are acquisition-related. you may recall, though the powera earn-out is payable in two equal installments over the next two years if certain sales and profit targets are met. as such, every quarter, we must reflect the fair value of the earn-out and recognize any change as an expense in our income statement. we expect that this will result in [indecipherable] charges throughout the two-year earn-out period as we forecast strong results for powera. this quarter we booked a $7 million expense, which along with the higher charges previously noted, resulted in a small reported operating loss for the total company. our gross margin was approximately 28% compared with 29% in 2020. the adjusted gross margin was down 50 basis points versus last year, much less than the margin pressure we experienced in the fourth quarter. the main driver with the cost increases that are impacting our logistics expense, ocean freight and domestic freight, and some inflation in our input and purchase costs. on the positive side, low-cost savings, lower obsolete inventory charges, foreign exchange, and powera's accretive margins.
sg&a expenses were $94 million compared with $86 million, last year, primarily because of $8 million of higher incentive accruals, and $5 million of powera expense, which were partially offset by cost reduction efforts. you may recall that last year we eliminated almost all incentive accruals in the first quarter due to the pandemic. sg&a as a percent of sales was approximately 23%, roughly flat with last year because we were able to leverage powera against our core business expenses and largely offset the lower sales in the rest of our business. adjusted operating income was approximately $25 million compared with $26 million, last year, primarily due to powera's contribution largely offsetting the declines in the rest of the business. the adjusted operating margin was 6% versus 7% last year. our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 29.1%.
now, let's turn to some details of our segment results. comparable net sales in north america decreased to 19% to $136 million. some of the decline is because the first quarter pf 2020 benefited from almost $6 million of pre-buying in advance of our it system conversion, go live [phonetics] last april, as well as some channel inventory build because of covid concerns. lower commercial channel sales continue to impact north america as many offices remain closed or had limited openings. as boris mentioned, we are encouraged to see more schools reopening for in-person learning. this is helping to absorb some of our customers' inventory overhang from last season. we're likely to see less than our usual amount of back-to-school sell-in during the second quarter as last year's sell-in was strong. we expect our major customers will continue to work through the inventory they purchased last year but did not sell because of school closures. we are well prepared to service them with our branded products in the second half as may need replenishment. for the overall north america business, we anticipate a sales increase in the second quarter.
first-quarter adjusted operating income was $11 million, up slightly from last year. adjusted operating margin was 6% compared with 6.5% last year. the margin decline primarily was a result of lower sales in our business, excluding powera. also, as previously mentioned, we experienced higher costs, particularly related to logistics that impacted the margin, even with a partial offset from cost reductions. now, let's turn to emea. for the quarter, emea comparable net sales increased 7% to $136 million. reductions in commercial sales were partially offset by growth and trusens air purifiers, do-it-yourself tools, kensington computer accessories, our new line of work-from-home storage and organization products, and leitz's personal shredders together with derwent art supplies. powera contributed $9 million to emea sales. this is the third consecutive quarter that we are seeing sequential improvement in emea and this quarter showed strong year-over-year growth, even though last year's first quarter had just two weeks of covid impact. emea posted an adjusted operating profit of $21 million versus $15 million in 2020, primarily due to higher sales which offset some gross margin pressure from increased logistics expense, and also higher incentive costs. adjusted operating margin was approximately 14% versus 12%, last year. we expect emea to continue to perform well during the second quarter.
moving to the international segment. comparable sales declined significantly because of lower demand from the impact of covid19. while all markets declined, australia and asia sales trends continue to improve, sequentially, both down only 5%. however, brazil and mexico continue to be severely impacted by covid19 with sales down more than 50% as many schools and offices in both countries remain closed. the current expectation is that this situation will continue for the next several months. international adjusted operating income was $3 million compared with $8 million, last year, primarily as a result of the lower sales, which also reduced fixed cost absorption due to low volume. bad debt reserves in latin america remained high, but in total, only increased $700,000 versus last year. collections improved in brazil but were worse in mexico. let's move now to our balance sheet and cash flow. in the first quarter, we had $42 million of cash outflow from operations and the use of free cash flow of $46 million, which includes $4 million of capex. as expected, $28 million was used by powera for rebuilding working capital after the acquisition closed, since we did not purchase their receivables or payables in the transaction, and the business has also grown organically. if you exclude powera, our use of cash was lower this year than last year by $14 million. capex in the first quarter was $4 million and we paid $6 million in dividends. our capex outlook for 2021 is approximately $30 million, including $5 million related to powera. as we noted when we acquired powera and increased our debt, in the near term, we plan to use our cash to fund our dividend and to reduce debt. longer-term, we plan to use our free cash flow to fund our dividend, reduce debt, reduce -- repurchase shares, and make acquisitions.
during the quarter, we refinanced our bond and bank debt. the company issued $575 million of eight-year bonds at 4.25%. we also amended our bank agreement to lock in more favorable pricing and extend our maturity to march 2026. the refinancing will save $5 million in interest expense for the balance of this year. it also appropriately funds the powera acquisition with a better balance of long and short-term debt. at the end of the quarter, we had $219 million outstanding on our $600 million revolving credit facility and had $75 million cash-on-hand. our bank pro forma net leverage ratio was 4.5 times, which is in line with where we expected it to be after the purchase of powera. even with seasonal borrowings in the second quarter, we anticipate our leverage ratio to be approximately the same. we will use the majority of our free cash flow this year to reduce debt and with continued improvement in ebitda as we saw this quarter, and lower debt, we should reduce our year-end leverage ratio to approximately 3.5 times, which is where it was prior to purchasing powera. given our financial strength and the proactive steps we've taken to reduce costs, we expect to be able to maintain good liquidity as we manage through the current environment.
now, let's turn to our outlook. it continues to be difficult to forecast longer-term in this environment because there is still much uncertainty due to covid19. we are hopeful that as mass vaccinations continue to roll out, we will see reduced impacts from covid, particularly in the second half of this year and continuing through 2022. for the second quarter, we anticipate another strong performance by powera and the rest of our business will have easier comparisons. we are looking for organic growth in all three segments as we expect the recovery to continue. our second-quarter outlook for the entire company is for sales to be between $460 million to $490 million, with powera contributing between $50 million to $60 million. second-quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization are expected to be in the range of 25% to 30%. the outlook includes a favorable foreign exchange impact of 5% on sales and $0.01 to $0.02 on adjusted eps. we anticipate approximately $12 million of pre-tax intangible amortization will be excluded in the second quarter, based on our new definition of adjusted earnings, which represents approximately $0.09 on our adjusted eps basis. we have reinstated the compensation and benefit reductions we took in 2020. we are also planning to invest more in growth initiatives to support an anticipated stronger second-half demand. as such, our sg&a spending will increase in 2021 in all quarters compared with 2020.
we expect our productivity programs will deliver a more normal level of approximately $30 million-plus in savings for the full year. with respect to our cash flow outlook, we feel confident that we can generate at least $165 million of operating cash flow for the full year, and with capex expected to be approximately $30 million, we expect to generate at least $135 million of free cash flow. as i mentioned earlier, powera will not contribute a normal level of free cash flow in 2021 due to the structure of the acquisition agreement. in late december, we acquired powera without normal levels of accounts receivable and payable. we received an $18 million purchase price adjustment from the seller to account for the absence of working capital delivered at closing. but we also need to fund powera through both its seasonal peak in december and its substantial growth this year. thus, we anticipate minimal, if any, free cash flow impact from powera in 2021. powera working capital will be normalized in 2022 when we expect an incremental $25 million to $30 million in free cash flow contribution.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of chris mcginnis with sidoti & company.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hi good morning. thanks for taking my question and nice quarter. would you mind expanding on the growth in the commercial? how much of that is just that they haven't been spending through the course of the pandemic? and how do you think that should hold up for the rest of the year?
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive office
hi chris, thanks for the question. yes, the growth in commercial channels was pretty strong. you have to keep in mind that last year in q2, they really shut down purchases. so it's really a compare story. we do see more offices reopening. they're expecting more offices to reopen in the near future. so they're buying both for demand they have today as well as staging inventory for the demand that's going to come for the remainder of the year. so the growth throughout all segments of our commercial channels were very strong. whether it's independent or contract stationers, we saw very strong growth throughout. and we think more or less that story will continue for the remainder of the year. obviously, the compares will be different versus the worst quarter of the pandemic, which was q2 of last year. but still, from a sequential standpoint, we expect sequential growth for the remainder of the year.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
and if i could just add one follow-up, if it's all right. just on the powera, nice growth. can you just talk about from emea, how much that was up? and are you starting to gain traction there? i know it's very early on in the integration.
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive office
powera in emea had a good quarter, but they're still pretty small numbers. so that business is still driven very much by north american demand. we still have not implemented greater expansion plans for powera in emea. that's something that's going to come over the next several quarters. there's still significant upside in that business in emea. so despite that, we grew 19% in the quarter and 15% -- i'm sorry -- 53% year-to-date with powera globally.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. good luck q3.

your next question comes from the line of bradley thomas with keybanc capital mark.
andrew kenneth efimoff -- keybanc capital markets inc -- analyst
hi good morning boris and neal. this is andrew on for brad. congratulations on the strong results here. now that we're hopefully through the worst of the pandemic and it appears that you are starting to benefit from populations returning to the office and in-person learning at school, have you noticed any changes in the competitive environment for office products, particularly when you compare this environment to the pre-pandemic environment?
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive office
nothing meaningfully so. i mean, we're still in a competitive industry. we're benefiting from very strong brands that we have and strong distribution that we have. but the competitive environment is very similar. and i'm looking at neal. anything that you could add versus pre-pandemic levels? i don't think that there's anything...
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no change in competitiveness, but probably a change in which products are less popular and more popular as a result. so some of the paper storage products are less popular. people moved to more electronic storage and products that are used more for teamwork are showing strong signs.
andrew kenneth efimoff -- keybanc capital markets inc -- analyst
understood. if i may add on one quick follow-up. given the industrywide supply chain constraints, which you noted in your prepared remarks, are there any areas which you are facing product issues with product availability?
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive office
we have generic issues with product availability for everything that we bring in from asia. and that's not just us that is a global phenomenon with everybody. it's a function of logistics constraints, both on just the availability of containers as well as sporadic shutdown through the covid in asian countries. so this is something that we're dealing with and i think managing quite well, but the whole world is dealing with that. it had an impact on some of our product availability in q2, and we do expect sporadic issues throughout the rest of the year. and as neal mentioned, all of that is already baked into the guidance that we provided.
andrew kenneth efimoff -- keybanc capital markets inc -- analyst
understood. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of joe gomes with noble capital.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
good morning. nice quarter.
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive office
thanks, joe.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
so quick question on the cash flow. i mean you really knocked the ball out of the park this quarter. first quarter, you're raising or putting out some nice numbers for the second half of the year, but you really haven't raised your cash flow guidance. and i'm just wondering is that just you being conservative? or what's behind that?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, that's a good question. one of the reverse challenges people don't always focus on when you get a lot of return to growth is we need a lot more accounts receivable on the balance sheet at the end of the year. and so particularly around south america, a lot of our business there is very q4-centric in brazil and drives all into receivables at the end of the year. so although guidance is increased, we have two negative issues. we have more ar and we're also seeing a lot more dollars having to go into inventory. and as we've always mentioned all year, it's not changed, powera is a use of cash for us for the year, as opposed to a normal source. and their big quarter is q4.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
right. right. okay. and one quick follow-up, if i may, also on powera. sequentially, revenues declined. i think in the first quarter, powera revenues were north of $60 million; in this quarter they were $50 million. is that just, as you mentioned before, some of the seasonality in the business and the fact that there has been some outages in terms of the consoles? or is there anything else there?
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive office
yes, that's right, joe, a little bit of seasonality, but probably a bigger impact is the fact that the console makers have a difficult -- are in a difficult situation, meeting demand due to the semiconductor chip shortages. so their shipments were affected and that affected the sales of the accessories. our expectation is that there's going to be a partial recovery of that in the remainder of the year. there'll still be some shortages, but it should be better than q2, which should drive incremental sales of powera as well as just normal seasonality of the business, which improves in q3 and q4.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
thank you.
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive office
thanks joe.
operator
your next question comes from the line of william reuter for bank of america.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning. in your gross margin reconciliation there doesn't really seem to be any meaningful headwinds in terms of margin pressure from inputs nor transportation. i guess can you talk a little bit about whether this is the use of third-party manufacturers or whether you've contracted your ocean freight some length of time in advance? or what's contributing to the lack of pressure?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so we raised prices at the beginning of the year to offset the ocean freight issues, and so those were largely an offset to each other. they were a small drag of about 30 basis points adverse in the overall net. but in q3, as we kind of highlighted on our call, we expect, because we've seen it already go into our balance sheet in q2, significant increases of commodity costs. so it's just the way we have about three months worth of inventory. and so all the purchases in q2 have basically gone to inventory, and they will hit the p&l in q3. and so we will see a lot more margin pressure in q3, and that's part of why we also need to raise prices again in the late summer.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and then i guess just as my follow-up to that, given that you guys were successful in pushing through sufficient price increases here for the second quarter, will these next round of price increases largely make it so fourth quarter we shouldn't see much margin pressure at that point?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
obviously it would if we see stability through this quarter. if we see more surges in commodity costs then that will do a different story. but we're always, unfortunately, lagging what happens in the real world. but we currently think commodities hopefully have stabilized roughly where they are. that's our function in our forecast.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
make sense. okay thank you.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
were ready for the next question.
operator
your next question comes from the line of hamed khorsand with bws financial.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
good morning. question on the supply chain and what you're seeing in terms of pricing pressure, not just for q3, but expanding on what you said, how that -- is that impact -- the impact there competing for space on cargo carriers to bring product over? and do you see that as an obstacle in the second half of the year?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, we do. it continues to be an issue. there continues to be container shortage in asia. it's difficult to reserve space on ships. so we continue to have elongated lead times as a result of that, and we don't see a near-term resolution to that. so we expect that to continue through the second half of the year.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
i guess my question on a follow-up is, i mean that's pretty much what you said in your prepared remarks. but my question is mostly about in terms of capacity and space to get products over, are you bidding higher to make sure your products are arriving in time? or is it just first come, first served that you're just -- and you're not quite sure if your product, if you'll have enough inventory in the second half? is that an issue at all?
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive office
well, we have long-term contracts with our logistics providers where the price is agreed to. but sometimes we do have to bid or get a spot rate, which is significantly higher in order to get products here in time for a retail set or back-to-school seasonality. so yes, we try to be strategic about it, but sometimes we do have to bid a higher price and incur a higher cost in order to get a product here earlier in expedited fashion.
operator
[operator instructions] at this time, there are no further questions. do you have any closing remarks?
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive office
i do. okay. thanks, christy. thank you for your interest in acco brands. to summarize, as the economy has improved, we saw a very good recovery from the impacts of covid-19, with strong increases in many of our product lines, particularly on the commercial side. powera continues to post significant sales contributions. we're expecting a strong second half. the business has momentum and we should continue to see strong economic growth, back-to-school replenishment and the traditional seasonality of kensington and powera. we look to generate a significant amount of free cash flow, and we'll use it to reduce our debt. we remain confident about our longer-term future as we continue to position the company for higher growth and strong returns for our shareholders. we'll update you on our progress next quarter. thank you, and have a great day.

christine j. hanneman -- senior director of investor relation
good morning. this is christine hanneman, senior director of investor relations. welcome to acco brands second quarter 2021 conference call. speaking on the call today are boris elisman, chairman, president and chief executive officer of acco brands corporation; and neal fenwick, executive vice president and chief financial officer. slides that accompany this call have been posted to the investor relations section of accobrands.com. when speaking about our results, we may refer to adjusted results. adjusted results exclude transaction, integration, amortization and restructuring costs and other nonrecurring items and reflect an adjusted tax rate. schedules of adjusted results and other non-gaap financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures are in the earnings release and slides that accompany this call. due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts, we do not reconcile our forward-looking non-gaap measures.
beginning with the first quarter of this year, we changed the way we calculate and report adjusted non-gaap results by excluding noncash amortization of intangible assets. please see our press release for further explanation of this change. forward-looking statements made during the call, including statements concerning the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on the company are based on the beliefs and assumptions of management based on information available to us at the time the statements are made. all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially. please refer to our earnings release and sec filings for an explanation of certain of these risk factors and assumptions. our forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we assume no obligation to update them going forward. following our prepared remarks, we will hold a q&a session. now i will turn the call over to boris elisman.
boris y. elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive office
good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us. i will spend a few minutes reviewing the second quarter highlights. neal will follow me with details on the numbers and provide additional comments on our balance sheet, cash flow and second half outlook; then we'll take your questions. we had an excellent quarter with a rebound in demand for many of our commercial products, reflecting the economic recovery. second quarter sales and profits exceeded our internal expectations as we posted a significant increase in total sales as well as robust organic growth for both the second quarter and year-to-date.
our total second quarter sales were near record levels and comparable to 2019, and each of our segments experienced a steady improving level of demand throughout the quarter. i'm very pleased with our performance and remain confident in our strategy of transforming our business to become more consumer-oriented. in general, the u.s., emea, australia, new zealand and asia, continue to see strong recoveries as more people return to offices, hiring rebounded and many schools return to in-person learning. emea had an excellent quarter, driven by outstanding organic sales growth, returning the business to pre-pandemic levels. we believe we continue to take share as customers move toward the well-known brands and more reliable service that we provide. strong sales growth was widespread, led by computer accessories, diy tools, wellness products, shredders, art supplies and a general increase in demand from all categories. in north america, we had a robust recovery of office and commercial categories, which improved sequentially throughout the quarter as offices begin reopening.
our second quarter is usually driven by north america back-to-school orders, and we expect most schools will be open for in-person, 5-day-a-week education beginning this fall. our major customers have back-to-school inventory remaining from last year, so our second quarter sales, while very good, were lower than normal expected sell-in. we plan for this in our second quarter guidance. we have expectations for a strong total season, which should trigger greater replenishment needs in the second half, where our ability to locally produce product may be an added benefit due to global supply chain problems. powera had a very good second quarter performance with sales up 19%. it would have been even better, but gaming console product availability was restricted due to supply chain challenges, including semiconductor chip shortages.
there is substantial demand for overall gaming products and the console producers of backorders. we expect many more gaming consoles to ship in the seasonally stronger second half and believe powera sales will increase as it is well positioned to take advantage of greater demand. we continue to expect 25% sales growth for the year from powera. our integration of powera continues on track, and we expect to end the transition services agreement with the previous owner in august. we are pleased with this acquisition in all aspects. turning to the international segment. the region overall had a good quarter. latin america is still operating in a challenging environment, but vaccinations are increasing, and that should bode well for office and school reopenings to accelerate. in the quarter, the segment had organic sales growth and profit improvement despite sporadic lockdowns in various parts of the region. we're expecting continued recovery in this segment over the next few quarters. moving on. last year, our kensington computer accessories business received the largest order it has ever had, which means a difficult comparison in the second and third quarters this year. despite the difficult comps, the kensington business grew in the quarter as we continue to introduce new innovative products. one of those products, which i spoke about during our first quarter earnings call is the studiodock for apple ipads. that product has been so popular that it is now out of stock, and we have a lengthy backorder list which we expect to fulfill in the second half. despite increased competition, our trusens wellness products continued to perform well in the quarter with double-digit growth from last year. expanded product offerings in this category later this year and next should fuel continued growth of health and wellness products. turning to the supply side of the business. the main issues we face worldwide are continued supply chain disruptions due to covid-19 impacts and high inflation. we are carrying more inventory where possible because of elongated supply chain lead times. logistics costs have risen significantly compared with last year's rates as have the cost of commodities such as oil, plastics, steel and paper.
while the length of [indecipherable] have subsided, we expect costs to stay at these elevated levels at least through the rest of the year. as a result, we have taken price increases in most countries and announced additional price increases that will occur later this summer and fall. favorable foreign exchange is helping to mitigate some of the higher costs in emea, canada and parts of our international segment. in summary, we continue to focus on executing our strategy of improving sales growth and profitability by shifting our business toward more consumer-centric products and faster-growing channels.
as occurred this quarter, our growth will come from acquisitions such as powera as well as organic sales from demand recovery, innovative new products and market share gains. we have adapted quickly to take advantage of the changing post-pandemic environment by aggressively pursuing the long-term opportunities we think will grow most rapidly. we're making larger investments in growth areas such as video gaming accessories; wellness products; work, learn or play-from-home products and computer accessories, and are reducing our investments in some commercial office products that we expect will remain relatively weak longer term. although we're seeing some post-pandemic recovery even in these product lines as offices reopen. we now have better visibility for the second half and are expecting a sustained economic recovery in all regions in the third quarter. we believe that environment will lead to continued organic sales growth with inflation offsetting some of the gross profit gains from volume growth. for the full year, we're expecting record sales and a strong profit performance. now i will turn the call over to neal for a more detailed review of the segments, our outlook and other financial commentary, and then i'll join him in answering your questions. neal?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, boris, and good morning, everyone. our second quarter reported net sales increased 41% due to an increase in sales of commercial products as well as the contribution of powera, which added $51 million. our comparable sales rose 21%, helped by steadily improving market conditions. second quarter net income was $49 million or $0.50 per share. adjusted net income was $42 million and adjusted eps was $0.43, much better than our outlook, based on higher sales. our gross margin rose to almost 32% compared to 30% in 2020. the increase was largely the result of cost savings and lower inventory reserves. sg&a expenses were $98 million compared with $77 million last year. results in 2020 benefited from many pandemic-related temporary cost reduction efforts that impacted both sg&a and cost of goods sold.
this year's expenses are at a more normal level for our company. sg&a as a percent of sales was 19% compared to 21%, primarily because of higher net sales. reported operating income grew $50 million compared with $19 million last year. the operating margin was almost 10% versus 5% in 2020. we recorded $9 million of other income because of the brazilian supreme court tax ruling that will allow future offset for certain indirect taxes previously paid. we anticipate as the lower courts continue to apply the supreme court's ruling, we will record additional income in future periods. our adjusted tax rate of 28% was in line with our full year estimate of approximately 29%. ra sales rose 19%. however, the increase would have been larger, if not for a shortage of consoles related to the chip shortage, as boris described. we continue to expect a strong second half from powera as console manufacturers fill their back orders and because of the normal seasonally strong demand for the december holidays.
the powera earnout is payable in two equal installments over the next two years, if certain sales and profit targets are met. each quarter, we recognize any change in fair value of the earnout as an expense in our income statement. we expect quarterly charges throughout the two year earnout period. this quarter, we booked a $5 million expense related to the earnout, which, along with the $4 million of amortization related to the acquisition resulted in only a slight operating contribution from powera. powera contributed $0.03 to adjusted eps. now let's turn to some details of our segment results. net sales in north america increased 27%, largely due to the contribution from powera. comparable sales rose 8% as a result of strength in commercial office products. as expected, the sell-in back-to-school products was less than last year's second quarter as customers used inventory they held from last year. we still expect back-to-school season to be significantly higher than last year with replenishment to come in the third quarter and possibly also in the fourth quarter.
north america operating income and operating margin increased as a result of higher sales, $5 million of lower restructuring costs and $5 million less expense for inventory reserves. now let's turn to emea. net sales rose significantly to $157 million and comparable sales rose to $136 million, which are both above 2019 levels. the strong increases were the result of a general economic recovery as well as market share gains. we have now seen four quarters of strong business improvement in emea. emea posted a $10 million operating profit versus a $2 million loss last year, primarily due to the higher sales, which offset higher costs, particularly from normalized expenses and logistics.
moving to the international segment. net sales and comparable sales increased significantly because of higher demand in all countries. mexico and brazil continue to be impacted by covid-19, although we are seeing improvement as vaccination rates have increased. our businesses in australia, new zealand, asia and chile are much less impacted. as a result of improved sales, this segment posted an adjusted operating profit of $5 million versus a loss of $2 million last year. results were also helped by $2 million of lower bad debt reserves, $1 million of lower inventory reserves and $1 million of lower restructuring costs.
let's move now to our balance sheet and cash flow. in the second quarter, we used approximately $13 million in net cash from operating activities and had $18 million of free cash outflow. we paid dividends of $6 million and capex was approximately $5 million. year-to-date, we used approximately $55 million in net cash from operating activities and used $64 million of free cash outflow. we paid dividends of $12 million and capex grew $9 million. our use of cash was lower this year than last year by $12 million. if you exclude powera, it was $35 million better. as we have noted before, the planned use of free cash flow for this year will be to fund our dividend and to reduce debt. our capex outlook for 2021 is less than $30 million.
at quarter end, we had $331 million remaining on our $600 million revolving credit facility. we also had $78 million in cash on hand. our bank pro forma net leverage ratio improved to 4.2 times, which is better than we expected due to our stronger earnings. now let's turn to our outlook. we now have greater visibility to the rest of the year. therefore, we are enhancing our guidance to provide both a third quarter and full year outlook. our second half demand is expected to continue to improve compared with last year, especially with more companies returning to offices, at least in a hybrid mode. we expect a good sell-off of back-to-school products and foreign exchange should continue to be a benefit. likewise, the second half is seasonally strong for kensington and especially powera.
our third quarter outlook is for sales to be in the range of $515 million to $545 million. third quarter adjusted eps is expected to be in a range of $0.30 to $0.35. the third quarter outlook includes a favorable foreign exchange impact of 2% on sales and $0.01 on adjusted eps. we anticipate approximately $12 million of pre-tax intangible amortization will be excluded in the third quarter based on our definition of adjusted earnings, which represents approximately $0.09 on an adjusted eps basis. compared to the second quarter, we expect additional pressure on operating margins in the third quarter, mainly due to cost inflation, much of which [hit] inventory values in the second quarter and will impact the bottom line in the third quarter. most of the incremental price increases to offset inflation will not affect our results until the fourth quarter. all of this is baked into our guidance.
the fourth quarter will also incrementally benefit from strong powera sales due to its typical business seasonality. for the full year, our outlook is for sales to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.07 billion. full year adjusted eps is expected to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.45. this translates to adjusted ebitda in a range of $285 million to $300 million. and with our expected use of free cash flow to mainly reduce debt, we expect to achieve our leverage goal of 3.5 times or lower at year-end, similar to where it was before we purchased powera.
the full year outlook includes a favorable foreign exchange impact of 3% on sales and $0.05 on adjusted eps. we expect our normal productivity programs will deliver approximately $30 million in full year expense savings. the pre-tax amortization exclusion for the full year is estimated to be $47 million, which equates to approximately $0.34 on an adjusted eps basis. we feel confident that we can deliver at least $165 million of operating cash flow for the full year and, with capex expected to be less than $30 million, we will generate at least $135 million in free cash flow. that means we expect to generate approximately $220 million in cash flow in the second half. that type of performance has been a regular occurrence in our seasonally strong second half. now let's move on to q&a, where boris and i will be happy to take your questions. operator?

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question today comes from brad thomas from keybanc capital markets. please go ahead, brad. your line now open.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi. good morning, boris and neal. thanks for all the details. i will focus my question around gross margin. and given the world that we're operating in, with input costs going up and logistics and transportation costs going up, i was hoping if you could talk a little bit more about the puts and takes on gross margin as we think about 2022, and maybe a first cut at how we should be thinking about that for next year? thank you.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. good morning, brad. it's neal. so, like every other company, we are seeing worldwide escalation in costs for international and domestic freight together with commodity cost escalation. and all of that is feeding into our products. and as you probably heard from other companies, it's a developing story that is continuing to see increases, particularly now in commodity costs even though ocean freight has perhaps stabilized.
so we are playing catch up with pricing. you see that particularly, if you look, for example, in the third quarter at our emea segment, which wasn't able to raise prices until beginning of october. and you see a fairly significant impact on its gross margin. the other two segments, we're able to get the price increase in. we will need to raise prices again in the future to offset. and we have fundamentally committed to -- we have no choice, but to pass on the level of cost increases that we're seeing. we don't make enough gross profit to absorb it. and so we will be playing catch up on cost through next year, and we do expect to see our margins continue to recover. so year-over-year, perhaps improved, but they're just getting back to where they were in the long-term in 2019.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
and neal, just to be clear, as a follow-up on this topic, you still have some nice tailwinds from recovery and productivity initiatives. do you believe that each quarter going forward, there's still a good shot at continuing to expand gross margin just at a lesser rate than the environment? we're not so [speech overlap] is there a potential you start to see gross margin declines again? just trying to understand the magnitude of some of these things.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. if you look at the third quarter in total, pricing actually didn't offset cost. so cost was actually a drag on margin. so the thing that drove up margins was higher volume and product mix, together with our own cost-saving initiatives. so from a cost versus price perspective on commodities and freight, we're still playing catch up. what's driving the improvement in our margins is fundamentally the better mix of product sales and the higher volume of sales and our own cost reduction efforts.
boris elisman -- chairman and chief executive officer
we do expect improvement, to your point, brad. we expect improvement, just not as much as maybe we originally planned for it just because of the level of inflation we're seeing. but given the productivity initiatives, given expected volume recovery and the pricing we're passing through, we do expect to continue to improve our margins next year.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
very helpful. i will turn it over to others and get back in the queue.
boris elisman -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, brad.

thank you. our next question today comes from chris mcginnis from sidoti & company. please go ahead. your line is now open.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my questions. nice quarter. i guess just maybe to touch on powera just in q4. it sounds like it's going to obviously have some issues related to the console manufacturers. do you think you'll -- i don't know if i may have missed a forecast for powera in q4. i don't know if you gave one. but could you just provide where you think that will end up for the year and above or below your expectation there?
boris elisman -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. overall, let me just kind of go through a little bit of what happened this year. we entered this year with an expectation of 15% growth for powera15 [phonetic]. we had an incredibly strong first quarter. and in the back of the first quarter, we raised our expectations for the year to 25% growth. we maintained that through the second quarter.
we expected console product availability to be better in q3 based on information that was shared with the markets. that did not really happen. they're still in very, very tight supply. and console sales drive accessory sales. so because of that, we are reducing our forecast for powera to 20%, for the year. it's still outstanding growth. and as i mentioned, if anybody told me we're going to grow 20% as we entered 2021, i would have taken and signed it and said, great.
so even though we're reducing it from 25% to 20%, is still outstanding growth, and we expect a strong quarter, strong fourth quarter from powera, but there is some uncertainty in console product availability and that's really why we took it from 25% to 20%.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
totally understand. thanks for that color. and i guess just with the strong performance in back-to-school. can you just talk about maybe the competitive landscape? could you take share in the -- in that market? and maybe just a little more color around the sell-through or replenishment?
boris elisman -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. sure. sure, chris. yes, back-to-school was good is going to return to almost normal. there's still inventory kind of overhang, etc. from a seller perspective, it was almost normal. the overall school supply sales grew by 27% versus last year, which is a very strong recovery. and then we took share, our five star branded school products grew 39%. we were one of the fastest-growing school supply manufacturers during the season, took share and definitely are number-one in school notebooks in north america.
so we're very, very pleased with the season from a sell-out perspective and we're also pleased that the channel is exiting this back-to-school clean. there's not a level of additional incremental inventory that is left over. so we're very optimistic that next years sell-in is going to be really good because the channel is clean.
chris mcginnis -- sidoti & company -- analyst
great. thanks very much for taking my questions and good luck in q4.

our next question today comes from joe gomes with noble capital. please go ahead, joe, your line is now open.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
good morning. congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my question.
boris elisman -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, joe.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
so just wanted to talk a little bit here, get some more insight, boris, on the commercial reopening and how much -- where you think we stand on that and how much more positive impact can that have? if you look at emea, you've had five consecutive positive quarters there. how much is left there and same here in north america where it seems to be a little bit slower of return to normality. how much more do you think is still to come in the commercial reopening side and what can that mean for the top-line at acco? thank you.
boris elisman -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, joe. yes, we think there's still a tailwind in the commercial sales. if you look at north america, for example, where we have most third-party market research information on these things, we still have a lot of offices, especially in the enterprise space, that are operating remotely, especially the case in q3 when the delta variant spiked. people are now returning back to work, at least in a hybrid mode, some in q4 and some in q1 of next year and that's going to be a tailwind in north america.
we had positive sales comps, commercial sales comps, in north america but there's more to come given the return back to office in q3 -- sorry, in q4 and q1 of next year. we're seeing good commercial sales internationally as people are beginning to work from offices, more there as well. and the same thing is happening in emea. to your point, the comps are more difficult in emea because our sales have been very, very strong for five quarters in a row. but in emea too, people are beginning to return to offices this quarter more and more, so we should see some tailwind in commercial sales. i can't quantify that for you, but i do believe it's going to be a positive for sales growth.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
thanks for that, boris. i'll get back in queue.

thank you. our next question today comes from william reuter from bank of america. please go ahead, william. your line is now open.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning. so you mentioned in your prepared remarks that growth is going to continue to come from acquisitions. what does the pipeline look like at this point? where are valuations? and i guess, are you guys ready given leverage being down to take on a larger acquisition?
boris elisman -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, bill. thanks for the question. the pipeline is still strong. there's still a lot of opportunities. valuations are fairly high at this moment in our types of markets, consistent with what we've seen across the board. our net debt-to-ebitda ratio was down to 3.8 at the end of q3. so it's improving, but we would still like it to continue to improve before we are ready to do anything big. so we previously said that our target range is 2.0 to 2.5. that is still the case. we will continue to delever both this year and next. and the more we delever, the more of an opportunity for us to do something big. but our strategy is not changing. we think acquisitions are an important component of our growth strategy, but we want to make sure that we're managing it prudently and building over our balance sheet.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
very helpful commentary. thanks
boris elisman -- chairman and chief executive officer

thank you. our next question today comes from hamed khorsand from bws financial. please go ahead, hamed. your line is now open.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
good morning. i just wanted to ask if you're carrying more inventory play? do so, what kind of drag does this have on free cash flow abilities for next year? or are you expecting just demand to be so strong that you need that extra inventory?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
obviously, one of the things that's driving up inventory is both the unpredictability of the supply chain and also just the commodity cost increases that we've been seeing. so you're correct in pointing out that as a statement when inventory goes up, it's a drag on free cash flow. with that, obviously, comes the fact that you increase your payables for the same inflation, so you get a partial offset for that. but from a free cash flow perspective, part of what we've been doing this year is also working on receivables and payables. and so that's effectively going to allow us to still achieve our free cash flow target for the year, together with our ebitda, which is remaining very strong.
and so from a tax perspective, although our tax rate went up, our cash taxes are actually coming in lower than the original forecast for the year as is our capex. so there are several puts and takes. but overall, we're still on track to deliver our $135 million free cash flow for the year.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
and enough inventory going into 2022?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. we've got, in my view, a lot of inventory. and so if we see supply chains become more reliable, that's an opportunity in 2022, but we're going to go into 2022 with a lot of inventory compared to last year.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
okay. thank you.

our next question today comes from kevin steinke from barrington research. please go ahead. your line is now open.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
good morning. i was wondering if you could touch on your plans for the international rollout or further rollout of powera's products as you move into 2022? and are those plans impacted at all by the lack of console availability?
boris elisman -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, kevin. thanks for the question. the plans for incremental expansion international are really focused on asia. we don't have a significant presence or kind of legacy presence with powera in asia, and we have feet on the ground with acco. so if you look at countries like india, japan, china, we think there are opportunities there with powera in the second half of 2022. we're in the middle of that planning. to your second part of your question, we certainly hope and expect that by the second half of 2022, there'll be much better product availability of consoles, not to impact our incremental rollout. but obviously, we'll get more information to the contrary, we will scale our launches. but right now, we're not planning. we think it's a terrific opportunity, given that really half of the gaming world is in asia, and we have very little participation there. so we think it's a terrific opportunity for incremental growth for us.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay, great. thank you for taking the question.

thank you. our next question today is a follow-up from brad thomas from keybanc capital markets. please go ahead, brad, your line is now open.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks. boris and neal, i was hoping you could talk a little bit more about capex. i think you lowered that to, i think you said a little under $25 million this year. i believe the plan had originally been $30 million. that's still coming in pretty lean for what you guys historically had spent. and i think of the business being bigger now with powera. so i was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what the needs of the business probably are on a normal annual basis for capex and some of the priorities there?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, brad. one of the nice things about powera is we were able to leverage all the core systems that we'd spent a lot of money putting in. and so powera fundamentally, apart from just the take on cost of doing it this year, which is part of our capex for this year, doesn't add to our capex burden going forward. what does drive capex for us fundamentally is two things. it's basically new product rollouts together with a certain level of productivity, replacement for machinery, and it. it is really driven by erp transitions that we have to make. and the next couple of erp projects that we're working on are smaller ones. we had a significantly higher capex associated with transitioning the u.s./canadian business, which we spent in preceding years. and so on a go-forward basis, we're pretty comfortable that capex will be around $30 million.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst

hello, and welcome to the third quarter 2021 acco brands' earnings call. my name is emma, and i'll be your operator today. [operator instructions]
it's now my pleasure to hand you over to christine hanneman to begin today's call. christine, over to you.
christine hanneman -- senior director of investor relations
good morning. this is christine hanneman, senior director of investor relations. welcome to acco brands' third quarter 2021 conference call. speaking on the call today are boris elisman, chairman and chief executive officer of acco brands corporation; and neal fenwick, executive vice president and chief financial officer. slides that accompany this call have been posted to the investor relations section of accobrands.com.
while speaking about our results, we may refer to adjusted results. adjusted results exclude transaction, integration, amortization, and restructuring costs, and other non-recurring items and reflect an adjusted tax rate. schedules of adjusted results and other non-gaap financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures are in the earnings release and slides that accompany this call. due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts, we do not reconcile our forward-looking non-gaap measures.
forward-looking statements made during the call, including statements concerning the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on the company, are based on the beliefs and assumptions of management based on information available to us at the time the statements are made. our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and our actual results could differ materially. please refer to our earnings release and sec filings for an explanation of certain of these risk factors and assumptions. our forward-looking statements are made as of today and we assume no obligation to update them going forward. following our prepared remarks, we will hold a q&a session.
now, i will turn the call over to boris elisman.
boris elisman -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us.
i will spend a few minutes discussing the overall environment we are operating in and how it's impacting our business. neal will follow me with details on the numbers and provide additional comments on our balance sheet, cash flow, and outlook. then we will take your questions.
we had a good quarter based on the addition of powera, continued strength in emea, a solid back-to-school sell-out in north america and improvement in our international segment. all segments posted organic sales growth, including double-digit growth in comparable sales in emea.
during the quarter we continued to see steadily improving demand overall despite higher incidences of covid-19 during august and september. however, while commercial product sales were up, and back-to-school replenishment orders were solid, the increase in the delta variant in the quarter resulted in more muted demand for commercial products and less back-to-school replenishment than we would have seen otherwise.
in addition, global supply chain and semiconductor availability issues kept our backorders high which also delayed some shipments in the quarter. despite those challenges we saw economic recovery and improving end user demand throughout the quarter and believe that the steady recovery will continue in the fourth quarter.
let me now give you some color on our business. i'll begin with powera. we are pleased with the performance of this business, which had a good sales quarter but at the low end of our expectations. due to the chip shortages, video gaming console sales have been hampered by product availability issues throughout the year, and console sales are a major demand driver for the accessories sold by powera. we had expected console availability to improve in the third quarter, but it did not to any significant extent. there were few products on retail shelves and whatever shipments were received were sold immediately mostly through online channels. there continues to be strong demand for video gaming products and we expect console supply to improve over time, but console producers are still likely to have backorders in the fourth quarter.
as a result, we are reducing our outlook for powera sales growth this year to 20% from 25%. our business has enough product to sell in its seasonally strong fourth quarter and we are well-positioned to meet demand. we expect to continue to see a strong organic performance domestically from powera in 2022 and plan to begin incremental expansion internationally in the latter part of next year.
moving on, as we noted last quarter, the u.s back-to-school sell-in was impacted by an inventory overhang from 2020. back-to-school sell-through was solid this year with school supply sales growing 27% according to the preliminary information from external sources. our five star brand of school products took share again with sales growing 39% according to external sources. we were the leading notebook brand for back-to-school in north america.
the inventory overhang from last year's soft sell-out has been sold through. due to increased incidents of the delta variant, however, our customers were somewhat conservative in making replenishment orders. but we still had a reasonable amount of replenishment in the third quarter and i'm very pleased with our overall back-to-school performance. we will enter next year in a good position for back-to-school sell-in and have expectations for a strong 2022 season as the circumstances should be more normalized and the channel finished this season without access inventory.
moving now to our kensington brand, you may recall that last year that business had its largest order ever, so we were up against a very difficult comparison this quarter. if we exclude that large sale, kensington had double-digit sales growth versus last year and our total comparable sales increased 10% instead of 4%. kensington continues to focus on development of new products to fuel its growth and the pipeline for 2022 is robust.
emea had another excellent quarter with organic growth of 10% on top of a strong third quarter last year. we continue to take share in every part of our portfolio and especially strong growth in kensington, rapid, leitz, and derwent branded products. our team in emea is doing an excellent job and i'll expect our strong performance there to continue.
finally, let me talk a bit about our supply chain and the high freight and commodity costs we have been seeing. every business is facing supply chain delays and disruptions, whether it's ports congestion, factory closures, truck driver shortages, rail chassis shortages, shipping containers in the wrong places, etc. logistics and commodity costs have increased rapidly over the past year, and are still very high. while it is hard to predict, we don't see the situation improving until perhaps the second half of 2022.
our employees have been managing this difficult situation very well. we are carrying more inventory where possible because of elongated supply chain lead times. it also helps that we manufacture approximately 40% of our products in our local markets.
we've taken several price increases across all of our businesses globally to help offset the higher cost and we will announce additional price increases for 2022. we expect price increases to substantially mitigate the effects of inflation in 2021, but they won't fully offset them until next year because our pricing generally lags cost increases.
in summary, we believe that current recovery in demand will lead to continued organic sales growth and improved profitability in our business. for the full year, we continue to expect record sales and a strong profit performance. overall, we continue to focus on executing our long-term strategy of improving sales growth and profitability by shifting our business toward more consumer-centric products and faster-growing channels.
our growth will come from acquisitions such as powera, as well as organic sales from demand recovery, innovative new products, and market share gains. we are aggressively pursuing and investing in the long-term opportunities we think will grow most rapidly such as video gaming accessories, computer accessories, and work, learn or play from home products.
we've recently made some leadership changes to enhance our execution of this strategy. we have promoted tom tedford, who ran our north america operations, to president and chief operating officer and hired roxanne bernstein, who has strong consumer and marketing experience to run our north america segment.
we remain confident in our strategy and our solid financial position, especially our consistent, strong free cash flow generation. i'm pleased to report that our board shares that confidence and has approved a 15% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.075 per share.
now, i will turn the call over to neal for a more detailed review of the segments, our outlook, and other financial commentary, and then, i'll join him in answering your questions. neal?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, boris, and good morning, everyone.
our third quarter reported net sales increased 19% to $527 million, largely due to the contribution of powera, which added $57 million. our comparable sales rose 4% as we saw improved demand in most markets.
third quarter net income was $20 million or $0.21 per share, adjusted net income was $32 million and adjusted eps was $0.33 per share. our adjusted eps was adversely impacted by $0.03 from a much higher adjusted tax rate than originally forecast. without the change in tax rate, our adjusted eps would have been $0.36.
our gross margin rose 120 basis points to almost 30% compared with roughly 29% in 2020. the increase was largely the result of higher sales, a better product mix, and cost reductions. sg&a expenses were $102 million compared with $84 million last year. results in 2020 benefited from many pandemic-related temporary cost reduction efforts that impacted both sg&a and cost of goods sold. this year's expenses are at a more normal level for our company and also reflect the addition of powera. sg&a expense as a percent of sales was 19%, even with last year, as the higher expenditure was offset by higher sales.
reported operating income was $39 million compared with $34 million last year, and operating margin was slightly over 7% versus close to 8% in 2020 due to the dilution from the powera earnout and amortization. the powera earnout is payable in two equal installments in march of 2022 and 2023 if certain sales and profit targets are met. each quarter, we recognize any change in fair value of the earnout as an expense in our income statement. we expect quarterly charges throughout the earnout period.
this quarter we booked a $5 million expense related to the earnout, which, along with $4 million amortization related to the acquisition resulted in only a slight operating profit contribution from powera. without those charges, powera contributed $0.04 to adjusted eps.
we increased our full-year tax estimate to reflect changes in our forecast to geographic mix of income, interest expense limitations, and our gilti tax burden. this resulted in a 31% projection for 2021, increase from the previous level of 29%. for the third quarter, the 34.8% tax expense reflects the year-to-date true-up as the first two quarters had reflected a 29% projection.
now, let's turn to some details of our segment results. net sales in north america increased 21% to $288 million, largely due to the $45 million contribution from powera. comparable sales rose 1%, primarily from higher back-to-school and commercial sales, partially offset by the absence of a large kensington computer accessories order that shipped mainly in the third quarter last year. north america adjusted operating income and margin increased as a result of higher organic sales, powera and better product mix, primarily due to the absence of $22 million of lower margin kensington sales.
now let's turn to emea. net sales rose 18% to $161 million and comparable sales rose 10% to $151 million, which are both above 2019 levels. the strong increases were the result of the general economic recovery, as well as market share gains, including the benefit from the acquisition of franken product line.
we have now seen five consecutive quarters of strong business improvement in emea. emea posted a lower operating profit and margin due to higher logistics and commodity costs, as well as more normalized sg&a expenses versus last year. emea raised prices effective october 1, so we should see some margin improvements in the fourth quarter, but emea will likely need to take additional price increases in 2022 to offset inflation.
moving to the international segment. net sales increased 13% due to price increases, powera and favorable foreign exchange. comparable sales increased 5%, primarily because of higher prices. mexico and brazil continue to be impacted more by covid-19, although we are seeing improvement as vaccination rates have increased. mexico, essentially did not have a back-to-school season. we are hopeful that brazil will fare better with its back-to-school season as more children have returned this fall to in-person education. we expect the back-to-school season in brazil to be larger than the prior year. however, we anticipate that more sales are likely to move into the first quarter of 2022 and less in the fourth quarter of this year, which is the opposite of what historically has occurred.
our business in australia was negatively impacted by return to lockdowns. in new south wales, which has the largest population and it's where most of our sales occur, lockdowns impacted the entire third quarter. despite that, sales in australia were up mid-single digits in the quarter. the lockdowns are now over and the vaccination rates have improved markedly. so we are expecting australia to have a relatively good fourth quarter.
the international segment posted an adjusted operating profit of $10 million, much better than last year, primarily based on long-term cost reductions and higher pricing.
let's move now to our balance sheet and cash flow. in the third quarter, we generated $99 million in net cash from operating activities and had approximately $94 million of free cash flow. we paid dividends of $6 million and capex was $5 million. to-date, we generated $44 million in net cash from operating activities and generated $30 million of free cash flow. we have paid dividends of $19 million and capex was $14 million. our year-to-date free cash flow is $20 million higher than last year.
as we have noted before, the planned use of free cash flow for this year will be to reduce our debt and fund our dividend. our capex outlook for 2021 is less than $25 million. at quarter-end, we had $447 million available on our $600 million revolving credit facility. we repaid $117 million in debt in the quarter. our bank pro forma net leverage ratio improved to 3.8 times, which is in line with what we expected and results in incremental interest savings of over $400,000 for the next four months.
now let's turn to our outlook. our fourth quarter demand is expected to continue to improve compared to last year, especially with more companies expected to return to offices at least in a hybrid mode. foreign exchange, which has been a benefit, is not expected to add much to our fourth quarter since the u.s. dollar recovered strongly during the third quarter. as a reminder, the fourth quarter is normally very strong seasonally for powera, emea, and back-to-school in both australia and brazil.
we expect continued pressure on operating margins in the fourth quarter, mainly due to logistics and commodity cost inflation. however, the recent price increases will benefit our results in the fourth quarter and although they will not fully offset the cumulative impact of inflation, we should see margins expand, but they will still remain below 2019 levels. we have incorporated this into our guidance.
we are reducing the top-end of our sales outlook to reflect the impact of console availability for powera and we are modifying our adjusted eps to reflect the higher full-year tax rate. for the full year, our outlook is for sales to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.04 billion. full-year adjusted eps is expected to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.40 using a 31% tax rate. the impact of the higher tax rate on the full-year adjusted eps forecast is $0.04.
we forecast adjusted ebitda to still be in the range of $285 million to $300 million, which, at the high end, would bring us back to 2019 levels. with our expected use of free cash flow to mainly reduce debt, we expect to achieve our leverage goal of 3.5 times or lower at year-end, similar to where it was before we purchased powera. the full-year outlook includes a favorable foreign exchange impact of 2.5% on sales and $0.05 on adjusted eps.
we expect our normal productivity programs will deliver approximately $30 million in full-year expense savings. the pre-tax amortization exclusion for the full year is estimated to be $47 million, which equates to approximately $0.33 on an adjusted eps basis. we feel confident that we can deliver at least $135 million in free cash flow. we expect to generate at least $160 million of operating cash flow for the full year and capex is expected to be less than $25 million.

(operator instructions). your first question comes from brad thomas with keybanc capital markets. your line is open.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
yeah, hi good morning, boris, neal and jennifer.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning brad.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
wanted to ask first about the north america market and hoping boris, you could give us a little bit more color about how you're thinking about the run rate of the trends here in north america, to what degree is there, may be, some destocking that's going on, as a result of some of the consolidation. how much might that pressure you, as we start into 2019? and what do you think kind of the underlying run rate of the market looks like?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. we look at that 2018 as a reset year for north america. there was a lot of inventory that came out, especially from the two wholesalers in 2018, and it was just a lot of uncertainty, given merger planning that happened between the two of them initially, and then one of them in another company. so the whole environment on the commercial side was uncertain. as a result of that, the dealers were also sitting on the fence a little bit and not making significant investments in inventory.
we have seen sales rebound in january, so the people are now buying to sell through. we think the inventory has pretty much come out, and we do expect normalization in 2019. so what that normalization means, is we think that the wholesale and independent sales will be roughly flat. office superstores will continue to decline, as they continue to rationalize their store base, and especially in the retail end of their business, they are shifting more to private label and focusing more on services on the commercial end. so we do expect decline with superstores. and then the growth that's going to come from major mass and e-tail channels, and we saw similar growth in 2018. so the big change between 2018 and 2019 is really the inventory -- significant inventory coming out of the two wholesalers.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you, boris. and then if i could add a follow-up on the topic of acquisitions? i guess, could you give us any color on how the landscape seems to you for potential acquisitions, and is there any change positive or negative in light of some of the underlying trends around the world?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. the trends look similar brad. we did three acquisitions in the last three years. the funnel is still very robust. we're still being judicious in the decisions we make. the strategy is still to -- through (ph) acquisitions to reorient our business to more attractive categories, in more attractive markets, as we've done over the last three years. and my hope that we'll continue -- be able to continue to do that. as neal mentioned in his prepared remarks, we generate a lot of free cash flow, and we certainly would like to use part of that for acquisitions. so the strategy remains the same.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you very much boris.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, brad.

thank you. your next question comes from bill chappell with suntrust. your line is open.
grant o'brien -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
hi, good morning. this is actually grant on for bill. thanks for taking the question. first one is just on emea and the customer that became insolvent in the quarter. i don't know if you guys would quantify the impact on the top line in the quarter and then, is there any potential impact going forward, as maybe that customer liquidates inventory or any other impact on that market there?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
certainly. it's about a $3 million impact, and it was largely caused by them liquidating inventory in the fourth quarter. and so what we saw in january was a return to normal rates of business, as either the channel or directly or the wholesaler is actually in certain countries operating under bankruptcy protection, and is able to order in paper goods.
grant o'brien -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then actually one clarifying and question on the potential pricing actions in the u.s. if the tariffs do come through, will you be able to basically get that pricing through immediately, or will there be that three to six month lag time to pass that through to customers?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, it will be something in between. just the execution time will take probably 30 to 90 days for us to be able to execute a price increase. but we don't have to go through a three to six months notification process anymore. so it won't be in march, but it also will not have to wait until the fall timeframe.
grant o'brien -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
got it. thank you. i will pass it along.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from hamed khorsand with bws financial. your line is open.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
hey, good morning. so first off, could you just talk about your paper supply in 2019, you were talking about last quarter, and then what you're doing for 2020, given that georgia-pacific is now exiting the industry?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. paper supply for 2019 remains tight and to avoid the issues that we had in back-to-school 2018, we actually pre-bought paper in the fall of 2018, in order to secure our supply for back-to-school, to guarantee the supply for back-to-school. so we're fine for 2019 back-to-school. what we are looking to do in 2020, is actually source -- potentially source product from abroad to supply the u.s. back-to-school, so that we don't have this issue and we are initiating that process very early. given the exchange rates we think that foreign sourced paper could be competitive, with domestic paper for our needs, and that's the path that we're pursuing.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
okay. and then just talking about the u.s. size, as far as the wholesalers go, is the entire industry shrinking, or has this purely been a wholesaler driven issue?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
this is a wholesaler driven issue. if you look at sellout; sellout is roughly flat to minus 1%, minus 2%, in the categories. and as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, our sales in the u.s. were down 7%. so sales are significantly more affected than the sellout is, and that's because of the inventory coming out of the wholesale channel.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
okay. thank you.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, hamed.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from william reuter with bank of america. your line is open.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
hi. a couple of questions. first, your guidance for a high single digit contribution from pricing in north america, however sales are going to be flat to down low single-digits, that implies a pretty big decline in terms of units. i guess i would have been surprised that the unit declines in these categories would have been this great. can you talk a little bit about those unit declines and whether it's due to share losses on your part, or whether the units are declining that much?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes bill, this is the assumptions we are making on price elasticity for our products. we're assuming that everything that's going up in price, will be offset in volume, and then there's going to be additional declines from just channel shifts, as we mentioned office superstores are expected to decline, and not be fully offset with the growth in mass and e-tail and flat sales in wholesale independent. so it's the assumption that we are making. we hope we are wrong, but we think it's the right assumption under the circumstances.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and then your expectation, international sales grow high single digits longer-term kind of mid-single digits, are these due to share gains or are the categories in these regions growing this much in terms of units?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. the guidance that neal has provided, the color that was for 2019, and a lot of it is driven by the acquisitions that we made mid-year and a little tuck-in that we made earlier this year. so that's what's driving the high single digit growth, including currency and low double-digit growth, excluding currency. if you remove the acquisition, the growth will be more in the 3% to 5% range, which is our long-term view for that particular region.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and is this basically because some of these developing countries are actually continuing to consume more units, or use more units than they have been?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
that's correct. there is just positive demographics there with more people being educated, more people staying in school longer, and a shift from blue-collar to white-collar workforce, all of that is beneficial for our categories.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and then just lastly for me, you've repurchased bonds in the second quarter of 2018. will you consider bond repurchases with your free cash flow in 2019? how do you think about that?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
please understand, we don't give the right to comment on what we intend to do going forward. we look at all things opportunistically, and make decisions from time-to-time. and that's all (inaudible).
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. i will pass to others. thank you.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks bill.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from hale holden with barclays. your line is open.
hale holden -- barclays -- analyst
hi. thank you for taking the call. i just had two quick ones. boris, why do you think you didn't see any orders over the last two weeks of december, because you guys were very vocal about taking price increases on january, who would've thought some guys would've bought ahead of that?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes hale, we believe it's a combination of things. if you remember, the market environment in december, there are a lot of concerns about trade and u.s. fed raising rates. so we think that played into it.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
government shutdown as well.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
and the government shutdown coming in at the end of december, exactly. and then the other thing is the inventory levels of our big customers, as they brought in additional inventory ahead of tariffs, everybody thought that tariffs will go up to 25% and all of those decisions were made probably in the september timeframe. so when the u.s. government made the decision to keep the tariffs at 10% in december, it was too late, that inventory was already coming in, and we think there was just not enough space to take in additional products. so we think that played into it.
and then the other thing that we think played into it, is just the change in metrics for some of our customers, who are -- have undergone an ownership transition, and are just operating to different metrics or they either made their numbers and decided to delay until next year, or they didn't make their numbers and have no reason to chase. so i think it's a combination of all those things that affected december.
hale holden -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you. and then the second question is, you called out source (ph) sales on planning products in december, and just wondering, if you've seen that catch up in january or if that was just products that probably weren't going to sell through this year, or if it's even meaningful?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. our big planning selling season is november, december and january. and from a compare standpoint, we had placement of a lot of skus with one of the major retailers in the u.s. in 2017, and we didn't have that placement in 2018. so sales were down in december, and sales at wholesale were down a little bit in january as well.
hale holden -- barclays -- analyst
got it. but it's not inventory that you are getting stuck with necessarily? it's just a comparable issue?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's not an inventory issue. right. placement issue.
hale holden -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you so much for the time. i appreciate it.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from karru martinson with jefferies. your line is open.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning. in terms of the long-term two times to two and a half times target, we're kind of close to that on leverage today. i mean what's the timetable that you guys see yourself getting there and kind of maintaining that level?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we believe that with -- under normal conditions, we should get there in the next 12 to 18 months. but of course, how we perform is going to influence that, and if we do any acquisitions, are going to influence that. it is a priority for us to try to get to at least 2.5x, because we will be able to have complete flexibility on when we do what, including share repurchases. but we also are not going to hold off on a strategic acquisition, in order to get to that 2.5x level. we're very comfortable with where we are today at 2.8x. we'd like to get to 2.5x in the near term. but we will apply business judgment to that, as we go to it.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. when you guys talk about having a pipeline of acquisitions; i mean, it seems like the industry, every couple of years goes through a major consolidation. are these -- is this pipeline kind of tuck-in varieties, or are we due for another wave of that industry consolidation?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. the industry consolidation that we've been seeing, is more on the channel side. so we don't really participate in that. the acquisitions that we have done recently, is really expanding in the international markets, where the industry conditions and market conditions are more attractive. so we see a lot of opportunity still on that end, getting bigger and faster-growing markets. there could be some consolidating acquisitions, but those for us would have to be very meaningful and very accretive. i think the chances of that are lower than just expanding in the international markets. and then, we still continue to look at adjacencies. but as i mentioned, on prior quarters, the evaluation there is a little bit too high to make it meaningful for our shareholders.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. and i realize that it's early days, but wholesale had -- wholesale disruption had been a stable category, now, one of the big players being taken over, how does that change the dynamics in that segment of the market?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. karru, to your point, it's too early to tell. we kind of expect a continued normal behavior from the customers at least in the first few quarters. over the long term, we certainly do expect that there'll be some shift of purchasing from dealers, from one wholesaler to the other. we think net-net, it will probably be neutral for us. but there could be some quarter-to-quarter variations that may impact our sales. but in the near term, we expect normal behavior.
karru martinson -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you very much guys. appreciate it.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from kevin steinke with barrington. your line is open.
kevin steinke -- barrington -- analyst
good morning. what were you able to find, that enabled you to increase your target for the (inaudible) synergies?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we just -- we had -- i don't want to say conservative, but we had realistic synergy plans, and we executed broadly at the high-end of the top end of, really of our expectations. i think it was all -- it wasn't any new initiatives that we uncovered. but i would say, our execution has been outstanding for the last two years, whether it's facilities' consolidation, or removing duplicate functions or duplicate costs in the business. our european team has done a really outstanding job delivering and obviously over-delivering to synergies. so that's really what drove the overperformance for the last two years, and we have raised our expectations for synergies now from $23 million that we had at the time of the acquisition to now $32 million that we'll deliver by the end of this year.
kevin steinke -- barrington -- analyst
okay. good. and on the small acquisition you did in australia, could you offer any more detail in terms of size or what it brings to you strategically?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's a small tuck-in. it's not really material to our results. we bought inventory, customer list and brands from a small company in australia, and it allows us to get a little bit bigger in the categories where we are present, and leverage scale and it also allows us to increase our share in (inaudible), which is an attractive category in australia, as well as a bigger participation in some of the higher margin calendar products, which is also a new category for us in australia. so we look at it as just a small tuck-in that's very-very accretive for our shareholders.
kevin steinke -- barrington -- analyst
okay, good. and lastly, as we think about incentive compensation, how much of a headwind is that to your 2019 guidance versus 2018? just the assumption i guess that it's restored, i guess, on an eps basis?
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so it's about a $21 million impact in terms of costs that we didn't pay in 2018, and we hope to pay it in 2019. so if you just look at it in pure eps, it will be about $0.14.
kevin steinke -- barrington -- analyst
okay. thanks. that's very helpful. thanks for taking the questions.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks kevin.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from joe gomes with noble capital market. your line is open.
joe gomes -- noble capital market -- analyst
good morning. and i apologize in advance if i repeat some questions here, i had little phone issues here earlier. but just on the competitive environment, that you guys have raised prices here twice. and just wondering, what are you seeing the competitors doing, so where -- on a relative basis, are you still, vis-a-vis your competitors, in terms of pricing and everything?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes joe. we always look at competition when we adjust prices. we believe we are very price competitive with companies that we compete with. if they weren't, we wouldn't be adjusting prices. everybody is using the same commodities, everybody is seeing the same cost increases on steel and aluminum and paper and transportation and tariffs, right? so we think from a competitive standpoint, where we need to be. raising prices is never easy, customers never like price increases, regardless of whether there is high inflation or low inflation, so there's always a challenging process, but this is something we absolutely have to do, given the rising costs that we see, in the u. s. and canada and in many other countries of the world. so we have to recover costs and our team historically has done a great job of adjusting our prices to make sure that we recover costs.
joe gomes -- noble capital market -- analyst
okay great. and then on the dollar store channel. over the last two quarters, you've mentioned it as having a impact on profitability. but just wondering, what is the differential currently with dollar store channel margins vis-a -vis, the overall corporate margins, when do you expect the dollar store channel margins to kind of migrate, hopefully up, toward the corporate overall margin area? how big is the dollar store channel today as a percent of revenues?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes the dollar store channel is very small for us the u.s. it's something that is growing. it's something that we believe we need to become more successful. we are not happy with the balance we had between revenues and profitability in 2018 in that channel. so we're going to be more balanced between revenues and profitability and margin in 2019. but it is still an important channel for us, because more and more consumers shop in that channel and we want to go and we have to be where the consumers shop. so it's a small part of our business. we're talking about single digits in terms of millions of sales. but we'd like to grow it more and we'd like it to be more profitable than it is.
joe gomes -- noble capital market -- analyst
okay, great. thank you very much.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer

good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the acco brands fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings conference call. (operator instructions). as a reminder this call is being recorded.
i would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, jennifer rice, vice president investor relations. ma'am you may begin.
jennifer rice -- vice president of investor relations
good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2018 conference call. speaking on the call today are boris elisman, chairman president and chief executive officer of acco brands corporation; and neal fenwick executive vice president and chief financial officer.
slides that accompany this call have been posted to the investor relations section of accobrands.com. we also posted a newly refreshed investor overview presentation to our investor relations website this morning. when speaking to quarterly results, we may refer to adjusted results. adjusted results exclude transaction, integration and restructuring costs, and apply a tax rate of 32% for the current quarter and 30% for the current year. this is a change from our previous assumption.
schedules of adjusted results and other non-gaap financial measures and a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures are in this morning's earnings release and the slides that accompany this call. due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts, we do not reconcile our forward-looking adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow, net leverage ratio, or normalized tax rate guidance.
forward-looking statements made during the call are based on certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results could differ materially. please refer to our press release and sec filings for an explanation of certain of these risk factors and assumptions. our forward-looking statements statements are made as of today's date, and we assume no obligation to update them going forward. following our prepared remarks, we will hold a q&a session.
now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to boris elisman.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning everyone. our fourth quarter results were somewhat mixed. our free cash flow was higher than our revised expectations, but our sales and earnings were lower. the softer sales resulted from lower-than-expected orders in december, especially in the last two weeks of the month. our adjusted earnings were lower than anticipated, due to the adverse impact from the higher tax rate, which reduced eps by $0.02.
our results were also mixed for the year in total. sales and profits were down in the u.s. and international, but we had an excellent year in emea. my comments this morning will focus on the main drivers behind our performance in 2018, and describe the actions we have taken and will take in response. i will also comment on our strategy for the new year.
i will begin with and spent most of my time on the u.s., since this is where we saw a significant degradation on our financial performance, which was disappointing to me and to my management team. prior to 2018, our business in the u.s. had four straight years of profit improvements with moderate sales declines, largely caused by the office superstore consolidation. our team did a great job managing the consolidation, and associated channel transitions, with growth in mass and e-tail channels, largely offsetting reduced sales to office superstores, as they closed retail locations and distribution centers. office wholesalers and independents were relatively stable over those years.
on the cost side, u.s. inflation was mild during these years and we were able to drive significant profitability improvements in our u.s. business, through cost reductions and better productivity. it is largely the u.s. improvements that drove organic profit improvements in our total business prior to 2018.
but what was so different about 2018 than the preceding four years? on the revenue side the major difference can be explained by the two office wholesalers. they were in merger planning throughout most of the year and their actions to prepare for their merger, as well as the uncertainty the merger created in the independent dealer community, significantly affected sales. u.s. sales declined 7% in 2018, and roughly 4% of that was due to a sales decline with the two office wholesalers. without that, our u.s. sales decline would have been around 3%, consistent with the range that we have seen in recent years.
two other factors that impacted our u.s. sales and global sales, especially in q4, were lost share in planning products and no end of year buying ahead of price increases, especially in december, as i mentioned earlier. our u.s. gross margin was also impacted by lower sales to office wholesalers and independents, especially in the second half of the year, and higher sales to dollar stores or back-to-school, as well as lower sales of planning products, especially in q4.
on the cost side, we saw major increases in the raw materials and logistics costs beginning in the spring of 2018 with paper, steel, transportation and fuel, up double digits from 2017 levels. in addition, beginning in april we began to experience a progressive increase in tariffs and chinese imports that continued through the year. all in, inflation and tariffs added approximately $15 million, one five, to our cost for the year.
it is normal in our industry to give notice to customers for price increases, so there's typically a three to six months lag time between our decision to increase prices, and our ability to implement. as a result, in a rapidly rising inflationary environment, such as the one we experienced in 2018 in the u.s., it was not possible to implement price increases fast enough to fully offset the increased costs.
we raised prices in the u.s. in october, but that was based on the latest cost information available at the time of the pricing notification. as costs kept rising and new tariffs went into place at the end of september, october increases weren't enough to recover margins. we are raising prices again beginning in january of this year in the u.s. and in most other countries. and if the u.s. tariffs stay as they are today, and commodities oscillate within the expected ranges, we should fully recover last year's cost increases.
as you know, there's a possibility that the u.s. will further raise tariffs on chinese imports beginning in march. and if that happens, we have already notified our customers that we plan to immediately increase prices on effective products in the u.s.
we have also taken several actions to reduce our operating costs in the u.s. in addition to ongoing productivity initiatives, last quarter, we communicated $5 million in cost reductions associated with reducing our u.s. headcount. we are now expanding our plans to reduce structural costs in the u.s. by another $6 million, which includes both headcount, as well as improved manufacturing efficiencies. this brings the total of new structural cost reductions to $11 million, which we expect to realize mostly in 2019.
in the u.s., we expect these and other actions will deliver flat to moderate sales declines and improved profitability in 2019. in terms of sales, we expect the u.s. channel environment to remain difficult. we expect wholesaler and independent dealers sales to be roughly flat. a few months ago, we launched a program to incentivize independent dealers to buy directly from us. the purpose of the program, is to make independent dealers more price competitive with e-tailers and superstores. the initial results from the program are very positive, and we plan to continue this activation (ph) with dealers in 2019.
we expect office superstores to continue to decline, but their decline is expected to be mostly offset by growth in mass, e-tail, and tech channels. we grew back-to-school sales 2% last year and based on early customer information, we expect 2019 back-to-school sales growth to be comparable to 2018. we continue to reorient our portfolio toward consumer-centric categories and the brands, and back-to-school is an increasingly important part of our u.s. results. in addition, kensington computer accessories grew 6% last year in the u.s., and we believe their growth, through the tech channel, will continue this year.
turning now to emea; we had great results in that segment in 2018. comparable sales were up approximately 2%, with broad growth of branded products throughout the region, offsetting declines in private label sales, and the insolvency of a significant customer. we had especially strong growth with rexel shredders, kensington computer accessories, and derwent art pencils. we have expanded product listings in emea for 2019, which we expect to drive continued positive sales momentum. beyond sales growth, we realized substantial cost synergies from the merger with esselte and margins for the year were up significantly.
i'm very pleased with our results in emea. we are positioned well strategically throughout the region. our execution is very strong, and i'm optimistic to have another year of low single digit organic sales growth and further profit expansion. our international performance was mixed, but we saw sequential comparable sales improvement every quarter throughout the year. we had another outstanding year in brazil, with sales up high-single digits, despite a difficult economy. selling (ph) for this back-to-school season was very strong, and we are hoping for a solid sellout season. business confidence in brazil has improved post-election, and gdp growth is forecasted to increase.
australia had a slow start to the year, as two large customers merged, but comparable sales trends improved throughout the year, despite the environment remaining challenging. mexico had a difficult year, especially in the first half, with our major customer implementing a more conservative inventory management strategy.
on the other hand, we were very pleased with the initial six months from the goba acquisition, and believe our combined mexican business is positioned for strong growth in 2019. asia also had a difficult first half, but stronger growth in q3 and q4. there is improving momentum in international, and altogether, we expect mid-single digit growth in 2019.
now to review our strategy; over the last several years, we have been shifting our business through organic initiatives and acquisitions toward stronger brands, more value-added products, faster-growing geographies and a more diversified customer base. we have complemented these investments with the ongoing cost reductions and productivity improvements initiatives, especially in more mature countries, and with declining channels. as a result of the strategy, we were able to grow our free cash flow from $146 million in 2014, to $161 million in 2018, and return to some of this cash to our shareholders, initiating a share repurchase program in 2014 and a dividend last year. in total, we returned $216 million to shareholders over the last four and a half years, including $100 million in 2018.
we believe we have the right strategy for our company. we'll continue to reorient our business toward faster-growing product categories and geographies, stronger brands, and complementary channels, both organically and through acquisitions. we'll continue to drive aggressive productivity initiatives and scale our cost with revenues as appropriate, and we'll continue to use our free cash flow in a balanced way to reposition our business and reward our shareholders.
neal will discuss our 2019 guidance, but i will review our longer-term business expectations. beyond 2019, based on the strategies we have in place today, we expect our company to deliver top line growth in the range of 0% to 2% compounded annually. we expect this growth to be driven by 0% to 2% growth in emea, and a 3% to 5% growth in international. this will offset north america, which should be flat to down 2%. we anticipate our gross margin being in the 33% to 34% range, and sg&a in the mid-19% range.
in summary, despite a challenging year in 2018, we remain confident about our future and continue to position the company for growth. as jennifer mentioned at the beginning of this call, we have developed an updated investor presentation available in the ir section of our website, that provides more granularity into our business and strategy and long-term targets, which we hope you will find helpful.
with that, i will hand it over to neal, to give you more details on our quarter.
neal v. fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, boris, and good morning everyone. fourth quarter sales decreased 7% and comparable sales decreased 5%, primarily due to lower sales in the u.s. reported eps decreased 50% to $0.34 per share, due primarily to the non-repeat of a $25.7 million tax benefit and lower operating income. adjusted eps decreased 15% to $0.41 in the quarter. we had a higher-than-anticipated tax rate in the year, which had to true-up in the quarter, primarily due to our lower u.s. earnings. our gross profit was lower in the quarter, primarily due to the u.s. business.
overall, our reported an adjusted gross margin declined 170 basis points to 33.5%, as detailed on page 10 of our slide deck. the decline was mainly attributable to adverse customer mix, product mix, and obsolete inventory, which together accounted for 160 basis points of the decline. inflation, net of price increases, drove a further 50 basis point reduction year-over-year. these factors offset costs and synergy savings of $5.4 million, which were favorable by 50 basis points. we expect to continue to offset higher costs currently and in the future quarters, with price increases and cost reductions.
we were able to deliver an improvement in sg&a in the quarter. as a percent of sales, reported sg&a was lower by 40 basis points and adjusted sg&a was lower by 20 basis points. the improvement in adjusted sg&a was enabled by a 120 basis points benefits from lower incentive compensation expense, and 10 basis points from cost reductions and synergy savings. these benefits more than offset the negative effect of lower sales volume, which was 110 basis points. all in reported and adjusted operating income and margin both decreased due to the lower sales in gross profit, partially offset by cost reductions.
turning now to the full year results; sales decreased 0.4% and comparable sales decreased 3%, due to lower sales in the u.s. and international. reported eps declined 16%, primarily due to the non-repeat of a $25.7 million one-time tax benefit related to the new u.s. tax code in the prior year. adjusted eps declined 4% for the year, driven by lower sales and gross profit in the u.s. foreign currency had a $0.02 adverse impact on the year, while share repurchase was a benefit of $0.04, and lower full year tax rate was a benefit of $0.03. reported an adjusted gross margin declined 140 and 150 basis points respectively for the 12 month period as shown on slide 12, driven by largely adverse mix and $15 million of inflation, including tariffs. sg&a however showed improvement year-over-year.
on a reported basis, sg&a was lower by 110 basis points, and on an adjusted basis, was lower by 60 basis points. the improvement in sg&a for the year was driven by lower cost, including $20.8 million or 100 basis points from lower incentive compensation expense, and 50 basis points from cost savings and synergies.
for the year, we realized a total of $32 million savings, of which $19 million was from productivity initiatives, and $13 million was from acquisition synergy savings. for 2019, we have higher cost saving targets, and will also offset cost of reinstating our incentive compensation.
all in, reported operating income was slightly up and margins were flat. adjusted operating income declined, and margin was down 90 basis points, primarily due to lower profit in the u.s. reported and adjusted net income were down year-over-year, due to the lower sales and gross margin.
since boris provided a lot of commentary on our segment results, i will just hit the highlights. in north america, fourth quarter sales decreased 9.6%, primarily due to the u.s., where we had lower sales to wholesalers, and lower sales of calendar products, due to lost market share. we did start to see the benefits of our october price increases, which added 2.5%.
for the full year, north america sales decreased 6%, as market share gains in back-to-school were more than offset by lower sales in the wholesaler channel and in calendar product. north america reported an adjusted operating income and margin were both down in the quarter and the year.
margins declined due to unfavorable customer and product mix, specifically lower sales to the wholesaler channel, and increased sales to the dollar store channel, and lower sales of calendar products, along with more sales of competition notebooks. we also experienced inflation from higher material and transportation costs and tariffs. these impacts were partially offset by price increases and lower incentive compensation expense.
fourth quarter results, includes a $3 million charge we noted last quarter related to actions to reduce our u.s. headcount, driving savings of $5 million, mostly in 2019. we will incur additional restructuring charges in q1, related to the cost reduction initiatives boris has noted.
in our emea segment, sales decreased 6% or 2% on a comparable basis in q4. the decline was primarily due to lower sales to our wholesale customers that became insolvent in some countries during the quarter. it's important to note that emea returned to growth this january.
for the year, emea comparable sales increased 2%, driven by expended distribution of legacy acco products, the esselte customer base, with strong growth in shredders and computer accessories.
for emea operating income improved in the quarter due to lower charges. adjusted operating income and margin declined slightly, due to lower sales and higher costs and the business has now increased prices in january to offset inflation. for the year, emea delivered a strong growth and profitability with adjusted margins up 200 basis points due to cost synergies, favorable product mix, and higher volume.
in our international segment, fourth quarter comparable sales were flat. we continue to see growth in brazil and asia, offset by declines in australia and our legacy business in mexico, where we continue to recover from the effects of substantial inventory reductions by one large customer, earlier in the year.
for the year international sales declined approximately 3% on a reported and comparable basis, due to declines in australia and in mexico, particularly during the first half of the year, which offset strong growth in brazil. international reported an adjusted operating income, both decreased for the quarter and the year, primarily due to adverse foreign exchange. our normalized tax rate for 2018 was 30%, a point higher than what we previously estimated. the increase primarily results from lower u.s. earnings and finalization of the u.s. tax reform act.
turning now to our cash flow and balance sheet; we continue to generate strong operating cash flow, allowing us to consistently invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. for the full year, we generated $160 million in free cash flow, and we paid $25 million in dividends, purchased 6 million shares for $75 million, and repaid $62 million in debt. we paid $38 million for the goba acquisition from increased debt and we ended the year with 2.8x net leverage.
in terms of working capital, our inventory balance was up year-over-year by $86 million, funded by payables which were up $96 million. while both are impacted by fx and the goba acquisition, the predominant reasons for the increases were the strategic decisions we made to increase inventory, to secure paper for the 2019 back-to-school season, and to buy ahead of anticipated inflation, tariff-related increases and anticipated port disruption.
we also increased inventory to support new product launches and stronger sales of our computer accessories and shredders; because of these decisions, the cadence of our cash flow in 2019 will be different year-over-year in q1 and q2. we anticipate a large outflow in q1, as payables unwind, and less-than-usual outflow in q2, as we won't need to build as much inventory for back-to-school. our full year 2019 cash flow should not be impacted.
turning now to our 2019 guidance. we expect sales to be flat to down 3%, including an adverse 2% impact from foreign currency translation using recent spot rates. we expect earnings per share of $1.10 to $1.20, assuming a $0.03 impact from adverse foreign exchange, and assuming a 30% to 31% normalized tax rate. we estimate free cash flow to be in the range, $165 million to $175 million. at the segment level, we are expecting north america sales to be flat to down low single digits for the year, including a high single digit contribution from pricing. we are expecting emea to be down low single digits because of foreign currency. excluding currency, we expect emea sales to increase low single-digits.
and for international, we are expecting sales to be up high single digits with currency. excluding currency, we expect international sales to increase low double digits, due to the goba acquisition. by quarter for sales, we estimate adverse foreign currency will be most pronounced in q1, an approximate 5% to 6% adverse impact, lessening to about 2% in q2, and 1% in q3, and then a marginal impact in q4. based on current foreign currency spot rates, eps will be adversely impacted in the first half of the year by $0.02 in q1 and $0.01 in q2.
the quarterly cadence of our earnings should be somewhat similar to 2018, with acquisitions offsetting the negative effects of fx in q1 and q2. in q3, we have a tough comp, as we lack the substantial release of incentive compensation accruals, that had a $0.07 benefit in q3 of 2018. as usual, we don't yet know if back-to-school shipments will fall more into june or july, but this timing could result in the shift of sales and earnings between q2 and q3. we have provided numerous additional modeling assumptions on page 18 of our slide presentation.
with that i'll conclude my remarks and move on to q&a where boris and i will be happy to take your questions. operator?

thank you. ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question at this time, please press * then 1 on your touchtone telephone. if your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, you may press the # key. as well, we do ask that you please place your line on mute once your question has been stated to prevent any background noise during response. once again, that is * then 1 to ask a question. our first question comes from bill chappell with suntrust. your line is now open.
bill chappell -- suntrust -- analyst
thanks. good morning. hey boris, just talk a little bit more about the commercial destock. just trying to understand how this is different. was it just different timing you were expecting? typically, these happen more in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. was it a greater magnitude? just because this has been going for several years and surprised that there's more of a kneejerk reaction. and so, didn't know if it had to do with the consolidation of a couple players there. and just help us understand why now and why it was such a surprise.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure, bill. typical cycle that we see out of the commercial office wholesalers is they order up in q3 and especially in q4 to prepare for their strong selling season which is the first quarter of the year and also to hit their annual volume target too to be able to achieve a certain rebate level. and that's the pattern that we've seen for many years. it varies a little bit player by player and year to year. but in general, that's the pattern that we've seen. that's also what happened in the end of '17 when both wholesalers ordered a bunch of inventory to hit their volume rebate and prepare for the strong selling season.
our sales to them were pretty low in the first half of 2018 as we bled down the inventory. so, we anticipated that replenishment and the beginning of the cycle that we've seen in prior years. we didn't see that at all. so, what we saw in q3 which was not what we expected were continued reduction in purchases from both wholesalers. the industry is going through a consolidation, as you mentioned. so, that probably has something to do with that. also, potentially, them losing share to other players in the industry has something to do with that. we don't have the specific answers as to why. but certainly, the facts are that they ordered significantly less than we expected in q3. and given what we saw in q3, we anticipate that that will continue in q4. that's the basis for our guidance.
bill chappell -- suntrust -- analyst
got it. if i'm looking at the guidance for the full-year, it appears that a majority of the impact was in 3q. is that fair? or do you expect more of a similar to carry into october, november?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
the majority of the impact was in q3, but we do expect a further drag in q4. not by the same magnitude, but it will still be there.
bill chappell -- suntrust -- analyst
got it. and then the other question. i'm surprised, i guess glad to hear about your gross margin outlook for next year. but with tariffs, with currency, that implies a pretty meaningful price increase that you'll probably have to take to at least expand gross margins. is that the right way to look at it for next year?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. the price increases will be pretty meaningful. we took about a 3% price increase in october. and there's a large price increase coming in early 2019 to make up for all of the inflation in tariffs that we are seeing already.
bill chappell -- suntrust -- analyst
got it. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from kevin steinke with barrington research. your line is now open.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
good morning. hey, could you talk a little bit about the 150 basis point gross margin headwind from product and customer mix in the third quarter?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. neal will reply to that, kevin. one second.
neal fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. so, in terms of the mix issues, we actually had two reverse things going on. we had favorable mix in europe, but we had very adverse mix in north america. and it was a combination of the products that we were selling and the customers that we were selling them to. so, as an example, some of our back to school sales went through dollar stores. they weren't as profitable as we would have typically had for other customers. it's a new channel for us. we were doing a bit of experimentation that we didn't quite necessarily get right. also, wholesalers will typically sell a lot or carry a lot of inventory of products which tend to have high margins. so, when they take a lot of inventory out, it takes a lot of high margin products out.
and then additionally, acco became very scarce in north america. acco prices went up significantly, particularly spot prices. and although we forward-buy a certain amount of paper, we had to take a lot in the spot market. and prices went up more than 30% for paper. and additionally, as you know, tariffs came into the us too. so, there was a lot of cost issues. and the mix of what we sold skewed to a lower margin mix.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. you mentioned reduced placement of calendar products. did that factor into that mix at all that impacted gross margin?
neal fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. calendar products are typically high margin.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
yeah. okay. so, you implemented the price increase on october 1st. another one coming early next year. have the various cost headwinds you cited run ahead of expectations at all relative to what you talked about last quarter? so, are you having to implement larger price increases than expected? or have those been in line with your expectations?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
the cost increases are higher than we expected, kevin. commodities rose through the quarter, through the third quarter, throughout the quarter. so, that's higher than we expected. the field and transportation costs are higher than we expected. there're also higher inbound logistics right now that's much higher than expected due to accelerated shipments from china by all of the us to get ahead of the tariffs. and then also, we saw some incremental product costs. so, inflation, commodity inflation, and the impact of tariffs is higher than we expected. we were not given the lead time associated with customer notifications for pricing. we did not have all of those costs on the october 1 price increase. so, the january price increase is much higher than we planned on before to accommodate these higher costs in tariffs that we're seeing.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay. i wanted to make sure i heard correctly. you mentioned getting back to the 33% to 34% gross margin range in 2019. did you also say that you would expect modest sales growth in 2019?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i did say that, yes.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay. what do you think will be the drivers behind that growth?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we think that 2018 was a big reset year in the us for the wholesalers. so, we think the comps are gonna be easier in the us. we have the incremental sales from goba acquisition. and then we also have good momentum in emea and international which i also expect to continue. so, for all those reasons, i expect to have modest sales growth in 2019.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay. good. and then lastly, i know it's still early, but any initial insights on back to school season in brazil?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it looks really promising. so, it is still early. but just based on early shipments that we're seeing, we're continuing to perform really well. shipments are strong. so, we still have a few months to go, but i'm very, very pleased with the initial signs for our back to school in brazil.
kevin steinke -- barrington research -- analyst
okay. great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from brad thomas with keybanc capital. your line is now open.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital -- analyst
hey. good morning. i did wanna note the nice performance in international and emea but had a few questions on north america. thanks for all the color you already provided. boris, if we zoomed in on 3q and thought about that 9% sales decline, you obviously called out the two points from paper. but could you give us a better sense to the extent of how much might be transitory and inventory destocking versus the organic run rate in the united states?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think most of it, brad, is timing and transitory. if you look at our back to school performance with the end-user, we are winning with the consumer. pos was up 2% within users. so, the outbound performance was really good which is the basis for my saying that i think there's a bunch of timing things driven by inventory destocking, driven by timing when some of our big, mass accounts purchased inventory for back to school, q2 versus q3, some of it by our inability to replenish. so, i think longer-term, the business is in a good position. pos is strong.
our brands are doing well. we're definitely seeing a better performance with consumer and retail that we're seeing on the commercial side. the commercial channel is going through consolidation. so, i think that is going to cloud the picture over the next couple of quarters and create some uncertainty on the commercial side. but overall, i think the business is healthy. and it has to do with some of these transitory issues as opposed to some fundamental issues in the business.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital -- analyst
great. and then a question really, i think the entire united states is going through is this issue of pricing. and i'd just be curious with the magnitude of price increases that you're putting through, are you seeing -- or at what point do you get worried about demand elasticity? and how are you thinking about that?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
certainly, brad, that's a worry for us. it's a consideration with not just us, but most folks who are bringing products from china are raising prices. it has to have an impact on the demand. the types of price increases that we are planning for for early 2019 are pretty high. and i think, again, most folks not just in our industry but in other consumer products will have to do something similar just given the magnitude and the impact from 25% tariffs. so, it is a worry. i'm not an economist. i can't tell you what's going to happen. we'll have to wait and see. but it is a concern.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital -- analyst
and then as you think about your strong cash flow generation, how, if at all, does this change your willingness to do share repurchase as we move into 2019 and you get access to buying back more shares? and how, if at all, does it change your consideration for acquisitions?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
certainly, as we discussed before, it would raise the bar for the types of returns we'll be looking for for acquisitions. but strategic acquisitions. so, it will still be on the table and will be balanced, in our view, between share repurchases and debt reduction. obviously, we have dividends now. and if we see the right acquisitions, and if they provide alternative return versus alternatives including share repurchases, we would look at that as well.
brad thomas -- keybanc capital -- analyst
great. thank you so much, boris.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from hamed khorsand with bws financial. your line is now open.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
hi. good morning. so, first off, do you think some of this pushback in pricing that your increase in q4 is causing some customers to move away? is there competitive pressures in the market that you're facing?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hamed, we always face competitive pressures. i don't think what -- well, it certainly had no impact on q3, given that we haven't implemented the price increases in q3 yet. and i'm not seeing the q4 price increases or october 1 price increases have a competitive downside on us. i think we'll have to wait and see what happens in 2019. again, the price increases are gonna be bigger than the ones we implemented in q4. and i think we have to wait and see what the impact of that is going to be.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
okay. so, is there gonna be pushback from your customers because of the price increase? have you seen any?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hamed, there's always pushback from our customers. it's 100% of the time from 100% of our customers, there's pushback on price increases. but this is something we negotiate with them and implement every time, just like they do with the consumer. we saw our customers raise pricing throughout the year on the consumer as they saw commodities increase on them. they passed those through. so, this is just something that's just the nature of business and negotiations on pricing.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
and on the inventory balance, it seemed like there was a increase. is that raw materials? or is that finished products? and have you been able to secure enough paper?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's both. and we are buying ahead, given our experience this year with tight paper supply. we are committing earlier to secure paper for 2019 back to school. i don't think we've seen much of that yet on our balance sheet. but certainly, it will come in q4. and part of our guidance for a reduction in free cash flow was because we'll have to carry high inventory both because of the inflation and the step-up that we're seeing in inventory as well as bringing in earlier some of the raw material inventory for 2019 back to school.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
okay. and my last question is in europe, with some organic growth that you're seeing, how much more do you think you can capture as far as customer penetration with your products into europe?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hamed, we haven't seen any slowdown in the momentum. so, we think there's still room for growth, both in q4 as well as into 2019. we have slightly tougher comps in q4 in europe. so, i'm certainly not anticipating a 5% organic growth in q4 in europe. i think it's gonna be probably flattish to up and go low-single-digits. but the momentum in europe is strong. and i still think that we are in the early innings of getting incremental share from leveraging the esselte distribution for legacy acco products.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from joe gomes with noble capital. your line is now open.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
good morning. i'm just wondering if you can just remind us what are the bank covenant restrictions on doing more than $75 million in buyback. and would that be something you would try and go back to the bank and possibly renegotiate? or would they be willing to renegotiate that given what's occurred with your stock price here recently?
neal fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so, a couple of points. while all leveraged above 2.5 times, we have the restriction of $75 million on share repurchases as part of the bank agreement that we have. in terms of capital allocation, we like to have a balanced capital allocation. so, that consists of a certain level of debt reductions, certain level of dividends, certain level of share repurchases. and january the 1st isn't far away. and we have a whole new $75 million basket available on january the 1st. and so, from our perspective, it wouldn't be appropriate for us to go back and renegotiate the bank covenants. i'm sure we could. we just don't think it's the right thing to do.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, joe. given what's happening with inflation and interest rates, the priority for q4 will be to pay debt down. and as neal mentioned, regardless of what the covenants say, that's gonna be our priority.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
okay. and on the tariffs, i don't know -- if you could just again remind us, roughly 1% of your product line in north america is subject to these tariffs. and would it make sense or are you guys contemplating looking into the possibility of outsourcing from someplace other than china? i know i've talked to a number of other consumer type product companies that actually are looking at other places in asia in order to get around some of these tariffs.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure, joe. that's a good question. about 30% of our us cogs come from china. and right now, half of that is subject to tariffs. so, it's a meaningful number. we are absolutely looking to move our supply from china where we can. it's easier in certain types of products, such as paper products. and we already have a large supply from outside of china. but we're moving to move even more. some of the more complicated or metal products, when you have to move tooling, it's more difficult to do. but we're looking at that as well. it's just something of that magnitude will take a longer time. and it's much more expensive to move. but we're looking at all of those things, especially as time goes on and the likelihood of these tariffs becoming permanent rose, we'll certainly be looking at evaluating the lowest total cost of supply. and if it's not china, we'll be moving our products away from there.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
okay. and one last one for me. you talk about some reduced calendar placements. and i'm just wondering if you might be able to give a little more detail on that. seeing that, is you think just a one-time event? or is this something that you think is more extended?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we lost some share this year in some of the retail accounts with fashion calendars. we are trying very hard to win it back. and we hope it's a one-time thing. but calendars is a interesting product line in that there's one time a year where you can sell it in, and then you have to wait another 12 months before you can try it again. so, we saw some share loss this academic calendar year. and we'll certainly go after it for 2019.
joe gomes -- noble capital -- analyst
okay. thanks. appreciate it.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from william reuter with bank of america. your line is now open.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning. so, in between the last quarter and this quarter, there would have been a couple things which you couldn't have expected, such as some of the product shortages. i'm sure that you did expect that some of those early shipments that you received in the second quarter would have impacted this quarter. were there other things that changed -- maybe it's on the wholesaler side -- that you were not expecting? or was the majority of the sales decrease expected?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no. the majority of the sales decrease i would say was not expected. and let me tell you the things that we did not expect. we did not expect the wholesaler sales that we had in q3. we also did not expect that many of our retailers managed to lower in-stock positions at the end of this back to school season that did last year. so, typically, they would manage to, let's say, an 85% sell-through of the inventory that they have because they never wanna completely run out. this year, they managed to a 90% sell through. so, there was less replenishment orders from them than we would have expected. and then certainly, we did not expect to have the product shortages i mentioned that cost us a couple of points of share. so, all of those things taken together were the unexpected assets of the sales decline.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
that makes sense. and one of the challenges that has contributed to the increased cost of goods sold has been shipping shortages. do you anticipate, or have you had conversations that might allude to the fact that we could see a little bit more capacity next year to the extent that tariffs reduce the amount of international trade? have you heard anything about that?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
not yet. we're not in that stage yet. we're hoping you're right. and we're hoping some of the costs associated with tariffs will go down, some of those secondary costs associated with tariffs will go down. but we have not seen that yet, bill.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and then just lastly, in an earlier question, when you were asked about thoughts with regard to your free cash flow, you still mentioned m&a. given the disruption that we're in in terms of higher costs and price increases, etc., has it materially changed your view about how active you wanna be in m&a over the next couple years?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
bill, not really. and i'll tell you why. strategically, it's still important for us to reposition our business for growth away from some of the more mature and declining categories and toward some of the faster-growing geographies and faster-growing categories. that is an imperative. we have to do this. we've been very, very prudent in how we do m&a over the last few years. so, we never bite off more than we can chew. and we make sure that it's a right investment with right returns for our shareholders. so, as i mentioned, just given where we are and the uncertainty and the economic uncertainty, certainly, the bar will rise for some of these things. but we will still be looking to continue to reposition our company for growth. and m&a is a big part of it.
william reuter -- bank of america -- analyst
makes sense. i'll pass to others.

on the pricing increase, you guys put 3% on october 1st and then a larger one in january. is it possible for you to give us the aggregate of what the price increase might be flowing through in the first half of the year?
neal fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it should be high-single-digits on average. in some categories, it'll be even higher than that because most categories are more susceptible to tariffs.
hale holden -- barclays -- analyst
got it. and then the last question i had is on the wholesaler consolidation. it looks like one way or another we're gonna be near completion on whatever happens with those two companies in the next couple of weeks. so, something i would rebound to a normalized level for you probably in one to two quarters or into next summer for the next season. is that the expectation?
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. i expect that to be the case. i'm of the same mind you are. i think this is coming to a conclusion one way or the other. and we think the major effects of the consolidation on us are gonna be behind us as we enter 2019.
hale holden -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you very much, boris. i appreciate it.
operator
thank you. and with that, i'll turn it back over to mr. elisman for closing remarks.
boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer

boris elisman -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, jennifer. and good morning, everyone. our third quarter results demonstrated momentum in some areas and continued headwinds in others, reflecting diverging environments in the us versus the rest of the world. we saw accelerated growth and strong profitability in emea, good improvements and revenue trends and profit growth in international, and very mixed results in north america. i'll begin with the highlights. i'm very pleased with the strong performance in emea where our comparable sales increased 5% as we successfully expanded the distribution of legacy acco products with a broader customer base of former esselte from cross-selling. we had double-digit sales growth with rexel shredders, gadgets, and computer accessories both for the quarter and year-to-date. this was driven by the increased distribution as well as strong underlying demand in new product introductions. we also saw solid performance of leitz, esselte, and rapid branded products.
we are seeing better growth from our branded products in emea than from private label. in addition to executing on sales growth initiatives, the european team is doing an excellent job of driving profit improvement, capturing cost synergies related to the integration of the acco and esselte businesses. 20 months into the acquisition, we are on track to deliver at least $23 million of committed synergies on time and at a lower cost. emea gross and operating margins were up during the quarter due to higher sales, better product mix, acquisition synergies, and expense leverage. it was an excellent quarter in emea by most measures. and i'm very pleased with and appreciative of the work our team is doing there. we also posted improved results in our international segment driven by another good quarter in brazil, sequential improvements in the rest of international, and good contribution from our acquisition in mexico.
constant currency sales were up 9% and flat organically versus last year as growth in brazil and asia was offset by a sales decline in australia. i'm pleased with the growth momentum in asia and latin america. and even in australia where the industry has experienced a major customer consolidation over the past few months, the trend improved. operating margins were up in international due to improved distribution center efficiencies in australia and good overall expense management throughout. the fourth quarter is a big quarter for this segment due to the timing of back to school in the southern hemisphere. and we expect further organic sequential improvements in the sales growth driven by stronger demand for our branded products. in north america, the back to school season was good. sell-through to end consumers in measured channels and categories was up approximately 2% in the us and a bit higher in canada.
based on preliminary market tracking data, we gained two points of share overall in measured channels, driven by our five-star branded products. consumer sell-through was especially strong in major e-tail and mass merchants channels. however, overall sales in north america were down in the quarter due to declines with the us office wholesalers who are in the midst of ongoing industry consolidation. amid pending acquisitions, we saw much lower than expected purchases by both us wholesalers with our sales to them down 38% during the quarter. in addition, the uncertain environment led to independent dealers who primarily buy from the two wholesalers becoming more cautious with their investments, specifically in inventory. furthermore, our us sales were hurt by a tight supply of paper which challenged our ability to replenish retail reorders late in the season. we believe this cost us about two points of growth.
finally, some of our major retail customers managed their back to school season to end with lower inventory levels than they did last year. and we shipped more to them in q2 than in q3. as a result of all of these factors, our north american sales were down 9% in q3. on the cost side, we saw escalating inflation in north america with paper and fuel costs up double-digits from earlier in the year. in addition, we experienced higher us-specific inflation in transportation, steel, aluminum, and tariffs. based on our analysis, we expect product and tariff related inflation to approximate $50 million in the us for the year with around one-third of that impacting q3 and the remaining two-thirds impacting q4. to address this, we implemented a price increase in the us on october 1st which will partially offset incurred and expected inflation in tariffs.
we're notifying customers of another us price increase to be implemented in early 2019 which is expected to offset the remaining impact from anticipated inflation and known tariffs. in addition, we will reduce our us office headcount by around 4% over the next few months. this will yield incremental savings of around $5 million on annual basis. finally, we are accelerating our efforts to offer more differentiated and price-competitive products directly to independent dealers and end-users. these are being enabled by new product launches as well as changes to our channel programs and distribution center capabilities. while the quarterly sales decline in the us was larger than anticipated due to the customer consolidation developments in the quarter, the channel challenges for the us office superstores and wholesalers is a long-term trend that we've been managing and mitigating.
as a reminder, we have implemented several strategic initiatives over the last few years to address this and position acco brands to achieve accelerated growth. specifically, since 2016, we've made three international acquisitions to diversify our business, increase our exposure with faster-growing geographies and a broader, more diversified customer base. two years ago, 43% of our sales were outside of the us. now, 56% are outside the us. two years ago, the top five customers constituted 43% of our global sales. they are 31% year-to-date this year. and since 2017, no single customer has accounted for 10% or more of our sales. we've been investing in our products and brands and in driving growth through faster growing channels such as mass merchants and e-tail. in addition to the back to school gains that we've made as a result, we have also increased our overall consumer sales through e-tail channels to 13% of our us business.
on the cost side, we implemented a robust productivity improvement program which is delivering $20 to $30 million in savings annually. we've also been consolidating our us manufacturing and distribution footprint with the latest plant and distribution center closure announced just a few months ago being implemented as we speak. we will continue to profitably manage the channel consolidation in the us while driving margin improvement, cash generation, and high return on assets in the us business. at the same time, we will continue to drive revenue growth in international and emea, increasing market share, launching new products, and expanding distribution. i expect our actions to deliver modest sales growth, margin expansion, and profit and cash flow per share improvements in 2019. i also expect our 2019 gross margins to return to our target range of 33% to 34% with the expansion benefiting operating margins and free cash flow.
and we will continue to deploy our free cash flow for debt reduction, return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and strategic acquisitions. now, turning to our 2018 full-year guidance, given our results year-to-date and the anticipated sales, costs, and foreign exchange environments, we're lowering our 2018 full-year outlook. we now expect sales growth of 1% versus 3% previously, adjusted earnings per share of $1.15 to $1.20 versus $1.33 to $1.37 previously, and free cash flow of approximately $150 million versus $180 million previously. our guidance assumes that us commercial channel uncertainties will continue at least through the fourth quarter. and it assumes negative impact of foreign exchange on q4 sales in the range of minus 2% to minus 3%. now, i'll ask neal to give you a more detailed look at the quarter. neal?
neal fenwick -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, boris. and good morning, everyone. third quarter sales decreased 5% and comparable sales decreased 4%, primarily due to lower sales in the us. net income was $35.6 million or $0.34 per share, an increase of 21% over the $0.28 in the prior year, due primarily to lower charge and accretion from the goba acquisition in mexico. adjusted net income was $35.7 million, compared to $38.8 million last year. the decline was primarily driven by the lower gross profit in the us. adjusted eps was $0.34 in the quarter, compared to $0.35 in the prior year. our normalized tax rate for the quarter was 30% instead of the anticipated 28% due to a true-up of our revised expectations for the year. we now expect our full-year normalized rate to be 29%, due to less of our earnings coming from the us which has a lower tax rate. our gross profit was lower in the quarter due to the us business. overall, our reported and adjusted gross margin declined 180 basis points to 31.7%.
the details that i'm about to review are on page seven of our slide deck. product and customer mix accounted for 150 basis points of the decline. increased inflation drove a further 100 basis point reduction in gross margin year-over-year. cost savings and synergies improved gross margin by 80 basis points compared to the prior quarter. we expect to continue to offset higher costs in future quarters with price increases and cost reductions. but there is a lag before pricing can catch up to the rapidly rising costs. reported sg&a and adjusted sg&a were both down in dollars and in rate. as a percent to sales, reported sg&a declined 230 basis points, and adjusted sg&a declined 160 basis points. excluding charges, the year-over-year improvement was due to lower incentive compensation expense, as we released accruals based on our lower performance expectations for the year.
this drove 190 basis points of the improvement. we also saw the benefits of cost reductions and synergy savings blow through the sg&a line, a benefit of 80 basis points. these benefits more than offset the negative leverage effect of lower sales volume which is 110 basis points. all in, reported operating income increased modestly. but excluding charges, it declined 7% to $59.5 million. and adjusted operating income margin declined slightly by 30 basis points to 11.7%. the decline was due to the lower sales and gross profit. turning to an overview of our segment for the quarter. in north america, sales decreased 9%. this was primarily due to the us where we had lower sales to wholesalers, lower shipments due to the earlier timing of back to school compared to prior year and reduced placements of calendar products. i want to point out that last year, the two us wholesalers accounted for about 5% of our global sales.
and based on the declines we've seen this year, we expect them to account for only 3% of global sales in 2018, mainly from reduced inventory. in terms of the fourth quarter, we expect further year-over-year declines but a much lower rate than we saw in q3. north america reported and adjusted operating income and margin were both down in the quarter due to lower gross profit from adverse customer and product mix as well as inflation which included higher materials, transportation, and tariff costs. as boris noted, we expect to offset inflation with the october and early 2019 price increases. we have also taken actions to reduce our us cost structure during the fourth quarter. we are reducing headcount by 4% which will result in $5 million of savings, mostly in 2019. we will book an approximate $3 million charge in the fourth quarter for associated severance. but gross margin will be pressured in q4. in our emea segment, sales increased 2%.
but excluding the 3% hit from currency, sales increased 5%. the 5% increase was driven by expanded distribution of legacy acco products, esselte customer base, with strong growth in shredders and computer accessories. emea reported an adjusted operating income, and margin increase. adjusted operating income increased 51%, and margins expanded 380 basis points, primarily due to higher volume, favorable mix, and cost synergies. international sales decreased modestly, both on a reported and comparable basis, a much-improved trend from the first half of the year. foreign currency reduced sales by approximately 10%. but the goba acquisition increased sales by about 10%. boris already reviewed the drivers. growth in brazil and asia was offset by declines in australia. international reported an adjusted operating income. both grew, primarily due to low sg&a expense.
this was the result of productivity savings, improved effectiveness of our combined operations in australia, and due to contributions from the goba acquisition as well as lower incentive compensation and bad debt expense. turning now to our cash flow and balance sheet, we continue to generate strong operating cash flow, allowing us to consistently invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. third quarter free cash flow was $83 million. september marked the beginning of our seasonal cash inflow associated with the working capital cycle for the north american back to school season. due to lower profits and adverse foreign exchange impact, our year-to-date operating cash flow, and therefore, our free cash flow is $38 million lower than the prior year. approximately $10 million of the delta is due to fx translation. another $11 million of the delta is due to higher capex as well as the timing of restructuring spend.
during the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders, including $6 million in dividends, making $19 million in dividends for the nine months. during the quarter, we also returned $25 million to shareholders through share repurchases and, year-to-date, $75 million through share repurchases. year-to-date, we have repurchased six million shares. we are capped at $75 million of purchases this calendar year under our bank covenants. we will have a new basket available in 2019. we anticipate our typically seasonal strong fourth quarter cash flow which should bring our annual free cash flow to approximately $150 million. we are reducing our full-year free cash flow target by $30 million to $150 million due to a combination of lower than anticipated profit as well as increased inventory value driven by inflation. finally, some additional comments about foreign currency. currency was a $0.02 adverse impact in the quarter but flat year-to-date.
due to the current strength of the us dollar, fx is likely to be a $0.02 to $0.03 headwind in q4 based on current spot rates. for the year in total, the impact is expected to be slightly negative to revenue and eps. as usual, we have included several modeling assumptions in our slide deck. they can be found on page 11. with that, i'll conclude my remarks and move on to q&a where boris and i will be happy to take your questions. operator?
