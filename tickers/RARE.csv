i will now turn the call over to emil.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
good afternoon and thank you everyone for joining us on today's call. it's been a busy week, quarter and year for ultragenyx. this matches the fundamental part of my philosophy for the company, which is a relentless focus on execution. i'm proud of how productive the company has been throughout the year across all facets of our diverse business. regular [phonetic] team and development teams have got to new approvals in two weeks in june. commercial team and all the people supporting the products have rapidly and successfully launched those products to patients in need while still growing crysvita and xlh and improving our annual guidance despite the global impact of covid.
the clinical team are internally and jointly working with our partner, genetx, has delivered a series of positive updates on our gene therapy programs and now the angelman program and the business development team brought in a new gene therapy program for duchenne on top of the gene therapy technology partnership announced with daiichi sankyo in march. we've been firing on all cylinders and will provide updates on all of this progress on the call today.
starting with our commercial programs which provide a stable source of growth underpins the rest of our development. crysvita continues to perform strongly and is now bolstered by the additional tumor-induced osteomalacia indication. in the first quarter of launch, dojolvi is off to a strong start in its first quarter, which is encouraging. we received start-forms from a large number of prescribers for patients in our trials, but also those naive to dojolvi. this speaks to the unmet need for those living with lc-faod and to the strong relationships that we have with physicians and the major treatment centers.
moving to our strategic collaboration with solid biosciences. last week, we announced that we've been developing a new gene therapy for the treatment of duchenne muscular dystrophy or dmd. while there are other duchenne programs that are far more advanced, this was an unique opportunity to combine solid's technology with our technology and two like-minded companies to create a next-generation gene therapy for this disease. we will combine solid's best-in-class microdystrophin with its potential ability to enhance blood flow to working muscles with our novel capsid which has an excellent immune profile and is produced by high-quality 2000 liter hela cell -- producer cell manufacturing process. we believe this could be a differentiated therapy for duchenne that we will seek to achieve global accessibility. we look forward to collaborating with solid to bring a new treatment forward rapidly and we'll continue to update you on the progress coming out of the collaboration in the coming quarters.
moving to angelman. yesterday, we announced positive interim data from the ongoing phase 1/2 study of the investigational product gtx-102 in angelman syndrome, which is a part of the collaboration with genetx biotherapeutics. gtx-102 is the first antisense oligonucleotide program for angelman to reach the clinic and is based on the extraordinary science from dr. scott dindot supported by genetx. in our update, all five patients of the first patients treated in the study have shown substantial improvements in the clinical global impression scale or cgi tailored for some of the key domains of angelman with a mean change score of 2.4. the positive clinical effects were supported by other endpoints and remarkable reports of change is provided by the caregivers of patients treated with gtx-102. these include two patients going from being non-verbal their entire lives with difficulty communicating to now using multiple words, while others are beginning to use sign, gestures, and augmentative communication devices for the first time. some patients adopted independent capabilities such as using a fork to feed themselves for the first time. others are learning to swim on their own and other reports includes ability to follow commands, focus on tasks, respond by name and sleep through the night. not only were these changes profound, but they begin rapidly often after just a few weeks to a few months of treatment and in some patients after the lowest dose, in part is due to these reportedly unprecedented changes, all families didn't indicate desire to continue in the study.
turning to safety. all five patients at the highest doses had a serious adverse event or sae of lower extremity weakness with an elevation of protein in the csf and which have now completely resolved. we believe the sae is related to local inflammation in the region of intrathecal administration of gtx-102. this lower extremity weakness was not observed at the lower doses in the study where we also saw clinically meaningful responses. we believe the impact of gtx-102 is manageable with changes in dose administration strategy and so we expect to resume enrollment and dosing once we get an amendment filed and agreed to with the fda. we are very excited about what we are seeing as are the patients families who are hearing about these results for the first time yesterday. we plan to provide additional data on these patients at the fast summit in december and additional safety and efficacy data on the program in 2021.
looking at these two recent developments, both duchenne and angelman are very significant disease both in terms of unmet need and prevalence. they're aligned with our company's strategy of developing therapies for rare disease where there is a great -- greatest need and we'll leverage our various modalities and platform to create the best treatment options for patients.
now before i turn the call over to mardi, i'd like to start first by thanking shalini sharp for joining us on one last conference call, all the way from new zealand. shalini sharp has been with me from the early days of the company and has been a greatly valued friend, colleague and a superb cfo. she has been instrumental in building rare to where it is today and we could not be here without her contribution throughout the time, ups and downs in all the financings and all the work with many of you on the phone call. we certainly wish her the best going forward, but i just want her to know that her legacy and contribution to the company will remain with us at rare forever.
and with that, i will hand the call over to shalini.
shalini sharp -- executive vice president, finance
well, thank you so much, emil, and good afternoon to everybody. i am delighted to join you all for our last quarterly conference call. i'd like to take this opportunity to thank emil, the executive team, the finance team, the it team and the rest of the ultragenyx team for the extraordinary experience that i have had working here. i could not be more proud of this company, its mission to serve patients above all and its ability to effectively execute on its mission every day. i'd also like to thank you all, our analysts and our investors for your support of ultragenyx over these past years.
and with that, i'm very pleased to introduce you to our new cfo, mardi dier. you will be in excellent hands with mardi and i'll now turn the call over to her to walk you through the financials for the quarter.
mardi dier -- chief financial officer and executive vice president
well, thank you, shalini and i am very excited to be joining ultragenyx during its next stage of growth in helping patients with rare diseases. shalini has been a critical part of building a fantastic team, one that i know already will make this a very smooth transition. so, thank you, shalini. so, today we issued a press release that included a financial update, which i will briefly summarize.
total company revenue for the first nine months of 2020 totaled $179.5 million, representing a 163% growth over the same period in 2019. this includes revenue from crysvita and ultragenyx territories of $98.5 million and 91% growth over 2019 and combined revenue from mepsevii and dojolvi totaling $18.3 million or 78% increase compared to 2019. total revenue for the three months ending september 30th, 2020 was $81.5 million. for the quarter ended september 30th, 2020, crysvita revenue in the ultragenyx territory was $37.3 million. this included $34.1 million in collaboration revenue in the north america profit share territory and net product sales in other regions of $3.3 million.
total royalty revenue related to the sales of crysvita in the european territory was $3.3 million. mepsevii product revenue for the third quarter of 2020 was $4.1 million. we expect these revenues may modestly increase over-time, but we do not expect there to be significant growth. in the initial quarter after receiving us fda approval, worldwide revenue from dojolvi was $3.9 million. this includes named patient sales and us product sales. we also recognized $32.9 million of revenue related to the collaboration and license agreement with daiichi sankyo that was executed in march 2020. the majority of revenue from this agreement will be recognized as work is performed on the technology transfer to daiichi. it'll be recognized based on progress toward completion, not straight line and we expect the majority of this work to be completed by the end of 2021.
our total operating expenses were $131.8 million for the third quarter 2020 which includes research and development expenses of $87.3 million and sg&a expense of $42.1 million. we expect our r&d costs to continue increasing over-time as we advance additional product candidates from pre-clinical development into early and pivotal clinical studies. we also expect sg&a to modestly increase over the coming quarters as we support the expense of our existing commercial programs and the launch of dojolvi for lc-faod and crysvita for tio. we expect a split of r&d versus sg&a expense to remain fairly consistent.
in the third quarter of 2020, we reported a net loss of $68.8 million or $1.13 per share basic and diluted. this compares to a net loss of $113 million or $1.96 per share basic and diluted for the third quarter of 2019. the net loss for the third quarter of 2020 includes $11.5 million unrealized loss from the fair value adjustment on the investment in the arcturus equity. this also include $8.6 million in non-cash interest expense on the liability related to the sale of future royalties.
for the first nine months of 2020, net cash used in operations were $69.8 million compared to $273.3 million for the same period in 2019. we ended the third quarter 2020 with $765.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and available for sale investments.
i would now like to turn the call to erik, who will provide an update on our commercial performance for the quarter and an update on our guidance range for crysvita.
erik harris -- chief commercial officer and executive vice president
thank you, mardi. in the third quarter, crysvita continued to deliver meaningful revenue growth. the team also launched dojolvi for patients with long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders and crysvita for tumor-induced osteomalacia. our third product, mepsevii continues to provide a meaningful therapy to patients with mps 7, an ultra-rare diseases.
i would like to begin by providing an update on dojolvi launch which is going very well. dojolvi was approved in june by the usfda and was launched on july 22nd for the treatment of all forms of lc-faod or for molecularly confirmed diagnosis across the 2,500 to 3,000 pediatric and adult patients in the us. as of the end of the third quarter, we have received approximately 120 start-forms from approximately 60 unique prescribers. all 80 of the clinical trials and compassionate use patients have been converted to commercial therapy with many successfully navigating reimbursement. and approximately 30% of all start-forms are for patients who are naive to prior dojolvi therapy.
the team has made significant progress on the reimbursement front in the first few months after being approved. this has led to more than 60 patients on reimbursed commercial therapy. the payer mix is approximately 70% commercial and 30% government, compares with formal policies in place but most are approving dojolvi on an exception basis during a new-to-market coverage guidelines. we continue to work closely with commercial and government payers to ensure that dojolvi is accessible to all lc-faod patients as indicated by the broad fda label. dojolvi as a pharmacy benefit and it is importance in [technical issues] does take time as various payers establish their coverage policies. looking forward, we will continue leveraging our established commercial infrastructure along with the fewer than 10 incremental hires we added to support the dojolvi launch.
over-time, we expect revenue from the dojolvi in the us to gradually build as the launch gained even more traction. outside of the united states, dojolvi has been submitted for approval with anvisa in brazil and has been submitted to health canada after being granted priority review. the discussions with eu regulators are ongoing and with the us approval, patients in other european and latin american countries are now able to access to dojolvi through named-patient programs. these programs have been meaningful -- that have been a meaningful way for patients in france and italy to gain access to this important therapy. i would like to reiterate our commitment to broad access. during these regulatory discussions and review phases, request for named-patient access will continue to be supported in all relevant countries. we continue to expect named-patient sales to make up the bulk of dojolvi sales in 2020.
moving next to crysvita, which was approved last quarter by the fda for its second indication, the treatment of fgf23 related hypophosphatemia and tumor-induced osteomalacia or tio. we estimate there to be between 500 to 1,000 tio patients in the us with 50% having unresectable tumors. the launch for this indication has gone well as we have been able to successfully leverage our existing infrastructure and relationships with physicians to ensure the small patient population who is able to receive this important therapy.
now turning more broadly to crysvita for xlh. we have been able to maintain continuity of care for just about all patients on treatment. we continue to adapt to the covid situation by shifting more resources to digital initiatives along with virtual personal promotions and limited in-person meetings more recently. we are also starting to see increasing success with finding more patients, leading to growth in new start forms and reimburse patients.
in latin america, a strong patient community and kol support continued to drive the live awareness and demand for crysvita. in brazil, the region's largest market we are seeing a steadily growing number of injunctions that are being granted and funded by both the state and federal governments. similarly in colombia and argentina, the number of patients on reimbursed name patient treatment have increased. over-time, we expect latin america to provide a more meaningful contribution to revenue as the launch in this region progresses.
recall, at the beginning of the year, pre-covid, we established a range of $125 million to $140 million for crysvita revenues in ultragenyx territories. on our second quarter call, we maintained this range as we continued to evaluate the impact of the pandemic and our team's ability to execute. based on recent trends, we are raising the lower-end of our guidance to $130 million, bringing the revised range to $130 million to $140 million. while there is still some uncertainty related to covid as we enter the winter season and this long-term impact on crysvita revenue, we are confident the strategies and tactics we have put in place will allow us to close out the year within this range. at peak, we continue to believe crysvita has a potential to be a blockbuster as we move into a significant rare disease treatment for patients with xlh and tio around the world.
with that, i will turn the call over to camille, who will provide an update on the gene therapy clinical programs.
camille bedrosian -- chief medical officer and executive vice president
thank you, erik, and good afternoon everyone. emil provided the encouraging update on our angelman syndrome program and i will review progress with our other clinical stage programs.
starting with dtx301, our gene therapy program for the treatment of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency or otc. otc is a most common of urea cycle disorders caused by inability to detoxify ammonia into urea and patients with otc can experience metabolic crisis that could result in neurological complications, hospitalizations and coma. it also sometimes results in death. data from our ongoing phase 1/2 study demonstrate durable and clinically meaningful responses to dtx301. importantly, these improvements have continued after patients discontinued their previous alternative pathway medications and liberalize their diets. for dtx301, a fourth cohort of three patients at the 1 times 10th to the 13th genome copies per kilogram dose is ongoing using prophylactic steroids. we expect data by the end of 2020. we are also continuing phase 3 planning and discussions with the fda and plan to start the phase 3 study in 2021.
moving to dtx401 for glycogen storage disease type 1a. gsd1a is a life-threatening disease that requires patients to take corn starch every three to four hours to avoid severe hypoglycemia, long-term complications and potentially death. results from the phase 1/2 study so far show that dtx401 is changing the lives of these patients who are showing improved glucose metabolism with significant reduction in and less reliance on corn starch. prior to gene therapy, these levels of corn starch reduction would have put these patients at risk for death. safety has been acceptable to-date with any transaminase elevations managed by reactive steroids. in addition to following the first three cohorts for longer-term data, we also are enrolling a fourth cohort of three patients using our prophylactic steroid regimen at the same 6 times 10th to the 12th genome copies per kilogram dose level. this decision is based on the value of preventing standardized use of steroids rather than reactive monitoring and treatment present in the commercial setting. the timing of this cohort will not impact the initiation of the phase 3 study. we are moving forward with planning our phase 3 study for dtx401. following meetings with the fda and finalization of the study design, we plan to initiate this study in the first half of 2021.
with these updates, i will now turn the call back to emil. thank you very much.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
thank you camille. adding to erik's summary on our commercial programs, have been very strong through 2020 and we are in an unique position with this robust commercial business that has three product simultaneously in the growth phase of launch. on top of that, we have a gene therapy platform that has delivered positive clinical results in 2020 across three diseases, but also continues to be a source of new pipeline opportunities and new partnerships. next up, will be wilson disease gene therapy, which is a larger rare disease and will be the first program internally to leverage the scalability of our hela manufacturing platform that is vital for larger patient populations. and behind that, we have other large indications moving ahead. this includes the newly announced duchenne program, which is a competitive space, one that we believe we are uniquely able to bring forward.
and beyond the gene therapy space, we have the exciting angelman data from yesterday that supports that we have a potent molecule in that disease and we have a plan in place to work through the safety issue to advance this product forward for this large and severe disease. over the last couple of years, we've gone from a clinical stage biotech to a diversified commercial rare disease leader with a number of large opportunities ahead of us.
we will continue executing across all facets of our business with our dedicated employees across the globe and a strong balance sheet and growing revenue.
let's move on to your questions. operator, please provide the instructions for the q&a portion of the call.
",":
operator
yes, sir. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of yaron werber of cowen. your line is open.
brendan smith -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi guys, this is brendan on for yaron. thanks very much for taking the question and congrats again on the progress. just a couple of quick ones from us. i guess first on dmd, as you mentioned there are obviously a few players already in motion here and i totally understand it very early in the process. but can you just give us maybe a little bit of a sense of how you kind of plan to be differentiated in your approach maybe mechanistically or if it's really a matter of your capsid versus other ones out there.
and then just really quickly on the data from the gene therapy, prophylactic steroid cohorts. i know you mentioned we could potentially get data from the otc by year-end. i'm just kind of wondering about timing for the gsd1a patients. thanks very much.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
very good. when i look at the duchenne program, there are several aspects of differentiation. one is the nnos-binding microdystrophin from solid. the second is the capsid we view, which has very excellent immune profile. the third is ability to produce sys [phonetic] aav in a mammalian large-scale system, which we've been using now for two programs very successfully and produce a high quality aav. high quality many features, which are achievable with the producer cell line approach is more difficult to do with transaction approach. we think with those three areas, we are differentiated. combined that with skills both companies have in this space, i think we have an opportunity to do something special for duchenne patients and to bring program forward that can become accessible globally, not just in the us. so that's i think how i would answer that question.
on the prophylactic steroid timing, we are dosing patients in both groups. we will have some data on them this year, but neither program does a steroid cohort interfere with the initiation of phase 3. both programs were planned to have the prophylactic steroid approach built into the program, but it is helpful to us before we start phase 3 to have done some tracings and shown how it looks good. so the phase 3 planning continues for both and prophylactic steroid data, we'll provide some data this year on those patients.
brendan smith -- cowen and company -- analyst
all right, great. thanks very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from chris raymond of piper sandler. your question please.
christopher raymond -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks. also on the dmd program. emil, there is a hypothesis surrounding gene therapy in dmd where muscles are able to be transfused maybe as efficiently as they would normally because of the damage that's caused by actual disease. i guess -- i'm sure you've looked at this closely, is there a way to address that clinically or do you have any thoughts on that. and then also maybe sort of a question on just execution on the program you have specifically. can you remind us how long it takes to establish a hela producer cell line. thanks.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
sure. so on duchenne and really we're filled with lot of different muscle diseases. muscle, even without injury by the way is very difficult to deliver particulates of large molecules in general. they have very tight fenestrated capillaries, it's difficult with delivery of products, it's designed that way, so you don't create big swollen muscles when you exercise. it is designed to control fluid flow and that creates challenges while delivering. we are highly aware of the issue and we have ways that we're approaching on how to improve it. the issue being damaged or not, i think that the -- there is certainly another part of the story, but we are looking at ways to help improve that and i won't say any more of it at this point in time, but we're aware of the challenge and the challenge in muscle in general.
with regard to producer cell lines, using the automated approaches we have created at the company and processes that we've established generally we can identify a high quality stable clone within or usually about six months of time. that would be a clone that can survive growth at 2,000 liters and maintain stable incorporation and can produce high titers of aav vector. the process of the automation allows us to actually screen a large number of clones and help identify a stable and high producing clone. the combination of those approaches gives us the power than the creator, manufacturing platform has hyper-reproducibility, high quality and to do it in a way that's from a long-term commercial standpoint reproducible at the 2000 liter scale.
christopher raymond -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. thank you
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of maury raycroft of jefferies. your line is open.
maury raycroft -- jefferies llc -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my questions. for dojolvi, just wondering for the 30% naive patients, if you can talk more about those patients and their demographics, including age, and can you comment if the naive patients represent a bolus or more of a natural uptake of getting patients on treatment.
erik harris -- chief commercial officer and executive vice president
well, we haven't really described in detail with the exact ages of the patients. i think they are across the spectrum and there have been newborns, of course identified and put on drug as well. but in general, it is the spectrum of patients and obviously it's early launch and i don't think we can say if it's a bolus or steady yet because we just talking about a quarter of work, but we believe from the response we're getting from physicians out there and the number of prescribers, which is now already 60 has clearly brought interest in the product and we would expect this to continue seeing start forms generated exactly [technical issues] bolus that i think we will to have to watch and wait how it moves forward.
maury raycroft -- jefferies llc -- analyst
got it, ok. and then for angelman, i guess besides the natural history data out there, is there good existing efficacy data to contextualize what you're seeing in angelman based on the time points and the age range and along these lines, is it possible to reconcile or convert data on the cgi-i-as versus the more general cgi-i scale.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
well, certainly i can try to provide some help for you. when you look at natural history data in angelman patients, they generally gained some ground until i think around two or three years of age. and from there on, they're relatively flat and they don't really change much over-time, they're pretty flat. so the changes we're seeing are not something with same people, ages are non-verbal and by the way all deletion patients are non-verbal, they never become verbal and so to have patients becoming verbal and using words is highly unusual and regardless of what cgi or any other score you could make up, the fact that patients are talking, learning their names, responding to instructions and using other forms of communication are -- it is something unique and different and valuable in of itself because communication problems are the number one family reported need that affect them and their life with the patient.
with regard to cgi, the global score is involved, looking at all the domains and just creating a summation of the physician view but each domain has particular areas that they look at in making the score pre-cgi. it's not really that different from any other cgi, it's just that it is based on particular problems of patients with angelman have inside each domain. i would say to you in general, people do not see change in angelman on any score including cgi and there is some data on what the placebo effect might be in cgi. but i think the kind of magnitude, we're seeing which was a mean change score of 2.4 which means basically half way between much improved to very much improved is a very strong score that has passed anything possible with natural history by far and for families with the disease, absolutely unique and compelling. so we're comfortable with the potency and we'll put out more data at the december fast meeting on the details of information that support the cgi data.
maury raycroft -- jefferies llc -- analyst
got it. that's really helpful, thanks for taking my questions.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from gena wang of barclays. your question please.
gena huidong wang -- barclays capital, inc. -- analyst
thank you for taking my questions. first, i wanted to say to shalini, it has been great working with you for the past five to six years and my best wishes to your next journey. and mardi, we are looking forward to working with you.
and so i have two sets of questions. first one is the dojolvi. so is it fair to assume majority of the patients right now on drug is teen and adults, let's say 70% to 80% are teen and adult and also how many ex-us patients right now are on a named-patient access program. and my second question is in regarding the dmd gene therapy. and you mentioned that you could file r&d within one year. so what additional cooperation -- can you give additional color on all the capabilities reaching the need to do r&d, including such as cmc potency assay and also do you need fda inspection in order for you to start.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
thanks gena, that's quite a few questions. i don't know if you want to say anything shalini.
shalini sharp -- executive vice president, finance
okay. i will just thank you, gena, to you and your team and i really enjoyed working with you all as well.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
good. with dojolvi, thing to understand about dosing is that the patients in the first four or five years of life have increasing amount of drug usage. but once you get about five, six, seven, or eight years old, then it's a very flat curve and so patients from school age to adults are getting very similar amounts of drug, which we estimate is after adjustment for gross to net and compliance, around 130,000 a year. so what might matter is how many very young patients we have, but we're probably not going to be putting out that much delineation at this point in time.
i don't know if you want to add anything else erik, on this issue of patients on dojolvi.
erik harris -- chief commercial officer and executive vice president
nothing else there to that.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
all right. i think the other question you asked was how many patients were named-patient ex-us. yes, on the french-hu program [phonetic], it's a little less than 50 patients i think are on the faod in france. in italy, it's a handful of patients, but because of the approval in the us, we are able to respond to name patient requests in more countries now. so we expect that potentially to grow, although not dramatically. the us revenue is certainly going to grow we think significantly as we move forward in the launch.
last question was on ind for wilson. so far, the program has gotten -- dmd, did you say. i am sorry.
gena huidong wang -- barclays capital, inc. -- analyst
yeah. it is for both wilson and dmd.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
okay. well, for wilson -- we'll start with wilson. and i guess you are out of that. for wilson, we have completed making the drug substance at scale and it runs well in the hela platform and we made a lot of product and we're in the test release phase of that program and that requires a lot of analytical methods and so forth that's ongoing. there is some non-clinical work going and those pieces are coming together and we should be on track to hit two files at the end of the year, the ind and our expectation is as long as there is no more covid related shutdowns of labs or other things going on, then we should. if there are some problems with that, then we could find ourselves somewhat delayed, but overall, the process has gone well and we've been working and have clinical development plan put together for the program.
so on duchenne with the other program, it's at a beginning stage. we are in the process of making the production system, which is the hela producer cell line system more often can be testing a number of other factors in the design. so it will take some months to get through that process. then we have to just scale-up and so forth, which will take some time. we haven't said [indecipherable] timeframe but i wanted to be clear, it's certainly well more than a year for us to be able to get the manufacturing and non-clinical work put together, so it's not an immediate -- it's not an immediate event. we want to get it right. if we're coming in at this point after other parties already in the clinic, we want to come in and nail it with a very high quality system and quality production as well as a good strategy administration that will optimize the treatment effect.
gena huidong wang -- barclays capital, inc. -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of tazeen ahmad of bank of america. your line is open.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. emil, i just wanted to get your thoughts on where you are in reaching commercial supple scale for both dtx401 and dtx301 programs and more specifically, have you completed any necessary potency assays for the fda. and then i have a follow-up.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
yes. well, we've been dealing with potency assay across the program -- across all the programs and have an understanding with the agency how we're managing that for all the programs. they have been talking to us about this for a while. so it's not a new thing and i think it's pretty clear to them that in entering phase 3, they want to see a potency assay as part of each manufacturing process and on lot release and their point is they want to make absolutely sure that we're getting potent vector. we have a number of -- the guidance allows for a matrix of multiple assays with multiple, but they don't really want one that looks at the active protein story and we will have those in place for those programs.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. and then can you just give us a little bit more background on what led to the decision to add a prophylactic steroid cohort to the dtx401 program.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
well, it was actually -- the dtx401 plan was sort of there and it has been talked about as much. in cohort three, we use steroids a little earlier, we set the trigger for initiation of steroids a little bit earlier. it look like we got a better effect at controlling the -- any plan for a response from liver and the sense was that with the safety apparent of doing that we decided we would look at moving the steroids up even a little bit earlier on in the process and we think that we're just practically speaking become a lot easier in the commercial setting and would help us get ahead of any inflammation that might get going. so it's basically learnings from cohort three, but it was actually in the plan and with the data, the way it looks from our third cohort it seem prudent to do that as well. it doesn't affect us. we have soft product available and we could treat another three.
i will tell you the other benefit of course for having 12 patients here and 12 patients in the other program is that while the number of patients that we treat that are successfully treated certainly can help us with the long-term durability argument that they will be on treatment far ahead of the phase 3 program in that as you know is going to become an important piece at getting or moving forward in a filing approval process is to show that we have enough durability and so having a few extra is probably helpful in that. so we'll be exploring that we are already enrolling patients in it and i think it just adds to the story for how to treat in an efficient way when you're in the commercial setting.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of yigal nochomovitz of citi. your line is open.
samantha semenkow -- citigroup, inc. -- analyst
this is samantha on for yigal. thank you very much for taking our questions. just first on the crysvita guidance revision. is that incremental $5 million on the lower end related to the expectations for the tio launch or is that related to the increase and the identification of new xlh patients that you mentioned in your prepared remarks?
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
well, the guidance we put out in the beginning of the year did assume that tio would get approved launch. the guidance we put out was for all crysvita sales for the year. and so we've moved up the lower-end of the guidance, because our revenue is actually guiding into the higher part of the guidance. so that was simply tightening up the predictions for the street.
i don't know, erik, if you had any other thoughts on the guidance that you want to provide?
erik harris -- chief commercial officer and executive vice president
yeah. i would just say just to build on my remarks earlier, so far less than 1% of the existing patients have been impacted as a result of the covid pandemic. and while we are seeing growth rates that are trending back toward pre-covid levels there, but not there yet, but are trending in the right direction. i think that's as a result of the team is continuing to find innovative ways as [indecipherable] providers and patients to virtual meetings and in live meetings were allowed according to safety protocols and more offices are opening up and seeing more patients in clinic. so we are encouraged by the rebound that we're seeing.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
great. thanks, erik. so i don't -- and at the end, the bottom line not tio really the maintenance of the base off of covid has kept us in game and the launch has continued and to tighten up our focus and remove the bottom end of the guidance range. i think that's good news for the crysvita franchise.
samantha semenkow -- citigroup, inc. -- analyst
okay, great. thank you. and then just a follow-up on the dmd question. once you get this construct into the clinic, how quickly do you think you can advance into a pivotal trial. do you think you'll be able to use the safety data that you've generated for dtx401 and dtx301 to sort of advance it a little bit faster maybe some of your other gene therapy program?
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
well, i think we would be able to understand from those programs, the safety profile, but more importantly the dosing range of affect, but i think the truth is in duchenne the dosing is quite different. the safety will be quite different. so there's a little bit less than we can leverage upon. i think the manufacturing might be helpful particularly the hema program which is hela produced would give us some -- would provide us some advantage. so i don't think i would say it's -- let's say those programs alone, i think the biggest advantage would come through in understanding of likely dose range we need to achieve and being able to design and the biomarker endpoints involved as well as clinical endpoints and being able to design a seamless design trial, which would take us through the dosing phase as well as the randomized phase more rapidly, which is the approach we're going to take with wilson. and i think that type design, which has been promoted by cber and peter marks. i think, it is possible when you know enough about the disease to know the endpoints and the measures you want to make, then you can kind of predict the plan and just settle the dosing and move right into phase 3 without having a gap. that would be one of the ways we can shorten the timeline after we get to the clinic.
samantha semenkow -- citigroup, inc. -- analyst
okay, great. thanks for taking our questions.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of cory kasimov of jpmorgan. your question please.
cory kasimov -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. first of all, it's great to hear from shalini, so hope you're enjoying your time in new zealand. two questions from me as well. first on ux701 in wilson. can you just give some insight into how you're thinking about initial clinical studies and what the duration of follow-up might look like there.
and then my second question is just to follow up on dtx401 for gsdia. and with your comment that the new prophylactic steroid cohort that you're evaluating now won't impact the timing of phase 3, does that mean you would start phase 3 and amend the protocol if necessary just taking early look and build up a prophylactic steroid kind of regimen into that?
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
okay. so the first question is around ux701, which is the gene therapy for wilson disease. the clinical studies -- our plan in the clinical studies is to do a significantly larger study than we did in the others, but it will be three cohort groups that will be exploring dose and then with that dose information will essentially go straight into the phase 3 design and one seamless design. so we're getting -- we're going to seeking its approval on doing a single seamless design where you go through dosing and go right to the pivotal design. the reason that's possible is that the agreement on primary endpoint is on a biomarker based primary endpoint is doable, because of the history of approvals in duchenne and therefore we think we can setup and operate a program straight through in one shot, so that will help it.
the study length, look, i think the fda is very clear that they want to make sure there's sufficient durability in the program. the patients from the early dose cohorts would probably end up having close to a year or more time on drug than the phase 3 component patients, but we haven't fully nailed down what exactly the amount length of time is, but our expectation based on design, they have a 48-week blinded study, how much extension data we'll need to discuss with the agency at some point in time, but our plan is to have 48-week plan to study for the core efficacy and safety determination.
so with the dtx401 prophylactic steroid question, we're primarily looking to see that we can keep the inflammation down in the first few weeks and that effect is sufficient to allow us to get the good corn starch reductions. we only need a few weeks of data in order to know how steroids are working for us. so that's we're looking for. last time in the third cohort, what we did with steroids that were, as soon as they changed from baseline, which really meant it was only like a couple of weeks in from the treatment and so now we're to starting a little bit earlier. so it's really not that fundamentally different from where we are, it's just a little bit earlier and we'll have to see that, its safe and doesn't have any issues with the gsd1a patients and as long as that happens first week, we will know. our plan though is to submit the profile with the new proposed [phonetic] additions that way. if we had an issue in the [indecipherable], yes, we could then amend the protocol back away from that, but i doubt that we will and i think it's probably the best way forward.
cory kasimov -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
okay. thanks emil.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of salveen richter of goldman sachs. your question please.
salveen richter -- goldman sachs & co. -- analyst
good afternoon. shalini, it's been great working with you and enjoy the break and mardi congratulations on joining ultragenyx. emil, i was just wondering if you could update us with where you stand with regard to optimizing the hela platform to create this third generation process and how you intend to layer this hela manufacturing into your pipeline, particularly with wilson?
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
right. so the wilson program is produced with the hela we call 2.0 version of the process. however, we've already created hela 3.0 version from that version and we don't have at this point time or need to crossover to it, but we could at some point in time. but right now, we will head to the clinic with the 2.0 version, which is already very productive and certainly providing more than enough product. the hela 3.0 level of productivity improvements, which are some patented additional changes we're making, which were presented at the asgct. those change i think will particularly be valuable for the duchenne program because where you really need that much higher productivity therefore is a real big win for that. and with those changes, we can get the productivity up several fold even higher and reach levels that will really enable the ability at 2,000 liter scale to produce enough product to treat many patients for every run. so we're looking at hela 3.0 point is really coming into play there. the process though making that 3.0 version can be done with any existing hela producer cell line. we can actually take existing line and turn it into the 3.0 version. so we could certainly go back. we haven't done it for wilson with hela three other programs and do that as well. going forward, we look to see the hela 3.0 version as being the right version. but we're still finishing the development of that and the duchenne will give us a chance to optimize it for human use.
salveen richter -- goldman sachs & co. -- analyst
great. thank you.

thank you. our next question comes from laura chico of wedbush securities. please go ahead.
kenneth shields -- wedbush securities -- analyst
hi, this is ken shields on for laura chico. thanks for taking my question. so one for mardi. what created the opportunity and how should we think about capital allocation and financing strategy. and ultragenyx has benefited from recent transaction, so what should we anticipate as we are looking at?
mardi dier -- chief financial officer and executive vice president
yeah, great. great. thanks for the question and it is pretty easy decision to join ultragenyx and i think you heard a lot about it on the call. i think the team has guided the company in such a great way to get to this point, but they certainly plan for their next phase of growth and i'm pretty honored to be part of the team now and to help them achieve that.
in terms of capital allocation, i think the company has done a fantastic job, frankly to be here. if you look at our cash balance at the end of last year and the cash balance today, it's pretty darn close to the same number and particularly the last two deals that brought in capital non-equity dilutive in nature where the royalty pharma, royalty deal last december and then of course the daiichi deal, which we've talked about today together bringing in well over $500 million into the company. so that's fantastic. so the company is in a really strong cash position. we did announce, of course, the solid deal recently. but with that deal and sort of our base business going forward, we have cash that takes us into 2023, but i want to highlight that we're on a growth path. so we like deals that look like solid and i want to highlight the genetx purchase option as well for the angelman program, which we have the option to purchase that company for $125 million after some period of time after phase 2 data. so we're in great position, but we are very active as well and we look forward to the next steps.
kenneth shields -- wedbush securities -- analyst
thank you. and maybe just one more. so on angelman syndrome, how do you think about the competitive landscape and the potential for a crispr based therapy versus an aso strategy. i think there is a recent publication that came out and then might have your interim data. i was just wondering if you could opine on the potential for gene editing disease?
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
thank you. well, for angelman disease, fortunately for angelman patients, there is a lot of people working on strategies right now. and there are a lot of very interesting strategies out there. so they certainly all have potential. we picked aso by the way particularly because we felt it was more likely be superior than gene therapy or even a crispr type approach. the aso can just -- particularly in the areas it distributes well to the whole brain and induces the expression in a wide variety of neurons across the brain which we think is really important in this disease state whereas gene therapy now, even in the non-human primate or in humans is still getting a small fraction to neurons. so while that can work in something like sma, it may not work in disease that has very complex neuronal communications. i think, gene editing is going to be extremely challenging, the brain getting an adequate and an effective expression in the neurons to actually have the impact you desire. and keep in mind it's only the neurons that are imprinted, the other cells are not imprinted. so if you gene correct non-neuronal cells here that's actually may not be what you want to do. so while this is complicated, i would say having looked it all, our view is aso is with the best strategy, it turned on the paternal chromosome which was there, it allows that expression occur in a regulated fashion and it does it in a wide variety of neurons and i think that's still going to be hard to beat even so there are more asos out there than us, so with roche, biogen, [indecipherable] both very capable firms with a lot of expertise.
we picked the genetx program to get involved because we felt they had a superior understanding of the r&d regulation and the science which was we think superior and it's basically more evolved and understanding regarding how to knock-down the rna and their oligo i think is substantially more potent than others that were tried in the laboratory. so we're excited about that oligo and i actually think it's still going to be the best strategy and it will be hard to match i think with other strategies.

thank you. our next question comes from jeff hung of morgan stanley. please go ahead.
jeffrey hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks for taking the question and best wishes to shalini. just to clarify the guidance if i'm looking at this right, the midpoint of the range in size approximately flat sequential growth in the fourth quarter crysvita sales in ultragenyx territories. you mentioned outstanding uncertainty due to covid, so is that the main driver or is it conservatism. are there any other potential factors that we should be thinking about for the fourth quarter. thanks.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
well, i think there are probably a lot of factors like how about the widely discussed covid surge ongoing out there.
erik, do you want to touch on the question, which is really how the guidance relates to what's happening, what are the risks to the guidance, maybe going forward and what the changes were. is that about right, jeff?
jeffrey hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah.
erik harris -- chief commercial officer and executive vice president
yeah. we are encouraged by the rebound that we're seeing, but there is still a great deal of uncertainty as to when the market will fully open to pre-covid level. so it creates some challenges with forecasting as you think about as we move in, close out the year and move into 2021.
jeffrey hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
yes. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from joon lee of truist securities. your line is open.
joon lee -- truist securities -- analyst
hi, congrats on the strong quarter and thanks for taking my questions as well. our gtx-102 for angelman use ivig to treat some of the patients which implies igg response, yet you said on the call yesterday, i believe that igg [indecipherable] ratio were not altered, so can you tell us a little bit more about what the nature of the new response was.
and then second question is based on the mri, did we actually -- as you described, appear to be very localized. but my question is, what was the greatest extent of the spread of the information in the patients -- in any patient actually just trying to assess the potential to spread to other spinal cord levels maybe little bit more about functions. thank you.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
sure. so the use of ivig areas we've done more reactively as the patient's symptoms, that was not actually based on a known immunological situation that we've thought ivig would work. it was just looking parallel from other conditions not because there's any rational basis it was used. it is not clear the ivig steroids are actually having impact. in fact, we were just including them for completeness, but it does not indicate that there is an immunoglobulin based and we have no evidence for that at this point.
regard to localized [phonetic], we said lumbosacral but actually lumbosacral was the largest extent and that was in the smallest patients that's where it extended to the lumbar region. but in the bigger patients it was really almost in the sacral region only, so it was actually smaller. the biggest region was up to the lumbar and it did not include thoracic levels or higher levels. so we don't think it would spread, we think it appears to be region where the drug sits immediately after administration. without trendelenburg if a small patient it would fill up a little more than a big patient where it will only fill up the bottom part. so we think that the trendelenburg which hopefully tips the cup over and have all the stuff pour to top which is what we think would change things and we're adding a flush additional to csf after the dosing to help wash-out the drug from the lumbosacral region, which we think would both produce a local effect and help promote the movement. the thing once the drug moves north and flows, it will mix now with csf up in the spinal cord mix and dilute and when it reaches the cisterna magna there is almost of pumping mixing action that goes on with it. so if you sit there long enough, the drug should move farther up and mix more efficiently and not sit in any one place, so it's why we believe we can alter the distribution. it's not a new thing. trendelenburg and these actions are commonly used in other intrathecal drugs and i've been personally doing intrathecal therapy for 20 years, so it's there, i'm quite familiar with them. these are very simple things you can do to alter and this is why we're very confident we can manage this and it will not become an issue.
joon lee -- truist securities -- analyst
and just a follow-up question. but there are other aso therapies that led to some localized inflammation or reactions that will result with trendelenburg?
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
well, there are other aso therapies that clearly cause meningeal irritation and elevated csf protein, multiple ones in the clinic have shown that. so that's definitely true. so the trendelenburg can be used in any situation. i don't know, but i can't speak to the clinical judgment of other people what they do or don't do but trendelenburg is widely used in intrathecal therapies as a way to take the heavier drug solution and move it toward the brain where it needs to work.
joon lee -- truist securities -- analyst
all right. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from arlinda lee of canaccord. your question please.
arlinda lee -- canaccord genuity group inc. -- analyst
hi, thank you for taking my questions. maybe a quick one on dojolvi. can you provide an update on what's going on in the discussions with the regulatory agencies and then maybe more involved. on the hela efficiencies, you've mentioned that you're now in version 3.0. i'm wondering if you're looking to further enhance improvements there. and can you talk about how you think about the hela programs and your appetite for additional collaborations and additional indications you're interested in going into. thank you.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
thank you. so on dojolvi regulatory we have -- just to update, we have filed in canada under priority review, we filed in brazil in addition and for those are the two there in play. in europe, we're having discussions because we need to get a pediatric investigational plan and we're having ongoing discussions and no filing plan yet for europe. so that's where we are in the [indecipherable]. with the us approval though we can do named-patient sales in many places where the request come to us and we can fulfill those requests.
with regard to hela 3.0, the new version has some alterations which help generate more productivity in our really substantial and very important then, so the team led by sam wadsworth is of course continually looking on what's next and are continuing adding to the platform and building its value and i think these changes, the kind of things that happened in the early days of monoclonal antibodies that whoever controlled the creation of large-scale, cost efficient system for monoclonal antibodies started kind of owning the field and ending up partnering and gaining a lot of ground.
now we believe there are additional collaborations are possible whether for indications we would develop or ones for which we would provide the technology and an agreement as we did with daiichi sankyo. we are looking at those kind of arrangements, we would -- the deal with daiichi sankyo also involves a lot of tech transfer and a lot of effort, but on the spectrum we could do another deal as extensive as that or other deals in which the technologies license for particular indications and we're open to a variety of avenues and we've created the largest mammalian system and high quality system for avv manufacturers, coming to us to make it available and work with the companies and putting more products in play. duchenne story just became one that we could take advantage ourselves, it's an area of muscle that we're pretty knowledgeable about and for which solid as a partner was available to help bring their duchenne particular knowledge to the floor especially their microdystrophin. we certainly would look at other deals of a similar type where we would supply our technology and pick up another product where the unique scalable and large-scale production and high titre productivity of the hela platform, it could be a distinct advantage particularly then in high dose indications. so we are looking at those and sam will continually ask for investment in further versions of the platform, i guarantee it.
arlinda lee -- canaccord genuity group inc. -- analyst

operator
thank you. our next question comes from vincent chen of bernstein. your question please.
vincent chen -- sanford c. bernstein & company llc -- analyst
thank you so much for putting me in. i have a couple of a science questions on angelman and dmd. starting with angelman i was wondering if you could provide some more color on what you think the mechanism is for the potential inflammation seeing and what findings or observation support this hypothesis. is this something that you think it's likely to be come in effect come into simply rna dose intrathecally or bolus [indecipherable] or is it something that maybe related to certain rna molecules or certain rna modifications.
and then for dmd and the solid collaboration, i'd be curious what is your thinking around what causes the complement-related side effects that solid has seen previously. are these likely to be related to the use of a longer half-life vector like aav9 and do you think a program using your capsid would be potentially less susceptible.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
sure. so in the angelman story, the mechanism of the inflammation, we think is probably a very distinct from the mechanism of the action of the drug. all asos can have toxicity applied to cells in culture and [indecipherable] published in very elegant paper showing that -- showing how asos of various types combine certain proteins that lead to toxicity. this is the ideal aso with positive toxicity as a class is pretty well established in many different oligo, so it's not something very new. the issue of meningeal inflammation protein in csf is also widely observed. we don't think the mechanism has anything to do with mechanism of oligo and rna, it has really to do with a local cell toxicity relating to too much oligo present and being taken up. that is why we believe it is primarily an issue of getting the concentration and the contact time down locally. but we know and the data supports this is that we have looked at non-human primates and we know that in those non-primates without trendelenburg have done the same ways we're doing in human.
we do see very high concentrations in the local tissues. they hadn't been associated with a problem in non-human primate. the concentration of the brain are lower than what you see locally applied drug. but now in humans, that isn't a problem and so therefore we're having to take action, but it hadn't caused this problem in non-human primates. so we know the concentration is higher there. we know from in-vitro work with a number of laboratories that oligo at high concentration can cause localized toxicity. so we think it's a simple matter of just lowering the exposure level in the local and trying to reduce that inflammation. i think it's something that's completely manageable and not a fundamental type toxicity that's related to the actual drug action, it is related to a local toxicity of just too much drug in the locally applied space. so we feel that's something very differentiated from what the drug does and therefore very manageable and i feel confident we'll get it managed.
now with regard to duchenne, both pfizer and the pfizer program and solids program have had common activation -- appears to be antibody related common activation. this could be due to longer exposure time with aav9 which lasts longer. the sarepta program to the extent they've disclosed and this appears to have -- not have this particular problem. we know that aav8 related vector is clearly bit quicker and that may be a factor. we have an aav8 variant that is has a very good immune profile and which we think has a good potential of being an optimum product. we know it delivers to muscle and therefore we feel confident. it's a good choice from its immune profile standpoint, it's faster clearance from the circulation to be a good option to combine with the really best-in-class microdystrophin that solid has and for solid this gives them another way to win. they've got their current product it could do well and it could be fine and figure out the issues they've had. this also gives them another way to work with us and another upside potential for duchenne patients.
i like deals that get two winners put together, something that will create a common goal and combine the best technology there is out there and they've done that type of deal in the past and i think it was kind of deal that can work. duchenne is a very big indication, there is a lot of room here and i think there's a lot of room for doing better, and we think the platform we have in the dystrophin combined with some learnings and intelligent approach could provide a very good option for treating duchenne. we're behind everyone else but i think we can be -- we can be better.

2020-Q4,RARE,2021-02-11 17:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results and corporate update conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to your host, mr. joshua higa. sir, you may begin.
joshua higa -- director of investor relations and corporate communications
good afternoon, and welcome to the ultragenyx financial results and corporate update conference call for the fourth quarter and full-year 2020. we have issued a press release detailing our financial results, which you can find on our website at ultragenyx.com. i am joshua higa, director of investor relations, and joining me on this call today are emil kakkis, chief executive officer and president; camille bedrosian, chief medical officer; erik harris, chief commercial officer; and mardi dier, our chief financial officer.
i would like to remind investors that this call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, including but not limited to the types of statements identified as forward-looking in quarterly report on form 10-q that was filed on october 27, 2020, our annual report on form 10-k that will be filed soon and our subsequent periodic reports filed with the sec, which will all be available on our website in the investors section.
these forward-looking statements represent our views only as of the date of this call and involve substantial risks and uncertainties, including many that are beyond our control. please note that actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. for further description of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, as well as risks related to our business, please see our periodic reports filed with the sec.
i'll now turn the call over to emil.
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
good afternoon, and thank you everyone for joining us today. 2020 was a transformative year for ultragenyx as we executed on many of our strategic priorities. we now completed the fourth approval from our portfolio we had at ipo and over the last couple of years, it now refilled our portfolio with substantial opportunities in six clinical-stage programs, four of which are entering pivotal studies. we also have 14 preclinical programs and are advancing our first mrna program to the clinic this year. the efficient conversion of our pipeline to our next opportunities will allow us to accelerate our value creation and treat more rare disease patients with the first-ever specific treatment. from a commercial perspective, we achieved the upper end of crysvita revenue guidance despite a global pandemic and received two u.s. approvals and launched treatment for two more diseases with no other approved treatments.
from our clinical programs, we released important data updates from our gene therapy programs in gsd1a and otc deficiency, as well as the first glimpse of results for the antisense oligonucleotide gtx-102 in angelman syndrome. those initial arrangement results suggest promising activity in this relatively large rare disease with no approved therapies, but certainly much more to do to realize the potential. on the gene therapy side, we initiated one of the largest ever gene therapy licensing deals by providing nonexclusive rights to daiichi sankyo to utilize our manufacturing platform, including our hela producer selling technology. later in the year we partnered with solid biosciences in duchenne muscular dystrophy to pair their differentiated microdystrophin construct with our aav8 variance and our producted hela pcl system.
most recently we broke round and began construction on our gene therapy manufacturing facility in bedford, massachusetts, that will initially provide 30 manufacturing runs per year at the 2000-liter manufacturing scale. ultragenyx now has one of the broadest gene therapy franchises, which originated from our acquisition of dimension therapeutics in 2017. our portfolio now includes three in-house pivotal clinical stage programs, one additional clinical program partnered with bayer with two publicly disclosed in-house pre-clinical programs. our robust hela pcl manufacturing platforms enable us to make aav vectors at large scale, the highly efficient robust process that will enable the next generation of larger clinical programs.
but that was just the gene therapy side of the business. our development strategies to choose the right modalities for each disease and we have a variety of other therapeutic modes in our portfolio. for a genetic disease of bone, monoclonal antibodies can be the most effective way for affecting change in their biology. december, we added a new late-stage monoclonal antibody program by our collaboration with mereo biopharma. setrusumab or ux143 has completed a phase 2b study in adult patients with multiple tides of osteogenesis imperfecta or oi, which is one of the largest rare genetic bone diseases and significantly more common than xlh. camille will provide more detail on this program later, but i will note that oi and the ux143 program are perfect complement for our bone franchise and the expertise, we have built with crysvita. the learnings from our crysvita [phonetic] redevelopment program will be very helpful in the future development of ux143, and there is significant overlap between the physician to treat oi, xlh and tio.
importantly this collaboration provides us to commercialize the product throughout the world with the exception of europe, where we would see the royalty. while 2020 was a year full of unforeseen challenges, ultragenyx was able to make substantial progress executing our strategic plan across our pre-clinical, clinical and commercial programs with great success this past year.
i'll hand it over to erik provide more detail on our commercial performance for the year.
erik harris -- chief commercial officer and executive vice president
thank you, emil and good afternoon everyone. i'm truly proud of how the commercial team executed in 2020 in the face of never before seen challenges. 12 months ago, pre-covid, we issued guidance for crysvita revenue in our territories of $125 million to $140 million. despite the stay-at-home orders, many doctors' offices temporarily closing to non-essential in-person visits and all the uncertainty with global pandemic, we were able to finish the year at approximately $139 million, right at the top end of our guidance range. for 2021, we have issued guidance of $180 million to $190 million for crysvita revenue in ultragenyx territories. this represents between 30% and 37% year-over-year growth as we kind of the fourth year of crysvita's launch. this steady growth is enabled by the many digital strategies to educate physicians and finding xlh patients and getting these patients all crysvita while ensuring that existing patients, they are on crysvita during this pandemic.
we believe we will continue to see the mix of xlh patients on crysvita shift toward a greater portion of adult patients. this will be driven by our increasing efforts on finding adult patients by expanding our reach out to more endocrinologists, nephrologists and other specialties in the communities side. to support these efforts, we will expand both our commercial and medical field teams who will be focused on these harder to find adult xlh patients. in the middle of last year, we launched a tio indication for crysvita. the launch is going very well. we have converted the majority of clinical trial patients to reimburse drug and are receiving start forms for tio patients from the major metabolic bone centers.
reimbursement for tio is progressing well and is consistent with xlh reimbursement at the same stage of launch. we will not be providing specific patient numbers for tio as sales and that indication are included in our overall crysvita revenue guidance.
outside of the u.s., we are making steady progress in our discussions with health and reimbursement officials. demand remained strong across latin america, as we continue to see more and more patients being granted injunctions required to gain access to named-patient sales. the ordering patterns from the health authorities in this region tend to be inconsistent leading to some revenue lumpiness, which is consistent with other rare disease products in that region. we will keep you updated as we look forward to receiving full reimbursement in other ultragenyx territories.
moving now to dojolvi, which was also launched in the middle of last year for the treatment of long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders in the united states. at the end of december, we received approximately 190 completed start-forms from approximately 90 unique prescribers of dojolvi, which speaks to the breadth of interest, we are seeing for this product launch from the physician community. this led to approximately 130 patients on reimbursed commercial therapy, which also includes all 80 patients who participated in our clinical studies. we are also seeing strong support from payers. as of the end of january 2021, over 100 million lives in the u.s. have dojolvi coverage from over 40 policies, which includes some of the largest national payers. in these first quarters of the dojolvi launch, we will not be providing revenue guidance and believe the start-forms and prescriber metrics provide a better sense of the strength of the launch.
with that i will turn the call over to mardi to share the financial results.
mardi dier -- chief financial officer and executive vice president
thanks, erik. good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining today's call. we issued a press release earlier today that included a financial update, which i will briefly summarize. company revenue for the year ending december 31, 2020 totaled $271 million. crysvita revenue in ultragenyx territories was $138.9 million including $128.6 million from the north american profit share territory and net product sales of $10.4 million in other regions. total royalty revenue related to the sale of crysvita in the european territory was $14.5 million. mepsevii revenue for 2020 was $15.3 million. we expect these revenues may increase modestly over time. dojolvi revenue for the year was $13 million. this includes approximately 5 months of revenue after the u.s. launch of dojolvi toward the end of july ended -- and 12 months of named-patient sales in other regions.
2020 total revenue also included -- includes $89.2 million of non-cash revenue related to the tech transfer services provided to daiichi sankyo as part of our strategic manufacturing partnership around the hela pcl and hek293 technologies. our total operating expenses for the year were $601.1 million, which includes research and development expense of $412.1 million and sg&a expenses of $182.9 million. in 2021, we expect our r&d costs to increase as we support three pivotal gene therapy clinical studies, setrusumab phase 2, 3 clinical study in oi. ux053, our first mrna phase 1-2 clinical study and gsd 3 and a number of other ind enabling activities as we get ready to advance the next programs into the clinic.
we expect sg&a to modestly increase in 2021, as we continue to support the expansion and launches of crysvita, dojolvi and mepsevii. for the year ended december 31, 2020, net loss was $186.6 million or $3.07 per share. this compares to a net loss for the same period in 2019 of $402.7 million or $7.12 per share. net loss for the year ended december 31, 2020 includes $170.4 million increase in the fair value of investments in equity securities. net cash used in operations for the year was $132.2 million, compared to $345.4 million for the same period in 2019. we ended 2020 with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. this puts us in an excellent position to be able to support the execution of and achieve key milestones in our late-stage clinical pipeline and commercial expansion.
now i would like camille touch on some of our clinical programs.
camille l. bedrosian -- executive vice president, chief medical officer
thanks, mardi, and good afternoon, everyone. on january 8th, we issued a comprehensive press release, the detailed the latest data, regulatory progress, and phase 3 plans for our gene therapy programs. therefore, today, i will briefly summarize our current status and next steps for our three pivotal stage gene therapy program. dtx401 for glycogen storage disease type 1a has completed the scientific advice process with the european medicines agency, or ema, as well as held an end of phase 2 meeting with the fda. out of these meetings, we have aligned on the phase 3 study design and endpoints. we currently are on track to initiate this pivotal study in the first half of 2021.
shifting now to dtx301, for ornithine transcarbamylase, or otc, deficiency. we have received feedback from our initial scientific advice discussions with the ema and will have an end of phase 2 meeting with the fda, barring any unforeseen delays by the end of this quarter. based on the initial discussions, we feel confident about where we will end up with regards to the design and endpoints for this phase 3 study. we currently are on track to initiate this study in the second half of 2021.
moving now to ux701 for wilson disease, our third third pivotal gene therapy program to enter the clinic in 2021. earlier this year, we announced that the seamless single protocol phase 1, 2, 3 ind application has cleared fda review. the program also recently received fast track designation, which will enable additional dialog and feedback from the fda. this study currently is on track to initiate in the first half of 2021.
now i will touch on gtx-102, an antisense oligonucleotide which is being developed with our partner, genetx, for the treatment of angelman syndrome. angelman syndrome is a devastating neurogenetic disorder with a broad spectrum of disease manifestations, including speech and cognitive impairment, ataxia or balance issues, sleep dysfunction, and seizures. gtx-102 is the first antisense oligonucleotide program for angelman to reach the clinic.
late last year, we announced positive interim data from the ongoing phase 1, 2 study of gtx-102. all five patients who were treated demonstrated improvements in at least three disease domains and scores of much improved or very much improved, and two disease domains as measured by the clinical global impression of improvement scale for angelman syndrome. these improvements were also supported by other increases and measures, including observer reported communication ability, or orca, and daily for communication scale, as well as by preliminary eeg reading. all five patients also had a grade 1 or 2 serious adverse event of lower extremity weakness associated with local inflammation in the region of administration in the lower back at the higher doses of gtx-102.
dosing was paused after the first sae onset was observed and the study is currently on clinical hold. the sae has fully resolved in all five patients and clinical improvements have been sustained beyond the resolution of the sae. genetx, our partner, has submitted to the fda, a substantial information amendment including follow up safety information for the five patients dosed and non-clinical data in non-human primates. we have proposed an amended dosing and administration plan to the fda. these changes are expected to reduce the local contact time and concentration of the aso.
furthermore, the new dosing plan is within the observed range of the clinical activity, but well below doses associated with sae's. genetx received some questions from the fda and responses were provided. we currently expect the study to resume enrollment and dosing in the first half of 2021 following resolution of fda requests and approval to proceed. once we started, we expect additional interim data from this study that are expected in the second half of 2021. we are also in the process of expanding the study to other countries, including canada, where clinical trial application was previously filed, a protocol and information amendment similar to that proposed to fda will be submitted.
our first pivotal program to enter the clinic in 2021 will be the ux143, or setrusumab, a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta or oi through our partnership with mereo. oi is an extremely serious bone disease where defect in collagen result in significant bone fragility leading to stiffness, pain, factors, and deformities. oftentimes oi is believed to be a result of weak collagen, but based on our sponsor preclinical work and others research, we now understand that the major cause of bone weakness in oi is due to excess bone resorption triggered by the abnormal collagen and the inadequate production of new bone leading to low bone mass. these data show that if you could simply increase bone formation and reduce the excessive bone resorption, you kind of increase bone density and improve bone strength, even with the abnormal collagen and achieve improved fracture prevention.
we believe this is the insight that could change the future for patients with oi. mereo has released phase 2 data in 90 adult patients with oi, randomized among three different dose levels. the patients were dosed monthly for 12 months. study results indicated substantial improvements in bone mineral density in uptight oi type 1, 3, and 4, the three types included in this study. this response was dose-dependent and observed across different anatomical sites. the study also showed an ability to create a significant amount of bone, which we believe is a very important factor in improving bone strength. the safety profile for setrusumab is favorable for patients with oi.
pending discussions with regulatory agencies, we are planning to enroll the phase 2, 3 study in pediatric patients. the first will identify the optimal dose based on increases in the serum bone formation markers p1np and enroll into a randomized control period, looking at fracture rate reduction and bone mineral density over an estimated 15 to 24 months. while a separate pivotal study also is being planned for adults with oi, we believe the pediatric population will give us the fastest avenue for approval for the product. we currently expect to initiate the pediatric phase 2, 3 in the second half of 2021.
the last program, i will briefly summarize is ux053 for glycogen storage disease type 3, or gsd3. gsd3 is an inborn era of metabolism caused by mutations in the aglg, which is responsible for the production of the glycogen debrancher enzyme. a deficiency of the debrancher enzyme impairs the breakdown of glycogen in the liver and leads to a toxic residual carbohydrate. to our license from arcturus, we have developed an mrna with n -- with a nanoparticle product that is intended to restore the debrancher enzyme function thereby clearing the accumulated toxic residual carbohydrate and normalizing glycogen metabolism in the liver. we are currently on track for an ind in the first half of 2021 and to initiate a phase 1, 2 study in the second half of the year.
i will now turn the call back to emil, to wrap up.
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, camille, mardi, and erik. 2021 is going to be a full year of lots of important progress across our commercial and clinical programs. the active work and bd has refilled the pipeline with multiple late-stage catalysts with one of the best rare disease portfolios in the business. in the commercial portfolio, we're looking forward to continue expanding crysvita in the adult market through greater efforts to find patients and outline clinics and through pedigree analysis. we are also continuing to expand crysvita use outside the us, latin america, canada, and turkey. we drove this off to a strong start and i know the team will continue to execute launch for patients with lc-faod. we are in great and urgent need for a new treatment option. our commercial mepsevii [phonetic] have adapted well -- very well, the launching three products in four disease in the covid environment. within our gene therapy business, we've broken ground on the manufacturing facility embedded for massachusetts and three programs going at least late stage clinical trials. we continue to advance our early stage work in new muscular disease a cdkl5 deficiency and duchenne muscular dystrophy. we are also continuing to improve on the hela manufacturing technology with the new 3.0 system that will have even higher productivity and reduce cogs making gene therapy a viable modality for these larger higher dose indications on a global basis.
our nucleic acid therapeutics pipeline will also advance. we're making progress in reviewing the aso phase 1/2 study in angelman. we plan to initiate clinical development for the mrna ux053 and glycogen storage disease type iii or debrancher deficiency. with our first mrna probing to come out of our license, arcturus and that license also provides rights for up to 12 mrna and other nucleic acid therapy targets.
the gsd3 program is also a great complement to our efforts in gsd1a and builds on our broader portfolio therapies aimed at inborne areas of metabolism that have not been treated by more traditional means. the addition of setrusumab gives us a de-risk wastage from the leverage expertise in creating clinical pathway for rare genetic bone diseases. as you can see we're in a great moment in our evolution to the company with multiple late-stage assets across therapeutic areas, modalities all enabled by continued strong financial performance from our proved programs, strategic investing in fiscal diligence. now let's move on to your questions. operator, please provide instructions for the q&a portion of the call.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of maury raycroft from jefferies. your line is open.
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
hello, maury. hey there, maury. well, it's a very good question. we are doing great and thank you for asking. maury, may be you are on mute. operator can we go onto the next caller until maury gets his vacation fixed?
operator
yes, sir. your next question comes from the line of yaron werber from cowen. your line is open.
yaron werber -- cowen -- analyst
hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. so, emil, i got maybe the first question, the pipeline is now -- looks really good. i mean you've essentially two drugs going into pivotal, another one potentially into a phase 2/3, i mean it's fairly full. do you have more room for bd, are you still looking or you are sort of good for the next year? and then, mardi. i don't know if you can give us any sense how do we model daichii related revenues? do you have visibility that you could share with us? thank you.
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
great, yaron. i think if you look at our portfolio, we tend of target having 5 to 7 clinical stage programs and right now we would have six with what we're dealing. so we're on a relatively full state in terms of development stage programs. we are still continuing to be because you always continue to look if there were something amazing, we wouldn't want to walk past it, we would look for that opportunity, but we are potentially have ability to leverage our commercial organization with later stage opportunity, but i do believe them from earlier development stage opportunities, we're very full. we've been on and off and we've got a lot of work to do, and i'm excited about the portfolio. i don't think we can imagine being in a better place than what we've been able to put together over the last couple of years. so mardi, maybe you can answer the other question.
mardi dier -- chief financial officer and executive vice president
yeah, real simply yaron with daiichi, of course, the deal that we completed back in march was for a $200 million upfront. from an accounting purpose, we have this non-cash revenue recognition that we believe is associated with the tech transfer of the deal. so there is about $60 million plus left on that recognition of revenue and that should be complete in 2021, so that should be a pretty specific way to model it in 2021.
yaron werber -- cowen -- analyst
great, thank you.
mardi dier -- chief financial officer and executive vice president
yeah.
operator
your next question comes from the line of gena wang from barclays. your line is open.
gena wang -- barclays -- analyst
thank you for taking my questions. i have two questions, one is regarding the angelman syndrome. it seems that fda already gave you feedback and emil, just wondering if you can give a little bit more color regarding the amendment to the protocol. if there any additional change versus your original submission regarding the protocol amendment? and my second question is regarding the dosing change you use ddpcr for the gsd-y pivotal study and change the dose from 6e12 to 1e13 and just wondering do you need to do similar change for the otc program? and will you use ddpcr across all the future program, so that the dosing will be more accurate going forward?
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
sure. great. so on the angelman, we gave in this very large substantial amendment. they provided then a response to some specific questions. additional information inquiry that they were interested in. they -- those questions did not change the plan we had proposed. we listened to what they put together and provided now -- an amendment to the protocol and irb, etc. and all the things required in order to proceed ahead. so we'll wait and see their response to that. but the questions didn't really change our plan. they were basically in line. i think we -- our plan is pretty well thought out. i don't think that there is -- i think there is not much we can do to change, but we'll wait and see for their feedback and there may be subtle ways to manage it and they will want to assure safety, just like we do and we're happy to work with them to get that done, but we feel comfortable, we're going to get back into the treating these patients and the patients have been inquiring they really want to get back to treatment. so we want to get back to it, i think we're in good shape for that and we'll see what they say.
on the gsd1 story, we're not really changing the dose, what we're doing is changing how we're measuring the dose. so what -- it's really important that total doses that we're giving the same as it was before. it's just what we're calling it has changed and what's happened is that the original qpcr methods have some limitations and variability in them. they're not as good and we've been working on the digital drop method, which is high more reproducible, more validatable and therefore a more accurate representation. what it turned out for gsd1a is that, we were really -- the amount of vector we're giving which we considered 6e12 before was actually closer to e13 when you use a more accurate digital drop method and it just relates to the techniques and the basis of certain techniques.
for the otc program, there is also a difference and we are using the digital drop, but would it be clear to the everyone is that the dose is the same as it was, it's just what we're labeling the dose as based on a more accurate method and this is one of the things, even fda has been on and we all want is to continue to improve the quality of the methods, to give us accurate representation of how many of these particles are alive and well in its vector product that we can use for gene therapy.
so practically speaking, it doesn't change anything, but from a standpoint of the quality of the process, it helps give fda and ourselves confidence of what we're administering in every lot.
gena wang -- barclays -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of cory kasimov from jp morgan. your line is open.
cory kasimov -- jp morgan -- analyst
hey, good afternoon guys. thanks for taking the questions. first one on angelman, assuming you do in fact get that study up and running in the first half of the year as you're expecting, how quickly do you think you'll know whether the amended dosing and administration plan is working and avoid any assays you saw originally? and then i have one follow-up on the wilson's.
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
well, the way the protocol is proposed, we will redose the existing patients -- five patients and will also enroll another 12 patients in the staged manner and look at basically four doses and then we'll go into a maintenance every three months. so by the time we get to four months of dosing with these patients in the -- both the five and the additional 12 that will give us a sense of are we getting the efficacy we thought after accumulating the effect over multiple doses at a lower level and are we seeing safety. so, we'd expect to get to that story later in the year because it takes about four months for each patient enrolled to get through the dosing. so we can get through four doses and show the same substantial efficacy we saw before and not have the safety event that helps improve it. once they go on to maintenance where they are going every three month dosing. i think we feel more comfortable that the safety will be better. the problem we had was only during the monthly phase. so if we can get through the monthly phase, go onto maintenance dosing and we're good through the monthly phase, and get the efficacy, we're hoping for them, i think we'll know and that should happen later this year.
cory kasimov -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay, that's very helpful. and then for your seamless phase 1, 2, 3 for wilson's, what's the process in terms of making go-no-go decisions here to move to the next stage in this particular type of design? is it -- should we think of it as a truncated study across all three typical phases or is there something else that goes into it?
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
well, the two stages. in stage one, we're going to dose of placebo and drug in three cohorts, a first dose cohort 5e12, e13, 2e13. all right. so it's going to be a sequence of patients through three cohorts. during this period, there will be an interim assessment -- a blinded interim assessment to show whether that -- what the dose is looking like and what's happening, and we'll make a decision on dose after those three cohorts. at that point we would know in a blinded fashion in group that we are seeing an efficacy when safety is as appropriate and we'll pick the dose to move forward. so we'd expect somewhere in there to have some data that we would put out that would not -- but we want to make sure not to harm the conduct of the study, but we'll put out some information about where we stand and that we have crossed from dosing stage into the pivotal stage. is that helpful?
cory kasimov -- jp morgan -- analyst
yes, definitely. thanks, emil. i appreciate it.
operator
your next question comes from the line of joon lee from truist securities. you may ask your question.
joon lee -- truist securities -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my questions. so, emil, can you affirm that the fda was generally in agreement that trendelenburg and lower dosing will be sufficient to avoid the saes, or do they want something entirely different? and then secondly, what if any rethrough is there from the failure of ov101 and angelman is placebo effect possibly an issue when using cgi-i-as, just curious if there is anything that could be learned from that study to apply to your story? thank you.
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
sure. well, the fda did not question trendelenburg and plus the procedures because actually they had been used widely and i think we provided the justification for that. it has been done by the way in chemotherapy for years, years, now if we've made this up, it's been well established to reduce local toxicity in chemotherapy drug. so it's not like we're something never been done before. so it wasn't really question about that. it was more about what the event is and what's going on, kind of thing. they just want confidence around that we can make the right interpretation of what's happening and our interpretation of it being a local inflammatory event and those required, those just more detailed information about the mris and other things so they can kind of understand what we understand. so there was no question about the strategy on lower dosing capping and the other changes at this point. so we feel pretty good about where we're at. i do think we're making the right choices and i think there's good base for our changes to be beneficial.
now with regard to ov101, i don't think it has too much read-through it. if it was of course an approved product during our phase 3, it would probably create more complexity for how we're managing patients on it or not on it. with regard to cgi and its value, i appreciate the fact that our five patients were open-label. the magnitude effect that we are seeing is not 0.7 points, meanwhile the average for the five patients was 2.4. so, the degree of efficacy changes far larger than you might see from placebo if that was placebo effect. so in addition to that, there were multiple other evaluations in the trial that supported the communication changes and the other changes observed, including sleep and other things including mobility. so it wasn't just cgi that was actually a whole host of secondary valuations also supporting the change.
so that's why we know this is real and we know it's profound and we were where we think it's something could be quite important for these patients. we know by the way that with the time is passing, of course the patients have the effect lasted maybe four, five months in many of these symptoms, but as time has passed, of course patients have lost some ground and are anxious to get started again. so in our case, i'm 100% confident, this is not placebo effect, we have too much data to support it and of course the magnitude effects just beyond what you would assume to be part of a placebo effect.
joon lee -- truist securities -- analyst
and just quickly, following up on the angelman's. you have not created a target for yourself. there are companies pursuing the exact same approach stop to start. what kind of note do you have around your product that could protect the franchise front well, better?
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think you've got a target to make the first thing you got to run fast. so they're hard to hit. but that's sort of position, but truthful to i think our ability to execute its going to be real important. the truth is, if you want to -- as a company, we will work on some larger rare disease areas. but when we do, it's not to be all alone like some other ones, like otc, gsd1, gsd3. it's more comfortable, we really pretty much the only clinical play. it will be there. but here's the thing about the whole program. the reason we picked this angelman program, the work we have done, is that we have the data that we were looking at that they produce in vitro and others, all the work has gone day-to-day, which said what they're doing in the region they're targeting is far more prudent and able to knock down all the antisense transcripts than what other people are doing, is we felt there was a distinct intellectual property scientific insight improvement.
the other method is trying to do what we're doing is actually very hard. i do think the aso method will be better and the gene therapy will be hard to replicate, because you cannot deliver every neuron evenly and you can't have variations of expression of this thing, they are too high. so it's going to be a lot trickier to deal with this on a gene therapy basis then an aso basis. because with the aso, we enable the gene to be expressed, but we don't force it to be expressed. that allows an endogenous regulatory mechanism to even out the amount of this ube3a protein. so maybe a little bit scientific detail, what i'm saying to you there is a very strong basis for why this, as it can allow you to get more neurons active and allow them to be regulated properly and i think that's why we believe the aso was the best method among those and among those aso methods, we have the best-targeted region and that's our confidence in what we're doing. same time we're going to run fast.
joon lee -- truist securities -- analyst
yeah. thank you. your next question comes from the line of yigal nochomovitz from citigroup. your line is open.
yigal nochomovitz -- citi -- analyst
hi, erik. hi, emil, and team. thank you for taking the questions. so, could you provide a bit of perspective on ultragenyx strategy to differentiate setrusumab profile from romosozumab, given as you know, both antibodies target sclerostin and in light of the fact that amgen is also pursuing osteogenesis imperfecta with romo in a phase 1 that was recently posted on clinical trials? and then secondarily, if you could comment on the advantages of targeting sclerostin as opposed to rancho [phonetic] or tgf-beta for osteogenesis imperfecta given as you know the amgen is pursuing oi phase 3 and oi with prolia and sanofi is pursuing with oi with fresolimumab in phase 1? thanks.
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
good, thank you. it sounds like another variation of target on our back questions, but -- so look, we are very familiar with romo and in fact, michael minsky that worked through us, worked for amgen for 10 years on romo and has a lot of knowledge. it's a good anti-sclerostin antibodies, main commercial potential for amgen has been around osteoporosis. as part of their development program, there are required to do a pediatric investigational plan for europe, which requires them to run the study. so if they are running a study, what they will do with that in the long run, it's unclear, but the idea that the tip is just they have to try to test their product in that population, but they're not focused on that population. we are going to look at the dosing and dose regimen uniquely to apply to oi, and we think the dosing may need to be higher and that's in pediatrics, and they're doing therapy for one year, whereas i think we will need to do more chronic or have at least induction in the main -- mean phase, which is not part of their program. so our folks in oi will allow us to depth dosing and regimen to optimize for the oi indication. that said, could people use romo off-label and will we have to deal with that commercially, and i say yes, we will. we still have to deal with it, but oi has a lot of patients and a lot of different types that can be benefited and we think somewhere in there with the dosing and other issues that there is a very important product that we could achieve regardless of what the pricing issues play out.
the second point you asked about is that the other competing molecules. i think sclerostin has some unique features that are particularly good. if you look at oi, the patients have too much resorption, but they also have inadequate bone anabolism [phonetic]. so you definitely want a strong anabolic agent and we think sclerostin appears to be a very strong anabolic agent and in the animal models that why it's very potent and inducing good bone formation that results in strong bones that persist fracture. so we think that the focus on anabolism with some effect on resorption, i think is probably valuable, especially in the context with bisphosphonate. certainly tgf-beta is sanofi is working on is another strategy, its another hormone involved in bone regulation. i don't have a lot to say right now. it could be a factor we'll have to keep our eye on what they're doing, rank logan [phonetic] or bases the denosumab is what i assume you're talking about. it's another approach, but it's a little different, it's related more to the absorption. i just think -- we think based on what we're seeing as sclerostin is best and i will also say that sclerostin maybe the first step and maybe there were need ultimately as a second generation version to add another molecule like a combination to optimize but given the size of oi and our particular expertise in running bone development, i have confidence we can push forward a good product that will make a real big difference for oi patients.

liisa bayko -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi there, thanks for taking my question. for dtx401 for gsd1a, are you going to be enrolling patients in phase 3 from all the different kind of mutation types and should we expect similar efficacy across those? thanks.
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
so we are not restricting to a particular mutation. but remember in gsd1a about 80% of the patients are null. so it's probably is homogeneous, a phenotype null expression as you can get. and so we feel pretty comfortable that even if there is some minor -- let's say lesser mutation, patients with less effect, less deficiency that we would expect the effect to be as good or better because if we -- most of patient we have been treating being all null. so if we can treat the nulls effectively, then treating the nuance one should be easier, not harder, right. so we feel pretty confident we can treat -- we can treat all based on how many nulls we've already treated.
liisa bayko -- evercore isi -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of jeffrey hung from morgan stanley. you may ask your question.
jeffrey hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions. for ux701, you went through the plans for the single protocol phase 1/2/3. so going forward, do you see this as a standard way you'll be conducting studies for other gene therapies or was there something specific to this program that allowed sort of single protocol study design?
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
there are some factors that make single protocol designs possible, and one of the key ones, jeff is endpoints like primary endpoint and the wilson case because there's always approved products, we know and the fda has already agreed that urinary copper excretion can't -- 24-hour urinary copper excretion can be the primary endpoint. with the primary endpoint defined, then you can design entire program straight through. if you don't have a primary endpoint defined, it's a little in hard to try to find the phase 1/2/3 without having analyzed and configured the right inclusion criteria for the next stage, if that makes sense. so, it really has to do with what were your level of confidence in the endpoints. now for duchenne where there is knowledge of the endpoints, and for example, that's one more phase 1/2/3 maybe possible because of the endpoints have been developed, for cdkl5 is the neurologic disorder, is a little bit different. we're creating new endpoints, that's something where may be a little harder to do a straight through program. in any case, you can design in any way like, separate or together the key advantage of making it one continuous one is that you don't have to go through our regulatory query step in the middle. right. that's the thing...
jeffrey hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
all right.
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
that preparing the data submitting, getting the meeting, you burn out eight months, sometimes almost a year of time in there and that's the savings. so wherever we can get confidence from the agency upfront on endpoints and design, then we can try to take that rapid path.
jeffrey hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. and then for crysvita, you talked about the focus on finding adult patients. what's the current proportion of treated patients that are pediatric. i think in the past, you mentioned, its about 60%. just curious if that's changed much over time? thanks.
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. from the new patients i don't know, erik, you want to add anything to that but basically it's been shifting more toward adult. the terms of the fraction of current prescriptions.
erik harris -- chief commercial officer and executive vice president
in the last number reported out on this, there is the mix of about 35 to 45, its 5% pediatrics versus 40% adults. we've continued to see the overall share toward -- more heavily toward adult patients and in the last couple of quarters, we've been finding more adult patients than pediatric patients. so we expect that to continue to ship more heavily.
jeffrey hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, thank you.

your next question comes from the line of laura chico from wedbush securities. you may ask your question.
laura chico -- wedbush securities -- analyst
thank you very much and good afternoon. so, just following up on the crysvita co-promote. so i know it's probably looking a bit ahead, but the co-promotion, is that a change in 2023 and you just mentioned kind of the mix between the ped's and the adult patients. i'm just curious as we're kind of entering the second part of this agreement, is the focus on shifting toward adults. the theme to be thinking about as one of the key drivers to maximize the remaining trajectory or are there other, i guess just the strategic initiatives, we should be thinking about? and then just one quick follow-up with regards to a10 [phonetic] in dmd. i guess, following a competitor update from a gene therapy study, i'm wondering if you could maybe opine a little bit on how you're thinking about alternative biomarkers in the dmd space? thank you.
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, laura. so, with regard to crysvita, we still have room to penetrate both the ped's and the adult market. we have, we're not finished in that process. so, but we have not do about 30% of the peds. so we continue to work on growing the ped's market as well as the adult. it's just that the adult market -- the unmet need, there is probably a larger number of patients right now, right. and there are a little more of lost a little harder to find. so we are making a big effort. i don't know that it has a great deal to do with the transition is just mainly about optimizing the growth of the product ahead of it. so it really is more about where we see the most opportunity. i don't know if. erik has anything else to add to that.
erik harris -- chief commercial officer and executive vice president
the one thing i would add to that is there. it certainly is one of our top priorities in finding the adult patients and we've shifted resources to do just that from both digital and virtual but as well as i stated, there are plans to expand both the commercial and medical vlts to be able to target more physicians in the community setting where most of the adult patients are, so to take advantage of that opportunity.
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and i think one of the thing we're doing is because the -- each pediatric patient on drug likely has three or four adults that are related to them on average. using the pedigree enough to help find relatives across countries is important. i do think it's happening in adults is that we're getting a lot more feedback of adults on treatment and how they're doing and there's a lot more recognition of the adults. there are many adults that need to be treated and i think that's going to help, but if you look at the total number of patients that we can treat, the adult population is i think is still an area, where there is whole lot -- lot more patients for us to transition. so it's all about optimizing the growth of the product, but adults and peds both matter. and we're working with our partner khk and planning transition, but remember after the transition of course, we continue with the same essential revenue if you look at the revenue post. it's just. we're not doing the commercial as much, but we will be doing promotion of medical genetics after the transition. so we will have a role and promotion for the product in at least one segment of doctors.
so let's talk about the other the biomarker story. so the question, it sounds like you were asking about is, were there any outcome data from through after others which suggests that we should, how do we look at the biomarkers for proving efficacy. i think that the challenge here is that measuring this trough and then doing it accurately and knowing how it means is tricky and i think there is a lot of good methods and i do think we're going to want to look carefully at the methods because i do think they will have an impact on the impression of what you're achieving, i do think though that there is another factor which is how do markers translate really in the clinical benefit, which i think is partly at the question and we are familiar with muscular disease [phonetic] will help us. the truth is that even if you deliver the compound engaging it into the muscle and integrating it and having an effect on clinical function takes time and in addition with generally in muscle once you've lost function, i have just not seen treatments that bring back function, is almost always about maintaining and not losing. and i think that may be a mindset, we have to think about and that's we're treating early before they lost function is probably going to be important. so we're going to look at the quality of the biomarkers and the sure we're doing things that we think are validatable, but again [technical issues].

[operator instructions] your last question comes from the line of maury raycroft from jefferies. your line is open.
maury raycroft -- jefferies, llc. -- analyst
hi, everyone. congrats on the progress and thanks for taking my questions. so i just wanted to check in on dojolvi. it seems like it's off to a really good start and i'm guessing you're not going to say too much more on traction with newborn patients and naive use. but i'm wondering if you can provide any specifics around progress in screening and getting uptake in these patients?
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
yeah [phonetic]. we haven't -- we don't have any more to report on newborns, ours newborns have been prescribed and we also had some emergency cases still happening that we've had to respond to quickly without the reimbursement process being a whole separate story. so we've been doing some of that already and that continues. i don't really have any more specific about an uptick in the newborns. i think we need to continue to make sure our policies allow patients the numerous be treated. but what i would say to you the patient and wants patient to be treated, we will treat them with a reimbursement come through or not, we will treat the babies and work with the reimbursement process whenever it can be worked. but remember, in this situation, you know, time for -- we time our babies especially if there are symptoms, they got be taken care of, you don't have time for the process and so we're very comfortable with providing free drug assets immediately to patients and then handling the reimbursement process over time. i don't know, erik, if there is anything else you could provide on the issue of some newborns and naive patients[phonetic].
erik harris -- chief commercial officer and executive vice president
i would say that our own cohort has been very responsive with those requests form newborns where we've been able to get product to these newborns is certainly under 24 hours and as early as 6 hours in some emergency cases. so we are set up to address this need for such a fatal disease, life-threatening disease for these newborns.
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i hope that will help.
maury raycroft -- jefferies, llc. -- analyst
yeah. that's helpful. and last question is just on ux053. just wondering if you can provide any more perspective on what the study would look like, the types of patients you plan on enrolling and could we potentially see data from now one by the end of 2021?
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we would expect that we may have some data end of the year, maybe camille can you provided it early. just a brief negate on the study. i'm sure it will come up and clinical trials that in ordinate [phonetic] detail. go ahead camille.
camille l. bedrosian -- executive vice president, chief medical officer
it will. thank you for the question. thank you, emil. yes, the study is first and foremost the safety study, first out also looking at identifying the dose, dose finding followed by dose-ranging and we'll have a randomized cohorts of patients, placebo, and the drug. and in addition, there'll be multiple doses in the second round of cohorts for the patients. so the patients with gsd3 regardless of mutation and we will start initially with adults, followed by pediatric patients.

good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results and corporate update conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to your host, mr. joshua higa. sir, you may begin.
joshua higa -- director of investor relations and corporate communications
good afternoon, and welcome to the ultragenyx financial results and corporate update conference call for the fourth quarter and full-year 2020. we have issued a press release detailing our financial results, which you can find on our website at ultragenyx.com. i am joshua higa, director of investor relations, and joining me on this call today are emil kakkis, chief executive officer and president; camille bedrosian, chief medical officer; erik harris, chief commercial officer; and mardi dier, our chief financial officer.
i would like to remind investors that this call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, including but not limited to the types of statements identified as forward-looking in quarterly report on form 10-q that was filed on october 27, 2020, our annual report on form 10-k that will be filed soon and our subsequent periodic reports filed with the sec, which will all be available on our website in the investors section.
these forward-looking statements represent our views only as of the date of this call and involve substantial risks and uncertainties, including many that are beyond our control. please note that actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. for further description of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, as well as risks related to our business, please see our periodic reports filed with the sec.
i'll now turn the call over to emil.
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
good afternoon, and thank you everyone for joining us today. 2020 was a transformative year for ultragenyx as we executed on many of our strategic priorities. we now completed the fourth approval from our portfolio we had at ipo and over the last couple of years, it now refilled our portfolio with substantial opportunities in six clinical-stage programs, four of which are entering pivotal studies. we also have 14 preclinical programs and are advancing our first mrna program to the clinic this year. the efficient conversion of our pipeline to our next opportunities will allow us to accelerate our value creation and treat more rare disease patients with the first-ever specific treatment. from a commercial perspective, we achieved the upper end of crysvita revenue guidance despite a global pandemic and received two u.s. approvals and launched treatment for two more diseases with no other approved treatments.
from our clinical programs, we released important data updates from our gene therapy programs in gsd1a and otc deficiency, as well as the first glimpse of results for the antisense oligonucleotide gtx-102 in angelman syndrome. those initial arrangement results suggest promising activity in this relatively large rare disease with no approved therapies, but certainly much more to do to realize the potential. on the gene therapy side, we initiated one of the largest ever gene therapy licensing deals by providing nonexclusive rights to daiichi sankyo to utilize our manufacturing platform, including our hela producer selling technology. later in the year we partnered with solid biosciences in duchenne muscular dystrophy to pair their differentiated microdystrophin construct with our aav8 variance and our producted hela pcl system.
most recently we broke round and began construction on our gene therapy manufacturing facility in bedford, massachusetts, that will initially provide 30 manufacturing runs per year at the 2000-liter manufacturing scale. ultragenyx now has one of the broadest gene therapy franchises, which originated from our acquisition of dimension therapeutics in 2017. our portfolio now includes three in-house pivotal clinical stage programs, one additional clinical program partnered with bayer with two publicly disclosed in-house pre-clinical programs. our robust hela pcl manufacturing platforms enable us to make aav vectors at large scale, the highly efficient robust process that will enable the next generation of larger clinical programs.
but that was just the gene therapy side of the business. our development strategies to choose the right modalities for each disease and we have a variety of other therapeutic modes in our portfolio. for a genetic disease of bone, monoclonal antibodies can be the most effective way for affecting change in their biology. december, we added a new late-stage monoclonal antibody program by our collaboration with mereo biopharma. setrusumab or ux143 has completed a phase 2b study in adult patients with multiple tides of osteogenesis imperfecta or oi, which is one of the largest rare genetic bone diseases and significantly more common than xlh. camille will provide more detail on this program later, but i will note that oi and the ux143 program are perfect complement for our bone franchise and the expertise, we have built with crysvita. the learnings from our crysvita [phonetic] redevelopment program will be very helpful in the future development of ux143, and there is significant overlap between the physician to treat oi, xlh and tio.
importantly this collaboration provides us to commercialize the product throughout the world with the exception of europe, where we would see the royalty. while 2020 was a year full of unforeseen challenges, ultragenyx was able to make substantial progress executing our strategic plan across our pre-clinical, clinical and commercial programs with great success this past year.
i'll hand it over to erik provide more detail on our commercial performance for the year.
erik harris -- chief commercial officer and executive vice president
thank you, emil and good afternoon everyone. i'm truly proud of how the commercial team executed in 2020 in the face of never before seen challenges. 12 months ago, pre-covid, we issued guidance for crysvita revenue in our territories of $125 million to $140 million. despite the stay-at-home orders, many doctors' offices temporarily closing to non-essential in-person visits and all the uncertainty with global pandemic, we were able to finish the year at approximately $139 million, right at the top end of our guidance range. for 2021, we have issued guidance of $180 million to $190 million for crysvita revenue in ultragenyx territories. this represents between 30% and 37% year-over-year growth as we kind of the fourth year of crysvita's launch. this steady growth is enabled by the many digital strategies to educate physicians and finding xlh patients and getting these patients all crysvita while ensuring that existing patients, they are on crysvita during this pandemic.
we believe we will continue to see the mix of xlh patients on crysvita shift toward a greater portion of adult patients. this will be driven by our increasing efforts on finding adult patients by expanding our reach out to more endocrinologists, nephrologists and other specialties in the communities side. to support these efforts, we will expand both our commercial and medical field teams who will be focused on these harder to find adult xlh patients. in the middle of last year, we launched a tio indication for crysvita. the launch is going very well. we have converted the majority of clinical trial patients to reimburse drug and are receiving start forms for tio patients from the major metabolic bone centers.
reimbursement for tio is progressing well and is consistent with xlh reimbursement at the same stage of launch. we will not be providing specific patient numbers for tio as sales and that indication are included in our overall crysvita revenue guidance.
outside of the u.s., we are making steady progress in our discussions with health and reimbursement officials. demand remained strong across latin america, as we continue to see more and more patients being granted injunctions required to gain access to named-patient sales. the ordering patterns from the health authorities in this region tend to be inconsistent leading to some revenue lumpiness, which is consistent with other rare disease products in that region. we will keep you updated as we look forward to receiving full reimbursement in other ultragenyx territories.
moving now to dojolvi, which was also launched in the middle of last year for the treatment of long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders in the united states. at the end of december, we received approximately 190 completed start-forms from approximately 90 unique prescribers of dojolvi, which speaks to the breadth of interest, we are seeing for this product launch from the physician community. this led to approximately 130 patients on reimbursed commercial therapy, which also includes all 80 patients who participated in our clinical studies. we are also seeing strong support from payers. as of the end of january 2021, over 100 million lives in the u.s. have dojolvi coverage from over 40 policies, which includes some of the largest national payers. in these first quarters of the dojolvi launch, we will not be providing revenue guidance and believe the start-forms and prescriber metrics provide a better sense of the strength of the launch.
with that i will turn the call over to mardi to share the financial results.
mardi dier -- chief financial officer and executive vice president
thanks, erik. good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining today's call. we issued a press release earlier today that included a financial update, which i will briefly summarize. company revenue for the year ending december 31, 2020 totaled $271 million. crysvita revenue in ultragenyx territories was $138.9 million including $128.6 million from the north american profit share territory and net product sales of $10.4 million in other regions. total royalty revenue related to the sale of crysvita in the european territory was $14.5 million. mepsevii revenue for 2020 was $15.3 million. we expect these revenues may increase modestly over time. dojolvi revenue for the year was $13 million. this includes approximately 5 months of revenue after the u.s. launch of dojolvi toward the end of july ended -- and 12 months of named-patient sales in other regions.
2020 total revenue also included -- includes $89.2 million of non-cash revenue related to the tech transfer services provided to daiichi sankyo as part of our strategic manufacturing partnership around the hela pcl and hek293 technologies. our total operating expenses for the year were $601.1 million, which includes research and development expense of $412.1 million and sg&a expenses of $182.9 million. in 2021, we expect our r&d costs to increase as we support three pivotal gene therapy clinical studies, setrusumab phase 2, 3 clinical study in oi. ux053, our first mrna phase 1-2 clinical study and gsd 3 and a number of other ind enabling activities as we get ready to advance the next programs into the clinic.
we expect sg&a to modestly increase in 2021, as we continue to support the expansion and launches of crysvita, dojolvi and mepsevii. for the year ended december 31, 2020, net loss was $186.6 million or $3.07 per share. this compares to a net loss for the same period in 2019 of $402.7 million or $7.12 per share. net loss for the year ended december 31, 2020 includes $170.4 million increase in the fair value of investments in equity securities. net cash used in operations for the year was $132.2 million, compared to $345.4 million for the same period in 2019. we ended 2020 with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. this puts us in an excellent position to be able to support the execution of and achieve key milestones in our late-stage clinical pipeline and commercial expansion.
now i would like camille touch on some of our clinical programs.
camille l. bedrosian -- executive vice president, chief medical officer
thanks, mardi, and good afternoon, everyone. on january 8th, we issued a comprehensive press release, the detailed the latest data, regulatory progress, and phase 3 plans for our gene therapy programs. therefore, today, i will briefly summarize our current status and next steps for our three pivotal stage gene therapy program. dtx401 for glycogen storage disease type 1a has completed the scientific advice process with the european medicines agency, or ema, as well as held an end of phase 2 meeting with the fda. out of these meetings, we have aligned on the phase 3 study design and endpoints. we currently are on track to initiate this pivotal study in the first half of 2021.
shifting now to dtx301, for ornithine transcarbamylase, or otc, deficiency. we have received feedback from our initial scientific advice discussions with the ema and will have an end of phase 2 meeting with the fda, barring any unforeseen delays by the end of this quarter. based on the initial discussions, we feel confident about where we will end up with regards to the design and endpoints for this phase 3 study. we currently are on track to initiate this study in the second half of 2021.
moving now to ux701 for wilson disease, our third third pivotal gene therapy program to enter the clinic in 2021. earlier this year, we announced that the seamless single protocol phase 1, 2, 3 ind application has cleared fda review. the program also recently received fast track designation, which will enable additional dialog and feedback from the fda. this study currently is on track to initiate in the first half of 2021.
now i will touch on gtx-102, an antisense oligonucleotide which is being developed with our partner, genetx, for the treatment of angelman syndrome. angelman syndrome is a devastating neurogenetic disorder with a broad spectrum of disease manifestations, including speech and cognitive impairment, ataxia or balance issues, sleep dysfunction, and seizures. gtx-102 is the first antisense oligonucleotide program for angelman to reach the clinic.
late last year, we announced positive interim data from the ongoing phase 1, 2 study of gtx-102. all five patients who were treated demonstrated improvements in at least three disease domains and scores of much improved or very much improved, and two disease domains as measured by the clinical global impression of improvement scale for angelman syndrome. these improvements were also supported by other increases and measures, including observer reported communication ability, or orca, and daily for communication scale, as well as by preliminary eeg reading. all five patients also had a grade 1 or 2 serious adverse event of lower extremity weakness associated with local inflammation in the region of administration in the lower back at the higher doses of gtx-102.
dosing was paused after the first sae onset was observed and the study is currently on clinical hold. the sae has fully resolved in all five patients and clinical improvements have been sustained beyond the resolution of the sae. genetx, our partner, has submitted to the fda, a substantial information amendment including follow up safety information for the five patients dosed and non-clinical data in non-human primates. we have proposed an amended dosing and administration plan to the fda. these changes are expected to reduce the local contact time and concentration of the aso.
furthermore, the new dosing plan is within the observed range of the clinical activity, but well below doses associated with sae's. genetx received some questions from the fda and responses were provided. we currently expect the study to resume enrollment and dosing in the first half of 2021 following resolution of fda requests and approval to proceed. once we started, we expect additional interim data from this study that are expected in the second half of 2021. we are also in the process of expanding the study to other countries, including canada, where clinical trial application was previously filed, a protocol and information amendment similar to that proposed to fda will be submitted.
our first pivotal program to enter the clinic in 2021 will be the ux143, or setrusumab, a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta or oi through our partnership with mereo. oi is an extremely serious bone disease where defect in collagen result in significant bone fragility leading to stiffness, pain, factors, and deformities. oftentimes oi is believed to be a result of weak collagen, but based on our sponsor preclinical work and others research, we now understand that the major cause of bone weakness in oi is due to excess bone resorption triggered by the abnormal collagen and the inadequate production of new bone leading to low bone mass. these data show that if you could simply increase bone formation and reduce the excessive bone resorption, you kind of increase bone density and improve bone strength, even with the abnormal collagen and achieve improved fracture prevention.
we believe this is the insight that could change the future for patients with oi. mereo has released phase 2 data in 90 adult patients with oi, randomized among three different dose levels. the patients were dosed monthly for 12 months. study results indicated substantial improvements in bone mineral density in uptight oi type 1, 3, and 4, the three types included in this study. this response was dose-dependent and observed across different anatomical sites. the study also showed an ability to create a significant amount of bone, which we believe is a very important factor in improving bone strength. the safety profile for setrusumab is favorable for patients with oi.
pending discussions with regulatory agencies, we are planning to enroll the phase 2, 3 study in pediatric patients. the first will identify the optimal dose based on increases in the serum bone formation markers p1np and enroll into a randomized control period, looking at fracture rate reduction and bone mineral density over an estimated 15 to 24 months. while a separate pivotal study also is being planned for adults with oi, we believe the pediatric population will give us the fastest avenue for approval for the product. we currently expect to initiate the pediatric phase 2, 3 in the second half of 2021.
the last program, i will briefly summarize is ux053 for glycogen storage disease type 3, or gsd3. gsd3 is an inborn era of metabolism caused by mutations in the aglg, which is responsible for the production of the glycogen debrancher enzyme. a deficiency of the debrancher enzyme impairs the breakdown of glycogen in the liver and leads to a toxic residual carbohydrate. to our license from arcturus, we have developed an mrna with n -- with a nanoparticle product that is intended to restore the debrancher enzyme function thereby clearing the accumulated toxic residual carbohydrate and normalizing glycogen metabolism in the liver. we are currently on track for an ind in the first half of 2021 and to initiate a phase 1, 2 study in the second half of the year.
i will now turn the call back to emil, to wrap up.
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, camille, mardi, and erik. 2021 is going to be a full year of lots of important progress across our commercial and clinical programs. the active work and bd has refilled the pipeline with multiple late-stage catalysts with one of the best rare disease portfolios in the business. in the commercial portfolio, we're looking forward to continue expanding crysvita in the adult market through greater efforts to find patients and outline clinics and through pedigree analysis. we are also continuing to expand crysvita use outside the us, latin america, canada, and turkey. we drove this off to a strong start and i know the team will continue to execute launch for patients with lc-faod. we are in great and urgent need for a new treatment option. our commercial mepsevii [phonetic] have adapted well -- very well, the launching three products in four disease in the covid environment. within our gene therapy business, we've broken ground on the manufacturing facility embedded for massachusetts and three programs going at least late stage clinical trials. we continue to advance our early stage work in new muscular disease a cdkl5 deficiency and duchenne muscular dystrophy. we are also continuing to improve on the hela manufacturing technology with the new 3.0 system that will have even higher productivity and reduce cogs making gene therapy a viable modality for these larger higher dose indications on a global basis.
our nucleic acid therapeutics pipeline will also advance. we're making progress in reviewing the aso phase 1/2 study in angelman. we plan to initiate clinical development for the mrna ux053 and glycogen storage disease type iii or debrancher deficiency. with our first mrna probing to come out of our license, arcturus and that license also provides rights for up to 12 mrna and other nucleic acid therapy targets.
the gsd3 program is also a great complement to our efforts in gsd1a and builds on our broader portfolio therapies aimed at inborne areas of metabolism that have not been treated by more traditional means. the addition of setrusumab gives us a de-risk wastage from the leverage expertise in creating clinical pathway for rare genetic bone diseases. as you can see we're in a great moment in our evolution to the company with multiple late-stage assets across therapeutic areas, modalities all enabled by continued strong financial performance from our proved programs, strategic investing in fiscal diligence. now let's move on to your questions. operator, please provide instructions for the q&a portion of the call.

yes, sir. your next question comes from the line of yaron werber from cowen. your line is open.
yaron werber -- cowen -- analyst
hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. so, emil, i got maybe the first question, the pipeline is now -- looks really good. i mean you've essentially two drugs going into pivotal, another one potentially into a phase 2/3, i mean it's fairly full. do you have more room for bd, are you still looking or you are sort of good for the next year? and then, mardi. i don't know if you can give us any sense how do we model daichii related revenues? do you have visibility that you could share with us? thank you.
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
great, yaron. i think if you look at our portfolio, we tend of target having 5 to 7 clinical stage programs and right now we would have six with what we're dealing. so we're on a relatively full state in terms of development stage programs. we are still continuing to be because you always continue to look if there were something amazing, we wouldn't want to walk past it, we would look for that opportunity, but we are potentially have ability to leverage our commercial organization with later stage opportunity, but i do believe them from earlier development stage opportunities, we're very full. we've been on and off and we've got a lot of work to do, and i'm excited about the portfolio. i don't think we can imagine being in a better place than what we've been able to put together over the last couple of years. so mardi, maybe you can answer the other question.
mardi dier -- chief financial officer and executive vice president
yeah, real simply yaron with daiichi, of course, the deal that we completed back in march was for a $200 million upfront. from an accounting purpose, we have this non-cash revenue recognition that we believe is associated with the tech transfer of the deal. so there is about $60 million plus left on that recognition of revenue and that should be complete in 2021, so that should be a pretty specific way to model it in 2021.
yaron werber -- cowen -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of gena wang from barclays. your line is open.
gena wang -- barclays -- analyst
thank you for taking my questions. i have two questions, one is regarding the angelman syndrome. it seems that fda already gave you feedback and emil, just wondering if you can give a little bit more color regarding the amendment to the protocol. if there any additional change versus your original submission regarding the protocol amendment? and my second question is regarding the dosing change you use ddpcr for the gsd-y pivotal study and change the dose from 6e12 to 1e13 and just wondering do you need to do similar change for the otc program? and will you use ddpcr across all the future program, so that the dosing will be more accurate going forward?
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
sure. great. so on the angelman, we gave in this very large substantial amendment. they provided then a response to some specific questions. additional information inquiry that they were interested in. they -- those questions did not change the plan we had proposed. we listened to what they put together and provided now -- an amendment to the protocol and irb, etc. and all the things required in order to proceed ahead. so we'll wait and see their response to that. but the questions didn't really change our plan. they were basically in line. i think we -- our plan is pretty well thought out. i don't think that there is -- i think there is not much we can do to change, but we'll wait and see for their feedback and there may be subtle ways to manage it and they will want to assure safety, just like we do and we're happy to work with them to get that done, but we feel comfortable, we're going to get back into the treating these patients and the patients have been inquiring they really want to get back to treatment. so we want to get back to it, i think we're in good shape for that and we'll see what they say.
on the gsd1 story, we're not really changing the dose, what we're doing is changing how we're measuring the dose. so what -- it's really important that total doses that we're giving the same as it was before. it's just what we're calling it has changed and what's happened is that the original qpcr methods have some limitations and variability in them. they're not as good and we've been working on the digital drop method, which is high more reproducible, more validatable and therefore a more accurate representation. what it turned out for gsd1a is that, we were really -- the amount of vector we're giving which we considered 6e12 before was actually closer to e13 when you use a more accurate digital drop method and it just relates to the techniques and the basis of certain techniques.
for the otc program, there is also a difference and we are using the digital drop, but would it be clear to the everyone is that the dose is the same as it was, it's just what we're labeling the dose as based on a more accurate method and this is one of the things, even fda has been on and we all want is to continue to improve the quality of the methods, to give us accurate representation of how many of these particles are alive and well in its vector product that we can use for gene therapy.
so practically speaking, it doesn't change anything, but from a standpoint of the quality of the process, it helps give fda and ourselves confidence of what we're administering in every lot.
gena wang -- barclays -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of cory kasimov from jp morgan. your line is open.
cory kasimov -- jp morgan -- analyst
hey, good afternoon guys. thanks for taking the questions. first one on angelman, assuming you do in fact get that study up and running in the first half of the year as you're expecting, how quickly do you think you'll know whether the amended dosing and administration plan is working and avoid any assays you saw originally? and then i have one follow-up on the wilson's.
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
well, the way the protocol is proposed, we will redose the existing patients -- five patients and will also enroll another 12 patients in the staged manner and look at basically four doses and then we'll go into a maintenance every three months. so by the time we get to four months of dosing with these patients in the -- both the five and the additional 12 that will give us a sense of are we getting the efficacy we thought after accumulating the effect over multiple doses at a lower level and are we seeing safety. so, we'd expect to get to that story later in the year because it takes about four months for each patient enrolled to get through the dosing. so we can get through four doses and show the same substantial efficacy we saw before and not have the safety event that helps improve it. once they go on to maintenance where they are going every three month dosing. i think we feel more comfortable that the safety will be better. the problem we had was only during the monthly phase. so if we can get through the monthly phase, go onto maintenance dosing and we're good through the monthly phase, and get the efficacy, we're hoping for them, i think we'll know and that should happen later this year.
cory kasimov -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay, that's very helpful. and then for your seamless phase 1, 2, 3 for wilson's, what's the process in terms of making go-no-go decisions here to move to the next stage in this particular type of design? is it -- should we think of it as a truncated study across all three typical phases or is there something else that goes into it?
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
well, the two stages. in stage one, we're going to dose of placebo and drug in three cohorts, a first dose cohort 5e12, e13, 2e13. all right. so it's going to be a sequence of patients through three cohorts. during this period, there will be an interim assessment -- a blinded interim assessment to show whether that -- what the dose is looking like and what's happening, and we'll make a decision on dose after those three cohorts. at that point we would know in a blinded fashion in group that we are seeing an efficacy when safety is as appropriate and we'll pick the dose to move forward. so we'd expect somewhere in there to have some data that we would put out that would not -- but we want to make sure not to harm the conduct of the study, but we'll put out some information about where we stand and that we have crossed from dosing stage into the pivotal stage. is that helpful?
cory kasimov -- jp morgan -- analyst
yes, definitely. thanks, emil. i appreciate it.

your next question comes from the line of joon lee from truist securities. you may ask your question.
joon lee -- truist securities -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my questions. so, emil, can you affirm that the fda was generally in agreement that trendelenburg and lower dosing will be sufficient to avoid the saes, or do they want something entirely different? and then secondly, what if any rethrough is there from the failure of ov101 and angelman is placebo effect possibly an issue when using cgi-i-as, just curious if there is anything that could be learned from that study to apply to your story? thank you.
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
sure. well, the fda did not question trendelenburg and plus the procedures because actually they had been used widely and i think we provided the justification for that. it has been done by the way in chemotherapy for years, years, now if we've made this up, it's been well established to reduce local toxicity in chemotherapy drug. so it's not like we're something never been done before. so it wasn't really question about that. it was more about what the event is and what's going on, kind of thing. they just want confidence around that we can make the right interpretation of what's happening and our interpretation of it being a local inflammatory event and those required, those just more detailed information about the mris and other things so they can kind of understand what we understand. so there was no question about the strategy on lower dosing capping and the other changes at this point. so we feel pretty good about where we're at. i do think we're making the right choices and i think there's good base for our changes to be beneficial.
now with regard to ov101, i don't think it has too much read-through it. if it was of course an approved product during our phase 3, it would probably create more complexity for how we're managing patients on it or not on it. with regard to cgi and its value, i appreciate the fact that our five patients were open-label. the magnitude effect that we are seeing is not 0.7 points, meanwhile the average for the five patients was 2.4. so, the degree of efficacy changes far larger than you might see from placebo if that was placebo effect. so in addition to that, there were multiple other evaluations in the trial that supported the communication changes and the other changes observed, including sleep and other things including mobility. so it wasn't just cgi that was actually a whole host of secondary valuations also supporting the change.
so that's why we know this is real and we know it's profound and we were where we think it's something could be quite important for these patients. we know by the way that with the time is passing, of course the patients have the effect lasted maybe four, five months in many of these symptoms, but as time has passed, of course patients have lost some ground and are anxious to get started again. so in our case, i'm 100% confident, this is not placebo effect, we have too much data to support it and of course the magnitude effects just beyond what you would assume to be part of a placebo effect.
joon lee -- truist securities -- analyst
and just quickly, following up on the angelman's. you have not created a target for yourself. there are companies pursuing the exact same approach stop to start. what kind of note do you have around your product that could protect the franchise front well, better?
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think you've got a target to make the first thing you got to run fast. so they're hard to hit. but that's sort of position, but truthful to i think our ability to execute its going to be real important. the truth is, if you want to -- as a company, we will work on some larger rare disease areas. but when we do, it's not to be all alone like some other ones, like otc, gsd1, gsd3. it's more comfortable, we really pretty much the only clinical play. it will be there. but here's the thing about the whole program. the reason we picked this angelman program, the work we have done, is that we have the data that we were looking at that they produce in vitro and others, all the work has gone day-to-day, which said what they're doing in the region they're targeting is far more prudent and able to knock down all the antisense transcripts than what other people are doing, is we felt there was a distinct intellectual property scientific insight improvement.
the other method is trying to do what we're doing is actually very hard. i do think the aso method will be better and the gene therapy will be hard to replicate, because you cannot deliver every neuron evenly and you can't have variations of expression of this thing, they are too high. so it's going to be a lot trickier to deal with this on a gene therapy basis then an aso basis. because with the aso, we enable the gene to be expressed, but we don't force it to be expressed. that allows an endogenous regulatory mechanism to even out the amount of this ube3a protein. so maybe a little bit scientific detail, what i'm saying to you there is a very strong basis for why this, as it can allow you to get more neurons active and allow them to be regulated properly and i think that's why we believe the aso was the best method among those and among those aso methods, we have the best-targeted region and that's our confidence in what we're doing. same time we're going to run fast.
joon lee -- truist securities -- analyst
yeah. thank you. your next question comes from the line of yigal nochomovitz from citigroup. your line is open.
yigal nochomovitz -- citi -- analyst
hi, erik. hi, emil, and team. thank you for taking the questions. so, could you provide a bit of perspective on ultragenyx strategy to differentiate setrusumab profile from romosozumab, given as you know, both antibodies target sclerostin and in light of the fact that amgen is also pursuing osteogenesis imperfecta with romo in a phase 1 that was recently posted on clinical trials? and then secondarily, if you could comment on the advantages of targeting sclerostin as opposed to rancho [phonetic] or tgf-beta for osteogenesis imperfecta given as you know the amgen is pursuing oi phase 3 and oi with prolia and sanofi is pursuing with oi with fresolimumab in phase 1? thanks.
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
good, thank you. it sounds like another variation of target on our back questions, but -- so look, we are very familiar with romo and in fact, michael minsky that worked through us, worked for amgen for 10 years on romo and has a lot of knowledge. it's a good anti-sclerostin antibodies, main commercial potential for amgen has been around osteoporosis. as part of their development program, there are required to do a pediatric investigational plan for europe, which requires them to run the study. so if they are running a study, what they will do with that in the long run, it's unclear, but the idea that the tip is just they have to try to test their product in that population, but they're not focused on that population. we are going to look at the dosing and dose regimen uniquely to apply to oi, and we think the dosing may need to be higher and that's in pediatrics, and they're doing therapy for one year, whereas i think we will need to do more chronic or have at least induction in the main -- mean phase, which is not part of their program. so our folks in oi will allow us to depth dosing and regimen to optimize for the oi indication. that said, could people use romo off-label and will we have to deal with that commercially, and i say yes, we will. we still have to deal with it, but oi has a lot of patients and a lot of different types that can be benefited and we think somewhere in there with the dosing and other issues that there is a very important product that we could achieve regardless of what the pricing issues play out.
the second point you asked about is that the other competing molecules. i think sclerostin has some unique features that are particularly good. if you look at oi, the patients have too much resorption, but they also have inadequate bone anabolism [phonetic]. so you definitely want a strong anabolic agent and we think sclerostin appears to be a very strong anabolic agent and in the animal models that why it's very potent and inducing good bone formation that results in strong bones that persist fracture. so we think that the focus on anabolism with some effect on resorption, i think is probably valuable, especially in the context with bisphosphonate. certainly tgf-beta is sanofi is working on is another strategy, its another hormone involved in bone regulation. i don't have a lot to say right now. it could be a factor we'll have to keep our eye on what they're doing, rank logan [phonetic] or bases the denosumab is what i assume you're talking about. it's another approach, but it's a little different, it's related more to the absorption. i just think -- we think based on what we're seeing as sclerostin is best and i will also say that sclerostin maybe the first step and maybe there were need ultimately as a second generation version to add another molecule like a combination to optimize but given the size of oi and our particular expertise in running bone development, i have confidence we can push forward a good product that will make a real big difference for oi patients.

liisa bayko -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi there, thanks for taking my question. for dtx401 for gsd1a, are you going to be enrolling patients in phase 3 from all the different kind of mutation types and should we expect similar efficacy across those? thanks.
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
so we are not restricting to a particular mutation. but remember in gsd1a about 80% of the patients are null. so it's probably is homogeneous, a phenotype null expression as you can get. and so we feel pretty comfortable that even if there is some minor -- let's say lesser mutation, patients with less effect, less deficiency that we would expect the effect to be as good or better because if we -- most of patient we have been treating being all null. so if we can treat the nulls effectively, then treating the nuance one should be easier, not harder, right. so we feel pretty confident we can treat -- we can treat all based on how many nulls we've already treated.

your next question comes from the line of jeffrey hung from morgan stanley. you may ask your question.
jeffrey hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions. for ux701, you went through the plans for the single protocol phase 1/2/3. so going forward, do you see this as a standard way you'll be conducting studies for other gene therapies or was there something specific to this program that allowed sort of single protocol study design?
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
there are some factors that make single protocol designs possible, and one of the key ones, jeff is endpoints like primary endpoint and the wilson case because there's always approved products, we know and the fda has already agreed that urinary copper excretion can't -- 24-hour urinary copper excretion can be the primary endpoint. with the primary endpoint defined, then you can design entire program straight through. if you don't have a primary endpoint defined, it's a little in hard to try to find the phase 1/2/3 without having analyzed and configured the right inclusion criteria for the next stage, if that makes sense. so, it really has to do with what were your level of confidence in the endpoints. now for duchenne where there is knowledge of the endpoints, and for example, that's one more phase 1/2/3 maybe possible because of the endpoints have been developed, for cdkl5 is the neurologic disorder, is a little bit different. we're creating new endpoints, that's something where may be a little harder to do a straight through program. in any case, you can design in any way like, separate or together the key advantage of making it one continuous one is that you don't have to go through our regulatory query step in the middle. right. that's the thing...
jeffrey hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
all right.
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
that preparing the data submitting, getting the meeting, you burn out eight months, sometimes almost a year of time in there and that's the savings. so wherever we can get confidence from the agency upfront on endpoints and design, then we can try to take that rapid path.
jeffrey hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. and then for crysvita, you talked about the focus on finding adult patients. what's the current proportion of treated patients that are pediatric. i think in the past, you mentioned, its about 60%. just curious if that's changed much over time? thanks.
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. from the new patients i don't know, erik, you want to add anything to that but basically it's been shifting more toward adult. the terms of the fraction of current prescriptions.
erik harris -- chief commercial officer and executive vice president
in the last number reported out on this, there is the mix of about 35 to 45, its 5% pediatrics versus 40% adults. we've continued to see the overall share toward -- more heavily toward adult patients and in the last couple of quarters, we've been finding more adult patients than pediatric patients. so we expect that to continue to ship more heavily.
jeffrey hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of laura chico from wedbush securities. you may ask your question.
laura chico -- wedbush securities -- analyst
thank you very much and good afternoon. so, just following up on the crysvita co-promote. so i know it's probably looking a bit ahead, but the co-promotion, is that a change in 2023 and you just mentioned kind of the mix between the ped's and the adult patients. i'm just curious as we're kind of entering the second part of this agreement, is the focus on shifting toward adults. the theme to be thinking about as one of the key drivers to maximize the remaining trajectory or are there other, i guess just the strategic initiatives, we should be thinking about? and then just one quick follow-up with regards to a10 [phonetic] in dmd. i guess, following a competitor update from a gene therapy study, i'm wondering if you could maybe opine a little bit on how you're thinking about alternative biomarkers in the dmd space? thank you.
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, laura. so, with regard to crysvita, we still have room to penetrate both the ped's and the adult market. we have, we're not finished in that process. so, but we have not do about 30% of the peds. so we continue to work on growing the ped's market as well as the adult. it's just that the adult market -- the unmet need, there is probably a larger number of patients right now, right. and there are a little more of lost a little harder to find. so we are making a big effort. i don't know that it has a great deal to do with the transition is just mainly about optimizing the growth of the product ahead of it. so it really is more about where we see the most opportunity. i don't know if. erik has anything else to add to that.
erik harris -- chief commercial officer and executive vice president
the one thing i would add to that is there. it certainly is one of our top priorities in finding the adult patients and we've shifted resources to do just that from both digital and virtual but as well as i stated, there are plans to expand both the commercial and medical vlts to be able to target more physicians in the community setting where most of the adult patients are, so to take advantage of that opportunity.
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and i think one of the thing we're doing is because the -- each pediatric patient on drug likely has three or four adults that are related to them on average. using the pedigree enough to help find relatives across countries is important. i do think it's happening in adults is that we're getting a lot more feedback of adults on treatment and how they're doing and there's a lot more recognition of the adults. there are many adults that need to be treated and i think that's going to help, but if you look at the total number of patients that we can treat, the adult population is i think is still an area, where there is whole lot -- lot more patients for us to transition. so it's all about optimizing the growth of the product, but adults and peds both matter. and we're working with our partner khk and planning transition, but remember after the transition of course, we continue with the same essential revenue if you look at the revenue post. it's just. we're not doing the commercial as much, but we will be doing promotion of medical genetics after the transition. so we will have a role and promotion for the product in at least one segment of doctors.
so let's talk about the other the biomarker story. so the question, it sounds like you were asking about is, were there any outcome data from through after others which suggests that we should, how do we look at the biomarkers for proving efficacy. i think that the challenge here is that measuring this trough and then doing it accurately and knowing how it means is tricky and i think there is a lot of good methods and i do think we're going to want to look carefully at the methods because i do think they will have an impact on the impression of what you're achieving, i do think though that there is another factor which is how do markers translate really in the clinical benefit, which i think is partly at the question and we are familiar with muscular disease [phonetic] will help us. the truth is that even if you deliver the compound engaging it into the muscle and integrating it and having an effect on clinical function takes time and in addition with generally in muscle once you've lost function, i have just not seen treatments that bring back function, is almost always about maintaining and not losing. and i think that may be a mindset, we have to think about and that's we're treating early before they lost function is probably going to be important. so we're going to look at the quality of the biomarkers and the sure we're doing things that we think are validatable, but again [technical issues].

maury raycroft -- jefferies, llc. -- analyst
hi, everyone. congrats on the progress and thanks for taking my questions. so i just wanted to check in on dojolvi. it seems like it's off to a really good start and i'm guessing you're not going to say too much more on traction with newborn patients and naive use. but i'm wondering if you can provide any specifics around progress in screening and getting uptake in these patients?
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
yeah [phonetic]. we haven't -- we don't have any more to report on newborns, ours newborns have been prescribed and we also had some emergency cases still happening that we've had to respond to quickly without the reimbursement process being a whole separate story. so we've been doing some of that already and that continues. i don't really have any more specific about an uptick in the newborns. i think we need to continue to make sure our policies allow patients the numerous be treated. but what i would say to you the patient and wants patient to be treated, we will treat them with a reimbursement come through or not, we will treat the babies and work with the reimbursement process whenever it can be worked. but remember, in this situation, you know, time for -- we time our babies especially if there are symptoms, they got be taken care of, you don't have time for the process and so we're very comfortable with providing free drug assets immediately to patients and then handling the reimbursement process over time. i don't know, erik, if there is anything else you could provide on the issue of some newborns and naive patients[phonetic].
erik harris -- chief commercial officer and executive vice president
i would say that our own cohort has been very responsive with those requests form newborns where we've been able to get product to these newborns is certainly under 24 hours and as early as 6 hours in some emergency cases. so we are set up to address this need for such a fatal disease, life-threatening disease for these newborns.

yeah. that's helpful. and last question is just on ux053. just wondering if you can provide any more perspective on what the study would look like, the types of patients you plan on enrolling and could we potentially see data from now one by the end of 2021?
emil d. kakkis -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we would expect that we may have some data end of the year, maybe camille can you provided it early. just a brief negate on the study. i'm sure it will come up and clinical trials that in ordinate [phonetic] detail. go ahead camille.
camille l. bedrosian -- executive vice president, chief medical officer
it will. thank you for the question. thank you, emil. yes, the study is first and foremost the safety study, first out also looking at identifying the dose, dose finding followed by dose-ranging and we'll have a randomized cohorts of patients, placebo, and the drug. and in addition, there'll be multiple doses in the second round of cohorts for the patients. so the patients with gsd3 regardless of mutation and we will start initially with adults, followed by pediatric patients.
maury raycroft -- jefferies, llc. -- analyst

i will now turn the call over to emil.
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, josh, and welcome to everyone on the phone. so far 2021 has been a productive year for ultragenyx. we have made great progress toward the initiation of four pivotal clinical studies with novel therapies for rare genetic diseases and a broad portfolio of six clinical stage programs. the clinical progress is complemented by continued advances in our three commercial franchises, marking 2021 as an important inflection point in our growth as a company.
starting with gene therapy, we made significant regulatory and operational advances toward the initiation of the dtx301, dtx401 and ux701 pivotal studies. most recently, we completed successful regulatory discussions for dtx301, our aav8 gene therapy for otc deficiency, as one of the last key steps before initiating that phase 3 study. we have also completed all the regulatory discussions for the dtx401 phase 3 and are working with sites to get the study started soon. early in the year, we announced that the ind is active for innovative phase 1, 2, 3 studies for ux701, an aav9 gene therapy for wilson disease. we are currently on track to launch all three of these pivotal studies this year with the gst-1a and wilson studies on track to begin enrolling early in the second half. in addition to the late stage gene therapies, we are pushing ahead with ux143, the monoclonal antibody for osteogenesis imperfecta that we recently licensed from mereo biopharma. we are in the planning process for the phase 2/3 study for this program and we are currently on track to kick off this pivotal study in pediatric patients by the end of the year.
as a reminder, osteogenesis imperfecta is one of the largest groups of rare genetic bone disorders and is an excellent complement to preceded with respect to the clinical and commercial capabilities needed to craft and execute a top notch development and launch plan.
moving to gtx-102, the antisense oligonucleotide program for angelman syndrome. we are continuing to make progress toward resuming the phase 1/2 study. our goal for the program at this specific time is two-fold. first, to move forward as quickly as possible restart dosing at the low dose as it showed activity within and visually monitored dose titration plan to assure safety. and second to broaden the scope of the program to allow the program to accelerate once a safe and active dose level has been determined given the strong activity we have seen with the molecules so far. two of those goals our partner gt genetics submitted an amendment to the existing approved native filing to initiate study in canada. genetics also submitted a new clinical trial application for the second ex-u.s. regulatory agency to open clinical sites outside of the u.s.
we have an encouraging -- we had encouraging discussion with that european regulatory agency regarding gtx-102, including all the detailed efficacy, safety and non-clinical data, along with the same dosing and monitoring plan that was provided to the fda.
european agency agreed in principle with this analysis and plan and a full filing is made on this basis to that agency. based on this interaction we are confident we can start the study outside the u.s. this year. our discussions are continuing with the fda on removing the clinical hold. we have submitted additional clinical information requested and a meeting is pending with the fda. camille will provide a little more detail on this later in the call. we look forward to providing updates as definitive milestones are made in the angelman program.
moving to our newest clinical stage program; ux053 is our mrna candidate for gsdiii or glycogen storage disease type iii or debrancher deficiency. this is the first clinical program to come out of collaboration with our tourists through which we have rights to 12 programs. we are working on two other earlier projects in the mrna space that we will discuss as they mature. we are always evaluating additional opportunities to harness this promising technology for patients with rare genetic diseases. in the last year mardi has come forward. it's not just a theory but a viable strategy based on the highly successful covid vaccine program and we are also very encouraged with what we see with this technology. ux053 program has free clearance from the fda to start the phase 1/2 study in glycogen storage disease type iii or debrancher deficiency. this program will further build on our experience with gene therapy in glycogen storage disease type ia or von gierke disease and is expected to start later this year.
turning to our commercial portfolio, we had a good q1 that erik and mardi will describe further. crysvita in north america continues to do well now that we are three years into launch, as coivd restrictions have eased somewhat and clinics further reopened in 2021. we have seen an increase in diagnosis of xlh patients that we expect to help drive long-term growth for crysvita. we have initiated our strength in a number of efforts to support this increased diagnosis in xlh. this includes increasing our digital and social media activities, broadening the set of physicians we meet with and using patient education and genetic counseling to improve diagnosis across a broad family tree.
in latin america the team continues to make good progress in establishing the value of crysvita for patients with xlh and we continue to see more and more patients winning injunctions to receive reimburse therapy, which has started to generate meaningful revenue.
turning to dojolvi, which has been off to a great start. we saw strong demand in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2020 driven by conversion of 80 clinical trial and existing capacity of these patients and the most severe of diagnosed patients. we see a solid growth rate of new starts going forward and we are encouraged by the great positive feedback we are receiving from prescribers in the u.s. in europe our discussions with regulators continue. but we are also seeing strong new patient demand for dojolvi. recent longer term efficacy data and safety from 1818 patients in france, these are named patient treated patients were published in ultragenyx and metabolism. camille will get into the details later in this call. but it's good to see our phase 2 data corroborated by an independent french investigative team in their patients in france.
i will now hand the call off to erik to provide more detail on our commercial progress.
erik harris -- chief commercial officer
thank you, emil, and good afternoon, everyone. in 2020 the commercial team was able to find success in the face of many unprecedented challenges and in the first quarter of 2021 we continue to build on that momentum. i will start with crysvita. our leading indicators including patient times, start forms reimburse patients in the first quarter were strong and we are confident about our trajectory for the rest of the year. as expected, we did see some seasonality in the first quarter driven by the annual reauthorization process.
at this time, we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance for revenue in ultragenyx territories of $180 million to $190 million. based on where we finished 2020 this would represent strong growth 30% to 37% year-over-year. in the united states we are continuing to hear positive feedback from the medical and patient communities. once patients with xlh or tio start therapy with crysvita very few discontinue. this is mostly due to the benefits patients are experiencing while receiving crysvita, as well as the support our patients support services team provides. at this point, three years into launch, we have established strong relationships with all of the major endocrinology and metabolic bone centers. solid growth will come from our patient filing efforts in the community clinics where the majority of our new adult star forms originate. we are increasing investments and successful tactics that we piloted during the pandemic and are modestly expanding our field teams to reach more of those community clinics.
just a quick comment on the launch of crysvita for tio, we continue to see a steady flow of new start forms for patients with this ultra-rare disease. many of these patients are seeing the same physicians who treat patients with xlh and oi. over time we expect the launch to continue this trajectory, while leveraging our current field and patient support teams. the demand we are seeing across latin america for crysvita remain strong. the base of patients continues to expand as more are granted injunctions, gain access to name patient sales. it is typical within the region, we do expect latin america ordering patterns to be uneven as our team continues to make significant progress on full reimbursement approval within the region.
turning now to dojolvi, which was approved for the treatment of long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders by the fda in june 2020 and by health canada in february 2021. in the united states approximately three quarters into the launch almost 10% in february 2021.
in the united states approximately three quarters entered the launch, almost 10% of the estimated low end of the range for the prevalent population in the united states have been prescribed dojolvi. we believe that many of these patients are the most severe phenotypes. we received approximately 230 start forms from approximately 115 unique prescribers of dojolvi and have approximately 180 patients on reimbursed commercial therapy. this continues to speak to the broad interest we are seeing from the physician community and strong support from payers.
as of the end of march 2021, over 135 million lives in the u.s. have dojolvi coverage from over 50 policies. perhaps, as important as this broad coverage, we are seeing the time it takes from receiving a completed start form to a patient beginning reimbursed therapy to be less than 45 days. this is a faster turnaround time than we saw with crysvita at a similar stage of launch. it is great to see so many of these patients in the u.s. with lc-faods successfully navigating their insurance policies.
despite the pandemic and the challenges patients are faced with and trying to get into see their doctor, the launch is exceeding our expectations. as restrictions continue to ease, we are confident in the current trajectory of new start forms across all three brands of crysvita, dojolvi and mepsevii.
with that, i will turn the call over to mardi to share the financial results.
mardi dier -- chief financial officer
thanks, erik. good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining today's call. we issued a press release earlier today that included a financial update, which i will briefly summarize. company revenue for the quarter ending march 31, 2021, totaled $99.4 million. crysvita revenue in ultragenyx territory was $42.1 million, including $36.3 million from north -- from the north america profit share territory and net product sales at $5.9 million in other region. total royalty revenue related to the sales of crysvita in the european territory was $3.9 million.
as erik alluded to earlier, there are really two factors to keep in mind when looking at the first quarter crysvita revenue. first, in the north america profit share territory, we saw the anticipated seasonality from the annual reauthorization process that occurs at the beginning of each year. we are pleased that the first quarter revenue, the north america profit share territory grew 33% versus the first quarter 2020. second, we have received a large order from brazil's ministry of health toward the end of the quarter that reflects our success in identifying more xlh patients that are able to get reimbursement through the injunction process in brazil. as is with the case with brazil's ministry of health, we expect continued uneven ordering pattern for this territory.
the dojolvi revenue for the quarter was $7 million. as we have stated before we will not be providing revenue guidance for the dojolvi in the first quarters of watch. we believe the metrics erik just discussed better describe the success, we are having that we are seeing in this launch so far. mepsevii revenue for the quarter -- first quarter of 2021 was $3.6 million. we expect these revenues may modestly increase over time.
first quarter 2021 revenue also included $42.8 million related to the tech transfer as part of our strategic manufacturing partnership with daiichi sankyo around our hela pcl and hek293 technologies. of the total contract value of approximately$185 million we have recommended close to $132 million to-date. the remaining amount allocated to the intellectual property and tech transfer services most likely will be recognized over the rest of this year and will taper significantly over the next three quarters and as the tech transfer activities wind down. additional details on this revenue recognition can be found in our annual and quarterly reports filed with the sec.
our total operating expenses for the quarter were $206 million, which includes research and development expenses of $147.5, sg&a expenses of $53.3 million and cost of sales to $5.2 million. the r&d cost in the first quarter of 2021 included the $50 million upfront payment for the closing of the mereo license and collaboration agreement. as a reminder, we expect our r&d costs this year to increase as we will support the three pivotal gene therapy clinical trials, the ux143 phase 2/3 clinical study and osteogenesis imperfect and the phase 1/2 study for the most advanced mrna program ux053 and gsdiii, and a number of other preclinical activities as we get ready to advance the next program into the clinic. we also expect sg&a to modestly increase over 2021 as we continue to support the expansion and launches of crysvita, dojolvi and mepsevii.
for the quarter ended march 31, 2021, net loss was $126.1 million or $2.03 per share. this compares to a net loss for the same period in 2020 of $119 million or $2.05 per share. the net loss for the first quarter 2021 includes the $50 upfront payment mereo and $20.6 million decrease in the fair value of investments and equity securities.
net cash used in operations for the quarter was $153 -- $159.3 million, which includes the upcoming payment to mereo, as compared to the $95.2 million for the same period in 2020. we ended the quarter with over $1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. this puts us in a strong capital position to reach key clinical and commercial milestones as we continue executing our development and commercial strategies.
now, i will let camille touch on some of our clinical programs.
camille bedrosian -- chief medical officer
thank you, mardi, and i too wish everyone good afternoon. i would like to start by providing a regulatory update on gtx-102, which is being developed with our partner genetx for the treatment of angelman syndrome. angelman syndrome is a devastating neurogenetic disorder with a broad spectrum of disease manifestations, including speech and cognitive impairment, ataxia or balance issues, growth and fine motor dysfunction, sleep dysfunction and seizures.
late year we reported positive efficacy data from the first five patients treated in the phase 1/2 study that indicated substantial improvements and multiple remains in all patients. we also reported all five patients had a grade one or two serious adverse event of lower extremity weakness that now has fully resolved. we paused dosing and enrollment at the first presentation of the event. in support of resuming the clinical study, we have provided the fda with additional non-clinical data showing the effects of dtx-102 in non-human primates models at single and repeat doses at levels far exceeding an equivalent dose that would be expected to be used in our clinical program. the delayed onset weakness we saw in the phase 1/2 was not observed in the non-human primates with single doses as high as 10 milligrams or 110 milligram human equivalent dose, nor was it observed with seven monthly doses of 4 milligrams or an equivalent cumulative dose in humans of 314 milligrams.
importantly, we did see a strong knockdown of the ube3a antisense at very low monthly doses beginning at 1 milligram or approximately 10 milligram dose equivalent in humans. we also saw a measurable though not a strong effect at 0.5 milligrams dosed monthly. we recently requested a meeting with the fda following multiple submissions of substantial non-clinical and clinical data including data confirming that the serious adverse event in the previously treated patients has fully reversed. this meeting has been granted for later this quarter. following the meeting, we hope to have fully satisfied the fda's questions around me sae and to have approval to resume dosing in patients in the u.s.
now, i'd like to shift to our strategy outside of the u.s. earlier this year we held a pre-application meeting with a national regulatory authority in europe, where we presented detailed safety, efficacy and non-clinical information about gtx-102. the authorities agreed in principle on the expansion of the trial to europe using a proposed modified study design dosing and administration strategy pending review of the application. the application to enroll clinical studies in this country was recently submitted. separately, we also recently submitted an amended dataset and protocol to the canadian authority in order to begin enrolling patients there. this submission is currently being reviewed by health canada.
our modification to the study protocol included an amended administration and dose titration plan. trendelenburg and an artificial csf flush should help reduce the local contact time and help the aso reach the cisterna magna as it is diluted and circulation distributed to the brain. patients will be divided into two starting dose cohorts based on age. those under eight years old will receive a starting dose of 3.3 milligrams while those eight years and older will start at 5 milligrams. titration to higher doses will be evaluated on an individual basis after several repeat doses have been administered. this new dosing plan is within the observed range of clinical and non-clinical activity, but below the doses associated with sae. with this three-pronged approach we feel confident we will be able to resume this important study and share additional clinical data before the end of this year.
turning now to dtx401 our gene therapy for the treatment of glycogen storage disease type 1a or gsd1a. we previously completed the scientific advice process with the european medicines agency and held the end of phase 2 meeting with the fda. following these regulatory discussions, we submitted the study protocol two months ago to the fda. as of this call, the fda has not provided any objections to starting the study. while we await some informal feedback from the agency, we simultaneously are moving forward with steady start-up. as we finalize timing of irb submissions and approvals, we expect the study to be up and running soon, and anticipate dosing the first patients in the early part of the second half of this year.
next, i will turn to dtx301 our gene therapy for the treatment of ornithine transcarbamylase or otc deficiency. at the end of the first quarter, we held a successful end of phase 2 meeting with the fda and together with feedback from ema we now have a finalized phase 3 study design and end points. the study will enroll approximately 50 patients ages 12 years and older. patients will be randomized one-to-one to either dtx301 or placebo. the dose of 1.7 times 10 to the 13 genome copies per kilogram defined by the digital drop assay is the same dose that we study in the third and fourth cohorts of the phase 1/2 study.
for the phase 3 study we will have co-primary endpoints. the first is obtained in 24 hour plasma ammonia levels and the second co-primary is a percentage of patients who achieve a response, which we measure by 50% or more discontinuation or reduction in baseline disease management. we did lengthen the phase 3 duration slightly 48 weeks to 64 weeks to allow more time for patients to be weaned off of their ammonia scavenger medications and protein restricted diets. from our experience with the phase 1/2 study, we know that it can take some time to establish normal ammonia metabolism and to be able to safely reduce baseline treatment.
by moving to 64 weeks, we expect there will be enough time to assure success in the baseline treatment reduction co-primary endpoint and still proceed to development as rapidly as possible. with the finalization of the phase 3 design that incorporates feedback from both fda and ema, we are rapidly moving forward toward initiation of the study in the second half of this year.
lastly, i'd like to touch on data that were recently published in molecular genetics and metabolism that describe the clinical outcomes of 18 pediatric and adult patients with long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders or lc-faod, who were treated with dojolvi or triheptanoin for a median duration of 22 months. in this paper, 18 early access french cases show that triheptanoin reduced the need for medical intervention. patients in this cohort will follow for a range of nine to 228 months. similar to the published dojolvi phase 2 data, the cumulative annual number of days of emergency home care was reduced from a total of 286 days to 51 days during the 12 months on therapy. notably, 13 of these patients required zero days of emergency home care during this time.
other reported clinical improvements include a reduced fatigue and myalgia, and elimination of the need for wheelchair use in five of the six patients who had required it in the year prior to receiving triheptanoin.
with these updates, i will now turn back the call to emil. thank you.
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, camille. after completing four approvals in our first 10 years, we built out our pipeline of ultragenyx in last few years to put us in position to have both a full pipeline of late stage assets and multiple products in launch mode. result varies one of the broadest and most diverse portfolios in the rare disease space.
a clinical pipeline now includes six programs. it is well-balanced across modes, encompassing gene therapies and antibody and antisense oligonucleotide and mrna. it includes smaller rare diseases where we are essentially the only drug development, but also includes more competitive and much larger opportunities. over the long-term, we will continue the strategy of using our insights in relationships and rare disease defined in advance, a diverse set of compelling opportunities. we will focus more to our efforts now on executing on the new studies and data readouts that we have laid out for 2021 and beyond.
now, with that, let's move on to the q&a portion of the call. operator, please provide instructions for asking questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of joseph schwartz from svb leerink. your line is now open.
unidentified participant
[indecipherable] dialing in for joe. thank you for taking our questions. my question is on dtx301 for otc deficiency. typically, you have a co-primary endpoint. it can be analyzed several different ways. usually you have to hit both endpoints, but sometimes you can just hit one of the two or the hurdle can be higher for one over the other endpoint. so i was just wondering if you could discuss the statistics for your phase 3 study.
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
yes. so we are expecting to have hit both endpoints. the ammonia control is easy. but i think the question with the responder and also we think is the clinical meaningfulness of the results. and the clinical maintenance we think is quite dependent on being able to get off of existing therapies. so if we control ammonia, but can't get people up there it doesn't mean much.
but our view would be based on everything we have seen so far that if we control ammonia, maintain the ammonia get it below a certain level, we will be able to reduce our diet and drug. so we feel confident in putting both endpoints forward.
unidentified participant
okay, great. thank you. and then, how are you defining responder. i know that for the in your opening remarks you mentioned 50% plus reduction in the baseline disease management. but i guess i am curious about the ammonia component, are you assuming is there a threshold you have to meet or are you trying to get the patients down to the normal range?
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
now, the ammonia analysis is really a continuous variable reduction in ammonia level. so, it is not a responder determined analysis for ammonia. and since we will let relax the entry criteria from ammonia we have seen very sharp declines in ammonia. we would expect a spread of ammonia levels across a range and we expect that variation to compress among patients are treated. so it's a continuous variable ammonia level. you measure not a responder. in the diet -- in the reduction in care, this issue of threshold you could think of it is if you have 50%, we will say, if you get off your scavenger drugs but not relax your diet. that would be 50% reduction in your care sitting of the scavenger drugs and diet. if you get off both, that's 100%. if you get off one, it's 50%.
and the way the responder analysis will go as will count 50% that is getting off the drug the lung will count as a response for that endpoint and getting up everything will count as a complete responder and it would be 100%. and so we will look at the percent reduction in response in treatment requirement.
unidentified participant
okay, great. thank you so much.
operator
next question comes from the line of gena wang from barclays. your line is now open.
gena wang -- barclays -- analyst
thank you for taking my questions. i have two regarding the angelman. one is for the u.s. and one is for the ex-u.s. for the u.s., since fda didn't ask you for additional animal data and you submitted additional clinical data. just wondering what could hold fda back at your second quarter meeting? and then for the ex-u.s. both europe and canada a pending review, will you be able to start dosing in first half this year? and i think you mentioned that we will have some patient data by the end of this year? can you elaborate a little bit what kind of data will be shared by the end of this year?
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
very good. i will go ahead and answer that. so, on the first part, the angelman. they asked for more data on the individual patients that were treated and had the event mainly to assess their complete reversal and we have done some additional things and showed they are completely reversed. the question is what can hold them up. we think we have given them enough to get forward. so i am not sure what else would hold them up. but i think we are being responsive to their requests and we hope that we will move forward. but i don't have in my head right now what would be the reason not to go ahead. however that said, we also know that sometimes you can't predict what regulatory authorities will do and we have initiated work to also initiate in the study ex-u.s. what we said today is that, one ex-u.s. authority said, agreed with the plan given the knowledge about the serious adverse event and the efficacy and everything, agreed with our plan to move forward the same plan we have submitted to fda. canadian authorities have seen that now, we are waiting for their response.
the timing of those responses from the authorities will determine the timing when we can get going. if they were happened within a shorter period time we could get going, if they take their full period required we may not dose there in the first half. it's hard to know. with the u.s., of course, it's depending on the response we could dose. now, what we have said in the release though is that, given what we know now about the ex-u.s. path, the one way or another we will have some data in some patients this year and that's the point we are making for everyone gena, but you can't precisely say how those although we are going to play out as they undergo three different regulatory authorities are looking at reviews.
gena wang -- barclays -- analyst
okay. and then what kind of data will be shared?
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
well, we are talking about the first patients redosing again at the going through month -- since they are dosing once a month, we would expect to have several months of dosing on a set of patients. at first our plan currently that would reposing is called patients six below age eight or six above. and so we have been looking for some fraction of patients be treated at least a few times. based on our response we have seen before that within one or two more doses we started seeing things. and so we think within the timeframe of three or four doses we would have the opportunity to see if we are seeing the clinical fact and whether we are getting the adverse effect. it wouldn't be definitive information but at least tell you are we dosing is it safe and are we seeing some activity and that's the kind of range will give you a sense of where we are going.
operator
next question comes from the line of tazeen ahmad from bank of america. your line is now open.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. thanks for taking my question. as it relates to angelman and i guess when would you need to start resumption of the study this year in order to meet your targeted goal of having some clinical data available on patients by the end of this calendar year? and as it relates to the safety profile of the drug, is that kind of a make or break situation based on any discussions that you have had with the agency? and the reason i am asking is angelman is an area of undermet need. if you are showing efficacy in these patients, what is the tolerance do you think at the agency and/or physicians would have to -- a safety profile that might not be 100% clean? thank you.
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
sure. so, on the -- when started our expectations we need to get started either late this half or early next half in order to have a few least a few doses of in a number of patients, right, before the end of the year. so we would have to be late this half early next half in order to accumulate enough data. whatever data we -- we are going to say is, whatever data we have we will put out and we will update on that information. however, many patients how work much time, so we will commit to doing that. with regard to the safety profile, we think that having low extremity weakness wouldn't be a good profile to have for a chronic treatment like this. so, well, clearly, we believe we can get past that because it's not a drug pharmacologic effect, it's like a local irritation and inflammation effect which is something should be very manageable. so we are confident we can get past that. and even so if once we know that an aso can have this kind of effect, there are many avenues ahead of us even if this all ago, we had to change it we could we could of course use. so now that we are in this space and we have this ability to change clinical future of an engagement, it's something worth fighting for and we will fight for getting this done with a drug that gives patients an important efficacy and a safety that's appropriate and i don't think having lower extremity weaknesses is acceptable as a long-term safety outcome.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, thank you. and maybe a quick question on wilson. you are expected to start your study in the second half of this year. how big of a study do you plan on this being given that you are describing it as a single protocol phase 1 through phase 3 study?
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
yes. so the wilson phase 3 study is like a phase 1/2 study bolted on to a phase 3 study just to be most accurate. the seamlessness is we don't go back to regulatory authorities between the decision makings all preset. so the way it's going to go as we are doing cohorts in stage 1 cohorts at three different dose levels in sequence. they are randomized with a placebo group and those cohorts will be six and three. so there will be a total of 27 patients in that. the second half of the study is on the order of 60 to 70 patients at this point in time, that's our expectation.

next question comes from the line of yaron werber from cowen. your line is now.
yaron werber -- cowen -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. so i got two questions for you if you don't mind. one is do you have a sense, do you ask -- they want to actually see the weakness recapitulated in animal models for them and to show resolution for them to move forward or is that not one of the things because it's hard to recapitulate that? i am trying to get a sense what would get them comfortable?
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
yes.
yaron werber -- cowen -- analyst
and then, secondly, when you look at the structure, this is a cyclic base a gap, right? so the chemistry is a little different from spinraza and how valid is the chemistry? thank you.
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
well, the fda has not asked us to recreate anything in animals frankly at all and they do not ask us to do any more work. they recognize we have used higher dose in animals and for many repeated doses with very high load and not seen it. so, it's clearly not a toxicity of this all oligo. this oligo is not shown be toxin on non-human primates and so i think that's really important. now, what i else can say with regard to the chemistry is that lnas can have toxicities, but this particular oligo does not have toxicities that we see in the pathology of the non-human primates given repeat doses. so we feel comfortable while the chemistry is being appropriate. i do think the ability of asos to cause irritation or injury is not unknown, it's not new. it's been seen, there's been high protein in the csf in a number of aso programs including the recent hd1. i think the key here is what's the therapeutic index, how much efficacy do you get for the dose and in this case we have -- with this lna extraordinarily potent lna drug that is actually achieving -- beginning to achieve efficacy in the 3 milligram to 10 milligram range. so, a very potent and we think at that range we can avoid those secondary contact necessity issues. i think that's a distinct advantage of the -- based on the true high potency of this particular one.
so, right now we are comfortable with the chemistry. we think it's -- particular choices made were very potent. we are aware of a lot of variations that we have made and others have made. dr. dindot has done some exceptionally high quality work in this field. so we feel good about where we are at. and we are, of course -- we are also looking at making small variations that might change the profile, but we feel pretty good about the successity in efficacy we are seeing and right now the fda is just weighing more confirmation about the clinical situation and have not asked for any other animal data from us.
yaron werber -- cowen -- analyst
with them which is the long-term follow clinically and how do you control the risk mitigation. is that what it is?
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
no. they just want a more definitive proof that the patients didn't have any residual neurological effects. because i think this is a benefit risk question. they are trying to assess if they put more patients at risk. will they have an irreversible harm from that, right? that is fundamental. we have said no; they just wanted further information to confirm that that's true. and we have good reason to believe it's not because we don't think it's a direct neurotoxicity issue. i think it's just neuro inflammation issue. and it resolved -- the majority effect resolved within a few weeks. and so, they just wanted more definitive quantitative measures that help prove that they are reversed. and we have done those measures including mris and more lumbar punctures, as well as special neurophysiological tests and it found the patients are normal.

next question comes from the line of dae gon ha from stifel. your line is now open.
dae gon ha -- stifel -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for taking the question. emil, maybe i will just touch on one more angelman question. so recognizing you have three parallel paths with the ex-u.s. sites, as well as the u.s. i was wondering if you can comment on potential alignment between the three regulatory discussions. i mean do you see a lot of concordance between the three or do you see quite a bit of disparity in terms of what they are requesting? and then second question is more commercial, i was wondering perhaps it's for eric. given that u.s. has been easing up you in your prepared remarks talked about the irregular ordering patterns in latam. but now covid also seems to be somewhat more rampant in the ex-u.s. site. so i was wondering what you guys are currently seeing on that development front? thanks.
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
very good. thanks for the question dae gon. i will let eric in a moment. he can talk about covid around the world. eric, so prepare for that. i will do the first part. so one of the great techniques in rare disease regulatory is to exploit the actual differences between regulatory authorities and find the best answer somewhere in order to move forward. and that is extremely important part of moving very complex diseases forward in the drug development. so it's very often that we will go to another authority in order to get started and to get going and have involved in three programs that did that. in the end all came back to the u.s., all got approved in the u.s. so it's just a normal thing. we don't really look for concordancy. we are proposing ex-u.s. the same study in the same design. we have not had any negative feedback from the other european authority, does not give us any changes to the protocol that we were fundamental. whatever the canadians are seeing are actually in line with what we submitted to our other european. so that's the same and we don't have any further feedback.
with the fda right now we are highly focusing in on the current five patients and reducing them and just getting their understanding about doing that piece. and by limiting the scope we think will give us an opportunity to kind of generate a little bit of a more narrow and safe path for getting started in the u.s. on the existing five patients. so that's our approach right now. so let me hand this off now to erik to talk little about, i think, the question was erik on covid maybe easing up in the u.s., but how is covid affecting south america?
erik harris -- chief commercial officer
yes. a couple of things i will point out. first, when you consider 2020 we put out our guidance in advance of the covid pandemic and we ended up in the upper end. that's because the team did a great job of adapting to the situation and maintaining the same level of engagement with both physicians and patients for virtual and digital means. so we have learned a lot in 2020 and we will continue to leverage those successful tactics as we move into 2021, which is why we have taken into account our abilities to operate in this pandemic environment, as well as the potential for -- high potential for easing of restrictions throughout the year across the globe.
that having been said, no doubt the situation varies region-by-region and in some instances, country-by-country and the latam team has done a great job just as the u.s. team has done in adapting to this situation. so we feel confident that with our projections as we move forward.
dae gon ha -- stifel -- analyst
okay, thanks.
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, erik. we are getting obviously -- we are receiving orders -- we have received orders from brazil despite the pandemic. i know brazil has been hard hit. and there's no doubt it's going to put pressure on the world, including latin america, but patients with these disease are also in severe need and so we are pleased to see some ordering continuing. and i think your team just like in u.s. will do all the work to make sure that plays out right.

next question comes from the line of yigal nochomovitz from citigroup. your line is now open.
yigal nochomovitz -- citigroup -- analyst
hi, emil and team. thank you for taking the questions. could you expand a bit on why you opted for a single seamless protocol for wilson's disease or expanding the phase 1 to phase 2? just curious is there something specific about wilson disease that's better suited to doing a seamless protocol versus separate protocols?
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
well, yes, there are some very distinct differences to wilson. number one, it's been well-studied, well-treated, so they are actually well-established endpoints, which we could define and choose up front. so, urinary copper excretion, which is a measure of how much copper is essentially dumping out in your urine where it's not supposed to be is a relatively good measure whether your copper is being rounded to the correct place. since that's well accepted in wilson, we are able to get agreement with authorities on that as a primary endpoint. so, i think it's the issue the endpoints being defined and studies before it allows us to pick endpoints right up front. secondly, our experience in doing gene therapy of the liver now and two other programs gives us confidence in the dosing range you would like to hit, right? so, we are confident what the dosing range would likely need to be. and then we can hit that range in our phase 1/2 trial and be able to pick three doses confidently.
so, given that experience liver gene therapy ability to pick doses and endpoints that we can get agreement on then the only thing we need to decide with fda is how big this study is and how long they are. and with that, all the decisions required to go from phase 2 to phase 3 are done. we will do the phase 1/2. we will look at the dose data. we will pick the dose and we will begin enrolling phase 3 without having to go back to the authorities will have pre-defined administrative criteria to make those choices. you can't do this kind of thing is a disease that's never been studied with no history of endpoints, right? and where you don't know the dosing response, right? so, it is not something you can do with most programs, but in this case being a bigger disease with a lot of history we have an opportunity to take advantage of that and do something that would be smoother and faster.
yigal nochomovitz -- citigroup -- analyst
that makes a lot of sense. and then i had one other question on the french study that camille described. i was really intrigued by the upper end of the cited range of median follow-up of 228 months because that would imply 19 years of follow-up. so i want to make sure i am understanding that correctly and if so that this study of triheptanoin is actually been running for almost two decades?
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
camille, do you want to answer that?
camille bedrosian -- chief medical officer
yes, sure. thank you. thank you for the question. yes. you are correct. in fact before ultragenyx took on the development program for triheptanoin or dojolvi, the program was being studied by academics for a dozen years or so before that time and even before that. so you are correct. and physicians even then understood the biochemistry and the metabolisms and the potential for triheptanoin.
yigal nochomovitz -- citigroup -- analyst

next question comes from the line of cory kasimov from jpmorgan. your line is now open.
cory kasimov -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hey. good afternoon, guys. thanks for taking the question. two from me as well. first one on dtx301, just wanted to ask again about the rationale of going from 48 to 604 four weeks for the endpoint, so patients can win off of prior therapies. does that -- i am -- i guess, i am curious if that was driven by you or by regulators and if there was anything you saw in the phase 1/2 data that led you to think this additional time could be beneficial? and then i have a follow-up on angelman.
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
well, the debate with the regulators like it has been for a number of programs both not ours at all of them out there is whether you should be studying these diseases for up to two years, right, in phase 3. we didn't feel that was necessary. and so in the discussion of time we were agreeing to add another quarter, another 12 weeks essentially to the plan. if we are now going to include an endpoint, which result, which required the titration or maximal titration of the drugs and diet. what we saw in phase 1/2 is some patients responded a little later like say six months or so, which would leave a little less time, if they responded in the ix weeks to 12 weeks as a few did. then we would have enough time. but if they respond at six months then you are giving them a little less time to titrate their drugs down and die down. you don't want to be doing it precipitously, right? you want to do it steadily and to verify that they are not having problems with their ammonia. so just another few weeks would help us and also manage regulatory desire for a longer study without taking it out two years. we get a little benefit to us in terms of that endpoint and we manage the fda's desire for the length of study.
cory kasimov -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. that makes sense. and then just to go back to angelman for a second, i just want to make sure i understand. when you restart this program, how should we be thinking about the accrual strategy in terms of whether you would enroll one patient, treat them and then watch and wait before enrolling another or will it happen at a faster pace than that?
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
well, there is a staging strategy proposed. there's two younger ones, two older ones that would get a few doses and if they are ok then we enroll the rest of the two cohorts. so there's some staging for two and two and then moving up to what was a total of six and six patients to get through the four doses. so that's a stage a little bit that would slow up the enrollment of the second group. but we would have four patients that we think will reasonable short period of time to get started and then be able to expand that to total of 12. if the 12 was good then we have the option in their protocol to expand -- to include another 40 patients at the dose now that appears to be sufficient to have efficacy and also appears to be safe. so that would give us a lot more data than to learn more about the particular dose that we have hit with our first 12 patients.
cory kasimov -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay, makes sense. very helpful. thank you, emil.

next question comes from the line of maury raycroft from jefferies. your line is now open.
maury raycroft -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, everyone. thanks for taking my questions. first one is on angelman. i think you mentioned on the 4q call that the five angelman patients were losing efficacy benefit after being off treatment. can you confirm if the five patients fully reverted on efficacy and could this loss of benefit factor into your discussion with fda?
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
yes. so, patients have lost a lot of benefit. i think there may have been some that still retaining a little bit of the words that they gained. but it's clearly substantially resolved at this point and reversed. so, yes, it's been a factor in our discussion with agency, because the effects were not subtle. they were life changing. so we hope to make that part of the whole benefit risk assessment question. if we can show them the risk of a reversal change is really not there that it is reversible than i think we can open the door to seeing that patient and losing efficacy is not great. i do think the fda is always first rules about no doing no harm and safety. so, if we can demonstrate that then i think the efficacy story becomes relevant.
maury raycroft -- jefferies -- analyst
got it, that's helpful. and then, one quick one. yes. i think you mentioned potential for an angelman publication from scott dindot's lab and i am just wondering if you have a status update on that?
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
i don't have an immediate update on it. i thought it was submitted. it's a tour de force of research by the way just, so it's one of those special like very large papers. that requires a special journal. so i think it's still in review and i don't have an update at this point in time. but it is truly exciting and i think actually redefines the whole angelman biology a little more clearly, a little more precisely, which is what led into the discovery of the right place to knock down the antisense.

the next question comes from the line joon lee from truist securities. your line is now open.
joon lee -- truist securities -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the progress. for gsdiii why have we decided on mrna as opposed to dna dtx301 and dtx401 and i have a follow-up question.
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
yes. there's a good reason for it. i think gsdiii is a debrancher deficiency. it's a very complex large enzyme, has two activities. it wouldn't fit normally inside an avv vector. it's too large. the second thing that's unique about gsdiii is that you are creating a limit dextran like a little piece of glycogen that's leftover when the enzyme doesn't work. that is actually toxic and you accumulate then every single liver cell. and since gene therapy very often won't hit every single liver cell you will still have the problem if you hit 10% or 15% of the liver. they have a lot of liver that's not detoxified, right? because there's a cytoplasmic enzyme. so the advantage mrna then is twofold, one it conclude a larger protein as we need it here and secondly we have shown a very nice delivery to essentially every parasite and clear it.
the last thing i will note this becomes is that storage toxic effect if you clear the toxic dextran it could take some months to accumulate. so the actual dosing frequency could not be given let say by the loss of the enzyme but the time it takes for toxin accumulation of dextran to occur. and so we think those are some features that make gene therapy challenging, but maybe for mrna maybe a better opportunity and that's why we have gone ahead with mrna for that indication.
joon lee -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. and for gtx-102, angelman, there are several players now following your strategy of stopping the stop. and then roche, i think has a study up and running, and i think they have advanced two additional doses. does that play a factor in fda's decision and what can we learn from that, i'd be curious if what's the latest advance from roche?
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
yes. well, i haven't seen roche put out any information on their trials. i can't really comment on it. i don't think the fda makes a decision between program winners or losers based on early data, that's not their role. their role is to look at your program, should you be treating. if you are asking, well if they have another win, if they can get treated some other way that's safer. if it was an approved treatment, i would say that may be a factor, right? if they have an approved treatment that works very well and yours is not working and causing safety problems, there is a difference. but in this case it's not approved and nor have we heard any efficacy of the drug working. we believe we are in a much more potent area and based on the non-clinical data put out, we think our molecule is much more potent than there. so, if anything i would expect them to have more risk of safety issues than we did. so, we will see what happens, but i don't think it's a factor right now it's all up to us and gtx-102.
joon lee -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. and one more if i can squeeze in -- it seems like so they are all targeting the same gene. but you mentioned something about your drug targeting all the splice isoforms or more thorough suppression of the nk cells that are transcribed. can you -- is that an ip strategy or -- and can you talk to that differentiation between other -- multiple other players in the same thing, but it appears to be the same thing, but maybe a little differently.
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
no. they are targeting -- trying to targeting antisense but they are targeting a different patented region. so, the generics team and scott dindot have patented region near five prime end of the antisense message that is not covered by the roche patent, right? the roche patent is further 3 time downstream, that region is unique and that region for some reason was not included in the roche patent. so it is unique exclusive intellectual property about the use of oligo's within that region the target the antisense. the key value that uniqueness is the fact that it's way more potent and potency is involved in knocking down all the isoforms, which were not fully recognized by everyone, they were -- people think of this as a single antisense message and what scott's work showed. in fact that there's a number of antisense molecules and some of them are spliced. and therefore how you pick your targeting may be in the antisense or it may not be in picking toward the five prime he found a particularly unique potency there and that is patented. so i do think we have intellectual property position on a superior insight in the message.
and honestly that's why we did the deal with genetics. we did the deal because as we told our team it wasn't really wanted to get in a foot race or a muscle match with roche or biogen ionis, those are big players here so play. so the question is, was there a scientific insight that gave us an edge. so, i think, scott dindot had the insight and genetics had the rights to it.

next question is from jeff hung from morgan stanley. your line is now open.
hannah latimer -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, guys. this is hannah on for jeff. what -- for setrusumab, is there a particular profile of oi patients within the pediatric population that you guys think would best respond? and then what do you see is likely the key differences between potential pivotal studies within the pediatrics and adults and perhaps beyond the primary endpoint. thanks.
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
great. all right. right now to answering that question, we really focus on pediatric pivotal study as kind of the core drivers of the application. the pediatric patients have the highest unmet need. they are the core of the driver. what we will do to cover adults may depend a little on what we see there. but the pediatric phase 3 is really our core focus. with regard to the profile, if you look across the data that you have now in adults and peds, you see bone marrow density improvements, potential improvements in both oi type i, type iii and type iv. we know type iiis and type ivs will have more fractures and then type i it is more severe in general. what we will focus on in this study is patients who have a lot of fractures and this is because they have the unmet need and obviously it's part of our rare formula and rules that you have to treat sick people with drugs. and so in this case we will focus on patients who have had more fractures.
bones are more in need of improved strength which is where setrusumab can be very beneficial in terms of enhancing in animal bone activity, increasing bone density but not just any bone density. bone density in the places require increased strength and that the way that bone is directed would allow us and i think to strengthen bone is certainly in animal models allows a mutant college in animal model to achieve their normal strength after setrusumab. so we are anti-sclerostin antibody. so, we are -- we are focused on high fracture patients [phonetic] and demonstrating that bone marrow density and fracture improvement can occur with that core data. we will leverage that to adults for which we already have good data of 90 patients showing it does depend on improvements in bone mineral density in a number of locations in those patients.

hi. good afternoon. thanks for taking my question. i have one on ux701. i am just wondering if you could comment a little bit on who might be appropriate candidate for gene therapies and i guess i asked this in the context of one, your observational study in wilson's disease, if there's any learnings there? but then also astrazeneca and alexion has expanded enrollment in their studies, so just thinking about the impact on your efforts? thanks very much.
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
well, we are -- there's obviously a lot of people in the space, wilson, right now, the alexion, as well as pfizer with that, but there's also a lot of wilson patients. the trial will take more stable patients in the beginning patients, because we haven't established the safety, but we are looking ultimately for patients who have enough significant illness to measure with the disease. and we are not particularly restricting for example the cns or other types of manifestations, but we are accepting people who have seen this manifestation. and after the first stage, we will accept people that have some level of liver injury within their certain bounds. we don't want to take people who are in very severe late stage kind of liver problems, because we don't -- the gene therapy can have an impact on the liver. but those kind of patients is something we want to look at after the study.
so, we -- people who have figured out some measure, but not so sick with the liver, the gene therapy might harm them. and we looked to see both liver manifestations, as well as cns manifestations in some patients have signs of efficacy in the endpoints with evaluating the program.

next question is from salveen richter from goldman sachs. your line is now open.
salveen richter -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. on angelman you mentioned potential variations to the program. it maybe, what are those and what are your updated thoughts on the age factor? and then just the second question in therapy addition, so just give us an update there?
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
okay. so on angelman ex-u.s. there are no previously treated patients who were focused on treating naive patients in the protocols for canada and the other country are basically based on treating naive patients at the low dose in the regimen. in the u.s. we are focusing the program now on retrieving existing patients. if that is ok then with the fda we would move to adding more patients at the point of time when it makes sense. that all the programs we hope would converge at some point on a larger phase 2 cohort. but right now we are focusing u.s. on retreating the five and ex-u.s. and treating naive and then eventually will expand. so that's the difference we are talking about. the age factor is an important one. i think from the beginning of angelman the science and analysis there was a sense that only young patients would respond and there was many people thing that need to be very young patients. that's based on mouse data. but one of the important things is mice are not people. mice live only two years. so humans have to live decades and our brains are just different for that reason. so i wasn't so surprised that our brains have to continue to evolve and improve with our life.
so, we have observed already is the two youngest patients had the most potent effect of the treatment that we saw. they all said the stronger side effect. the older patients took a little longer and had to get a little higher dose before they saw the effect. but they clearly did have an effect including teenagers. so the fact you do a teenager i would say was completely unexpected by many people in fact denied that it would happen and i just believe in human neurology, you need to have an open mind of what can really happen, because honestly one thinks they know, but they don't know. so you got to do the experiments that's why we strongly believe in phase 2 studies that have wider criteria let yourself worn and not prejudge who is going to respond and who won't respond because you will be surprised sometimes. so, we think a wide age range can respond, can adults respond, potentially it might be slower, it might be different, but we think there is room for improvement across a range of angelman patients. we still believe that young patients will probably have a more potent effect than we will see in older patients, but the fact that all respond i think is important.
but finally in duchenne, we are making progress with our partner and we've been making constricts successfully and designed and finalized constricts and are doing the work and creating manufacturing system, which is all going well and so we are on track and we will provide an update later in the year about where we are at on the manufacturing of the new strategy and any other work we will have put together. but so far it's gone very well, very good collaborative teams and the constrict creation has occurred and we are moving forward on our on our vector production.

nicole gabreski -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi, this is nicole gabreski on for chris. thanks for taking the question. so, just one on ux053. i know you are on track to start the study in the second half of this year, but just kind of curious going back to your 2019 r&d day you attend a lot of data around ux053 and we are projecting to file to ind in 2020. i guess can you just talk a little bit about the path for getting ux053 into the clinic. was there something specific that was gating for that program. and i just -- i guess given your comments to-date that you have two other programs in the mrna space under development, are there any learnings that you might be able to apply to these future programs?
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
sure. well, 2020 was a difficult year, obviously. so running a lot of non-clinical things and other things were definitely impaired, our ability to operate were little impaired. and so, the nonclinical pre-ind stage programs were difficult to move ahead at the same pace. we tried to keep our main clinical programs operating, some of the non-clinical ones had to take whatever time they had to take. so, it was kind of normal. there certainly was learning though. one of things we learned is optimizing production of mrna for these longer mrnas we are using for translation like of a very large protein. so, we have been doing a lot of work in optimizing and producing mrnas that are low -- have low immune stimulating capacity and the team has done a dramatic job actually in improving the cost of manufacturing and the scale of manufacturing. and so those are a feature that would help us in our other programs for sure. we have also improved on scaling, making the lnps for this particular lnp, for this particular canin lupid [phonetic] and that information also will be very useful in the other programs. so, i would -- we looked at this first program was putting all the effort into developing it, getting it ready, but to do the second and the third one, i think it's going to be substantially easier given that all our other technology have been figured out. and so we decide to put all our effort on one program at the first, get it approved and get into clinic and then we can open the door on bringing other ones forward.

liisa bayko -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi, just two quick questions. first on angelman, does the fda, excuse me, sorry, if i apologize, if you answer this before i hopped on late, but is fda viewing for any additional clinical data generated from other regions before kind of allowing the process to reinstates here, are you -- is there anything along those lines you should be thinking about?
emil kakkis -- president & chief executive officer
well, first of all, the fda would never say that. it said now we are americans are too precious. go tested on some foreigners and then come back, they would never say -- that's not their view. they are looking us in our view. the reality is this is something that happens because they are being conservative we are moving it elsewhere. as i have said i have been involved in the molecular program, the cln2 and med-svavy [phonetic] which actually started actually ex-u.s. because of various questions that couldn't get answered in a timely way and we went ex-u.s. and then came back to u.s. so it's -- there's nothing there about that. they are not waiting for the others to do it. that may be what happens but they certainly are not and would never ask something like that. they just want to look at what's going on. i really think their issue is irreversibility and reversibility. it's really a big deal. i think they feel like this is a reversal problem then they feel they are taking less risk. but they wouldn't want to to irreversible damage to some kids, right? that's their main issue which we get and we think we have to show them that's not happening.
liisa bayko -- evercore isi -- analyst
all right. that makes sense. thank you. and then on dmd and gene therapy, i think pfizer made an interesting announcement saying that it's taking them a little longer to get their pivotal study up and running due to some i think requirements for additional testing and whatnot. can you maybe just kind of speak to how you see the opportunity for dmd in the context of development as opposed to leading companies sarepta and also pfizer and how that makes you think about your own program and what you need to do and sort of what the opportunity else coming up later to the game, but.

right. well, first i wouldn't consider this a horse race. we are not racing. if it was a horse race it's like a 10 mile course is not your 2 to a mile a quarter. but in that context, we are sea biscuit, right, because they are going to come in at the end. but the truth is all approaches are different. and ultimately, our efficacy and safety will win the day. and for us we think we have some advantages, because we can scale manufacturing which will produce a higher quality product really with the hela platform at a higher dose at a lower cost. that allows us to do a lot more competitive and to produce really a hybrid. i think the quality of product is starting to matter how well full it is with the presence of trace plasmid in it or other things. we get a much higher quality product out of the hela process we believe and that will what i think make the difference.
combined with other things we are planning to do, we think we can achieve potency equal or greater and also scale and costs that will be much improved and therefore come in the long run as a better product profile. i think the pfizer duchenne announcement related to the potency assay, which has been the bane of existence for many gene therapy programs and the fda rightly so is concerned about potency variations in manufacturing runs and wants a very high quality thorough activity based protein potency assay from gene therapy products. in other programs, we have resorted to using in vivo assays for that purpose, while we still further developed in vitro. but we have had to have those assays in place as well for our three programs. in duchenne is tricky because of the nature of the protein improving its activity. and so it's not surprising to see some challenges in developing an activity assay for a structural protein. so well i think it does tell you that the path is rocky but the importance of this treatment can't be underestimated.
so that's why so many people are trying to work and solve it and i think microdystrophin as strategy i think it's real. the data are strong and i am very -- i am very excited to be part of that race because i think we do have some new things to offer and the patients deserve to have every possible path going forward to them as rapidly as possible and not just four year old to seven year old, all the kids with duchenne and not just u.s. patients but elsewhere as well.

good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the second quarter 2021 financial results and corporate update conference call. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. after the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, joshua higa, director of investor relations. thank you. please go ahead.
joshua higa -- director of investor relations and corporate communications
good afternoon, and welcome to the ultragenyx financial results and corporate update conference call for the second quarter 2021. we have issued a press release detailing our financial results, which you can find on our website at ultragenyx.com. i am joshua higa, director of investor relations. joining me on this call are emil kakkis; chief executive officer and president; camille bedrosian; chief medical officer; and erik harris, chief commercial officer. mardi dier, our chief financial officer, had an unavoidable flight delay and is not able to join us on today's call.

i'll now turn the call over to emil.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, josh, and good afternoon, everyone. i want to quickly reflect on our progress mid-year and note that we are approaching a period of significant execution on our clinical programs in the second half of this year. for those who are newer to our story, we're a diversified global commercial rare disease company with three products approved for four indications. we now have one of the broadest clinical portfolios among rare disease companies in terms of modalities and indications, and one of the most prolific late stage pipelines of both gene therapy and rare disease. this is a testament to our ability to identify great signs, do effective deal transactions to drive that work forward in development of our 11 years as a company.
we are now on track to initiate four pivotal clinical trials over the second half of this year. and these include phase 3 studies for two of our gene therapy programs, dtx401 and dtx301 in gsdia and otc, respectively. two, a seamless phase 1/2/3 study for gene therapy target, ux701 in wilson disease. finally, a phase 2/3 pivotal study for ux143 in osteogenesis imperfecta. additionally, we will begin our first mrna therapy, a phase 1/2 study for ux053 in gsdiii. finally, gtx-102 developed by our partner genetx will now be back in the clinic treating angelman patients again.
i'll begin with the angelman program and then i'll summarize our clinical and commercial progress before handing it over to the team to provide more details. we previously announced in may and june that health canada and the uk's mhra approved a modified clinical protocol to begin dosing pediatric patients with angelman syndrome in those regions. these approvals followed review by both regulatory bodies of the clinical data on the first five patients in the us as well as abundant non-clinical data. they agreed with moving forward based on both the promising activities seen at the first lower dose of gtx-102 before any signs of serious adverse event had occurred and the extremely high unmet medical need across the 60,000 patients and their families. we're now working closely with our partner genetx to wrap-up the remaining logistical details to get sites enrolling and dosing patients.
in the us, we continue to make progress in our discussion with the fda for resuming the study. those discussions have been productive and we have received agreement from the agency on a dose administration plan for naive patients. the agency has requested us to bolster the protocol with some specific additional neurological acceptance and documentation to verify the safety of the gtx-102 during study conduct and to manage the study closely. we'll make further simple adjustments to protocol based on those feedback in order to get clearance to resume the study in the us. at this time, the fda has asked us to hold back on retreating the prior treated patients.
as we've noted before, we plan to provide a preliminary data updates from some patients treated with gtx-102, either ex-us or in the us by the end of the year. the amount of data may be limited based on the timing that we expect to treat the first cohorts of patients. overall, we are enthusiastic about the process for treating angelman gtx-102 based on everything we know today. we're looking forward to getting this treatment developed.
shifting to our gene therapy franchise, who has completed all of the known requirements to initiate three pivotal studies in gsdia, with dtx401, otc deficiency with dtx301 and wilson disease with ux701. at the asgct conference in may, we announced positive longer-term data from the dtx401 phase 1/2 study showing a 100% response rate across all nine patients treated and a durable response extending to 2.5 years. similarly, we shared positive long-term data from the dtx301 phase 1/2 study that showed response from all three patients at the phase 3 dose and totaled six of nine responders in the first three cohorts of patients enrolled. these patients maintained or improved their response up to three years following treatment. it seems they're in steady start-up mode for the pivotal studies and we expect them to get going soon.
our proprietary and commercial quality hela manufacturing platform will be the basis for the next generation of ultragenyx gene therapy products, starting with our program for wilson disease and extending to our preclinical programs for duchenne muscular dystrophy and cdkl5 deficiency, a neuro developmental disorder. these latter two preclinical programs represent our first non-liver targeted gene therapies and address much larger patient populations. we will provide updates on these programs later this year.
beyond our gene therapy work, we remain on track to initiate two additional clinical programs this year, one is ux143 or setrusumab, our recent licensed antibody for osteogenesis imperfecta or oi. our partner has already generated promising results in adults with oi showing substantial improvement in bone density. based on our review of the science of both clinical and non-clinical, we are convinced that the enhancement of bone production via the anti-sclerostin mechanism will improve bone mineral density in a productive manner that will improve bone strength in patients with oi by making new bone, right, where bone stresses if needed and be superior than to purely antiresorptive actions, for example, bisphosphonates. this should decrease fracturing, so potentially prevent the deformation of spine and bones that comes with repeated fractures early in life, especially in the patients with type iii or type iv oi.
the clinical study we'll initiate will focus on pediatric and young adult patients that have frequent fractures. we are planning initiation of a phase 2/3 study for this population by the end of the year. the other program is ux053, an mrna program for glycogen storage disease type iii. this first mrna program for our license with arcturus therapeutics is also expected to begin enrolling a phase 1/2 study by year-end.
now turning to our commercial programs. we had another solid quarter with significant revenue increases from q1 in 2020 with progress over the globe. crysvita particularly continues on a strong growth trajectory, even as we enter the fourth year from its initial approval in 2018. this continued uptick is driven by both north america and latin america. in north america, penetration in the adult xlh population is a major driver, in line with our expanded patient id and broader physician outreach efforts. in latin america, our team's efforts in supporting patient reimbursement have helped drive increased volume and revenue, and patients are staying on crysvita once started and compliant with their regimens. that is a testament to how much it helps patients with xlh. we also have a number of multi-generational families on crysvita now and there's nothing better than to get notes from families' comment on how much their lives across generations have changed. crysvita is a paradigm shift in xlh treatment. we're happy to be at the forefront of making this happen.
our strong launch with crysvita has been followed by our successful launch of dojolvi, which has now been on the market for about a year. our team established great momentum, identifying patients, securing reimbursement coverage, facilitating new start forms. this strong start shows how much a new option was needed for lc-faod and tells us that dojolvi will also represent a paradigm shift in the management of lc-faod.
i'll now turn the call over to erik to elaborate on our commercial progress in the quarter.
erik harris -- chief commercial officer and executive vice president
thank you, emil, and good afternoon, everyone. before i get into the details of the commercial performance for the quarter, i'd like to thank all of the teams for their work and dedication during what are still uncertain times. while most states have reopened, the teams have shown an ability to adapt and overcome challenges within this new environment of conducting business.
crysvita had another strong quarter, growing 6% versus the first quarter of 2021 and 38% over the second quarter of 2020. within the north american region, second quarter revenue grew 15% versus the prior quarter as the seasonal reimbursement effects normalized. crysvita revenue in latin america declined quarter-over-quarter, but this is driven by an uneven ordering patterns and is not reflective of the underlying demand. given the strong demand and execution we have seen in the first half of the year, we continue to affirm the 2021 guidance range we previously provided for revenue in ultragenyx territories of $180 million to $190 million.
in the united states, we are continuing to make inroads beyond major endocrinology and metabolic bone centers and into the community clinics where we are finding more and more adult patients. early on in the launch, adults made up 40% of the patients treated with crysvita. today, as the total number of patients on therapy has grown significantly, so too has the portion of adults who have received crysvita. we are now at approximately a 50-50 split between adults and peds on crysvita therapy, mainly driven by the work the team has done in the small harder to reach community clinics. as the teams leverage and expand upon investments that were made over the last year, we are confident we will continue to find more patients with xlh and tio who could benefit from crysvita.
shifting quickly to latin america. we continue to see growing demand for crysvita across this region. as is typical, full reimbursement approvals in latin american countries can take some time, but the base of patients continues to expand as more are granted injunctions and gain access to name patient sales. in colombia, we recently received regulatory approval for treatment of xlh in adult and pediatric patients one year of age and older. patients have been on therapy through name patient programs, but this will significantly streamline the process for patients to receive reimbursed therapy. in brazil, we are in the final stages of negotiating full reimbursement, and in the meantime, continue to receive orders from the ministry of health to support the patients who have been granted an injunction to receive this therapy.
turning now to dojolvi, which was approved for the treatment of long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders or lc-faod by the fda in june 2020 and by health canada in february 2021. recall, there are an estimated 2,000 to 3,500 patients in the us with lc-faod. as of the end of the second quarter, we have received approximately 270 completed start forms. this represents significant penetration into the prevalent patient population at this point of the launch. these start forms have come from more than 130 unique prescribers of dojolvi, with approximately half having written more than one prescription. this has led to approximately 220 patients on reimbursed commercial therapy and continues to speak to the broad interest we are seeing from the physician community and strong support from payers.
as of the end of june 2021, payers are providing broad coverage for patients with lc-faods. the time from completed start forms to reimbursed therapy continues to outpace what we saw at a similar point in the crysvita launch. it is great to see so many patients in the us with lc-faods quickly and successfully navigating their insurance policies. outside of the us, there are a number of patients who have received dojolvi through name patient and early access programs. we are continuing to work with regional regulators to gain full approval to treat all patients who could benefit from dojolvi.
in brazil, we have had positive discussions with the ministry of health and are hopeful about the review process with this agency. looking forward to the second half of the year, the commercial and field teams growth continue leveraging many of the tactics that were developed last year. we have learned how to adapt to this new environment and we'll continue to find more and more patients who could benefit from crysvita, dojolvi and mepsevii.
with that, i'll turn the call back to joshua to share the financial results.
joshua higa -- director of investor relations and corporate communications
thanks, erik. we issued a press release earlier today that included a financial update, which i will briefly summarize. company revenue for the quarter ending june 30, 2021 totaled $87.0 million. crysvita revenue in ultragenyx territories was $44.7 million, including $41.8 million from the north american profit share territory and net product sales of $2.9 million in other regions. total royalty revenue related to the sales of crysvita in the european territory was $4.9 million. as a reminder, ordering patterns in latin america will vary from quarter-to-quarter. in the first quarter 2021, we've received a large stocking order from brazil's ministry of health to support the patient demand in that region. we are confident revenue from this region will continue to grow over-time, driven by strong underlying demand, but ordering patterns will be uneven in the near-term as we work through the reimbursement process.
dojolvi revenue for the quarter was $10.0 million. as we have noted before, we will not be providing revenue guidance for dojolvi in these first quarters of launch. we believe the metrics erik discussed better describes the success we are seeing so far. mepsevii revenue for the second quarter 2021 was $5.4 million. we expect these revenues may modestly increase over-time.
second quarter 2021 revenue also includes $22.0 million related to tech transfer as part of our strategic manufacturing partnership with daiichi sankyo around our hela pcl and hek293 technologies. through the rest of this year, the revenue we recognize will taper significantly as the tech transfer activities come to a close. additional details on this revenue recognition can be found in our annual and quarterly reports filed with the sec.
our total operating expenses for the quarter were $169.8 million, which includes research and development expenses of $113.2 million, sg&a expenses of $53.4 million and cost of sales of $3.1 million. as a reminder, we expect our r&d costs this year to increase versus 2020 as we support three pivotal gene therapy studies, the ux143 phase 1/2 clinical study in oi, the phase 1/2 study for our most advanced mrna program ux053 in gsdiii and a number of other preclinical activities as we get ready to advance the next programs into the clinic. we also expect sg&a to modestly increase in 2021 as we continue to support the expansion and launches of crysvita, dojolvi and mepsevii.
for the quarter ended june 30, 2021, net loss was $122.4 million or $1.81 per share. this compares to a net income in the same period of 2020 of $25.3 million or $0.42 per share basic and $0.41 per share diluted. the net loss for the second quarter 2021 includes a $31 million decrease in the fair value of investments in equity securities as compared to a $95 million gain in q2 '20.
et cash used in operations for the six months ended june 30, 2021 was $224.7 million compared to $7.8 million for the same period in 2020. net cash used in the first half of '21 includes the $50 million upfront payment for the closing of the mereo license and collaboration agreement compared to net cash in the first half of 2020 that included $134.9 million of operating cash received from daiichi sankyo related to collaboration and license agreements. we ended the second quarter with approximately $974 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. this puts us in a strong capital position to reach key clinical and commercial milestones as we continue executing our development and commercial strategies.
i'll now turn the call over to camille.
camille bedrosian -- chief medical officer and executive vice president
thank you, josh, and i too wish everyone a good afternoon. today, i will focus my remarks on providing an update on gtx-102 being developed with our partner genetx for the treatment of angelman syndrome. angelman syndrome is a devastating neurogenetic disorder with a broad spectrum of disease manifestations that affect multiple important domains. last year, we reported surprisingly early positive efficacy data from the first five patients treated in the phase 1/2 study of gtx-102 that indicated substantial improvements in multiple domains in all patients. we also reported all five patients had a grade 1 or 2 serious adverse event of lower extremity weakness that has fully resolved. at the first presentation of the sae, we paused dosing and enrollment in the clinical study. since then, we have run extensive tests to confirm that this sae has been fully resolved in all five patients.
furthermore, we shared extensive clinical and non-clinical data with regulators and have had productive discussions with regulatory agencies, including health canada, the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency or mhra in the uk, and the fda. outside of the us, both regulatory agencies have reviewed our data and have given us the green light to begin treating patients with gtx-102. the agencies agreed with our plan to begin dosing in two parallel cohorts with a modified dose titration and administration plan. one cohort will start at 3.3 milligrams for patients under eight years old and the other at 5.0 milligrams for patients aged eight to 17 years. trendelenburg or a head down tilted positioning of the body and an artificial csf flush should help reduce the local contact time and help the aso reach the cisterna magna as it is diluted and to circulation distributed to the brain. careful titration to higher doses may be evaluated on an individual basis after two repeat doses have been first administered to allow the exploration of a dose that is both substantially effective in at least two domains without causing a safety event. dose escalation is capped at 14 milligrams for a single dose. this new dosing plan is within the observed range of clinical and non-clinical activity, but below doses associated with saes.
in the us, we have had a number of productive discussions with the fda, where we discussed the nature and complete resolution of the sae as well as our plan to resume dosing patients in the united states. following a type a meeting, we submitted a protocol amendment. based on feedback we received on this amendment, we believe we have agreement with the agency on a dose and dose administration strategy to treat naive patients. the agency asked that a few specific additional neurological assessments be added to the protocol before we resume dosing in the us. we will make these changes and look forward to resuming the treatment of patients with angelman syndrome in the us. we and the genetx team have received numerous inquiries from families looking to enroll their children in the study. the data generated will confirm we can safely dose patients with gtx-102 and will inform the loading and maintenance dose regimens as we move to the next phase of development.
with this update, i will now turn back the call to emil. thank you.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
thank you, camille. before we close out, i'll provide a quick reminder of the key upcoming milestones for ultragenyx.
for gtx-102 in angelman syndrome, we will dose patient in canada later this quarter and provide some preliminary data by the end of the year. we also expect to resume the study in us adapted to the fda's request. for our three pivotal gene therapy studies, dtx401, dtx301 and ux701, all the products have been manufactured and released for use in the studies, the sites around the globe identified and patient finding efforts are underway. the final operational tasks are completed before we can begin dosing patients. for ux143 in osteogenesis imperfecta, we reached agreement with the fda on a final pivotal study in pediatric and adult patient to initiate that study by year-end. for ux053 in gsdiii, we tend to move our first mrna therapy into the clinic with a phase 1/2 study.
as you can see, we are executing on all fronts with early and late stage clinical trials in various disease areas and therapeutic modes as well as in commercial. this will set up for multiple important clinical readouts over the coming 12 months as well as pivotal study data from at least four programs over the next couple of years.
with that, let's move on to your questions. operator, please provide the q&a instructions.
",":
operator
definitely. [operator instructions] your first question is from maury raycroft with jefferies. your line is open.
maury raycroft -- jefferies llc -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my questions. so i was wondering if you can elaborate on what the additional neuro assessments are that fda is asking you to use for angelman and can you book and how many patients and how much follow up you could have to report later this year?
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
sure. well, we've agreed on what the assessments are the sort of they want, how we're documenting with the training of the person is, who it is. they just want like a little more of logistical detail, but these are just really careful neuro exams. and we're doing some deliberate electrophysiology, and we'll also have -- will the imaging when necessary. they also want us just to be certain of what triggers what kind of action on our part, what you do when you find things. so it's a little what i'd call logistical management detail. but i think fundamentally, we have the big pieces put together, it's why we're confident we'll get that figured out. it's unfortunate it's taking time to do this, but i think we're finally there.
now on the how many patients, it depends a little bit of how many patients get treated in the uk, and in canada. the sites already have patients inquiring, they've gone through some of the ethics committee. so it's a little bit more of the last logistical steps. we said before, we would expect to have a few patients treated through a few doses, that we would by the end of the year. the exact number, i think it's hard for us to say, but we'll have some data on a few patients. and we should probably have most of the patients in the first two cohorts, at least receive one dose by the end of the year.
so we'll put out whatever we do have, but it will be limited. it won't be an extensive amount of data. but we do believe it'll give us least a sense of are we moving in the right direction with the program. our confidence is that if we give patients for three or four low doses that load them and they will begin seeing these the clinical effects we saw before, so without having the adverse events, so we'll get start to get a read on that before the end of the year.
maury raycroft -- jefferies llc -- analyst
great. okay. thanks for taking my questions.
operator
the next question is from tazeen ahmad with bank of america. your line is open.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. thanks so much for taking my questions. emil, another one on angelman, if i may. so you made in your prepared remarks the comment that the agency has asked you not to start redosing the previous patients. is that pending approval for what you're going to do for protocol for the new patients that you would add or is that something that would have to be separately discussed? and then i have a follow up?
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. i think their view right now is that we don't have perfect knowledge of what the reaction will from and so they'd want us to get patients treated that haven't seen higher doses and just see if it's safe to do and that works and then we could rediscuss what to do with retreating patients. but we don't have perfect knowledge what the mechanism is. what we have said and we believe the data we have suggests it's a local chemical irritation type effect, because there's no cellular response, there's no antibody response, it's really kind of a local contact thing. but we don't have perfect knowledge of mechanism. so it's mainly about going into naive patients' lower dose. that way we know it's nothing about the history of exposure, we're now dealing with the low dose alone and can look at it in a clean way. after that, we'll certainly have to get back to retreating the same patients we saw before. but we don't think this changes our overall timeline of what we do. i think we can get the data that we need. it just really is tough for those patients who were so excited and want to get retreated. for them, they have to wait more time is disappointing for them, but it won't affect the overall program. but we do feel for them. we're going to work in getting them treated as soon as we can.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. and then as a follow up, is it safe to say that the fda is asking for additional information relative to what the uk and canada asked for? and if that's the case, what's prompting that?
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
well, the actual method we're using in canada and in uk regarding evaluations and safety monitoring is actually the same. it's the same. it's a question of how much details we provide them, do we have a checklist form, is there some other let's say, operational structure and verification of training, etc. they sort of want more detailed rigor around the same things that we're doing there and doing here. so it's not like they're making us do extra things, really. it's really the same safety assessments. so i think they're just being very conservative. and they want great assurance that we're going to be careful about what we do, but of course, we will. but i think you can be careful by having really great neurologists whose insights to take care of patients carefully. and then the question is how much documentation makes that better or not. and i think you can do it. if you have great people, they'll do a good job. so that's the difference.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
your next question is from gena wang with barclays. your line is open.
gena wang -- barclays -- analyst
thank you. i have one question regarding angelman clinical endpoints. some doctor feedback suggests cgi has some limitations and rely too much on parents' feedback. what other measurements you would include for the phase 1/2 such as baileys or violin, that's what doctors recommended?
and then quickly another question regarding dmd. just wondering, are you on track for the r&d filing second half this year?
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
did you say dmd?
gena wang -- barclays -- analyst
yeah. dmd gene therapy.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
all right. well, we'll follow up with that. all right. so on the cgi or the patient feedback story, whatever they're telling you, they're not quite giving you the complete story because our evaluations in the trial what genetx has been doing involve -- well, there's a caregiver part, but there's also psychologists administer tests, like the bailey's were administered by people. and then we have other ones that the investigator measures and does themselves, by physically watching the patient do things not dependent on the patient. so we have really three different parties reporting the data in the data that we've already shown you. all right. that's all complimentary and supportive.
in addition to that, we have objective measures like the delta power, eeg measures, right, or the active mayo, which showed other things. so there's a number of different things that i would say are independent. cgi from the physician, by the way, depends also what he sees the patient do. but i appreciate their point, i think we would want to make sure and this is why we read out data on these multiple methods to make sure we have confirmation by independent observers and not be swayed by just a family's view.
i know also for a fact that our pi at chicago saw videos of the patients doing things that the parents had said they had done, so they actually were shooting videos of their kids, because they're so excited about them speaking words and other things. so she also saw video evidence of what they were doing rather than just patient report, just to be clear, like objective video evidence of things. so we're confident that the things we're seeing are real and are meaningful.
now let's talk about duchenne muscular dystrophy. what we said is we're going to update the street about where we're at on the program. we're not filing ind by this year. we've never said that. what we said this year is we're focused on creating a large scale commercial manufacturing system using our hela system, and that we would put out information about that production system. it's going very well, our expectation is to be able to put out data on a large scale methodology using our hela 3.0 technology later in the year on duchenne and update you on our non-clinical program. at that point in time, we would lay out potentially the timeline to an ind, but it's not the end of this year.
gena wang -- barclays -- analyst
okay. thank you.

brendan smith -- cowen & co. -- analyst
hi, this is brendan on for yaron. congrats on the progress. thanks for taking the questions. just a quick one from us. i guess, to keep on the same line in angelman, was kind of just hoping to see if you could maybe give us a little bit more color on the timing for the uk study. i know you said it seems like canada is pretty close to the first doses. just wanted to see what's left for maybe getting drug in some patients in the uk and if we might get any of those in the year-end data. and then just wanted to see also if -- you mentioned that you settled on a dosing scheme administration with fda. wanted to kind of see if you can tell us if it's the same structure you're using in the uk, in canada or if you're thinking about a different design for that. thanks.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
okay. so the uk is on track. i mean, it could be uk or canada in terms of who treats comparisons within weeks of each other. so it won't be that much different. we would expect to have some uk patients treated. there is a great deal of enthusiasm from the uk patient community getting enrolled. so once the sites open, we expect them to be able to enroll. and remember that study will have two patients below, two upon eight first treated if and then a couple of doses and then the additional patients will get treated, all right, till they're six and six treated. so that's -- we would expect some uk patients then.
now you're asking about the us protocol. us asked protocol will also have monthly dosing, it will have different dose, but the methodology will be simpler in the us, in fact, not identical to what the uk and canada is doing because the fda has made specific requests. we have understanding with them about the dose and administration strategy that we're going to use in the us, but it is a little bit different. it is monthly dosing similarly, but the method so far will be a little bit different based on fda's input.

your next question is from joon lee with truist securities. your line is open.
joon lee -- truist securities -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking our questions and for the updates. i have a question on ux053 for gsdiii. i'm very interested to hear your views on the use of modified versus unmodified mrna, given the precedents set by moderna, biontech and curevac. curious if the signal is some potential headwinds for 053, given arcturus uses the unmodified mrna and some kols seem to think that uridine might have contributed to the data for curevac and they also point out to double-stranded rna as a potential trigger of innate immunity. and so curious what your views on that -- are on that and sort of what kind of biomarkers are you hoping to collect in this initial data to assuage any concerns there. thank you.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. so we think the issue of the innate immunity stimulation of mrna is very important and we actually do several things to design, we design the mrnas very carefully to assure that they don't induce innate immunity response and we actually use peripheral blood mono -- white cells for patients to actually test our mrnas to determine they're not having significant amounts of double-stranded in how we purify and prepare them. we have used modified nucleotides, we're using mrnas, so we just have to make sure that they're translated efficiently. we haven't disclosed all the details of that, but we know our mrna is not stimulating human white cells, which we think gives us a handle on that particular issue and we know that the expression is as substantial in terms of how much enzyme can be made from the mrna product.
so the whole issue with regard to the covid vaccines i think are more complex than just the mrnas, frankly. so i think there's a lot of other aspects, like the lnp themselves, which can't -- lipids being used etc. those are factors that matter. the chemical that we're using is a novel one that arcturus developed, that is metabolizable and 99% cleared within a couple of weeks from the body unlike some of the other lipids. so it's a very appropriate one, it releases early and this is what gives us better expression. so we think the lnp is a factor too in how this works, but the mrna quality, we do a lot of work in optimizing how we prepare, purify and use of modified nucleotides as needed.

your next question is from salveen richter with goldman sachs. your line is open.
elizabeth webster -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. good afternoon, and thank you for taking our question. this is elizabeth on for salveen. a question on the angelman's program. so i know previously you've sort of discussed expanding the program to include other genetic types outside of the most severe deletion-based patients. just wondering, how this would work in terms of the trials in progress or if it's more of a future consideration?
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
we definitely think the other genetic types deserve to be treated and we think the aso, if it works in the deletion type, it will work in the other types based on the mechanistic understanding. our plan right now is to focus on the 77 patients that have deletions for the program we're conducting. however, we would probably put in place a second study to look at other genetic types. the reason to focus the main pivotal study on the deletion type is because they are more severe. and therefore, any improvement you've seen in language, in communication, which is one of the main things that patients are most interested in would be clearer if we have a mixture of patients who have varying degrees of communication skills and words, etc, it would just create difficulty in a pivotal randomized study. so we'll focus on those, but we are not going to forget the other types. we've put some program in place to deal with the other types as well, but creating heterogeneity in the main body of a big study is one of the ways you can create trouble for something that's doing great. so, we wouldn't do that.

your next question is from joseph schwartz with svb leerink. your line is open.
joseph schwartz -- svb leerink -- analyst
all right, thanks very much. we noticed -- a couple of questions on crysvita. first, we noticed that the label was updated in europe to allow patients to self-administer therapy. and we're wondering, what impact do you expect this to have, if any? and do you think we could see a similar change take place in the us at any point in the foreseeable future?
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
thank you, joe. in the us right now, we actually have temporary authorization from the fda to allow self-administration, which is going on already because of the pandemic. we haven't submitted to change that at this point. we have done the human factor study. the drug administration is very similar to what you might do for any other subcutaneous drug, there's nothing very special about the injections or problems. so certainly, it could be added. it has complexity though in the us because we have to deal with the different systems whether it becomes a medical product, a hospital product or a home product or not a part b product. so there's some complexities in the us at this point in time, but patients are already doing self-administration. and i think in the long run, we would certainly move in that direction.
we haven't had a big compliance issue. and i think one of the things important joseph is to know that we supported right upfront and do include in the cost of drug getting a home nurse that comes to your home and inject you. so 85%-plus of patients are getting their stuff at home already. right? so the benefit of self-administration is that you don't have someone show up at your house. on the plus side, there's a lot more confidence that you're going to get your injection on time since it's an appointment. but we want to make sure it's as convenient as possible because it is a lifelong treatment. so we'll look at self-administration in the long run, but so far the home nurses are working well and some of the patients are getting it -- are doing it for now on a temporary authorization.
joseph schwartz -- svb leerink -- analyst
okay, that's helpful color. thanks. and then has the need for brazilian patients to use the legal system to gain access to crysvita been holding back adoption there to an appreciable degree? can you quantify the impact you'd expect to see on crysvita brazil sales from potential anvisa approval?
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
well, we have the approval and we are getting injunctions and ministry of health orders, that's the lumpy ordering pattern we're seeing, but it is -- we are getting orders. now, it's growing over-time. what we're talking about today is getting formal approval of the organization within brazil that actually determines government reimbursement. with that, it would help get more regular reimbursement for brazil. so that is near the final stages. and once that's complete, we would expect that would help boost brazil further. so we wouldn't have as much of the logistical challenges of what you're doing with the injunction approach.
does that answer your question?
joseph schwartz -- svb leerink -- analyst
yeah, it's helpful. i was just wondering, is there any way to quantify how much the current system has been holding back sales or how much could you get a boost from --
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
i don't know -- yeah. let me -- erik, do you think there is something -- color on that, i don't have any sense for what that would be. i know we have a lot of patients who want to get on drug, so it's definitely holding back something. erik, do you have any sense for how many patients are in demand, i mean, a rough sense and how many actually navigated the process?
erik harris -- chief commercial officer and executive vice president
[speech overlap] we've done a good job of identifying patients and many of those patients have sought injunctions and as stated many have received injunctions and are receiving reimbursed therapy. i would say to the magnitude of about two to three-fold patients that have been identified and are seeking reimbursement versus that have received injunction. so there is some upside once we receive formal reimbursement. and one thing i do want to point out, just to piggyback on what emil stated is that in the first quarter, we did receive a positive opinion supporting reimbursement in brazil. we're just working through that final stage, which is establishing clinical guidelines, which is the next step in the approval process and we expect to complete that sometime in the new year.

your next question is from cory kasimov with jpmorgan. your line is open.
cory kasimov -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hey, good afternoon guys. thanks for taking the question. on angelman, had the fda conveyed this concern before about retreatment because it seemed like that was the plan for the go-forward strategy in the us until very recently? i guess, just wondering, if there is something new that triggered this change in direction?
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
well, we had our type a meeting with them and it was pretty clear that they were just concerned of the patients that had a reaction might be more sensitized to have it again. and therefore, they'd have trouble determining if the safety would have been different had they have a patient who never had the reaction as opposed to one that did. does that make sense?
so in terms of understanding what's going on, they felt it's safer to start with the naive patient and they want us to hold back on that. there is no new data that help change their mind. we have no new data. regarding things that might cause them to have a more severe reaction, we think based on everything we have that they don't have something that we think would have occurred that way, but we can't prove the mechanism exactly. right? and so, without that proof, the agency wants to play it safe with regard to who they expose in the beginning. so that's the story. there isn't anything new that came out, for example, that would have made that new change. it's just something they finally disclosed to us at the type a meeting.
cory kasimov -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay, makes sense. and then i just wanted to try to clear up the dosing you're expecting to use in the us. you said it's going to be different than canada and the uk. is it that you're going to start with lower doses and work your way up or would it be higher doses here given you've treated some patients?
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
no, we're going to start a little bit lower. we think that it's still in a range that will load the patients sufficiently over four doses to get a treatment effect, but i think the fda wants to be more cautious. and so --
cory kasimov -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
we went along with what you have to do to get going.
cory kasimov -- jpmorgan -- analyst

your next question is from yigal nochomovitz with citi. your line is open.
carly kenselaar -- citi -- analyst
hi. this is carly on for yigal. thanks for taking our questions. we had a couple on wilson disease. as far as the target patient profile for the phase 1/2/3 trial, will you be focused on recruiting patients with established disease or is the focused on treating newly diagnosed patients? just curious if you think there could be an advantage in terms of the magnitude of benefit with ux701 if you're able to capture patients earlier versus later in the course of the disease.
and then secondly, what is your expectation at this point for when we could potentially see some initial data for this program from the dose escalation part of the study? thank you.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
yes, thank you. so the patients will be patients who've been -- or established patients who've already had a chelator -- on a chelator. the problem with doing naive is it'd be very few patients and it would greatly slow enrollment, it would take a long time. i don't disagree with the thesis that treating patients early before they've changed would allow a cleaner result, but we do believe that since the chelators removed copper by bringing it into the urine and what we're doing will bring copper into the bile that we'll be able to look at urinary copper and show that the copper is no longer ending up in the urine, oozing out of the liver or being chelated, it's going to be routed into the bile, right. does that make sense? so even though they're on drug, we can determine if the copper pathway is changing in the body and if ceruloplasmin has gone up. so it won't really matter if they are on established or not, we can see the difference happening. and the truth is there's so many more patients on established therapy, it would be -- it would take us a long time to do it the other way. in the long run though using naive patients i think would give you a cleaner result. i think taking patients earlier in their course might change people's view what's happening. everyone believes it's just excess copper, but it's also possible that it's copper not being properly distributed as well that's part of the symptomatic problems that you're seeing in wilson. and we think the gene therapy can fix both. so that's our focus based on the ability to conduct the study and the way we can measure them.
now, with regard to when data -- we expect to be able to get the patients enrolled in the dosing relatively quickly. i can't say specifically when that data will come out, but we will put out data, it could be by the end of 2022, but i'm not 100% certain. it depends a little bit on delta virus, sites, execution, but we're up and running, product is ready, sites are getting set up and we have, i think, a very convenient protocol that will be easy on patients. so i think it will help make recruiting easier.

your next question is from laura chico with wedbush. your line is open.
laura chico -- wedbush.securities -- analyst
thanks very much for taking my question. just on angelman, you've commented in the past on the potential potency differences between gtx-102 and the roche program, then there is also another program starting from biogen. i'm wondering, if we could just take a step back and how do you think about the key elements of differentiation in a clinical setting for all these aso targeted strategies? are there logical points in which two agents might differ? if this is still kind of evolving, i guess, what kind of aspects should we be focusing on as the clinical trials get underway here?
and then just one quick follow-up. with respect to the dosing in angelman patients in the uk and canada, i think in the past you've spoken about getting them through the titration, getting up to a steady-state level. it isn't clear to me how many patients are actually going to be at that range and especially if we're going to be needing more like three or four doses. i guess, i'm just trying to understand how you think the response data might differ this time around versus the prior experience. thanks.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
okay. so, on the competition, we know the mechanism for this oligo is special. the region is -- the patented region is different, it's at the five prime end. i think dr. rinto [phonetic] has shown that it's far more potent than antisense oligos from other parts of the message in terms of knocking down the production of the antisense message and level of induction. i think each aso could have varying levels of potency and penetration, but i think you want to have high potency across the brain and you want to bring the mrna down -- i mean, the antisense rna down far enough to get significant induction of the message. and we've shown that we can do that with a relatively small amount of drug, and that effect goes across the whole brain to all regions.
so i think the difficulty will be how well the oligos are distributing and how well are they able to knock down. and because all asos have toxicities, it's very common, you've seen them in a lot of programs. they're drugs that have a lot of potential challenges, the potency will then becoming a question of therapeutic window. i do believe if we're able to successfully dose in the single-digit range -- single-digit, low-double digit and achieve the efficacy we saw, that will greatly reduce the possibility of having systemic aso side-effects that you sometimes see or other neurological effects. so certainly that's our expectation.
so on the type dosing and titration story, in the first set of patients, right, we're treating two in each group and then we're going to add four and four, so it will be 12 patients total, right. we'll have 12 patients. and from the 12, we'll get a read on where do they seem to be getting the efficacy and what dose are they at. once we get that information, we're going to try to look at it and try to make sense of how is the optimum way to dose going forward. but we've said before, once -- if we see safety and we're getting good efficacy, we'll take that information and translate it into a dose that we'll use in an expanded cohort of say 30 or 40 patients. those patients would get a starting dose based on the dose achieved during the titration and use that as their starting dose. does that help you? and the idea is that those 30 to 40 would now have a little more standardized dosing regimen. right?
does that makes sense?
laura chico -- wedbush.securities -- analyst
yeah.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
titrate individuals learn a little bit and then standardize it in the next group.
laura chico -- wedbush.securities -- analyst

your next question is from dae gon ha with stifel. your line is open.
dae gon ha -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. good afternoon, and thanks for squeezing me in. and congrats on all the progress. maybe one question on angelman and then quick one on dtx401, emil. so on angelman, a lot of my questions have been answered, but just curious on clinical trials, you have one site in canada, one site in the uk. but just going back to the variability issue, will you have a centralized reading for the cgi to make sure that there is a confident vote in terms of the cgi benefit as well as some of the other benefits that are included?
and then on dtx401, just curious given that one of your endpoints measures the glucose control using cgms. i was wondering, if the protocol entails any backups in case cgm starts malfunctioning or any validations for any significant variability that might occur during that study? thank you.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
sure. so, there's really no way to do a cgi centrally because it's an opinion of the physician there and not everything they are doing in terms of valuing the patient could be centralized, turned into a video. the sites will be trained on the various endpoints. cgi, there is a global one and then there's individual ones for individual domains, which has specific questions that they answer and we'll try to -- we will do our best with our team to train -- the cgi team to train the sites to be able to do these tests. we also have a number of tests that are not cgi, right that have basic scoring mechanisms and are being administered by professionally trained psychologists, for example, as well as some other objective measures.
so we won't be relying on cgi to make all the calls. i think cgi will give you a gestalt feeling of what the pi thinks. but as we noted when we presented this data before, you want to look at the other endpoints to show there is an underpinning, right. if having cgi without any underpinning, then the rest of the data would be suspicious, right, that someone's just wishful thinking hoping they're better. but if they're really better, there should be something else happening. so we feel confident we can manage the question of objectivity by using the supporting data.
now with regard to dtx401, cgm controls, we will have them continuously monitored, we're actually going to take windows of sample time and do the calculations for how they're doing. so if for example, they had a probe and the probe fell off and stopped working, we would see the defect. we could take the period of time when they sampled, right, effectively and calibrate it. and so, they're going to put them on, calibrate, measure for a period and we'll use these sample periods. does that makes sense? because if you expect to be able to use all the data continuously for months and months, right, yes, stuff is going to happen during that period, but we'll have periods of assessment that are in intervals of time we're going to watch it more carefully, more closely and we'll take windows of sampling that will be -- or is verified as operating correctly, calibrated correctly and receiving. so that should help protect us against the kind of digital disaster you're talking about and we've been thinking about that too.
i would also point out the devices collect locally and then they collect in the cloud too. so it's actually double-collected. if anything, we could actually ship the device and do it, but that doesn't stop a patient from having a probe malfunction or something, right? so you have to include all levels of the problem, not just digitally, but on the physical parts connected to the patient, which are probably the bigger source of questions. but we've had good experience so far. we're getting a lot of good data from the patients, so we feel pretty comfortable we can get this to work without having a lot of trouble.
very good. next question?

okay. your next question is from liisa bayko with evercore isi. your line is open.
liisa bayko -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi, emil. thanks for taking the question. just to clarify, so in the us -- or just back to angelman program, even though you're starting lower, can you still escalate up to the 14 milligram level?
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
we'll start lower and see how we do and then we'll treat several doses at a lower dose, which as i said should still give us enough drug to show an effect. and then if we'd established safety there, we have safety elsewhere, we'll then apply to the fda to kind of titrate them up, but we're kind of taking baby steps forward on the us, get them tested, get some data and get comfort. but whatever happens in the us will not control the future, we will have uk and us sites, more than one site doing -- with all that data together, we'll come against -- come up with a plan. i think the agency is being very conservative, it's fairly typical for them and we're just working our way to get going, but i don't think it's going to affect anything, it just may -- it will delay our ability to titrate those patients, but we will still have enough drug on board to know that it's safe and to know that it is doing something for them.
liisa bayko -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay. i see. okay, thank you. that's helpful. and -- so, there is no -- the max dose is basically not determined or is there a -- because you can kind of set it at 14 for the other?
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
for ex-us, we agreed at 14 based on the other authorities, 14 is the max. but in the us, we haven't set a max because we're not titrating and we're starting at a low dose. we're going to repeat that multiple times and the fda has agreed to that. so i'll get it started and start getting some data.
liisa bayko -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay. and then last thing is just on, your gene therapy programs, just you want an otc. i know your endpoints are 48 and 64 weeks. do you need a greater safety databases, i'm just thinking back to biomarin or to file or is -- and kind of longer-term efficacy or can you really file on that, when you reach a primary endpoint sufficient to file? thanks.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. it's good question. i think the key thing here is that, we will have 12 patients from the earlier cohorts, in both program that have been exposed, that will give us some sense of durability. now so far it looks durable. i think the challenge biomarin has, they had some decline activity and the fda was trying to understand the direction. our disease are much smaller than hemophilia. and our hemophilia has 100,000 patients in it. our diseases have 8,000 to 10,000 patients, one-tenth. so the size of our trial compared to the population size have actually substantially more, right. so we're taking a bigger sample. in addition, the safety patient trial and the 12 patient, phase 1/2, it's very likely we might add some additional patients that we treated for example different ages or other situations that we would add to the package. but right now we believe these numbers are fine. and frankly we have not had any regulatory debate, the size of studies with us. and remember the 50 randomized, the other 25 will get treated too, right. so it is all crossovers, you will have 50 patients treated now -- 62 patients treated. it's pretty a normal safety set or rare disease products, that's not unusual one for gene therapy, i think it's good.
liisa bayko -- evercore isi -- analyst

jeffrey hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. most of mine were already asked. so you recently indicated that patient identification because delta had come back to pre-pandemic levels. any additional update on that level since then, particularly given the delta variant and recent increase in covid? thanks.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
yeah, it seems to be going still pretty well. i think it's just the people who have adapted to the new world, and so we're still doing a lot of virtual work, and people are responding and getting things done. so i don't know that we've seen anything from delta, and i'm not sure if erik or camille have something to say about patient id and delta at this point.
erik harris -- chief commercial officer and executive vice president
only thing i would add is that, the patient identification has been pretty consistent in the last couple of quarters. and the other good thing to add about that is that we're finding more adult patients than pediatric patients and thus far have not seen any impact from the delta variant, but it's very early.
camille bedrosian -- chief medical officer and executive vice president
right. this is camille. i would agree with that. and to emil's point, the teams have been working virtually quite a bit, as well as understanding more about the multi-generational aspects of the disease and finding patients in that way as well.

the next question is from joel beatty with baird. your line is open.
joel beatty -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking the question. for angelman, what gives you confidence that the changes you're making in dose administration will help reduce or avoid the lower extremity weakness? and part of the reason i ask is that since it wasn't seen in preclinical studies that may make it more difficult to test for?
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
certainly. but i think there's two things i would say, joe. is that, based on non-clinical studies we know the therapeutic window actually goes pretty low. so we know that in the single-digit range, we would see efficacy based on what we're seeing in the animals. so it gives us confidence that we could stay low and still get the potency, right, that is the therapeutic effect we would expect. what we know so far is among the patients that got the lower doses early in the course and there is only a few patients right, they didn't seem to have the problem at all. and in fact they're lower extremities we're improving prior to the event. so not only were they not having an adverse effect, their actually lower extremity function was actually one of the first things that people were talking about that they weren't falling down, they walk uphill, they're walking on grass and are not falling down, these kids fall down a lot. so when they start falling down parents notice right, because it's kind of normal for them.
so we think that those early dose we're seeing an improvement even before the effects. so i think that's why we're pretty confident that lower extremity effects are not happening at lower doses, because they wouldn't be getting better if you're having a safety event at the lower doses. so the combination of those two feature things put us in position to believe that lower doses will get the safety and the appropriate administration and we believe the trendelenburg flush approach, we're taking ex-us, will optimize the delivery of drug and make sure it's not sitting down at a high concentration locally, causing the chemical effect.
joel beatty -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst

and your last question is from joon lee with truist securities. your line is open.
joon lee -- truist securities -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking the follow-up question. so just to clarify, emil, you said that you saw no antibodies or cells, implying that it's unlikely to be adapted, it means reaction which sort of switches fda's concern on redosing, but have you rolled out the formation of any -- like tertiary structures or like self-complementary of their gtx-102 that mature in 18-year responses, because just curious what source of that you may be worried about? so, thank you.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. thank you. and from everything we evaluate, the only thing we're seeing is like localized inflammation. there is nothing systemic. so any structured thing you're talking about wouldn't necessarily just become a localized phenomenon, right, it should've been a systemic because the drug gets absorbed, we can prove it to you, it's absorbed in the circulation with significant concentrations and it's going -- it will -- from the animal studies, we know it will end up in the kidney and everywhere. so why would you have such a highly localized effect, if you're really having this fundamental problem. so i really don't think there's anything about it that fits to that story. and we've done a lot of work on the innate immunity and otherwise.
joon lee -- truist securities -- analyst
actually, i agree with you, because you don't see any effect in the brain itself, it's just local. so it's not like you see it wherever the antisense oligo goes.
emil d. kakkis -- chief executive officer and president
right. you don't only see it, where the first place is applied. so it's why it's very concentration dependent. if it was a nucleotide targeting thing, which we -- by the way they did some detailed work on, showed it does not. but if it were, it should be happening wherever the drug is. it doesn't -- it is highly localized to just below t12 to l5, that area, not even up the cord, where you know the drug went there, so it's right, it wouldn't -- you wouldn't see such a weird localized phenomena. i think that's why i think -- if you look at a lot of the data the asos cause a non-specific toxicity thing, that's what this looks like to me. and is concentration dependent, which need to stay below the threshold and we'll get it, the specialty part is very potent, we just need to keep the other part managed.
joon lee -- truist securities -- analyst

thank you for standing by, and welcome to the third quarter 2021 financial results and corporate update [operator instructions] thank you.
i would now like to hand the conference over to joshua higa. please go ahead.
joshua higa -- investors and media
good afternoon, and welcome to the ultragenyx financial results and corporate update conference call for the third quarter 2021. we have issued a press release detailing our financial results, which you can find on our website at ultragenyx.com. i am joshua higa, director of investor relations. joining me on this call are emil kakkis, chief executive officer and president; camille bedrosian, chief medical officer; erik harris, chief commercial officer; and mardi dier, chief financial officer. i would like to remind investors that this call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, including but not limited to, the types of statements identified as forward-looking in our 2020 annual report on form 10-k that was filed on february 12, 2021. our quarterly report on form 10-q that will be filed soon. and our subsequent periodic reports filed with the sec, which will all be available in the investors section on our website. these forward-looking statements represent our views only as of the date of this call and involve substantial risks and uncertainties, including many that are beyond our control. please note the actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. for a further description of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements as well as risks related to our business, see our periodic reports filed with the sec.
i'll now turn the call over to emil.
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
thanks, josh, and good afternoon, everyone. i'll start off by highlighting our continued execution across ultragenyx' broad portfolio of clinical and commercial assets. since our last call, we made substantive progress on two of our most significant clinical programs focused on larger rare genetic diseases. the first of these is gtx-102, an antisense oligonucleotide that we are developing in partnership with genetx biotherapeutics for angelman syndrome. over the last few months, we successfully concluded discussions with three regulatory agencies to get our phase i/ii study up and running again. the ex u.s. protocol initially dosed with four patients with two monthly doses each before our data monitoring committee reviews available safety data. as previously guided, we anticipate providing a preliminary update on the study after this review, which is expected to be around year-end. a study will then continue to treat those first four patients with two more monthly doses and to enroll an additional eight patients. we plan to provide a more substantial readout from the study after day 128 for all 12 patients which is expected in mid-2022. turning to the u.s. we expect to begin dosing patients under the revised protocol later this quarter.
the dose in the u.s. is lower than ex u.s., but the patients are restricted to the younger, smaller four to eight year old age group. our experience with the first five patients previously treated suggest that younger, smaller patients can respond to treatment at this dose after drug loading with four repeated low doses over three months. for wilson disease, we've also begun enrolling participants in the baseline evaluation phase of our pivotal study. ux701 is an aav9 gene therapy of a specially designed copper transport that can restore normal copper metabolism and distribution. the design of our novel phase i/ii/iii study in wilson disease is notable because it enables a seamless transition from a traditional dose-finding phase i/ii study right into a pivotal study, which will save time. i will note that this is our fourth clinical-stage gene therapy program and our first targeting a more prevalent genetic disease. camille will provide more information on this program and study later on in her section. also of note is that the ux701 program for wilson disease as is our second program to use the ultragenyx producer cell line or pcl gene therapy manufacturing system. our pcl technology is a novel approach similar to vaccine manufacturing that is designed to yield a more productive and consistent aav production process.
the result is that we are manufacturing commercial grade material at commercial scale for the first clinical patients with a substantial reduction in costs compared with triple transfection processes. this process allows us to manufacture enough material to treat all the patients randomized to ux701 in the phase i/ii portion of the study with a single run significantly driving down cogs, an important element when thinking about the potential reimbursement challenges in the future for gene therapy products. we are continuing to invest in our pcl system, most recently as part of our preclinical aav program for duchenne muscular dystrophy. we expect the greater productivity of the pcl system will be especially important for more common and higher dose indications like duchenne, where the amount and cost of the product can be an important factor. moving to the rest of our clinical pipeline. we are advancing four additional programs that further demonstrate the diversity of our portfolio across modalities. all four of these programs have new studies starting over the next few months, and three of these studies will be pivotal. our gene therapy for dtx401 for gsdia and dtx301 for otc deficiency are both moving into phase iii studies based on durable positive base ii results over multiple years of follow-up. we are also on track to initiate a pivotal phase ii/iii study of our newest program, ux143.
this monoclonal antibody will be tested in pediatric and adult patients with osteogenesis imperfecta, a larger rare genetic bone diseases complements the capabilities we've developed with crysvita. wrapping up with our commercial programs. despite the recent challenges with the covid delta variant, our team has continued to be effective at a supporting compliance for patients already receiving our therapies as well as increasing new patient starts across all products. with crysvita, the successful launch continues, and we are now tracking toward the upper end of our full year guidance. adult patients are an increasing portion of patients we are identifying and converting to treatment. in latin america, crysvita continues to do especially well. revenue in that region has more than doubled year-to-date in 2021 versus 2020. this growth is backed by increases across the board in patient identification patients who have a prescription and are navigating reimbursement process and patients receiving reimbursed therapy. we are nearing the conclusion of the formal reimbursement process in brazil for access of product, which should help further growth there. with dojolvi, we're continuing to build the momentum of a strong launch.
all the key metrics show the teams are able to find patients and quickly get them on reimbursed therapy. we are near 10% of the expected population of lc-faod patients now being prescribed dojolvi in the first year or so of launch. dojolvi is also growing in europe, driven by significant increases in named patient requests in france and other countries in the region. before i turn the call over to erik, i want to highlight our recently announced collaboration with fda, nih and leading public and private organizations focused on gene therapy development. the bespoke gene therapy consortium as part of the nih accelerating medicines partnership program is focused on advancing gene therapies for ultra-rare diseases. at ultragenyx, we believe we have responsibility to support the development of treatments for as many rare disease as possible, including these ultra-rares that might not otherwise get treated. we also believe that this joint collaboration will help identify ways to improve the development process and create a further improved regulatory paradigm to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the development of the next generation of gene therapy for all rare diseases.
with that, i'll turn the call now over to erik.
erik harris -- chief commercial officer and executive vice president
thank you, emil, and good afternoon, everyone. the commercial and field teams continue to execute in the north and latin american regions despite the ongoing pandemic. this has led to another strong quarter, building on significant momentum that we generated in the first half of the year. in the press release we issued earlier today, we further highlighted this by guiding toward the upper end of the $180 million to $190 million range for 2021 crysvita revenue in ultragenyx territories. this would represent greater than a 35% year-over-year growth. within the north american region, we continue to see steady underlying demand from both the pediatric and adult markets as total number of prescribers surpassed 1,000. the split of the pediatric and adult patients remains approximately 50-50 while the total number of patients on therapy continues to increase. as emil mentioned earlier, we expect this split will continue shifting toward a greater portion of adults on crysvita as the teams continue to increase focus on finding doctors who have adult patients with xlh or til dispersed in the community setting. compliance remains very high in part because of the ultracare patient support services team, and because patients who begin therapy recognize how much better they can feel when on crysvita.
outside of the u.s., demand for crysvita continues to gain momentum. third quarter revenue in latin america grew significantly versus the second quarter, partly reflecting the uneven ordering patterns we expect within that region. however, if you compare the revenue of the first three quarters in 2021 versus the same period -- time period in 2020, you can begin to see the significant opportunity ahead of us. revenue over that time period grew approximately 115%, driven by increasing underlying demand. this is the result of all of the work the teams have been doing for the last couple of years to educate healthcare providers, find patients and work with regulatory and reimbursement authorities. we are in the final stages of negotiating full reimbursement with the brazilian authorities, and in the meantime, continue to receive orders from the ministry of health to support patients who have been granted an injunction to receive this therapy. turning now to dojolvi, which was approved for the treatment of long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders, or lc-faod, by the fda in the middle of 2020 and by health canada earlier this year. in the third quarter, we added approximately 40 [indecipherable] bringing the total since launch to approximately 310 site points. as of the end of the quarter, this has resulted in approximately 250 patients on reimbursed therapy.
approximately 145 unique healthcare providers have written a prescription for the job for dojolvi, and we are continuing to see growth in the number who have written multiple prescriptions. much of the success we have seen in the first year of launch is driven by a couple of factors. first, the strong demand for dojolvi at the major centers [indecipherable] and metabolism. second, our patient support services team is doing a great job, supporting patients and their families as they navigate the insurance process and work through any issues they might have in receiving the dojolvi. over time, we believe demand with dojolvi will continue to grow at a steady pace similar to other products in the space. outside of the u.s., uptake of dojolvi remains strong through our named patient and early access programs. in europe, dojolvi is growing, driven by steady increases in named patient requests in france. we are continuing to work with regional regulatory regulators to gain full approval to treat all patients who could benefit from dojolvi. in fact, the brazilian national health surveillance agency recently approved dojolvi for the treatment of both pediatric and adult patients with lc-faod. as is typical within that country, we are now working with the ministry of finance to get full reimbursement approval. these are important steps forward as we seek to provide broad access to dojolvi in the latin american region. as the teams look to close out the year, we will continue to adapt to the ever-changing covid landscape to ensure that patients can continue to benefit from our products.
with that, i'll turn the call over to mardi to share the financial results.
mardi c. dier -- chief financial officer and executive vice president
thanks, erik. we issued a press release earlier today that included a financial update, which i will briefly summarize. company revenue for the quarter ending september 30, 2021, totaled $81.6 million. crysvita revenue in ultragenyx territories grew to $50.3 million, including $43 million from the north american profit share territory and net product sales of $7.4 million in other regions. total royalty revenue related to the sales of crysvita in the european territory was $4.7 million. dojolvi revenue for the quarter was $10.7 million. as we have stated before, we will not be providing guidance for dojolvi in these first quarters of launch. we believe the metrics erik just discussed better describes the success we are seeing so far. mepsevii revenue for the third quarter of 2021 was $3.9 million, and we expect these revenues may modestly increase over time. third quarter 2021 revenue also includes $12.1 million related to the tech transfer as part of our strategic manufacturing partnership with daiichi sankyo around our pcl and hek293 technologies. as we have discussed previously in the fourth quarter of 2021, the revenue we recognized from this agreement will taper significantly as the tech transfer activities wind down as planned.
additional details on this revenue recognition can be found in our annual and quarterly reports filed with the sec. total operating expenses for the quarter were $171.5 million, which includes research and development expenses of $113.4 million, sg&a expenses of $53.9 million and cost of sales of $4.2 million. we continue to expect our r&d cost to increase in 2021 compared to 2020 as we support three pivotal gene therapy clinical trials, the ux143 phase ii/iii clinical study in osteogenesis imperfecta and the phase i/ii study for our most advanced mrna program, ux053 and gsdiii, and a number of other preclinical activities as we get ready to advance the next programs into the clinic. we also expect sg&a to modestly increase in 2021 as we compare -- as we continue to support the expansion of the launches of crysvita, dojolvi and mepsevii. for the quarter ended september 30, 2021, net loss was $73 million or $1.08 per share. this compares to a net loss for the same period in 2020 of $68.8 million or $1.13 per share.
the net loss for the third quarter 2021 includes a $25.7 million increase in the fair value of investments in equity securities as compared to $11.5 million decrease in q3 2020. net cash used in operations for the nine months ended september 30, 2021, was $284.4 million compared to $69.8 million for the same period in 2020. net cash used in the nine months ended september 30, 2021, includes the $50 million upfront payment for the closing of the mereo license and collaboration agreement, compared to the net cash used in the same period of 2020 that included $154 million of operating cash received from daiichi sankyo related to the collaboration and license agreements. we have ended the third quarter with approximately $941 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. this puts us in a strong capital position to reach key clinical and commercial milestones as we continue executing our development and commercial strategies.
so now i'll let camille touch on some of our clinical programs. camille?
camille l. bedrosian -- chief medical officer and executive vice president
thank you, mardi, and i too wish everyone a good afternoon. before i share updates from our ongoing clinical programs, i'd like to review new data were presented last month at the international network for fatty acid oxidation research and management, or inform 2021 virtual conference. the results represent data over a longer period of time and on additional patients and an independent group of patients with long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders, lc-faod, treated with dojolvi in an extension study. there was a statistically significant reduction in annualized major clinical events, or mces, and annualized duration of these events for 33 patients who had not previously received treatment with dojolvi when comparing the 18 months prior to treatment to the median 21.9 months on therapy. in these patients, the median annualized rate of mces went from 2.00 to 0.28 per year or an 86% reduction, p-value 0.0343 and the median annualized duration of mces went from 8.66 to 0.8 days or a 91% reduction p-value 0.0325. these data are consistent with the previous published results. next, i'll shift to gtx-102, the antisense oligonucleotide, aso, that we are developing in partnership with genetx for the treatment of angelman syndrome. angelman is a severe neurogenetic disorder that affects approximately 60,000 patients in the developed world.
we, with our partner genetx, are currently enrolling the phase i/ii study in canada and the u.k. dosing at the canadian site has already begun with the u.k. to follow shortly. as a reminder, initially, two patients in the under eight year-old and two in the over eight year-old cohorts will be enrolled. following each patient's second monthly dose and the completion of a two week follow-up period, a data monitoring committee will review the available safety data to determine if they recommend moving forward with enrolling the remaining four patients in each age cohort. following extensive discussions with the fda, we were able to reach agreement on a modified protocol that will allow us to dose naive patients, younger than eight years old, in the united states. the revised protocol will enroll eight patients split between a gtx-102 treatment arm and a comparator group with the active group receiving two milligrams monthly doses for four months. the comparator group can then eventually enter the same dosing regimen. because the dose level is lower in the u.s. protocol, we have narrowed enrollment to the younger age patient group of four to eight years old. the site in the u.s. has a number of patients identified who are all eager to participate in the study. we expect dosing to begin later this quarter. i'll now turn to our three pivotal gene therapy programs, starting with ux701 for the treatment of wilson disease. wilson disease is a rare genetic disorder of copper metabolism due to a mutation in the atp7b or copper transporter gene.
this results in the accumulation of copper in the liver and brain, particularly a potentially progressive serious disease. we estimate there are approximately 50,000 patients in the developed world who have wilson disease. last month, we announced that we have successfully screened the first patient in the seamless phase i/ii/iii study that aims to directly address the mutated atp7b gene. these patients are now in a 6- to 12-week baseline evaluation period where they will be evaluated to ensure stable measures of disease such as 24-hour urinary copper concentration, complete blood count and liver function tests. following this baseline screening period, patients will be randomized and treated with ux701 or placebo. next, dtx401 for the treatment of glycogen storage disease type ia, or gsdia, is a disease that arises from a defect in the glucose 6-phosphatase, or g6pase enzyme, which is essential to the liver's ability to release glucose to the bloodstream and its deficiency leads to serious hypoglycemia. gsdia is the most common genetically inherited glycogen storage disease with an estimated 6,000 patients in the developed world. we have a number of sites already activated and expect the first patients from the u.s. and canadian sites to enter the four to eight week baseline evaluation period around the end of the year. during this period, patients will be monitored to establish four consecutive weeks of clinically stable disease through the use of a controlled diet, oral glucose replacement therapy and a continuous glucose monitoring.
following this baseline evaluation period, patients will be randomized and treated with either dtx401 or placebo. our third pivotal gene therapy is dtx301 for the treatment of ornithine transcarbamylase or otc deficiency. otc is a critical component of the urea cycle that metabolizes toxic ammonia into urea that can then be safely excreted in the urine. ammonia is a very potent neurotoxic compound and can lead to coma, serious brain injury and death. there are approximately 10,000 patients in the developed world with 80% being late onset. we currently expect the first patients to enter the four to eight week baseline evaluation period around the end of the year. during this period, patients will be monitored to establish four weeks of clinically and metabolically stable disease through a protein-restricted diet and/or the use of ammonia scavengers. following this baseline evaluation period, patients will be randomized and treated with either dtx301 or placebo. the last program i will touch on is ux143 for the treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta, or oi. oi is a large genetic bone disorder with approximately 60,000 patients in the developed world. and most of our xlh doctors have many more patients with oi than xlh. these patients have reduced or abnormal collagen that triggers a maladaptive bone remodeling response.
the body recognizes the bad collagen and breaks down bone in a repeated cycling attempt to fix the issue. however, patients with oi are unable to create normal collagen, and that then leads to an overabsorption and inadequate net production of bone, and the bone weakness creates the risk for fractures. what we have found in animal models is that if you stimulate the production of more bone with anti-sclerostin or other agents, you can improve the bone strength to normal or near normal even while the collagen is still mutated. this would suggest that the fragility of the bone is not due to the collagen, but is actually the body's mal-adapter response to this defect. ux143 or setrusumab, is a fully human anti-sclerostin monoclonal antibody that should help the body write this imbalance by stimulating bone production and suppressing bone resorption, restoring the net balance to our bone production. mereo's asteroid study showed a dose-dependent increase in p1np and a decrease in ctx serum levels supporting this hypothesis. there were also continuous improvements in bone mineral density over the 12-month treatment period of the study, including an 8% to 10% improvement in the spinal column, which is a better anabolic result than other commonly used bone anabolic agents. the pivotal ii/iii study we expect to initiate later this year, will study pediatric and young adult patients ranging from five to 25 years old with and without a history of prior bisphosphonate treatment. the first part of the study will enroll approximately 40 patients and will evaluate a few doses compared to placebo. once the dose is identified, the study will enroll additional patients at the optimal dose level. we will provide more details on the study design and end points when we initiate the study later this year.
with this update, i will now turn back the call to emil. thank you.
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
thank you, camille. before we close out, i would like to provide a quick reminder of the key upcoming milestones for the company. for gtx-102 in angelman syndrome, we've dosed patients in canada. we'll dose patients in the u.k. and u.s. later this quarter. and we plan to provide a preliminary update on this program around the end of the year. for our gene therapy pipeline, we continue enrolling the ux701 phase i/ii/iii study for wilson. we'll share a longer-term follow-up phase i/ii data at the iciem from the studies of dtx401 in gsdi and dtx301 in otc. we will initiate phase iii studies in both these programs around the end of 2021. for ux143 in osteogenesis imperfecta, we'll initiate the pivotal phase ii/iii study in pediatric patients around the end of the year with studies and other age groups anticipated to begin next year. as you can see, our clinical pipeline is one of the largest and most diverse in the rare disease space and targets a number of genetic diseases with significant unmet need. with four pivotal studies enrolling in early 2022, and the angelman program back up and running, we look forward to updating you on our progress. with that, let's move on to your questions.
operator, please provide the q&a instructions.

[operator instructions] and our first question comes from the line of tazeen ahmad from bank of america. your line is now open.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, thank you guys. good evening, and thanks for taking my questions. two quick ones, emil. for gene therapy for dmd, where do you think that there is the most room to differentiate from what potentially could be in the market. so for example, the latest update, it seems like sarepta and pfizer are now both expecting their phase iii data for their programs in the early part of 2023. obviously, we don't know what they would look like. but let's say that they're built on the market before your program, where do you see the biggest opportunity there? and then quickly for the 701 program, are you able to tell us what you expect the screen-out rate to be for the aav9 antibodies with patients that you're looking to enroll into the study?
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
sure. so look, on the dmd program, we know when we started, we're well behind the two program leaders and sarepta and pfizer. and so our goal is to come up with a better combination microdystrophin vector, along with the manufacturing process, we think will be superior. and to do some other improvements related to how we administer the drug, which we think can enhance the delivery. so the combination of factors, i think, will help us provide an improvement. now our ability to look at development and improve the quality of the development strategy and end points and evaluations, i think, are another factor. we think all the micro -- do work and i think there's room for further improvement and we have that opportunity as a fast follower. but we're well behind, and we have a lot of work cut out for us. so we appreciate both companies or the other companies are very capable. but we do think we have some angles on how to be superior to the other duchenne programs. with regard to aav9 for 701, we haven't put out any information on the frequency, but we don't expect it to be an important issue with regard to being able to enroll the study and execute. and so far, a multiple patients have qualified, so we haven't seen an issue.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
and your next question from yaron werber from cowen. your line is now open.
yaron werber -- cowen -- analyst
congrats everybody on the great progress. all really great progress. just really quickly on the gene therapy stuff as well. so i know in wilson just got up and running would we maybe be able to expect any maybe preliminary updates from the phase i/ii next year? and if so, maybe when you're thinking that could be. and then just for -- on gsdia and otc, it seems like you're expecting to start dosing patients probably realistically early next year now. so i just wanted to see if there's maybe anything of note that's kind of limited getting these up and running, or rate of enrollment or anything like that, that we should be aware of.
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
sure. so for the phase i/ii wilson data, we expect by late in the year, we should have enough data on the phase i/ii that segment of the program to be able to talk about it, but we can't yet commit to exact timing of that data, but that's what we're expecting. and the phase i/ii data would be separately analyzed from the phase iii, so -- which gives us a little bit more room to maneuver with regard to disclosing what we find. but we expect we should know the dose and have information about it by late in the year next year. we expect it to enroll fairly promptly for wilson. so there are a lot of patients we think our program is an attractable one for patients, and we've managed to work to make it as convenient as possible so we could enhance enrollment. with regard to otc, we made the decision that gsdi and wilson were able to get going quicker. the challenge with otcs, we had some work we had to do with the agency regarding the ureagenesis test and the involvement of the device division that fda, the cdrh on that, which led to some more conversations, which just took more time to get through.
and right now, i would say cbr and crh are both strapped and overextended it took more time than we would have liked. so that's the main thing. it's really getting up and running. we've been doing patient diagnosis for all of our programs with our global team have lined up a lot of patients that we know are out there. so at least we believe we should be able to help improve the actual enrollment process once we get started. but it took a little longer to get through some of the regulatory steps for otc. that behind us now, we're ready to get going. but there is still -- that's the one main difference for otc.
yaron werber -- cowen -- analyst
okay, great. makes sense. thanks very much.
operator
your next question is from maury raycroft of jefferies. your line is now open.
maury raycroft -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, everyone. congrats on the progress. and thanks for taking my question. i was just going to check in on angelman for the preliminary data for the four patients around year-end, can you set expectations on what we should be focused on, how much follow-up we should expect, and will there be enough total drug administered to see some efficacy and determine if safety has improved.
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
yes. i think the main thing you'll see is that we'll talk about patients dosed and what we're looking at with regard to safety at that time. it's a little bit early on in the time course to know what the loading would be. and there was a run-in period where these patients were started and that pushed out the amount of data we'll get. but it will be a good update on where we are with regard to any safety issues and where we go. and -- but -- so it will give us a sense that everything is progressing, i think, but it will take -- we won't have a lot of efficacy information at that point in time because it's a bit early. what we are guiding to, though, is that the 12 patients of full data coming midyear is really kind of the place where you get a real full feel for loading six young and six old patients maximally titrating. and well, i think that will be the best assessment. anyway, so far, it's going well, and we're pleased to get going.
maury raycroft -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. and as a quick follow-up, will you provide an update on enrollment status at the year-end update on where you're at with the total of 12 patients.
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
yes. we'll talk about where we're at on the status of the program at that time. yes.
maury raycroft -- jefferies -- analyst
yes. okay. thanks for taking my question.
operator
and your next question is from joseph schwartz of svb leerink. your line is now open.
julie dalian -- svb leerink -- analyst
i'm julie dalian [phonetic] for joe. thank you for taking our question. the first one is on angelman. is there any more work you can do to help the fda get comfortable with the risk benefit of dosing additional angelman patients at a higher dose?
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
yes. well, i think the fda is being conservative with regard to the sense of safety. and i think the thing that's going to help them is getting more data on the higher doses ex u.s. and comfort with the administration strategy. we have confidence and confidence in it. but for them, there's not much benefit in taking any risk. so we're able to get started at 2, which will give us some information since we restricted because of that dose to be the young patients where the milligrams of loaded drug should be significant enough to give an effect based on what we saw before. but we think that the dose ex u.s. is going to give us the safety and efficacy information, which we would use to revise the u.s. program eventually in this coming year. so i think clinical data is what's going to move the needle for fda at this point, and that's on track to get it.
julie dalian -- svb leerink -- analyst
okay. great. and i guess, as a follow-on to that, you kind of touched upon it. but i guess, to what extent do you think that the fda will consider learnings from your ongoing u.k. and canada study where you'll be able to do higher look, have you had any conversations with the fda about this?
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
well, i've done a lot of regulatory. one of the things i know that doesn't really work that well to ask some hypothetical questions because they won't commit to anything. so you can't say if they all look good there, will you do this. they'd say, well, let's see what that says. i just -- it's not really a productive thing to ask them. so -- but i know from history, and i can tell you, i've done on four other programs. i've gone ex u.s., obtained more data on safety, efficacy, come back to the u.s., got their agreement and got those products approved, right? so i've done it four times before. i think that's probably enough evidence that, that strategy can work.
julie dalian -- svb leerink -- analyst
okay. great. that's very helpful. and then my second question is on the wilson program. i believe that the dtx701 has an inducible promoter. curious to know how it works and how -- and have you learned anything from your experience with dtx401, which also has this feature, although it's likely different and there still needs to be patients for -- and they are needed to be patients blood glucose to equilibrate over time. do you foresee the need for any equilibrating among wilson patients? or do you expect that they will achieve homeostasis right away to get the dose right?
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
well, we're depending on the dose to get to the right level, where -- there isn't an inducible feature in 701 that i'm aware of. the 401, it's not just ineducable. -- it's more of a regulation that is -- the 401 promoter includes all the normal signaling elements that you require to control your glucose correctly for insulin and glucagon and cortisol and other things. so that our transgene for collection store disease will respond to your body's signals, which i think is extremely important in managing glucose correctly, right? you want a system that responds for the metal ion, i don't think there is actually a particular need. as long as you're getting enough metal transport excess will not harm you basically, your body already regulates whether it's sending the copper to the bile or whether it's going to the golgi. if the golgi is how you make reals if you need -- if you have excess, it ends up going to the bile. and so how much transport is present is not as, i think, as critical as it might be in glucose regulation.

and your next question from gena wang of barclays.
gena wang -- barclays -- analyst
thank you for taking my questions. i also have two short questions regarding angelman. so emil, i'm just wondering, how did the fda pick 2-milligram dose the thought process or data to support that? and then second question is just wanted to confirm for the year-end update. will we see full patient data with each has three doses or two doses? and then quickly, i think you comment a little bit. just wondering what kind of safety data in terms of, say, follow-up or dose that from ex u.s., do you think it will allow you to do higher in the u.s.?
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
okay. so the 2-milligram dose is basically a level that's 1/10 the dose at which we saw in one patient, a safety problem. remember, patient five had the safety problem at 20 mg and they wanted a more dose 1/10 of that dose, that's the basis for that choice at two mgs. i don't really think that two to 3.3 is a big difference, but they prefer to stay a full 10 times below. we decided just tactically not to try to titrate right? they didn't tell us not to, but we just decided not to even push it because we were going to get what we needed ex u.s., and it felt it more important just to get started and started treating some dose some patients. and we restricted to the young patients because we thought we had a better chance of seeing efficacy in that group. and the idea is we would have a group of patients now, four patients that would run at two mg and we'll have ex u.s. patients. so two mgs that get about a total of 8. and the ex u.s. patients will get around 16.6 mg. so we'll actually essentially have like an equivalent of sort of half of the dose cohort. so if you look at totality of this, it will give us a potential for looking at dose response, combining u.s. and ex u.s. data. so there is a plus side to it, and we think it's just about getting started in the u.s. and the fda just wants to be conservative and protect patients and we're willing to work with them and get through that and get on to the next step. and we're comfortable the dose administration change we're making and how we're managing those ex u.s. will be successful, and therefore, we'll be able to bring that to the u.s. the end of the year update, we've been -- we will have some safety data and through the first two to three doses. but i think right now, it won't -- it's not going to be a very complete update. it will be some dosing you'll get a sense that whether patients are having the symptoms but we want to be able to fully load the patients.
we had hoped to have more like three to four doses, but it's more like two to 3. and the update, i think, will give people -- should -- if we're showing safety, then we'll at least understand that we can dose at this level and not get the problem and to get loaded to efficacy, though, we think you need several doses in order to get there. so the efficacy will be -- will provide what we have, but it will be more important to think -- look forward to the full data set on 12 patients midyear, which will be, i think, a truly substantial amount of information on what's going on with that algo at the dosing and loads that we are proposing. last item, you said safety data ex u.s. i think the type of safety will be able to show them is that we're not seeing the exacerbation of protein into the csf that we had seen, and the fact that we're not seeing lower extremity weakness via both clinically as well as using the neurological assessments. and of course, if we saw a problem, we would do an mri scan. so -- but assuming we haven't seen anything, it's the combination of the laboratory clinical findings that we'll be able to use in terms of justifying what we would do in the u.s. but we'd expect to take the data from the majority of patients in the u.s. and after we've gotten our four doses loaded in those u.s. patients to put that package together, come back to fda in order for the next cohort that we would initiate to begin at a dosing in a dosing plan that would be more optimal for achieving efficacy.
gena wang -- barclays -- analyst
great, thank you. and the next question from cory kasimov of jpmorgan. your line is now open.
thomas -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. this is thomas [phonetic] on for cory. i guess maybe just a quick one on setrusumab or ux143, i know you guys haven't laid out this whole design of the phase ii/iii study there, but curious if you can just comment on what specifically you'll be looking for in the phase ii portion to make a decision on a go-forward dose? and then also curious if we should be expecting a data update from the phase ii portion of that site specifically?
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
sure. so the phase ii portion will focus on p1np, which is the synthetic peptides that were released when your body is making collagen and laying down new bone. so it's the early sign of new bone creation. and we'll rely on that. we have seen it before, provided a dose response. we'll be looking at 20 and a higher dose. and what we're trying to do is figure out for the children whether a higher dose might work better. and so it's not only just -- it's not which dose. it's the dose range and age for dosing that we'll figure out. we'll use a couple of dosing in the first group of patients that are in the phase i/ii -- phase iii/ii part to make the decision and then define a dosing algorithm for children up to adults that we would use then in the pivotal study. we know the 20 mg per kilo dose provides a substantial improvement in bone moral density already in hand. so we have a strong anchor for what's an effective dose. so it's just about making sure we do the best we can for the children and that we optimize and ensure that there isn't more efficacy that we would have missed out on by not increasing the dose, either for children or adolescents or older patients. so that's the basic idea. with that, we'll move into the rolling of the phase iii patients and at the -- using the dosing algorithm defined.
thomas -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay, thank you.

next question from salveen richter of goldman sachs.
elizabeth -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, good evening, guys and thank you for taking our question this is elizabeth [phonetic] on for salveen. just wanted to ask, and i could have missed it, but are you looking to start redosing patients that were originally treated in the angelman's program? and i guess, when could that happen?
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
we have not reached agreement on redosing those patients. the agency wants us to treat these other patients and do a little more work to figure out whether we can demonstrate it's safe to redose those patients. we believe it's safe. the problems have resolved fully, and we do not think there is any immunological type basis for what's going on. but right now, we have not achieved a plan to redose those five patients, but we will work on that. but our first step, we think, is getting patients dosed and treated safely. with that in hand, then you can also go back and talk about redosing those initial patients. they're anxious to get started, but we have to work through this first step of treating some naive patients before we can make that move.
elizabeth -- goldman sachs -- analyst

next question from yigal nochomovitz of citigroup. your line is now open.
yigal nochomovitz -- citigroup -- analyst
hi, thank you hearing us for taking my questions and congrats on the progress. i just had a quick one on angelman. could you tell us what the volume of the 2-milligram doses? and have you ruled out that injection volume was playing a role and we observed muscle weakness. and assuming it's not volume related, was this perhaps a sequel dependent effect based on the ube3a sequence or just the result of any antisense oligo present in the cns?
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
yes. so volume is not really a factor. we've been using 10 ccs. in some cases, they got more 15 ccs but it really didn't relate to the volume of the artificial csf being used. so we don't think volume is a factor at all. we do think though that in these patients, if they were -- since they were relatively active patients, they wouldn't lay down and they stood up quickly that their drug tended to settle down the bottom of their cord, which we think was probably a factor in incubating their nerve routes and a much higher concentration of drug. now we don't think it's sequence specific. everything we've done would suggest it's not -- we think it's a high concentration effect. even with sequence specific, we would have seen the phenomenon up and down the spinal cord because the clinical effect happening in the brain demonstrates the sequences there. but yes, we don't see the problem.
the drug and the oligo was originally heavily screened for sequence-dependent effects. and screen negative and toxicologically was negative. so we don't think it's a sequence-specific effect at all. i think it's nonspecific. and at this point, my best sense is that this is more of a chemical irritation effect of the oligo present at high concentrations and kids that don't lay down. in the u.k. and canada now we're sedating them longer, keeping them laying down in trendelenburg and to make sure the drug is moving forward. we're also adding a flush as just to keep the drug moving and make sure it mixes rather than settling in at the bottom of their spine. so that's what we think at the moment, and we don't think it's sequence or volume dependent.
yigal nochomovitz -- citigroup -- analyst
okay. got it. and then just a separate question on setrusumab. could you just comment on why you believe that anticlirosatic antibody would be a better approach in osteogenesis imperfecta as opposed to one of the commercially available -- antibodies.
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
well, the -- stuff like [indecipherable], the data were not that great. the truth is they're blocking resorption more, but the drill deficiencies anabolism, making bone. the final difference in blocking resorption is that you're also inhibiting the overall turnover of bone in the correct way that is resorting bones not needed and making new bone that is needed. when you look at what's happening in these patients, they're not making enough new bone their bones are essentially osteoporotic. they're not making enough. they're resorbing too much not making enough new bone. so you really want an anabolic agent. and the anabolic agents -- the reason it's important is that they're activating normal mechanisms in your bone and where the bone gets laid down will be driven by where the signals are for bim weakness. so when you have bone movement, there is a mechanism -- biological mechanism to detect that weakness in movement and recruit the osteoblast to make the osteocytes to make new bone.
so the whole mechanism is designed to fill in bone where its weakest. and in animal models, this particular mechanism can result in normalizing bone strength within a few weeks of treatment in a model with defective collagen. so it is a potential fundamental impact on bone. and it's why we've been guiding people -- the way the idea that the weakness of bone in oi is due to the collagen, but rather it's due to the maladaptive response primarily. and that adapter response causes bone to be resorbed too much and not enough bone to be made. and so sclerostin is the right biological signal to turn on bone production and it has some antiresorptive effects, too, but it's primarily an anabolic agent, and we think could have a profound effect on oi. and we think of all the mechanisms out there, we think this is the strongest one because it drives osteoblast recruitment and production of new bone. both are being effective for oi.

your next question on from joon lee of truist. your line is now open.
joon lee -- truist -- analyst
all right, thanks for the updates on the questions. can you provide any more granularity on the patient disposition from the first three cohorts. is the lack of urgency by the fda to allow redosing based on some continued maintenance of efficacy? or is there something else? and i have a follow-up.
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
well, there's no lack of urgency we've been urgently working getting those patients retreated since the last november. so if anything, it's a pure frustration for us because it should have happened. i think the agency is we've provided all the data we have, which show there really is no mechanism other than a local irritation contact kind of injury. and -- however, we haven't in their mind, definitely proven that. and so there is a question, what is going on. but based on what we see, that's the only evidence. redosing is something we'd like to start doing, but i don't think at this point, it's the right step forward for the agency. i think we need to treat some patients with low doses, show we can do it safely. show we're getting efficacy and then reapproach them with the concept of redosing, i think showing that we can get to stun safely will help us move forward on redosing but unfortunately it didn't happen right away.
joon lee -- truist -- analyst
are the patients continue to maintain some efficacy? or have they gone back to the baseline?
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
well, they did -- they maintained their improvement for four or five months. and most of them have moved toward baseline in some ways, but i've heard from the pi that, in fact, some of the patients have retained long term some of the benefits they obtained during the treatment period. so it is possible that once the neurons have communicated and trained that they can actually maintain some of the signaling and improvements. so that's encouraging. so they're not all the way back to baseline for some of the features. but clearly, they're not as good as they were when they were on drug.
joon lee -- truist -- analyst
okay. and then the second question is, do you have any plans to vectorize gtx-102? it looks like jim wilson is working with fast to develop vectorized microrna targeting the same ubs and there's another company using vectorized rna probably the same [indecipherable] so just curious for your long-term plans. i know that it's not -- it's a [indecipherable].
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
well, [indecipherable] and when you do it vectorized is totally unregulated. so the challenge right now, and we're doing gene therapy in the brain, we are working on ccl5 deficiency, and we have a lot of work on it. what i can tell you, though, is the reliability of getting all the neurons treated efficiently, consistently is tougher with gene therapy. you end up with some newer with a lot of expression it's important to get enough expression in all and not too much in some. and so -- and keep in mind that the only imprinted cells are the neurons not the other cells. so there is some complexities to how this would work. we don't know that the efficiency of gene therapy in the brain is going to be good enough for angelman in terms of how -- what fraction of neurons are truly transformed. and so i would actually say that the aso strategies are more likely to treat more neurons consistently, and will be more effective and that there's still work to be done. i know everyone wants to vectorize and try to do that, but let's be -- how many of them gotten there where they actually are reliably controlling that in a wider -- neurons in a consistent way. the brain is tricky. i think the aso strategy we're using is going to provide a more consistent result going forward. and -- but with time, there's no question, with time, could there be a gene therapy? yes. at that point, we hope to be in a position to be able to do it ourselves. but right now, we're very excited about the potential of an aso that can bring benefit and help establish standards of what you can expect by turning on maternal ub3a.

your next question from dae gon ha from stifel. your line is now open.
dae gon ha -- stifel -- analyst
good evening. thanks for taking our questions. just two from me as well. going back to angelman. so first, on the u.k. and canada protocol, given that it includes the trendelenburg as well as the artificial csf flush. i guess we're mostly concerned about safety from the inflammation side of the question. but i was just wondering, would the artificial csf flush in a way kind of truncate how soon you can actually see the efficacy signal and perhaps even at lower doses than what you might have seen in the first u.s. trial. and then second question related to angelman. as we think about the u.s. trial, i know it's flat dosing, but it also doesn't include artificial csf flush nor the trendelenburg. so when we think about the spinal canal, any reason to believe that compared to the 3.3 that any kind of efficacy that could emanate from these accumulated dose would be somewhat weaker than the u.k. or the canadian patients.
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
yes. so the trendelenburg and flush will enhance delivery to the brain, and we know this is true, and it's been true for other drugs, by the way, even chemo drugs. by doing trendelenburg and flush, you will enhance brain concentration. so that's kind of not new. that's like three decades old. so it's not an unusual thing. what's happening basically is you're enhancing the mixing and the artificial sub will not reduce. it will reduce the local concentration, but it just enhances mixing. so the drug doesn't sit at high concentrations down in the lumber area, but gets mixed into the bottom volume of csf and keeps the concentration down at the lower better. so it's about enhancing, it's about limiting lower concentration, but it's about getting mixing. once you mix, the brain delivery will be improved. in the u.s., we're doing a lower dosing. we're maintaining the original protocol in terms of patients laying down or not doing trendelenburg and flush. and it could reduce the delivery of drug -- i think it will get still drug delivery. but i would say it's not going to be -- it's not going to matter. and fundamentally, the drivers for choosing administration efficacy will come from our ex-u.s. program. the u.s. patients will have a chance to see some efficacy. and my hope would be we bring all that data together in the u.s. patients, the ex-us patients will get synchronized on development -- on a treatment strategy for dose and administration going forward in next year.

your next question from jeff hung of morgan stanley.
jeff hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions. last quarter, you said you hadn't seen any impact from delta variant on identifying new patients for crysvita. in 3q, did you see any impact on identifying patients? and if so, do you believe that the main impact from delta variant is behind us?
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
well, i don't know if we've ever said that covid didn't have any impact on patients as it certainly had more of it last year for sure and it started easing up early in the year. the delta probably had some impact in the year, but we feel like things are picking up, and we're in pretty good shape in terms of how many patients we've diagnosed and in filling the pipe. but we see things as picking up again. and so delta probably had some impact on our ability to do face-to-face patient diagnosis and find work. but right now, we don't see that as our biggest barrier, but things are improving.
jeff hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. and then for ux701, you said that you might not be able to treat all 50,000 patients in the developed world. what do you need to see in your studies to be clinically meaningful? and i guess, at that level, what proportion of the 50,000 patients do you think would be addressable?
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
what i've said is that i advise people not to include in their model that we would treat every known patient with wilson disease gene therapy. i don't think that's rational. i think you're going to end up finding the most urgent addressed patients or those with continuing problems difficult to each complying progression their symptoms. and it's a fraction of them. and we've said it could be a fraction, like half of them or something, but we don't really know what the number is. and i would right now, i wouldn't want to speculate. i think it's going to depend on what do the efficacy really look like? how powerful is it in the various types of in severity of wilson disease patients. if the restoration of copper distribution has a bigger impact on neurologic function than we know today that could change the outcome of how many patients get on therapy. but i've told people the biggest early addressable patients would be the ones that are still having problems even on chelators are unable to tolerate them. and i think that would be true for almost any of the gene therapies that it's going to really be dependent on people who are needing improvement to justify it. and i just think we shouldn't model assuming a huge fraction of all these patients are going to get treated. i don't think it's rational. but we do think there's a really significant fraction of those patients. and i believe that restoring copper distribution will be more important than people realize today.
jeff hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst

your next question from esther rajavelu of ubs.
esther rajavelu -- ubs -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my question. i apologize if i'm asking things you've already covered. i've been jumping between calls. but on dojolvi, can you comment on the sequential changes in the new start forms versus the total treated patients. when i kind of look at the sequential numbers, it looks like the stock forms seem to be pretty stable quarter-over-quarter, but there is variability on changes in the total number of patients treated. so any color you can share on that would be helpful. and then i have a quick follow-up on gtx-102.
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
yes. erik, are you available? do you want to talk about that particular topic.
erik harris -- chief commercial officer and executive vice president
sure. i mean, first and foremost, i think it's important to note that the team has done a remarkable job launching this product in the midst of pandemic. we see steady growth in all the key metrics start forms, reimbursed patients and total number of patients, just other number of prescribers that have multiple prescriptions. so we believe these are the best indicators. we've always stated -- and the other thing i think is important to note in the first year of launch, we have about 10% of the sma equivalent population on reimbursed treatment. -- we always stated, as we move into 2021 through 2021, we expected a steady gradual build to continue consistent with other products. and i think that's what you're seeing is a steady, gradual growth as we move forward.
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
erik, i think she's speaking of the -- there is a slight lag in the reimbursed patients in the q3, but i think this was in the summer delta variant. it was probably impacted some of the things...
erik harris -- chief commercial officer and executive vice president
yes. if you look at that those patients are just working themselves through the reimbursed process, and we fully expect them to be able to transition on to treatment as reimbursement remains strong access [indecipherable]
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
we've had the same pattern during crysvita, where we have more start forms kind of continuing and reimbursement a little lagging and catching up again and i don't think there's anything there. i think the key thing start forms is growing and reimbursement totals are growing. so we feel good about the strength and continued progress in the launch.
esther rajavelu -- ubs -- analyst
got it. and what is the average durability? i know it's early days in launch, but are you sort of seeing patients taking through therapy for the course of the year? or another way to ask is what is the drop-off rate?
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
we -- i think we've been seeing people stay on therapy. in fact, we have people that have been on the drug almost 20 years now steadily. so in our trials, we lost a few people at the very beginning. but when we learned how to adapt and use the dietitians to help guide people how to get started. we've generally seen people stay on drug very long periods of time. i don't think we've put out specific numbers yet at this point, erik, but...
erik harris -- chief commercial officer and executive vice president
no, we haven't put out [indecipherable]
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
consistent. yes [indecipherable]
erik harris -- chief commercial officer and executive vice president
consistent. yes.
esther rajavelu -- ubs -- analyst
got it. and then on gtx-102, can you clarify whether all four patients have already been dosed in canada? or when would that be completed?
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
we haven't said -- we have multiple patients dosed and the process is ongoing. so we'd expect to have all patients have got all four patients would have gotten dosing and more than one dose. but we'll put out more information at the end of the year, exact timing. it just depends on what happens at each center. but it's going along well, and we're happy with the number of patients that are queued up, ready to go.

thanks for taking the question. could you tell us more about the manufacturing runs you're getting with the pcl gene therapy system. in particular, quantifying the size of the runs as well as the percent of taxis you're seeing.
emil d. kakkis -- founder, president and chief executive officer
yes. the pcl system runs at a 2,000-liter scale, all right, and dispels 2,000-liter bioreactors. and depending on the particular pcl clone, we're in the -- usually in the 60% to 80% full range, full compared to empty. and so it's a lot higher than you would see with triple transaction methods. that's the raw product and then you would go through purification.
