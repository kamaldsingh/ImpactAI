the company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. additionally, on today's call, management statements include a discussion of certain non-gaap financial measures, which are intended to supplement and not to be substitutes for comparable gaap measures. reconciliations of such supplemental information to the comparable gaap measures will be included as part of today's presentation and in our earnings release.
with that, i'd like to turn the call over to our president and chief executive officer, brett ponton. bret?
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, maureen, and good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us. in the last few months, we have seen an unprecedented health and economic crisis, and the covid-19 situation remains extremely fluid. during this period of uncertainty, we have been committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of our teammates, customers and communities while maintaining business continuity to support our customers' current and future needs. our more than 1,200 stores have remained open to provide essential services since the beginning of the pandemic, and we continue to leverage our diversified supply chain without significant disruption. i am immensely proud of our teammates' efforts and strong execution despite the ongoing challenges, and i am pleased to see that our monro forward initiatives continue to gain traction, which i believe will help us emerge stronger from this crisis. as highlighted on slide three, while we reduced our store operating hours at the onset of the pandemic, we have taken a measured approach to gradually return to a more normalized store schedule as the demand environment improves.
we have received positive feedback from our customers regarding the safety measures we have implemented in our stores, including key drop and contactless services. importantly, we continue to see strong teammate engagement as a result of the actions we have taken to protect and support them during this crisis. overall, we are focused on the elements of our business within our control and have taken the appropriate steps to mitigate near-term headwinds and expect to operate on a cash flow positive basis during the covid-19 pandemic. our strategy is underpinned by a rigorous financial discipline in cost management and capital allocation as well as a robust balance sheet and ample liquidity, which we believe provide us with significant financial flexibility to safely operate our business and execute our monro forward initiatives. in this context, we have continued to make critical investments in technology to support our future operations and have decided to gradually resume our store rebrand and reimage initiative in the second quarter. lastly, acquisitions remain a pillar of our growth strategy. we have a robust pipeline and are evaluating a number of quality, potential targets that would fit our strategy while maintaining strong financial discipline.
moving on to slide four. i would like to take a moment to discuss our first quarter performance and the current trends we're experiencing. government restrictions to curve the spread of covid-19 drove a substantial decline in traffic, which translated to a 26% decrease in comparable store sales in the first quarter. while april represented a low point in our top line performance, we saw a resumption in demand, driven by improved traffic, as government restrictions gradually abated throughout the quarter, with may and june improving sequentially. these encouraging trends continued into fiscal july with our comparable store sales down approximately 12%. despite the covid-19-related challenges we are facing, it is important to note that we continue to solidify our competitive position in the current environment, as evidenced by our performance tracking, in line or above miles driven and other mobility metrics. while we experienced a double digit comparable store sales decrease in all product and service categories during the first quarter, we were encouraged to see that monthly comps improved sequentially across all categories throughout the quarter, a trend that has continued in the second quarter based on our preliminary results to date. importantly, tires, which represents our largest category, outperformed all other product and service categories as the rollout of our tire category management and pricing system is gaining traction. with improved visibility into the price elasticity of demand and competitive dynamics in each market, it has allowed us to optimize our tire assortment while favorably impacting tire volumes and margins during the first quarter. geographically, our southern and midwestern markets outperformed our northern markets, where we have had a high concentration of stores, as the northeast region was the most severely impacted by the covid-19 pandemic during the first quarter.
however, this outperformance has narrowed in recent weeks with strengthening performance in the northeast and a slowdown in recovery pace in our southern states, as many are increasing restrictions due to higher infection rates. as mentioned before, we're also able to quick and quickly and thoughtfully flex down our cost structure to adapt to the lower demand environment. the pandemic gave us the opportunity to accelerate the pace of some of our transformation initiatives, including our store staffing. we believe we have rightsized our store staffing and structurally changed our labor model to consistently have the right mix of technicians with the appropriate skill level and corresponding compensation aligned with demand and the level of services performed in each store. in addition, we have tightened our marketing spend and accelerated its shift toward higher roi digital channels. overall, we are encouraged by the cost savings that derive from these initiatives, which we believe set us up well to drive better operating performance going forward. despite the challenging operating environment, we are strongly committed to advancing our monro forward strategy to position our business for long-term sustainable growth. turning to slide five, i would like to discuss the recent developments in greater detail. beginning with our largest strategic initiative, our store rebrand and reimage program, which focuses on creating a more consistent store appearance and implementing standardized in-store operating procedures. to date, we have completed the transformation of more than 200 stores in a number of key markets, including rebranding approximately 70 stores from service branded stores tire branded stores and consolidating our tire brands to optimize our brand awareness and increase our tire revenues in select markets. while we have paused this initiative since the onset of the pandemic, we are pleased to report that our rebrand stores, comparable store sales continued to outperform our chain average. these positive trends reinforced our confidence in our reimage and retail brand portfolio consolidation strategy to drive long-term, same-store sales growth.
in light of our healthy financial position, we have decided to resume this program with a measured and moderated approach in the second quarter. accounting for the current pandemic backdrop, our goal is to undertake the refresh of 60 to 120 stores in fiscal 2021. as part of our one-time real estate portfolio adjustment, we completed the closure of 36 underperforming stores during the first quarter, in addition to the six stores that were closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. as we previously noted, these store closures were planned in accordance with our analytic model to drive a stronger, long-term performance of our company and were not in response to covid 19. we estimate the closure of these 42 stores will improve operating income by approximately $5.1 million on an annual basis. moving on to our customer-centric engagement initiatives. over the past few years, we have been focused on improving the experience for our customers, which has driven our all-time star rating up to 4.6 stars. building off these strong results, we have accelerated the strategic shift of our marketing efforts toward higher roi digital channels since the beginning of the pandemic. as part of our digital strategy, we have been focused on optimizing our seo performance for key product categories like tires.
these efforts have resulted in approximately 50% of our stores now ranking in the top three online search results, which has led to significant improvements in online consumer actions, whether that's scheduling an appointment at the store, making a phone call to the store or clicking to get directions to a monro location. importantly, our targeted investments in digital marketing and advertising, combined with our new digital phone system, allow us to acquire and retain customers at a lower cost while driving stronger results. as part of our broader efforts to create an omnichannel presence for our company, we are excited to announce that we have completed the rollout of our collaboration with amazon with all of our more than 1,200 locations in 32 states now providing tire installation services. we continue to receive positive feedback and strong customer satisfaction metrics in response to this initiative, which builds upon the success of our other online tire retailer agreements and is an important step in furthering our customer-centric engagement efforts. turning on to our critical turning now, excuse me, to our critical investments in technology, we continue to make tremendous progress on a number of initiatives that we believe will be instrumental in driving long-term sustainable top line growth and margin expansion.
during the first quarter, we substantially completed the rollout of our network infrastructure upgrade across our store base, including the new digital phone system i just mentioned. our modernized store infrastructure allows us to drive a more sophisticated and consistent approach to customer execution with the ability to measure the results of our marketing efforts. during the covid-19 pandemic, we have leveraged our new technology to establish a centralized call center that provides added flexibility and significantly improves our customer responsiveness. overall, we're encouraged by the early traction of this initiative and confident it will contribute to improved conversion and enhanced customer experiences going forward. as mentioned earlier, we are in the process of rolling out our new tire category management and pricing system across our store base, which we expect to complete by the third quarter of fiscal 2021. this new tool is driving relative strength in our tire category as we are better able to dynamically track demand trends at the market level and make rapid adjustments to our tire pricing and assortment strategy. this allows us to drive higher volume as well as optimized tire pricing to expand margins in this category. lastly, our technology-based store staffing model has allowed us to seamlessly rightsize and effectively balance our store labor in real time since the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic, ensuring we have the right mix of skills to match demand in each store. it is also proven critical to our ability to effectively ramp up staffing in our stores to support improving demand trends, which is one of our important priorities right now.
this program positively impacted gross margin in the first quarter, and we are confident it will continue to drive significant store labor efficiency going forward. as we are rolling out our cloud-based store staffing and scheduling software across our store base, which we expect to be complete by the third quarter, we are leveraging our monro university platform to train our teammates and have received overwhelmingly positive feedback so far. in addition to supporting the rollout of our strategic initiatives, monro university has a robust curriculum and continues to help our teammates grow and advance their career and technical skill set, which has significantly enhanced our employer value proposition as a key differentiator in the current environment. overall, we believe these important tools will enhance our competitiveness in the marketplace and will be critical to supporting our broader strategy moving forward. before passing the call over to brian, i would like to reiterate how proud i am of our team's dedication to safely provide a best-in-class experience to our customers. our teammates have demonstrated their ability to quickly adjust to the evolving environment and seamlessly embrace the structural changes we've made across our business to drive an improved operating performance and emerge even stronger when this crisis subsides.
with that, i'll turn the call over to brian, who will provide additional detail on our first quarter performance and strong financial position.
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, brett, and good morning, everyone. turning to slide six, i'd like to provide a more detailed overview of our performance this quarter. sales fell 22.1% year-over-year to $247.1 million, primarily driven by a 25.8% decline in same-store sales. as expected, the ongoing covid-19 pandemic substantially impacted our results as government restrictions to curve the spread significantly decreased traffic in the quarter. as brett noted, we were encouraged to see sequential comparable store sales improvement during the quarter across all product and service categories as restrictions have gradually abated in some of our key geographies. sales from new stores increased by $12.7 million or $11.1 million from recent acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in sales from closed stores of approximately $3.1 million. the first quarter of fiscal 2021 had 90 selling days, in line with the previous year period. gross margin decreased 500 basis points to 35.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 from 40.4% in the prior year period. this decrease was primarily due to an increase in distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales as we lost leverage on these largely fixed costs with lower comparable store sales.
additionally, we were impacted by lower vendor rebates due to slower inventory turns as well as higher sales mix of tires compared to the prior year period. however, this was partially offset by lower technician labor costs as a percentage of sales directly related to our store technology-based staffing model, as well as we rightsized labor to match lower demand while ensuring we had the right mix of necessary skill sets in each store. in addition, gross margin improved within the tire category, which was positively impacted by the partial rollout of our tire category management and pricing tool in the quarter. operating expenses for the quarter decreased $15.7 million to $76.1 million or 30.8% of sales as compared with $91.8 million or 28.9% of sales for the prior year period. as brett previously mentioned, we took targeted action to streamline our cost structure in the first quarter. most notably, we strategically realigned our marketing spend toward higher roi digital channels and rightsized store staffing to match lower demand. the year-over-year decrease in operating expenses also reflects lower expenses from a net reduction of four stores compared to the prior year period. this was partially offset by $2.5 million in store closing costs. the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales compared to the previous year period was driven by a decrease in comparable store sales. our operating income for the first quarter was $11.4 million compared to $36.4 million for the same quarter last year. as a percentage of sales, operating income was 4.6% compared to 11.5% in the prior year period. net interest expense for the quarter increased to $7.4 million as compared to $7.2 million in the same period last year.
the weighted average debt outstanding for the first quarter increased by approximately $486 million as compared to the prior year period. the increase is primarily related to an increase in debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility to fund the purchase of our acquisitions and to provide financial flexibility during the covid-19 pandemic, as well as an increase in finance lease debt recorded in connection with our fiscal 2020 acquisitions and greenfield expansion. the weighted average interest rate for the first quarter decreased by approximately 350 basis points year-over-year due to lower libor and prime interest rates as well as lower borrowing rates associated with new leases. for the first quarter, income tax expense was $1 million compared to $6.8 million in the prior year period. net income for the first quarter was $3 million compared to net income of $22.6 million in the prior year period. diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was $0.09 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.67 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, a non-gaap measure, was $0.15, which excludes $0.06 per share of store closing costs. this compares to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.69 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, which excluded $0.01 per share of costs related to monro forward initiatives and $0.01 per share of costs related to acquisition due diligence and integration costs.
as of july 29, 2020, the company had 1,247 company-operated stores and 97 franchise locations as compared with 1,251 company-operated stores and 98 franchise locations as of june 29, 2019. during the first quarter, we closed 36 stores. a complete bridge comparing our first quarter fiscal 2021 earnings per share performance with the same period last year is presented on slide seven. the covid-19-related drop in traffic significantly impacted our performance, resulting in a 25.8% decrease in comparable store sales and a $0.77 earnings per share decline. as we previously noted, every 1% decline in comparable store sales translates into roughly $0.03 per share per quarter. the decrease in gross margin impacted our operations by approximately $0.20 per share. the net benefit of our cost savings and lower expenses due to a reduction in the number of stores compared to the prior year period allows us to reconcile to our adjusted earnings per share of $0.15 in the quarter. as previously noted, this excludes $0.06 per share in planned store closing costs. turning to slide eight. i'd now like to provide an update on our strong financial position, beginning with our capital allocation strategy. we paid down $240.2 million of debt under our revolving credit facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. the our capital expenditures were $15.3 million in the first quarter, of which approximately $9.9 million was related to our monro forward initiatives, including our store technology infrastructure upgrade. additionally, we paid approximately $7.4 million in dividends during the first quarter. as brett previously noted, we have a robust m&a pipeline and are evaluating attractive targets that support our strategy while maintaining our strong financial discipline.
we also paused our store rebrand and reimage initiative in the first quarter, but we plan to resume this program during the second quarter, and we'll take a measured and thoughtful approach to ensure we are protecting our financial position. overall, we expect our focus on streamlining operations and operating costs in bolstering our working capital position to mitigate the impact of near-term headwinds and allow us to operate on a cash flow positive basis throughout this pandemic. finally, in june, we temporarily amended certain financial and restricted covenants of our existing 5-year revolving credit facility, which we believe will provide us with greater financial flexibility to operate our business. moving on to slide nine. our balance sheet and liquidity position remains strong, and we have confidence that we are well positioned to navigate the current environment. we generated approximately $73 million in operating cash flow during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. at the end of the first quarter, we had net bank debt of $179 million and a net debt-to-ebitda ratio of 3.86. as of july 25, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $145 million in availability on our revolving credit facility of approximately $255 million. turning to our financial assumptions for fiscal 2021. given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding covid-19, it remains difficult to accurately forecast the impact of the pandemic on our future operations. therefore, we are not providing fiscal 2021 guidance at this time. we have provided some financial assumptions on slide 10 to assist with your modeling, which we have updated for our first quarter performance.
regarding our capital expenditures, we are increasing our range to approximately $30 million to $50 million in fiscal 2021 to account for the number of stores we plan on rebranding during the year depending on the environment. the low end of our capex range assumes the rebranding of approximately 60 stores, while the high end assumes the rebranding of approximately 120 stores. in addition, we will continue to leverage our diverse and global supply chain and expect tire and oil costs to remain relatively stable to slightly lower year-over-year. as we've discussed, we completed our planned store portfolio optimization during the first quarter. and as a result, we expect the closure of these 42 stores will benefit our operating income by approximately $3.8 million in fiscal 2021. moving on to our actions to reduce costs. as we acted quickly to align our costs with the lower demand, we recognized approximately $15 million of cost reductions in the first quarter and, for the remainder of the year, expect to realize $5 million to $10 million in additional cost benefits. we anticipate lower cost savings in the second quarter as we intend to shift some of our marketing spend to enhance our recruiting initiatives and quickly ramp up staffing in our stores to match improving demand levels.
and with that, i will now turn the call back to brett for some closing remarks.
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, brian. overall, we are encouraged by our gradually improving performance throughout the first quarter and second quarter-to-date and remain cautiously optimistic that demand will continue to improve as this crisis subsides. this is supported by our belief that consumers will drive more, particularly given heightened risk applying and public transportation. further, our industry has traditionally been resilient in the face of a recessionary environment as consumers are more likely to visit an aftermarket retailer like monro to repair the cars they currently own than purchase a new vehicle. while the environment remains very uncertain, i am proud of our organization and how we've responded to these challenges. during the quarter, we made a number of changes to streamline our operations, which, in combination with the traction we are seeing from our monro forward initiatives, position us well to navigate the covid-19 pandemic and emerge stronger from this crisis. we have maintained our commitment to a strong financial position and remain extremely diligent when it comes to capital allocation.
during the second quarter, we plan to resume our store rebrand and reimage initiative, which underscores the strength of our business despite the volatility in the market. in conclusion, i'd like to thank everyone at monro for their outstanding work to protect health and safety across all aspects of our business and drive continuity for our customers. these priorities, further supported by the execution of our monro forward strategy, position us well to deliver long-term value for our shareholders through covid-19 and beyond.
with that, i will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.

[operator instructions] our first questions come from the line of brian nagel with oppenheimer. please proceed with your questions.
brian nagel -- oppenheimer -- analyst
good morning, guys.
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
brian. morning.
brian nagel -- oppenheimer -- analyst
the first question i want to ask, let me make sure i word this correctly, clearly, there's been an improving trajectory in the business through fiscal q1 and then probably, more importantly, here into the early part of fiscal q2. but the question is, what's as you look at the business and what's still holding it back, the negative 12%? and i understand that the monro business is not necessarily comparable to what we see out of the auto parts retailers. but i would say, generally, as the economy the auto business has been rebounding here with covid, we're seeing numbers that would suggest is better than a negative. so the question is, what do you think's holding back monro at this point in not allowing the company to have even stronger or, well, improving or even better trajectory in their business?
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so you might expect, one of the metrics we really look at pretty closely and monitor pretty closely in our business since the onset of this pandemic's been vehicle miles traveled, looking at that as well as gasoline consumption, etc. and our performance, since the onset of the crisis, is really correlated really pretty positively with those metrics. i think when we look at it overall, our business nationally has tracked pretty much in line with the broader national metrics. but having said that, i'm actually very encouraged when you look at this more on the regional level, given monro's high concentration of stores in the northeast and the baltimore, washington area. i think our performance has actually outperformed vmt in those respective areas.
having said that, though i think we certainly have seen in some areas a shortage of labor, as we ramp our labor models back up, we feel like if we are planning on making some focused investments in improving our recruiting capability in q2 to ramp up labor faster to match the demand. and of course, in our business model, as you know, every unit of labor is critical to supporting sales because all of our labor, for the most part, in the store is the sales-producing labor. so i think the top line here, brian, is we're encouraged by our performance when looking at it on a regional basis, but feel like we've got still upside as we ramp up labor and support improving demand. and i'd just add additional color on that. just the positive results that we're seeing from the shift in our digital marketing spend has driven nice increases in our online appointment traffic as well as phone calls to the store that we can measure. and that's really allowed us to be much more targeted in where we invest the marketing dollars at a very granular store level to support needs there, but also helps us identify where we maybe have demand that's being unfulfilled due to labor issues. and in q2, we're going to refocus our energy to supporting recruiting efforts to better align our labor model with stronger pockets of demand that we're maybe underserving today.
brian nagel -- oppenheimer -- analyst
brett, that's very helpful. second question i have, unrelated. just i don't know if you talked about this in your comments at all, but, again, as hopefully the economy start to pull out of the at least the depths of the covid prices, any update on your acquisition activity?
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we commented, given how well the team has navigated through, i think, the crisis from a cash flow point of view and the state of our balance sheet, it's given us confidence, especially in light of the improving trends that we've seen in the business, to restart a couple of major strategic initiatives in our company. one is the rebrand initiatives we talked about. we're going to kick off and do 60 to 120 stores this year, but we've also reengaged our business development team. and we've got a pretty robust pipeline of m&a targets, and our team is actively engaged right now in evaluating those targets. but like always, with monro, we're going to take a very disciplined approach in how we invest our capital on acquisitions, but we certainly are in the mode right now where we are evaluating adding to our portfolio.
brian nagel -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thank you very much. that's the luckier thanks, brian.
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question has come from the line of jonathan lamers of bmo capital markets. please proceed with your question.
jonathan lamers -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
good morning. brian, on slide seven, the eps bridge, what is the $0.45 in the other bucket?
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. that's really driven by largely by the cost reductions that we described in the script and also in the footnote to that slide. so that's about $15 million of reductions that we were able to achieve in the first quarter. and we moved very aggressively at the beginning of the quarter and really in march to meet the lower demand that we were seeing in our business with a lower cost structure in our business. and we focus really on three areas when we did that. we focused on making sure that our labor in our stores was rightsized down to meet the lower demand levels. we also as brett talked about, we focused our marketing on responsive advertising and advertising we could measure and eliminated a lot of the other advertising. and then we also took the opportunity to look at non-store overhead, such in our warehouses and store support center, and adjusted those down as well, primarily through furloughing of some employees there. now as the quarter went on, we saw improving demand trends. and that, in response to the improving demand trends, we added back appropriately to support those higher demand trends across those categories.
as we move forward, we talked about $5 million to $10 million of incremental benefit for fy 2021. and we talked about most of that occurring in the back half of the year. and that's because, as brett described, we are focused in q2 on spending additional resources to continue to increase our labor in the targeted markets where we see adding labor will be appropriate to help support improving demand. probably the biggest question is what happens outside of fy 2021 and what is structural as we move forward out of that those cost savings. and while it's obviously very fluid and things change and plans will change, as we stand today, what we really see is about $10 million to $15 million of structural cost savings that will be with us going forward as we exit fy 2021. and those are, again, across those three categories, roughly 70% coming through the labor reductions, 20% through the marketing and another 10% through non-store overhead reductions. and if you just look at fy 2020 and just assume that your same-store same amount of sales in fy 2020, that will give you about 150 to 250 basis points of structural operating margin improvement that we've created as we come out of that. so long answer, but really within that $0.45 is that cost reduction that i just described.
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
yes. maybe just to if i can add a little color to that, too, just to make a longer answer longer. i might add that these initiatives that we talked about weren't because of covid. they were all planned out prior to covid good as part of our monro forward initiatives on all three vectors. and we just leveraged the good work that the team has done and making good progress on installing some technology that enabled us to accelerate, i think, the pace of those initiatives we were able to capitalize on throughout covid. so it's the good work of the team. i think that's translated the short-term benefit into a long-term structural benefit to our business going forward.
jonathan lamers -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. great answer. just to confirm one point that brian said. that $5 million to $10 million incremental benefit, you're speaking of h2 fiscal year 2021 versus h2 fiscal year 2020. so it's $5 million to $10 million year-over-year? is that right?
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
that is correct.
jonathan lamers -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. switching gears to the rebranded stores. do you have an update on the performance of the previously rebranded stores versus the network this quarter?
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
as we talked about, we saw an outperformance in our rebranded stores versus the others. as you might expect, that given the regional nature of those stores and where they land, geographically speaking, it's tough to draw a comparison. however, what we have seen is about 500 bps of comp sale improvement versus the chain average coming out of our rebranded stores.
jonathan lamers -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. and just on the amazon topical announcement. i'm curious. for the stores that have had amazon on board for more than 12 months, do you have a same-store growth in online orders for that for the quarter or some updated color on how significant the economics could be there?
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean, it's not something we're going to comment on to that level of specificity. i would say we've taken a step back, jonathan, we're but we're pleased, despite the challenges of covid that we've completed the rollout with amazon. we're really pleased with the relationship there, now having installation services available at over 1,240 stores in our 32 states. but similar to that, we're also pleased with our relationships with the other third-party installers. what we have seen during covid that i can comment on is, although maybe not a step-function change in the increase in tire installations from all of our online tire sellers, we have seen a pretty significant increase in our online appointments to get tires installed and serviced on at our stores. so we think that's pretty consistent with our broader thesis around tire is a still pretty confusing category for consumers to shop.
consumers still see value, i think, in talking to professionals and experts at the store location and make sure they got the right tire for their vehicle. so we think it's support of a broader advantage for monro in having 1,250 brick-and-mortar locations, but also overlay continued relationships to expand our omnichannel presence with online third-party resellers as we also continue to pursue our efforts to build out our own e-commerce capability as well.
jonathan lamers -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
just last question on the rebranded stores. i noticed that the tire category significantly outperformed the others this quarter. does that reflect the expanded tire departments for the refreshed stores? or what would you attribute that to?
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think there's three things as we look at our business. i think if you go back to our q4 results, one of the things we talked about was a fairly soft january and february start to the year on tires. so i think we did see probably the industry felt a little benefit from some pent-up demand from calendar q1 that rolled into calendar q2. so that's one dynamic. however, really pleased with our team's efforts on rolling out our category management pricing tool. we have that now operationalized, covering just under half of our stores right now. and as you might expect, we picked the highest-volume, highest-impact tire stores with that system being installed. and i think, clearly, that's helped. the rebranding of our stores certainly has also been a self-help initiative. and the fourth variable we talked about was around the shift to digital marketing and the good work our marketing team has done on improving our seo performance. as we talked about, we are now ranked in the top three on online search for our core categories and over or right around half of our stores. so those four things, i think, are coming together. that's creating the outsized performance in a key category like tires.
jonathan lamers -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you for your comments.
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, jon.
operator
thank you. our next question has come from the line of bret jordan with jefferies. please proceed with your question.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, good morning guys. i guess, as you think about the labor issues at the store level, do you have a feeling, i guess, in that comp for july how much might have been lost to labor shortage? i mean, can you quantify, i guess, maybe through the digital phone system the number of customer requests you get that you can't fulfill? or, i guess, sort of what's the headwind in the market versus the headwind in your own labor capacity?
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
yes. as you might expect, it's a little difficult to kind of parse that, come up with a definitive number. i think we feel like, bret, it's we could have delivered better performance have we had the right labor. obviously, to what degree is the question. i will say i'd point to the metrics that we're watching really closely, now that we got the technology to be able to do it, is, obviously, online appointments and the phone traffic that we're seeing in two stores. and we're really encouraged by the level of effort that the marketing team has done to translate that into very positive demand signals that we're seeing on the front end. that's allowing us to pinpoint the investment on addressing labor concerns, but translate that into a comp sales estimates's probably a little more difficult for us to do. one thing i can point out for you, though, however, is we're still operating on a fewer number of stores that are open on sundays in our business. pre-covid, we had roughly 840 stores that were opened on sunday during q1.
we ramped that down to about 400 stores. and in july, right now, we're up to 600 that are open on sunday. but we believe that created about a 2% comp headwind in the quarter just by having fewer stores open on sunday. so a little easier to quantify that in terms of headwind. but the labor part, what we see as an opportunity, that's unmet right now. and that's reason why we're refocusing some of our marketing investment to market for candidates from a recruiting point of view as our consumer demand appears to be pretty strong.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. could you talk a little bit about the west coast performance? and obviously, it's sort of a new market, but you talked about south outperforming the northeast, but how was the west in general?
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
yes. as you know, we're kind of lapping our initial acquisition into california. and we are really, really pleased with the progress that we're seeing in our acquired stores, relatively speaking, certainly on a year-on-year basis. you saw that in our results. the integration of california is all but done. we've had a few permitting issues on signs out in california, but las vegas is doing performing extremely well for us, relatively speaking. but we're just really encouraged by the strength of the platform that we've built now out in california that pivoting and talking about our m&a strategy, i think, gives us a lot of confidence now to look at a number of targets in our pipeline and get a real strong consideration.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and then, brian, i guess, can i get the housekeeping, the monthly comps for april through june?
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. we were down 41% in april, 24% in may, 14% in june, and then, obviously, down 12% in july. preliminary rate.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
all right, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question has come from the line of rick nelson with stephens. please proceed with your question.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
thanks. good morning. i'd like to follow up on the july sales trend. you were down 12%. if you could speak to any sequential changes as the month progressed? are those declines narrowing?
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
well, as we talked about, we exited i guess, june finished up down 14%. so we saw, obviously, moderating improvement from june, july. as we talked about, rick, i think it's a tale of two cities. we saw the improvements accelerate in the northeast, but that was counteracted in the middle part of july with the slowdown of the pace of recovery that we saw in the south. exiting july now, rolling into what's our fiscal august, we're encouraged by continued gradual improvement that we're seeing in our business overall.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
yes. brett, the markets, where we we've seen this recent covid outbreaks to southern states, are you seeing any changes in customer behavior or sales trends there?
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i think it's consistent with what we said. that's where we're largely seeing a slowdown of, i would say, the improvement. we're still seeing improvement, but the pace of the improvement certainly has slowed as we've seen the outbreaks increase. it's a pretty tight correlation between those two variables.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
okay. got you. brian, curious about the independents, how you think they're performing here during the covid challenges and your appetite to step on the gas on the acquisition front. are there more willing sellers, less willing sellers? any comments on valuation would be helpful.
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, i think there's a couple of things at play here. i think, certainly, our pipeline is robust, as we've talked about, certainly, i think as robust as i've seen in my tenure year at monro. as it relates to the health of the independents, i think, certainly, the government programs around paycheck protection has certainly helped, i think, a lot of those operators bridge maybe the decline in demand that we have seen during this period of time. so i wouldn't necessarily call out anything in particular there. but i think the mood and the sentiment, i think, is consistent with what it was pre-covid. i think we've got a lot of independent owners that maybe lack second-generation succession plans for their business, and they certainly are interested in exploring options to exit. so we just feel really good about the improvement in our business, the state of our balance sheet and the attractiveness about the opportunities in our pipeline that we see that gives us confidence to restart the rebranding initiative as well as, obviously, conversations around acquiring companies going forward.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
your expectation for miles driven. we've seen some challenges there. i know some businesses like google are talk about opening out july of 2021. do you think there is a correlation between offices opening and miles driven? or how do you see that shaping up?
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. look, i think look, there's still a lot to unfold there, of course, once we get through the core crisis of the core pandemic and understand what structural changes take place in the form of consumer behavior, whether it's working in office and commuting there or shopping behavior is another area, i think that's tbd. but brett?
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
so i think it's still uncertain, rick, in terms of what how that plays out. i think when we look also to the countervailing measures as well that's probably in our favor around a shift from mass transit to cars, less apt to be on airplanes and drive to more destinations, more willingness to have drive-away vacations versus air travel. so there's a lot of countervailing things, i think, that creates a positive offset to any of the negatives. but i get the overlay, just the general sentiment around potential recessionary environment. and as we've talked about, we're pretty defensible here in our business as consumers hold on to their cars longer, become a little more value-conscious in their behavior, we feel like monro is well positioned with our supply chain, our cost structure and our store concentration to be well positioned to capitalize on those future trends, if they take fold.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
thanks and good luck. thanks. rick.
operator
thank you. our next question has come from the line of steph benjamin of suntrust. please proceed with your question.
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, good morning.
steph benjamin -- suntrust -- analyst
good morning. i was wondering if you could speak a bit on some of the new pricing and category management tools that you might have in place for other categories. just maybe remind me, i believe you had some on brakes and tires. so what might be the next leg to that stool? and then if you could also remind us, as we look for this year, what other initiatives in the monro forward strategy are the big focus? obviously, you called out the rebranding, but what's the next initiative beyond the rebranding and the tire pricing tool? yes.
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, stephanie. i'll let brian handle the second part of the question. but as it relates to the category management tools, tires is over 50% of our business, the most important category. it's also the category that lends itself to being shopped by consumers, and pricing's extremely important. so that's the reason why we focus there with our more sophisticated big data category management system that we're like i mentioned, we're operational now with about 500-plus stores that are using the system. we expect that to roll out completely across our store base by q3. once we get that done, certainly, the logic will apply for other core categories like brakes and certainly oil, but i will say those categories are less price-sensitive with consumers outside of oil. i would say brakes and other services in-store are normally not shopped. they're usually bought through an in-store selling/conversion process. so i think the premise applies that the degree of improvement that we would expect to see there is probably diminished. so category's a clear focus there. for us, key initiatives here are near term for us. it's all about rolling out the scheduling system in our business.
that helps us operationalize all the staffing model changes that we made during covid around getting the staffing mix right, by installing the cloud-based tool, which we now have in pilot in a couple of markets. that's going to begin to scale and will be done by the end of q3 as well. that just helps us operationalize that, create tighter controls over that, given the cloud-based visibility that we get, and allows us to make more refinements real-time, given the visibility that we get in our business. but a lot of the benefits that we saw in q1 that we expect to translate into structural changes going forward were due to the strategic moves we made that's just now enabled in a more efficient way through the cloud-based system. and, brian, do you want to add color on that go-forward?
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i think as it relates to the tire category management pricing system, very similar, it will be a continuation of that into q3 as we continue to roll that out very similar to the time line on the store staffing and scheduling. so the next couple of quarters will be getting those two initiatives firmly in place across our entire store base. we'll also be continuing to leverage our the new store network infrastructure upgrade. so as we've now got the digital phone system on, we'll be looking at other ways to leverage that. one of the items that we've talked about is cloud-based inspection and a more sophisticated way of interacting with the consumer, particularly as it relates to streamlining online appointments and further improving our omnichannel presence with the consumer now that we've got the in-store technology in place. and then, of course, we're continuing to build out and really fill in our monro university platform to continue the career pathing of our technicians, which, as we exit this with the right staffing and the workforce, it's going to be imperative for us to make sure that we've got that workforce trained and on a career path where we can continue to achieve the lower levels of turnover that we were experiencing pre-covid based on the investments we've already made in monro u.
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
so maybe just to bring it all together, i think if you literally lay out the monro forward, our whole objective was to drive sustainable growth in this business organically by creating a scalable platform that drives consistency from store-to-store. and what i'm encouraged by our progress the team has made is year one in our transformational strategy is about building the foundation. so we've installed a lot of underlying technology to help enable these next-generation tools and technology to take hold. and this year has been about installing major transformational systems around labor management and tire pricing. and once those two are largely behind us, it allows us, as an organization, to march forward, i think, more aggressively around the m&a front because we feel like we've got a very scalable platform built on technology with the right operational playbook that guarantees consistency from store-to-store. that gives us a lot of confidence to accelerate the m&a portion of our growth strategy going forward. we're really pleased with the progress and the acceleration we were able to do on that during the first quarter of our business.
steph benjamin -- suntrust -- analyst
thanks so much for all the color. i'll leave it there.
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, steph.
operator
thank you. our next question has come from the line of scott stember of cl king. please proceed with your question.
scott stember -- cl king -- analyst
good morning, guys. can you maybe dimensionalize the gap or difference if it's meaningful in comp performance between the southern stores and the northern region stores?
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, we talked about that, and i think we said that we were seeing a slowdown in the south, and that was about maybe an outperformance of 500 basis points plus in the north. and then we saw that narrow i'm sorry, underperformance in the north. and then we saw that narrow as the quarter as we exited the quarter in july.
scott stember -- cl king -- analyst
okay. i got it. and just trying to touch on the point of the underperformance versus the industry. i know you guys talked about store staffing. but can you maybe talk about the employment trends within your markets, your the customer you have and whether they're potentially feeling not so good and delaying some larger-ticket purchases such as brakes, which were down an outsized amount in the quarter?
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i think look, i think that's it's certainly going to be a factor, i think, going forward, scott. so once we get through the core crisis, if you will, i think that's going to be the next thing, i think, we need to be very conscientious about, which is how quickly does employment levels bounce back? which is a big, i think, variable in driving vehicle miles traveled. as it relates to comments about that in our market, so i think we probably don't have a ton of granularity around that. one of the things we did say in our last call that applies to this quarter as well is part of our outsized performance, we believe, on the tire category, given the fact it's a higher tire or excuse me, higher ticket normally with tires, we did see some outperformance in that category around the time frame where the stimulus checks were hitting consumers' households. so we as we got further away from the stimulus checks, certainly, i think that's tempered performance. but i think you fairly characterized one element that we're going to be watching pretty closely, which is how quickly employment levels bounce back. and that's obviously part of the reason why we haven't provided guidance. it's just the uncertainty still with a balance around employment levels and vehicle miles traveled post pandemic.
scott stember -- cl king -- analyst
all right. and just lastly, could you talk about brakes in the quarter? i know that you said that everything improved sequentially as the quarter progressed. but maybe just talk about why brakes were down so much. it's usually one of the things that you can't defer. so i'm just trying to get my hands around that.
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think a couple of things in the quarter. if you look at as we talked about, i think, back in our q4, january, february, we had maybe undersized performance as an industry in tires. that certainly has bounced back into our q1. conversely, if you look at brake performance, the peak demand months for our business is usually exiting the winter months. so it puts you in the march, april, may time frames and be able to say that was the peak time frame, where i think we saw maximum covid impact, number one, with consumer, but, also, we probably had the tightest labor conditions in our stores during that same period of time. so i think if you overlay that macro dynamic with also possibly seeing some share of wallet issues with the consumer, where if you have two large ticket items that need to be done on your car, tires and brakes, in many cases, you'll have to choose one of those. so we would expect to see breaks to recover a little bit later on in our year. and also, brian and our team is working on secondary financing options, i think, as well, to just open up more credit availability to consumers that may be getting a little tight with household discretionary funds.
scott stember -- cl king -- analyst

operator
good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to monro inc's earnings conference call for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. [operator instructions]
i would now like to introduce ms. maureen mulholland, executive vice president and chief legal officer at monro. please go ahead.
maureen e. mulholland -- executive vice president and chief legal officer and secretary
thank you. hello everyone, and thank you for joining us on this morning's call. before we get started, please note that as part of this call, we will be referencing a presentation that is available on the investors section of our website at corporate.monro.com/investors/investor-resources. if i could draw your attention to the safe harbor statement on slide two, i'd like to remind participants that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about monro's future performance. actual results may differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. the most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in monro's filings with the sec and in our earnings release and include a significant uncertainty relating to the duration and scope of the covid-19 pandemic, and its impact on our customers, executive officers and employees.
the company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. additionally, on today's call, management statements include a discussion of certain non-gaap financial measures, which are intended to supplement and not to be substitutes for comparable gaap measures. reconciliations of such supplemental information to the comparable gaap measures will be included as part of today's presentation and in our earnings release.
with that, i'd like to turn the call over to our president and chief executive officer, mike broderick. mike?
michael broderick -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, maureen, and good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us. we had a great start to the new fiscal year with top-line performance above pre-pandemic levels. we delivered double-digit comparable store sales growth across all our regions and categories, driven by strong demand, progress on our in-store operational excellence initiatives and consistent execution across the entire organization. over the last few months, i've enjoyed diving into the business with the support of our senior leadership team and getting to know our teammates better. i would like to thank them for their outstanding efforts and continued dedication to our customers.
turning to slide three. while we are not completely out of the covid tunnel, we are encouraged by our strong fiscal first quarter performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year. our first quarter performance reflects higher traffic and higher average ticket sales compared to the same period last year. importantly, we exited the first quarter with strong momentum in our first second quarter -- fiscal second quarter-to-date with comps up approximately 15% in fiscal july compared to comps down 12% in the same period last year. this represents an acceleration from june, and we are encouraged to see comparable store sales levels trending above pre-covid performance. we're seeing continued improvements in vehicle miles driven as more consumers start to reengage in their daily activities and commute miles return. we are particularly encouraged to see oil change customers starting to migrate back to our full-service offering. additionally, consumers are holding on to their cars longer as evidenced by lower new car sales, which means they continue to invest in their vehicles. as a best-in-class service provider, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on these favorable trends and the strengthening demand environment.
moving on to slide four, we have a clear path forward and our teammates will be the key enabler for us to realize the full potential of our growth strategy. operational excellence starts with our teammates, and we're committed to investing in our people to drive an engaged, inclusive, and high-performing team. it is our goal to be the employer of choice in the automotive service industry, and our deep bench of talented technicians is paramount to our success as an organization. to ensure that we attract and retain the best talent, we offer career advancement and a robust curriculum with our online training platform, monro university. we also provide our technicians with the automotive service excellence certification to advance their technical skill set and support their career growth while increasing productivity and ensuring top-quality service for our customers. our continued investment in highly trained and certified technicians is a key tenet of our employer value proposition and an important differentiator in the industry. since the beginning of fiscal '22, we have continued to hire new technicians to match the surge in customer demand and to ensure we have optimal staffing levels in our stores to meet the continued growth in our service categories going forward.
in addition, we've recently added two industry veterans to our leadership team. matt henson, as our new chief human resource officer and david nichols as our senior vice president of marketing and category management. matt brings broad experience in leading large-scale performance driven teams and will focus on advancing our vision to be a best-in-class field-led service organization. david will focus on enhancing monro's brand position in the communities in which we serve and support our strategic customer-focused initiatives as we aim to be our customer's number one choice for automotive services. with the continued support of our board of directors, i am committed to ensuring the continuity of monro's growth and transformation strategy through our monro forward initiatives.
in fact, my conviction has only grown stronger over the past few months that we have the right strategy for our organization. our top priority now is to bring these initiatives to life in every store, for every guest, and for every teammate. at the heart of this strategy is our customer-centric approach and the monro way of serving our communities. we are focused on bringing customers the professionalism and high-quality service they expect from a national retailer with the convenience and trust of a neighborhood garage. when new customers visit our stores, our technicians are able to inspect their vehicles and provide them with a clear understanding of their vehicle needs. this complementary inspection gives us the opportunity to recommend other needed services to the customer, and perform these services during the current or future visits. our objective is to build a lifetime relationship with our customer, from their first visit to our store through the entire life cycle of their car service journey.
turning to slide five. in addition to supporting our monro forward initiatives, our strong cash flow and solid financial position affords us the opportunity to take advantage of strategic and value-accretive consolidation opportunities in our fragmented industry. we closed the acquisition of the mountain view tire and service in april, further solidifying our footprint in the western region with 30 retail stores in the los angeles area. we have been focused on seamlessly integrating this acquisition, and i'm pleased with the contribution to date. strategically, located acquisitions at attractive valuations remain a cornerstone of our growth strategy. we have a robust acquisition pipeline and are well positioned to take advantage of the many opportunities for consolidation in our industry. we are excited about our growth prospects in the attractive and dynamic western region, and as previously mentioned, we will also leverage greenfields to fill out our footprint and optimize store density where needed. our scalable platform allows us to quickly build new stores to meet our target customers where they are while leveraging our playbook to ensure a consistently high-quality experience in each store. we have opened six greenfields during the past 1.5 years and are currently considering several additional opportunities in markets where we are underpenetrated.
in summary, we delivered outstanding performance this quarter and see a number of opportunities for both, top line and margin expansion going forward. from a top line perspective, we believe we can drive higher traffic to our stores as vehicles miles driven improves. in addition, as we continue to drive stronger performance in our service categories, we also expect our sales mix to favorably impact our margins. as we look forward on our customers, teammates and in-store execution will be the key drivers to realize the full potential of our monro forward strategy. we will invest in our people who will be critical in our success through the next phase of our transformation. we will focus on advancing our vision to be a best-in-class field led service organization to increase the overall lifetime value to our customers and stakeholders. lastly, our steadfast commitment to drive strong cash flow will allow us to continue to invest in attractive acquisitions, and greenfield expansion opportunities to build a strong, scalable platform for sustainable growth.
with that, i'll now turn the call over to brian, who will provide an overview of monro's first quarter performance and strong financial position. brian?
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, mike, and good morning, everyone. let me take a few minutes to talk about our first quarter performance and the meaningful progress we made in the quarter. turning to slide six. sales increased 38.4% year-over-year to a record $341.8 million in the first quarter, up approximately 8% compared to pre-covid levels in fiscal 2020. same-store sales increased 34.5%, driven by our key service categories and continued strength in tires. sales from new stores increased by $14.1 million, including $13.6 million from recent acquisitions. gross margin increased 140 basis points from the prior year to 36.8%. the year-over-year increase was due to higher comparable store sales, which resulted in lower fixed distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales. also contributing was a higher sales mix of service categories compared to the prior year period. variable gross profit was positively impacted by an 8% year-over-year increase in gross profit per tire, reflecting the benefits of our tire category management and pricing tool.
regarding labor costs, our training initiatives continue to drive increased labor productivity. however, we experienced higher technician labor costs as a percentage of sales due to more technicians working overtime in order to meet the surge in demand. we expect this to moderate as we increase staffing levels. we also expect continued gross margin improvement versus prior year as our service category sales continue to strengthen. we continue to execute disciplined cost controls with total operating expenses of $98 million or 28.7% of sales as compared to $76.1 million or 30.8% of sales in the prior year period. the year-over-year dollar increase included $3.9 million in one-time litigation settlement costs. we also had higher store management and advertising expenses in the quarter to support higher consumer demand. the remaining dollar increase was from the expenses of 44 net new stores. our decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of sales resulted from an increase in comparable store sales. and excluding litigation settlement costs, operating expenses for the first quarter were 27.5% of sales compared to 30.8% of sales in the prior year period. we previously disclosed in our periodic reports and employee wage and hour action filed against us. a settlement agreement is currently being reviewed, and we believe that the settlement is in the best interest of our company.
operating income for the first quarter more than doubled to $27.9 million or 8.2% of sales as compared to $11.4 million or 4.6% of sales in the prior year period. excluding litigation settlement costs, operating income for the first quarter was $31.8 million or 9.3% of sales. net interest expense decreased to $6.9 million as compared to $7.4 million in the same period last year. this was principally due to a decrease in weighted average debt, partially offset by higher average interest rates. income tax expense was $5.3 million compared to $1 million in the prior year period. net income was $15.7 million as compared to $3 million in the same period last year. diluted earnings per share was $0.46 compared to $0.09 for the same period last year. adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter, a non-gaap measure, was $0.55, which excluded $0.09 per share related to one-time litigation settlement costs, $0.01 per share of acquisition due diligence and integration costs and $0.01 per share benefit from an adjustment to the estimate for prior year store closing costs. this compares to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.15 for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, which excluded $0.06 per share of store closing costs.
as highlighted on slide seven, we continue to have significant financial flexibility to support our operations and execute our long-term growth strategy. we generated $63 million of cash from operations in the first quarter. we maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation and invested $5 million in capital expenditures, paid $62 million for acquisitions and spent $10 million in principal payments for financing leases. additionally, we distributed $8 million in dividends. our balance sheet and liquidity position remains strong. at the end of the quarter, we had net bank debt of $181 million and a net bank debt-to-ebitda ratio of 1.1 times. we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $17 million in availability under our revolving credit facility of approximately $372 million. as we progress through fiscal 2022, we remain committed to managing our business for maximum cash flow. first, we plan to continue to make operational enhancements across our business to expand margins. these efforts, combined with top line growth, will drive ebitda growth and increase cash flow generation. in fiscal 2022, we continue to expect approximately $15 million to $20 million in structural cost savings in addition to $5 million in benefits from store closures compared to fiscal 2020. in addition, we remain focused on working capital improvement, and we believe we have additional opportunity in this area.
turning to our outlook on slide eight. the covid-19 situation remains fluid, which makes it difficult to accurately forecast the impact of the ongoing pandemic on our future operations. while we're not providing formal guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2022, we remain optimistic given our first quarter momentum and strong second quarter to-date sales and gross margin trajectory. however, we do expect comparable store sales growth to moderate as compared to the 34.5% we achieved in the first quarter, as comparisons get less favorable in the second quarter through the end of the year. and for the second quarter, comparisons become less favorable during the latter part of the quarter compared to july comps.
lastly, we have provided some financial assumptions to assist with your modeling. we expect tire and oil costs to increase year-over-year, and in light of cost increases in general inflation in the current environment, we'll continue to leverage our diversified supply chain and cost leadership position. we have a successful track record of operating in an inflationary environment, while maintaining and expanding gross margins. lastly, regarding our capital expenditures, we expect to spend approximately $30 million to $45 million in fiscal 2022, dependent upon the amount of store refresh activity that we undertake.
and with that, i'll now turn the call back to mike for some closing remarks.
michael broderick -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, brian. we're very encouraged by our robust performance in the first quarter and optimistic about the outlook of our business. overall, we continue to be well positioned to capitalize our strengthening demand and have the financial flexibility to execute our growth strategy to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. as highlighted in slide nine, i would like to update you on our corporate responsibility efforts, which continue to be the lens for evaluating risks and opportunities that could materially impact our business over the long term. as part of our commitment to accountability and transparency in this area, i'm excited to report that we increased the oversight of our esg strategy at the senior leadership and board levels, and recently launched monro forward responsibly, our first corporate responsibility report. we view our responsibility to our teammates, customers, the communities in which we operate, and doing our part to take care of the environment as not only the right thing to do, but as an integral component of our long-term planning and success.
while we are early in our formalized esg journey, our report maps to the appropriate sasb standards for the multiline and specialty retailers and auto parts industry, and we are committed to increasing our disclosures over time. working with matt henson, our new chief human resource officer, we are excited to further align talent development with our business goals and solidify our diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy, which we believe will be instrumental in driving an engaged workforce to better serve our customers and communities. we look forward to sharing additional information on these important initiatives in the quarters and years ahead.
with that, i'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions.

good morning.
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, jonathan.
jonathan lamers -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
for july, how close were those service categories to returning to fiscal 2020 levels?
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. this is brian, jonathan. i appreciate the question. if you look at our performance in the service categories, you can obviously see for the quarter nice sequential progress in those categories as well as outperformance related to the overall comp. so, we saw leadership in q1 from our service categories, which as we noted, really helped us to improve our year-over-year and sequential gross margins. we saw those continued trends into july with our up 15 being led higher by the service categories, which is creating a nice trajectory in our growth -- continued increase in our gross margin performance year-over-year. so we are, i think, making good progress. overall, our comparable store sales are trending higher than they were in fy '20, but we still have opportunities to strengthen our service categories to get to pre-covid levels.

okay, great. and just a follow-up on that. with vehicle travel stabilizing, is there any reason that sales mix will not return to historical levels? has recruitment been a constraint, or have there been any market share changes we should be aware of?
michael broderick -- president and chief executive officer
jonathan, this is mike. thanks for the question. i don't see any constraints. i would say that the biggest opportunity that we have is on the recruitment and development side. a lot of the focus that we have really starting before '22 was really bringing our team on back from to enable our stores, getting back to staffing levels that they can handle the surge in business. and what you're seeing right now is a very healthy shift in mix on the categories. so, we just need to make sure that we have the technicians, and we're constantly recruiting just like pre-pandemic levels, we're constantly recruiting to making sure that we're staffed for the jobs that our customers requires to perform.
jonathan lamers -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thanks. and on the acquisition pipeline, is there any further color you can share with us. in the past, you've talked about the number of lois you've signed, for example, and are you seeing any change in multiples or willingness to sell at this stage?
michael broderick -- president and chief executive officer
jonathan, i'll start. i think there's a lot of activity going on right now. we don't have anything to talk about in this earnings release, but i would say there's a lot of opportunity out there. so, we are as aggressive as ever. we're financially positioned extremely well. and where we can't, just like my prepared remarks, if we can't buy, we will build. and i feel very strongly that there's a lot of green space for us, especially as we go out west, and when you look at these marketplaces such as colorado, arizona, texas, and then filling out california, it's just a fantastic opportunity. so, not specifically talking about anything, but we look forward to sharing with you some more good news on future earnings calls.
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and jonathan, the only thing i would add to that is while we didn't comment on the 10-plus ndas, we are still at those levels like we have been historically. so to mike's point, the level of activity is strong and historical multiples are still within the ranges of where we've been -- current multiples are still in the ranges of where we've been historically.
jonathan lamers -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
and apart although with greenfields, there is a longer time for development of the stores. are there some advantages to building out greenfield versus acquiring brownfield in some of these regions?
michael broderick -- president and chief executive officer
jonathan, this is mike. i'll handle that. good question. i've actually spent time this weekend in our greenfields down south. the biggest upside is, literally, you are creating a best-in-class experience. you have your model. it's just really clean. it's a beautiful looking store, and not only that, it's been built to be very efficient. and we're not dealing with 30 old problems, we're dealing with really -- when we introduce our new team, they're actually seeing a shiny penny. and i do believe on the greenfield, what i'm receiving from in my travels over this weekend is that customers like to come to these new stores too, in many cases. but with that being said, i think that's where our focus right now, especially on some of the acquisitions that we have done in the past, our focus out west is really to get these acquisitions up to speed, getting our rebrand reimage caught up on the acquisitions in california so that we have a best-in-class environment for not only our customers but also for our teammates.
jonathan lamers -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
i'll pass the line. thanks for your comments.

our next question is with brian nagel with oppenheimer and company. please proceed with your question.
brian nagel -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
hi, good morning.
michael broderick -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, brian.
brian nagel -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
congratulations on a nice quarter, nice start to the year.
michael broderick -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
brian nagel -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
so, the question i want to ask is -- and i understand it's going to be difficult to answer but if we look at this -- the improvement in sales here in this quarter and you parse it out. i mean, how do you think this -- as we try to gauge the, so to say, sustainability of it? and i think you recognize that you gave some nice parameters how we should think about that through the balance of the year, but if you look at the quarter, i guess the question is, i mean, how much do you think that is pent-up demand on the heels of the pandemic, and then second and probably more importantly, are you seeing evidence that the monro forward initiatives are helping the company to perform better as this demand is returning?
michael broderick -- president and chief executive officer
brian, let me take a shot. this is mike. thanks for the question. i would say that with regards to monro forward, remember, just to remind everybody, we touched people, product, promotion, technology and then on top of it, we rebrand and reimage. so we touched a lot. so, most of my focus right now is really how do we bring this to life, not only for our customers, for our teammates. so it's all about in-store execution. what i would like to point you to is when we talked about some of what i'm proud of, of the team and what they delivered is our tire business was up 25%. our alignments are truly attachment, and that's all about the culture and making sure we're taking care of the customers properly, that's up significantly over our entire performance. so, i'm actually seeing our teammates react, and they're doing the right thing for the customer. that's some of what i believe is very sustainable in our business model going forward.
brian nagel -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
got it. then the second question i wanted to ask, you mentioned -- or it was mentioned in the prepared comments, it's about cost inflation. to what extent have you been able to pass these costs along? and any thoughts on that going forward?
michael broderick -- president and chief executive officer
okay. this is mike again, but i welcome brian's comments also. but let me just give context. i've been calling on monro for 20 years. monro has done an excellent job managing expenses over the tenure that i've been involved with monro. as a supplier, i can definitely relate to that. so we've done an excellent job with that but let me give you a broader context. when you look at inflation, there's a lot of conversation about inflation, on the service categories, most of the cost is around people, and when you look at the repair order, the cost of labor is the biggest component. and brian talked about that in the prepared remarks, managing overtime, making sure we're scheduled properly, making sure people are not spending the overtime because we have enough people to be able to manage the demand. now, that's half our business. the other half of the business is very much tires. now that's a different story. most of the cost is tires. so our tire category management is very relevant, and i see that really driving significant value in our company. i believe it's very sustainable, and it's really just managing good, better, best, traditional retail methodology of managing costs.
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. and the only thing i would add to that, brian, is that, that's exactly why we highlighted the 8% year-over-year improvement in gross profit per tire. it really shows that, that category management tool and our attention to managing the tire category is allowing us to navigate any inflation that we may be seeing.
brian nagel -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
i appreciate all the color. thank you.

bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, good morning, guys.
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, bret.
michael broderick -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, bret.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
on the labor inflation on ex overtime, could you talk about sort of maybe what a regular hour inflation rate might be on the labor side? yes. this is brian, bret. we haven't seen significant labor pressure related to the rate. as you know, our compensation plans for our technicians are incentive-based and productivity based. and so most of our technicians are earning wages in excess of our -- any stated clock rate. so that allows us to be very competitive with those programs and really reward productivity and reward volume and sales and throughput of the stores. so, i think that's allowed -- our model has allowed us to mitigate any of that labor inflation that might be out there in other parts of retail. so really, the drive for the quarter was really driven by that overtime differential. okay. and i guess when you think about investment in the infrastructure, distribution in the southeast or the west, are you thinking you've got enough scale in those markets to build out distribution infrastructure?
michael broderick -- president and chief executive officer
bret, let me take that. this is mike. thanks for the question. we are looking at building or partnering. and that's probably the best way to say it. there's a lot of partners that are looking to do business with monro to enable our stores to be able to properly take care of their customers. so in the three to four months that i've been here, i'm really trying to develop partnerships and who's looking to support monro. the good news is there's a lot of people that want to do a lot of business with monro. so, if we can't find the appropriate partnerships we'll build, similar to our greenfield strategy, but i feel confident that we can partner with long-term -- in a long-term relationship that will enable us to continue to grow our service business.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
okay, great. and then, brian, just the housekeeping. could you give us the monthly for the quarter comp?
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, sure. we were up 76% in april, 28% in may, 14% in june and then again, 15% in july. and that trend is obviously reflective of prior year comparable trends as well.

good morning.
stephanie moore -- truist -- analyst
i wanted to touch on the sg and a side of this for a second. i know you talked about having to step up some overall labor expenses just to meet staffing means, but also have a pretty nice structural cost savings baked into expectations for this year. so, as you kind of look at the whole picture here, do you think that there's an opportunity maybe to exceed the structural cost savings target that you align, maybe as you get revenue up to, call it pre-covid levels, kind of look at the business model over the course of the last year and make some changes? any color there would be helpful. thanks.
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i appreciate the question, stephanie. i think if you look at our -- excluding the legal settlement, if you look at that 27.5% g and a as a percent of sales, i think that's right on our internal expectations and right where we expect to continue to trend as the quarters move forward. so, i think we're happy with the leverage that we're seeing in our business and the flow-through that those higher sales are driving. as we certainly would have expected and did expect, we added back advertising expenses versus the prior year levels, which were pretty much completely just to emergency levels last year from an advertising standpoint as the lockdowns in the consumer environment did not lend itself to marketing, but we're back to levels that we feel are appropriate to support the demand. much more efficient than entering covid with our digital strategy and our crm strategy. so we're getting better return on advertising dollar spent, but still bringing advertising levels to be supportive of our current demand environment. so, i think we've got the g and a structure right where we wanted at the levels i described and would look for that to continue as we move through q2 and q3.
stephanie moore -- truist -- analyst

david bellinger -- wolfe research -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking the question.
michael broderick -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
david bellinger -- wolfe research -- analyst
another one on labor constraints and the inflation we're seeing across the marketplace. is any comment on if that got better or worse through the quarter? any impact from the child tax care -- credit that we saw more recently? and how long do you think these labor issues persist before we get back to call it a normalized labor environment?
michael broderick -- president and chief executive officer
david, this is mike. thanks for the question. i'll start, and i'm sure brian will pile on with the labor conversation. let me just make sure everybody goes back even before pre-covid. labor, the technician development, a lot of what we've talked about in the past with training, how we develop our technicians, that's been paramount. none of that's changing. it's actually just been elevated as we continue to invest in our training initiatives, building out a best-in-class training organization so that we can take people who are entering into our service community and really developing their skills to be able to take care of the cost. so that's what we've done. before pre-covid, it's just been enhanced really in fiscal '22.
now from a recruiting perspective, i want to be clear. we have over 5,000 technicians, and i appreciate every one of them. we do have hot spots. with those hotspots, we are incredibly focused on making sure that we're staffed and that we're building out the team with qualified technicians that can do all jobs, both around the wheel and under hood because that's where the business is going, that is what customers expect from a full service provider. that is always going to be a challenge, but it starts with bringing people on early and then investing in them with training so that we can really drive the full-service offering in the communities that we serve. now is that a challenge? yes, but it's something that's been challenged for the industry for many years. i do believe that we will be the destination for our -- because we're focused on our technicians first, we will be the destination for the best technicians in the marketplace. that's the goal that we have for our organization.
david bellinger -- wolfe research -- analyst
that's very helpful. appreciate all that. and just my follow-up. you mentioned potentially building more locations as opposed to buying. are you factoring higher cost now with steel and other commodities moving up? any quantification of that, if you could?
michael broderick -- president and chief executive officer
sure. it goes back to -- thank you for the question. it goes back to my other comment. when you look at raw materials, that's more on the service side of the business. so when you look at brakes, rotors, that's a smaller component of actually our true cost. most of it is all about labor and managing labor. brian talked about the overtime, and we have to mitigate overtime through proper staffing levels. so, we give our teammates days off and they stay very productive when they do come to work for us. so, that is the focus that we have right now. with regards to the commodities and what those -- we are able to obviously continue to manage those expenses, and then we've always been able to prove to pass along those expenses to the consumer. at the same time, staying extremely competitive to our competition in the marketplace.
david bellinger -- wolfe research -- analyst

our next question is from rick nelson from stephens. please proceed with your question.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
thanks and good morning. i'd like to ask about tire units in the quarter, how those changed and what you think industry growth was in that period?
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i'll take that. rick, this is brian. thanks for the question. we had -- we were up 25%, as we said in our tire category, and that was really kind of equal parts of units and price mix. and so we feel good about the balance there and it certainly helped us to deliver that 8% gross profit per tire that i discussed. and i think that as we look at our performance versus the tire industry throughout the pandemic and certainly, as we've entered into fiscal 2022, we feel like we've said, that our unit performance has been at or slightly above the u.s. tire industry. so continued good performance there, driving units, driving average selling price and driving margin, a lot of the benefits from our category management.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
okay, thanks for that. any thoughts on why tire sales are lagging? are you, in fact, trading the sales for merger in the tire category?
michael broderick -- president and chief executive officer
rick, i'll take that. this is mike. i would say that i think it's not the tire sales are lagging. it's just our focus on the service categories. that's how i look at it. we're staying extremely competitive. we are focused on profitable sales but at the -- i think the theme that we should walk away from this conversation is the fact that we are now focused on the service business. we love selling tires, but we love selling service. and the fact that our service business now is getting the attention and the focus for it to continue to grow, and that should enable consistent comp sales growth quarter-over-quarter and also significant margin improvement.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
[indecipherable] that kind of makes sense. i'm so curious on the mountain view stores, how those stores are performing relative to your expectations? any changes you're putting into those stores? are you rebranding those stores?
michael broderick -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, rick. this is mike. i'll take that. i was out there. i love those stores. they've been very successful for us. i've been extremely pleased with the first three months. remember, just everybody that was an april 26 close. so we did talk about that in the last call, but they are contributing immediately. just quality people. they are heavy service business, and they just have a great reputation in the marketplace. now we -- with mountain view and allen tire, now we're in the process of reimaging those stores, making sure that they are up to snuff on -- with regards to everything we've done with monro forward. and that's for the back half of the year, we're really going to get those stores cleaned up.

good morning, scott.
scott stember -- cl king and associates -- analyst
just want to dig a little bit more into the sales versus pre-pandemic levels or, i guess, the first quarter of q1. brian, you did say that, i guess, across the board that you're generally and again, this is on a same-store sales basis, you are up versus two years ago at this time. could you quantify how much? and maybe also, are all categories up? is there any other low-hanging fruit that we could expect as the business comes back?
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, i think what i said was in the prepared remarks that we're up 8% in total sales. so that would take into account any stores that we've added since the pandemic. from a comparable store sales standpoint, in the first quarter, we were back at slightly above. so, i'm not going to quantify it, but slightly above pre-pandemic levels. we've seen that accelerate in july, where we're moving beyond pre-pandemic levels, and we're seeing that acceleration as we described in the prepared remarks, and we're also seeing that acceleration in margin as we kind of have a target of getting back to pre-pandemic levels as well.
scott stember -- cl king and associates -- analyst
got it. and just by category, is there any area that's been lagging that we could expect to really kick in or are we seeing that already in july?
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, i think what you're seeing is just to kind of remember during covid, we talked about in fy '21, that our service categories lagged and our tire category held up relatively and was in line with the industry. still down, but not down as much as our service categories. and mike's comments to the last question around our focus on service and making sure that we are staffed for service to say, yes to service is paramount in us continuing to recover and see the strengthening in our service categories, and we made tremendous amount of progress in q1 with our service categories up, some of them double where our tires were, and we expect that to continue. it certainly continued into july, and we expect that to continue. it will be a big component of our margin improvement going forward.

thank you. hello everyone and thank you for joining us on this morning's call. before we get started, please note that as part of the call this morning, we will be referencing a presentation that is available on the investors section of our website at corporate.monro.com/investor/investor-resources.
if i could draw your attention to the safe harbor statement on slide 2 of the presentation, i'd like to remind participants on this morning's call that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about monro's future performance. actual results may differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. the most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in monro's filings with the sec and in our earnings release.

with that, i'd like to turn the call over to our president and chief executive officer, brett ponton.
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, maureen, and good morning everyone. thanks for joining us today. we delivered another quarter of solid top line and bottom line growth, reflecting strong execution across our business as we continue to make progress on our monro.forward strategy.
overall, we achieved comparable store sales of 3.3% in the third quarter when adjusted for one less selling day compared to the prior year period due to the christmas holiday shift. importantly, this marks our fourth consecutive quarter of positive comparable store sales and represents the highest quarterly comparable store sales increase since the third quarter of fiscal 2011.
similar to the last quarter, our comp performance was driven by a higher average ticket from improved in-store execution and sustained strength in our tire and brake categories. we believe that these positive top line trends are a testament to our relentless focus on driving operational excellence and delivering a consistent five star experience to our customers. we also believe that they reflect the outstanding efforts and ongoing commitment of our teammates who have enthusiastically embraced the changes we are implementing across our organization to drive increased customer lifetime value and sustainable long-term growth.in addition, we achieved record third quarter earnings per share, while continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives.
i would now like to provide an overview of the comparable store sales trends we experienced during the quarter. as illustrated on slide 3, we saw accelerated top line growth in october and november, which was partially offset by a slowdown in comparable store sales in december, resulting from mild winter weather conditions we experienced across our markets. specifically, while we saw early snowfall above last year's levels in november, which contributed to our top line strength during the month, this was partially offset by limited snowfall in our northern markets in december compared to last year, which negatively impacted comparable store sales in that month.
however, the softness we experienced around the holiday period was temporary and we are encouraged by the stronger top line trends we saw in the back half of january, which have led to comparable store sales growth of approximately 2% so far in the fourth quarter. quarter-to-date, comparable store sales, adjusted for one extra selling day in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, were approximately 300 basis points lower than our reported comparable store sales.
moving on to our performance by category, we experienced notable strength in our tire business again this quarter, which represents half of our sales and our largest category. our optimized tire sales and pricing strategy continues to yield results and drove a 3% increase in tire comparable store sales during the third quarter, making our fourth consecutive quarter of positive tire comp sales growth.
our tire performance was driven by higher ticket and stable unit volume. in line with trends experienced in previous quarters, we also saw sustained momentum with our online tire pricing strategy since we unbundled the price of our tires and installation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, which has continued to drive increased conversion in online service appointments.
turning to our service and repair categories, we continue to capitalize on the strong demand for brakes, delivering double-digit comp sales growth in this category for the second consecutive quarter. our good-better-best brake packages drove an increase of 12% in comparable brake sales, and we are pleased to report that our optimized brake package pricing, combined with higher brake transaction volume, contributed to gross margin expansion again this quarter.
in our remaining categories, comparable store sales were up slightly for alignments and flat for maintenance, while front end/shocks declined year-over-year. for the quarter as a whole, our northern markets outperformed our southern markets. however, as we would expect, we saw our northern markets underperform in the month of december as they faced mild weather conditions.
lastly, new stores added $19.8 million in revenue, including $14.3 million from recent acquisitions.
moving on to slide 4, we continue to capitalize on accretive acquisition opportunities to build a strong, scalable platform for growth. we are pleased to announce that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire 12 stores in louisiana, expanding our store footprint in a new market and building out our geographical presence in the south. these locations are expected to add approximately $15 million in annualized sales, representing a sales mix of 35% service and 65% tires. the acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and to be break-even to diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2019. in addition, we completed the previously announced acquisition of five stores in ohio. these locations are expected to add approximately $5 million in annualized sales, representing a sales mix of 70% service and 30% tires.
we also completed the previously announced acquisition of 13 stores in florida, which are expected to add approximately $12 million in annualized sales, representing a sales mix of 65% service and 35% tires. these acquisitions fill in existing markets and are expected to be break-even to diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2019. following an extended due diligence period, we decided not to pursue further the previously announced potential acquisition of seven stores located in our existing markets, representing $8 million in annualized sales.
overall, acquisitions announced and completed thus far in fiscal 2019 collectively represent $87 million in annualized sales. acquisitions remain a key pillar of monro's growth strategy, and we have been encouraged by the significant opportunities for consolidation we continue to see in the marketplace. we have a robust m&a pipeline and currently have over 10 ndas signed with targets that have been between 5 and 40 stores each. we believe that we are well positioned to execute on these targets.
we believe that the implementation of our standardized in-store operating procedures and brand standards across our store base, which i'll discuss in further detail in a moment, allow us to more effectively integrate acquisitions and will drive higher roi going forward. lastly, we opened three greenfield locations during the third quarter, bringing our total greenfield store openings to 18 in fiscal 2019.
turning to slide 5, i am pleased to report that the execution of our monro.forward strategy continues to progress as anticipated, and i'd like to provide an update on the important steps we achieved during the third quarter. as a reminder, our monro.forward initiatives, unveiled in may of last year, are built around four areas of focus in order to increase the overall lifetime value of our customers and create a scalable platform for sustainable growth.
starting with our initiatives to improve the customer experience, we reached a key milestone during the quarter with a successful implementation of our new operating procedures, which we call, the monro playbook, as well as a refreshed appearance across our 31 pilot stores in rochester, new york. through these efforts, we have taken major steps to improve our customers' in-store experience and help ensure that we deliver a five star experience to them every time at every one of our store locations. first, we have taken an educated -- education-centered approach to the in-store customer selling process and trained our teams to execute our monro playbook consistently across to all locations.
our monro playbook is made up of standardized in-store operating procedures that include clearly defined roles and responsibilities for our teammates with a focus on service quality. our goal is to position our teammates as expert advisors, who can properly educate our customers about their vehicle needs and provide them with clear options, so they can choose the right services for their vehicles.
we expect that this clear and consistent selling approach, coupled with our stronger merchandise strategy across good, better and best product options, will be instrumental in driving higher in-store conversion. to complement our monro playbook, we also established clear brand standards to align the appearance of our stores and further drive consistency across our 1,197 locations that currently include a wide range of stores and formats.
overall, we want our stores to make positive lasting impressions on guests and the neighborhoods we serve. we started the implementation of our brand standards with the reimagining of our 31 pilot stores completed during third quarter. all of these renovated locations now have a more consistent and modernized appearance. as depicted on the slide, they look more inviting and contemporary and are more functional. so far, the feedback from our teammates and customers has been overwhelmingly positive.
our teammates are energized by the changes we have made in the stores and are proud of the actions monro is taking to better serve our customers with a simplified in-store selling process. while still in the early innings, we are very excited about the results we have seen at our pilot stores. after implementing our monro playbook and completing the stores' reimaging, we've seen improved customer satisfaction and conversion at these stores.
following the successful completion of our pilot program, we are currently finalizing purchasing negotiations with our reimagining suppliers to scale this initiative and look forward to rolling out our brand operational standards across our store base and modernize our store portfolio over the next three to five years.
in the near-term, we expect to refresh the appearance of approximately 70 stores in our southern markets in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. as previously discussed, we are determining the appropriate scope of refresh needed for each of our stores by examining their age, size and market demographics to ensure we are investing the appropriate amount of capital to achieve the highest possible returns. as part of the initiative rollout, we will prioritize our newly acquired stores as we believe the implementation of our standardized in-store operating procedures and brand standards will benefit our integration process and increase the value we realize from these stores.
moving on to slide 6, we continue to build -- to enhance customer satisfaction, while making tremendous progress in effectively building and managing our online presence. following the rollout of our customer satisfaction and online reputation management program across our entire store base almost a year ago, we are proud to report that our all-time average star rating has dramatically increased from 3.6 stars before we started this initiative to 4.5 stars currently. this was delivered by leveraging the feedback we collect from customer surveys and online reviews to drive targeted operational improvement in each of our stores. importantly, these impressive customer satisfaction scores have been instrumental in driving improved search traffic and higher conversion.
turning to slide 7, i would like to provide an update on our customer-centric engagement initiatives, starting with our data-driven marketing strategy. our goal is to invest in higher roi channels to meet our current and future customers where they are. we are, therefore, repurposing our marketing spend to invest in data-driven customer relationship marketing and customer acquisition campaigns. as a first step, we rolled out our data analytics-based crm platform last quarter, with a focus on driving higher customer retention. while still in the early innings of our initiatives to optimize our marketing efforts, we are very encouraged by the strong results of the pilot campaigns we launched in the third quarter.
by leveraging predictive analytics, we identified and targeted customers with a higher propensity to purchase our brake and tire offerings, which led to a notable increase in conversion. the next phase will consist of leveraging customer data and insights to deliver tailored messages and service recommendations to our customers based on their specific vehicle needs. overall, we have been able to unlock key consumer insights and are confident that our data-driven marketing approach will allow us to develop long-term one-to-one customer relationships. as a next step, we plan on rolling out our initiative to drive new customer acquisitions in the fourth quarter.
we have partnered with a customer analytics firm to provide market segmentation and demographic data specific to geographic areas in the vicinity of our monro locations to identify high value potential customers and focus our marketing efforts on targeting them directly. we also intend to leverage this market segmentation and customer demographic information to assess our existing real estate portfolio, as well as identify key markets for acquisitions and greenfield expansion.
moving on to our omni-channel strategy and the development of our online presence, we are very pleased with the success of our modernized retail website launched last quarter. improved content and functionalities are driving a better experience for our customers online while driving traffic to our stores, as evidenced by the 32% increase we experienced in online tire searches that led to appointments at our stores. we are also very encouraged to see the upgrade to a mobile capable architecture has led to an 80% increase in mobile phone conversion rates. our website monetization lays a strong foundation for the final phase of our omni-channel build-out, which we expect to roll out in the second half of fiscal 2020. once completed, our customers will be able to view and purchase tires online and seamlessly schedule an appointment for an in-store installation.
at the beginning of the third quarter, we announced the expansion of our collaboration with amazon.com to provide tire installation services to their customers at nearly 400 stores across 10 states. we are pleased with the smooth rollout of this program at these locations and are on track to make these services available to amazon.com customers at all monro retail locations across 28 states over the course of the next year.
turning to our initiatives to optimize our product and service offering, we are excited with the continued momentum of our good-better-best merchandising strategy launched across our store base in the first quarter. our good-better-best assortments provide customers with clearly defined options relevant to all consumer price segments and allow for increased trade-up and attachment opportunities, which in turn is driving higher in-store conversion. importantly, we have seen a significant increase in demand for brakes for the past three quarters and are pleased to report that the success of our brake packages translated into positive margin tailwinds once again this quarter.
as part of our efforts to optimize our tire assortment, we are also looking toward expanding our tire offering with the introduction of new high-margin branded tires in the fourth quarter to build on the strength in our tire category and capitalize on additional margin expansion opportunities. tires are an important part of monro's business, given that they represent half of our sales, and we want to make sure we offer the right tires at the right price points for our customers.
lastly, i would like to provide an update on our productivity and team engagement initiatives. after rightsizing our overstaffed and understaffed stores over the past couple of quarters, the better optimization of our store technical -- or technician labor allowed us to achieve overall greater store efficiency in the third quarter, which also supported our gross margin expansion in the quarter. we anticipate that the next step in this journey will be the implementation of a cloud-based data-driven store staffing and scheduling system in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 to drive further staffing efficiency by more accurately rebalancing the level of technical skills in each store, ensuring our stores are staffed with technicians who have the appropriate skill level for the services required at that store.
we have also launched our monro university training program pilot, an important initiative in our strategy to attract and retain the right talent. we have developed a comprehensive cloud-based learning management system that will provide our teammates with both the technical skill set needed to effectively serve our customers today and ongoing high-quality training to handle future technician requirements as vehicles become more complex with the increased adoption of technology. our employer value proposition is a key component of our monro.forward strategy, and the training program underscores our commitment to better support our 8,200 teammates. we recognize that teammate engagement and job satisfaction are essential to creating an exceptional guest experience, which is why we have aligned our teammates' business and developmental objectives accordingly.
leveraging our monro university platform, we are keenly focused on making sure they have a clearly defined and transparent career path to grow both personally and professionally. we are proud to report that our strong commitment to support our teammates' professional development and the cultural changes we have made across the organization have had a tremendous impact on our ability to retain talent, as evidenced by our quarterly turnover reaching its lowest level since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
our team is our biggest asset, and i would like to take a moment to thank our teammates across the organization for their hard work and dedication to our customers. with that, i'll turn the call over to brian, who will provide additional detail on our quarterly financial performance and full year outlook.
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, brett, and good morning, everyone. turning to slide 8 of the presentation, we delivered solid top line performance in the third quarter. sales increased 8.5% year-over-year to $310.1 million, driven by sales from new stores of $19.8 million, including $14.3 million from recent acquisitions, and a comparable store sales increase of 3.3% when adjusted for one less selling day in the current year quarter due to a shift in the timing of the christmas holiday from the fourth quarter in fiscal 2018 to the third quarter in fiscal 2019. this was offset by a decrease in sales from closed stores of approximately $1.3 million.
the third quarter had 89 selling days compared to 90 in the prior year period. as of december 29th, 2018, the company had 1,186 company-operated stores and 99 franchise locations, as compared with 1,138 company-operated stores and 103 franchise locations as of december 23rd, 2017. during the quarter, we added nine company-operated stores and closed one.
gross margin increased 60 basis points to 38% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 from 37.4% in the prior year period. this increase was largely due to continued benefit from our good-better-best service packages and our optimized store staffing model, as well as a decrease in distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales, as we gained leverage on these largely fixed costs with higher comparable store sales. this was partially offset by the impact of sales mix from the free service tire acquisition.
as we've previously noted, the commercial and wholesale locations we acquired as part of the free service tire acquisition operate at a lower gross margin, primarily due to the higher sales mix of tires, and with respect to the wholesale business, higher sales mix of tires without installation.
operating expenses for the quarter increased $9.6 million and were $87.3 million, or 28.1% of sales, as compared with $77.7 million, or 27.2% of sales, for the prior year period. the year-over-year dollar increase includes $1.5 million in costs related to our monro.forward initiative, of which $0.4 million were onetime in nature, and includes $0.4 million in onetime costs associated with our corporate and field management realignment. the year-over-year dollar increase also reflects expenses from 48 net new stores and higher incentive base pay related to improved current year financial performance. as a reminder, operating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 included $2 million in litigation settlement costs and $0.7 million in management transition costs.
our operating income for the third quarter was $30.7 million, which increased by 4.8% as compared to operating income of $29.3 million for the same quarter last year, and decreased as a percentage of sales from 10.3% to 9.9%. adjusted for the impact of the christmas holiday shift, operating margin for the third quarter was flat at 10.3%.
net interest expense for the third quarter increased $0.7 million as compared to the same period last year. the weighted average debt outstanding for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased by approximately $7 million as compared to the prior year period. this decrease is primarily related to a decrease in debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility, partially offset by an increase in capital lease debt recorded in connection with our fiscal 2018 and 2019 acquisition and greenfield expansion. the weighted average interest rate for the third quarter increased by approximately 70 basis points year-over-year, largely due to the higher libor and prime interest rates.
our effective tax rate was 15.3% for the third quarter compared to 50.1% for the same period last year. the year-over-year decrease in our effective tax rate primarily resulted from the enactment in december 2017 of the tax cuts and jobs act, which reduced the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, and also just decreased a result -- the result of a onetime income tax benefit adjustment in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and a onetime income tax expense adjustment in the prior year period.
the onetime income tax benefit adjustment in the current quarter is related to a retroactive accounting method change related to certain deductions that the irs accepted during an examination of our fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 tax returns. the method change resulted in additional tax deduction for the examination years instead of a deferral of such deductions in later years. an income tax benefit was recorded during the third quarter due to the difference in the federal tax rate of 35% that applies to the refund amount for the examination years, as compared to the federal tax rate of 21%, for which deferred tax accounting applies. the onetime income tax expense adjustment in the prior year period was related to the net impact of the implementation of the tax cuts and jobs act.
net income for the third quarter of $20.5 million increased 77% year-over-year. diluted earnings per share increased 74.3% year-over-year to a third quarter record $0.61, including $0.01 per share of onetime costs related to monro.forward investments, $0.01 per share of non-recurring costs related to corporate and field management realignment, $0.04 per share negative impact from the christmas holiday calendar shift, and $0.06 per share from the previously mentioned onetime income tax benefit. this compares to $0.35 in the prior year period, which included $0.15 of onetime costs, comprised of $0.01 per share in management transition costs, $0.04 per share in litigation settlement costs, and $0.10 per share related to the net impact of the newly enacted tax legislation. excluding these onetime items, diluted earnings per share was $0.61 for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $0.50 in the prior year period, representing a 22% increase year-over-year.
turning to slide 9, we continued to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation, while executing our strategy. our monro.forward strategy is progressing on track, and we continue to expect an incremental $75 million in capital expenditures above our normal run rate over the next five years to support investments in store reimaging and technology.
our capital expenditures were $31 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2019, of which $5 million was related to investments in our monro.forward initiatives. additionally, executing on accretive acquisition opportunities remains a pillar of our growth strategy, and during the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we spent approximately $46 million on acquisitions, including one to four store acquisitions completed as part of our greenfield expansion strategy. we are also maintaining our commitment to returning capital to shareholders through our dividend program and paid about $20 million in dividends during the first nine months of fiscal 2019.
finally, we remain focused on maintaining a solid balance sheet with ample flexibility to support our growth and profitability initiatives. we ended the quarter with strong leverage ratios and have ample room under our financial covenant. we generated approximately $129 million of cash flow from operating activities during the first nine months of fiscal 2019. debt under our revolver decreased by approximately $28 million during the first nine months of the fiscal year.
now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2019 on slide 10. based on current sales, business and economic trends and recently announced and completed acquisitions, we continue to expect fiscal 2019 sales to be in the range of $1,185 million to $1,215 million, an increase of 5.1% to 7.7% as compared to fiscal 2018 sales.
fiscal 2019 sales guidance continues to assume a comparable store sales increase of 1% to 3% on a 52-week basis. please note, the fiscal 2019 is a 52-week year, while fiscal 2018 was a 53-week year and benefited from an extra week of sales in the fourth quarter. we continue to believe our strong fiscal year-to-date performance and the momentum of our monro.forward initiative position us well to achieve closer to the upper end of the range, likely between 2% to 3% comparable store sales increase, assuming normal winter weather conditions for the remainder of the fourth quarter.
similarly, we continue to believe we are well positioned to achieve our diluted earnings per share guidance and are therefore reiterating our expectation for earnings per share in the range of $2.30 to $2.40, representing earnings growth of 20% to 25%. this guidance includes approximately $0.01 to $0.03 in accretion from fiscal 2018 acquisition. acquisitions made in fiscal 2019 are expected to be break-even to earnings per diluted share this year.
our guidance continues to assume stable overall tire and oil costs compared to fiscal 2018. in the phase of global tariffs and other material cost pressures, our vertically integrated and diversified supply chain continues to drive our cost leadership position and remains a key differentiator in our industry. as previously mentioned, any tire and oil cost increases not mitigated by our differentiated supply chain are expected to be passed on to consumers. however, any such cost and related consumer price increases are not assumed in our fiscal 2019 guidance. given these assumptions, we continue to expect to generate earnings growth on a comparable store sales increase above approximately 1%.
at the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect an operating margin of approximately 11%, interest expense to be approximately $28 million, depreciation and amortization to be approximately $56 million, and ebitda to be approximately $187 million. this guidance reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 22% and is based on 33.6 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. as always, our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or greenfield store openings.
i'll now turn the call over to brett to provide some closing remarks before we move to q&a.
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
thanks brian. in summary, we had another strong quarter of execution, delivering our fourth consecutive quarter of comparable store sales growth and are encouraged by positive top line trends we experienced in the second half of january. our monro.forward initiatives are shaping up nicely. we look forward to capitalizing on the success of our operational excellence and store reimage pilot program by expanding these efforts across our store base.
importantly, acquisitions remain a cornerstone of our growth strategy as evidenced by the new state we will add to our geographic footprint in the fourth quarter and $87 million in annualized sales from fiscal 2019 acquisitions. looking ahead, we remain confident in our outlook for fiscal 2019 and in our ability to continue creating long-term value for our shareholders.
with that, i will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.
",":
operator
thank you. at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. (operator instructions)
our first question comes from the line of brian nagel with oppenheimer and company. please proceed with your question.
brian nagel -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
hi, good morning.
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, brian.
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
brian nagel -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
congratulations on a nice quarter.
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
brian nagel -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
so, i want to start -- i've asked you this type of a question in the past, i want to ask again, just as we continue to push forward with the internal initiatives, but at the same time, the backdrop for your business -- your sector has clearly improved. so, if we look at the results today, how much of the continued acceleration, if you will, in comps you think relates to the internal initiatives versus an improved backdrop?
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
i think, brian, i'll give you the consistent answer i've shared with you previously on this point. i think first of all, i want to give credit to our team internally. i think, they've done everything we've asked them to do and they've embraced the culture change and have been very supportive of the initiatives that we have driven over the past year. so, i'd like to give them credit, number one.
number two, i think starting last year, certainly the macro environment became more net favorable. our first quarter had a favorable backdrop with a fairly harsh winter last year that created a good favorable environment for us throughout the spring selling season that helped contribute to our strong brake performance that led in, i think, to a strong summer, traditional summer season as well.
rolling into our q3, most recently here, as we talked about, certainly we got a little weather help early in november that probably drove some outsize performance in november when you look at snowfall in november year-on-year compared to last year, and then that reversed itself a little bit in december, as we saw.
but from that, i'm encouraged by how we recovered in the second half of january and we're back on kind of a mid-single digit comp pace that we saw leading into the holiday season. so, i think it's always difficult to parse out. i want to give credit to our team, but also i think the macro has improved to somewhat normalcy, and certainly, the longer term view is, the car part continues to age and drive further opportunities for us in our cohort, which is 6 to 12-year old vehicles.
brian nagel -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
that's very helpful, brett. and then i have a follow-up. now, it's kind of merged maybe two questions together here. with regard to the stores in your home market that you've retrofitted, you discussed this in your prepared comments, but maybe -- can you give us a better idea -- and i know it's early, but what we've seen as far as outperformance in those units now that they are -- been sort of, say, fixed up?
and then a second question is -- it is more mechanical in nature, but you talked about the impact of the calendar shift on your fiscal q3 comps and we discussed, i guess, q4 to date comps. how is -- how does that calendar shift, if at all, affect what we've seen so far in q4?
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
i'll take the first part and let brian reply to the second part. so, related to the pilot stores in rochester on the reimage, we completed that in its entirety, i would say, late november, end of december, brian. so, it's really early innings of course when you look at more macro traffic/sales trends. there are some underlying metrics that we look at pretty hard. one is, let me bifurcate this, there's two parts of what we're doing when we reimage a market. number one, we installed a new playbook, the new procedures in-store, and our expectation there is that would drive improved conversion in-store while driving higher customer satisfaction rates in the process. and we look at metrics, early indicators on that, we're seeing positive trends on customer satisfaction, net promoter score, as well as improved conversion that we saw with our initial pilot stores of four.
as it relates to the reimage, we would expect that over time to help drive satisfaction, but also traffic trend improvements. and i think given the fact we just wrapped that up in late november, december, clearly it's too early on that. but, i think the, the metrics that we see underlying, customer satisfaction bode pretty well for how we would expect that translate into traffic trends going forward.
i'll let brian comment on the calendar shift.
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. hi, brian. so, the -- as far as it goes with the 2%, that 2% that brett talked about is the reported number. he also commented in his prepared remarks that, that number is helped by -- about 300 basis points were the extra day that we've had in january with the calendar shift. i think if you look at the way kind of the quarter set up, we were up about 7 in october, up about 7 in november, down 6 adjusted for days in december, probably down low-single digits in the first part of january when we had that consistently mild weather that we saw also in december. and then once we got a little bit of harsher weather later in the month, that's what brett said, we've been up about mid-single digits since then.
so, clearly that, that run up to the holiday and that softness right after the holiday correlate pretty closely to the weather we saw. we're encouraged that the trends we're seeing now are kind of rereflective of what we saw back in october and november.
brian nagel -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
perfect. i appreciate the color and best of luck.
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
thanks brian.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of john healy with northcoast research. please proceed with your question.
john healy -- northcoast research -- analyst
thank you and congrats on a great quarter guys. brett, i want to ask you a little bit about your comment about the changing of the tire mix a little bit. and it sounded like to me that you guys were planning on mixing up the tires and maybe going toward a little bit more premium. so, i was hoping to understand kind of what's really the operational strategy there and why going higher for your customer mix is it the right move?
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
i don't know that if we necessarily imply that john, but let me give you some context on how we think about the tire category. today, we currently do business with north of 10 different tire manufacturers, and there, i'll give you some color on the pricing environment. certainly, in the last quarter of last year, we saw some tire manufacturers take some pricing actions. given our scale and our size, of course, we feel like we're well positioned to mitigate vast majority of those. but certainly, i wouldn't characterize those price increases as industrywide. we have some suppliers of ours that chose not to take price, others that have.
given our size and scale, we're using this as an opportunity to kind of reassess our product assortment and realign potentially in areas that create the best value for us and our consumers. it doesn't necessarily mean trying to shift our strategy up or down in the product stream. just overall, we're going to look for the best options available for us to create the best value for consumers and monro.
the second part that we're looking at doing, that we'll rollout next year, is really looking for ways we can become more efficient on opening price point tires. so, we're evaluating right now the opportunities to consolidate, become more efficient on the lower end of our product screen that creates more flexibility in our product screen on, call it, tier 3, tier 2 and tier 1 tires, again, leveraging the portfolio of manufacturers that we have to consider from.
john healy -- northcoast research -- analyst
understood. that's helpful. and i just wanted to ask a clarification question. i thought you mentioned that as we started 4q in january, comps were running up 2% or so. is that on a same day basis, or is there any movements of the days that are either helping or hurting that 2% number?
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, that 2% is as reported. it's about -- helped by about 300 basis points related to an extra day because of the shift.
john healy -- northcoast research -- analyst
okay.
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
hi, john, maybe just to add some color there, as we mentioned previously there, we kind of see the month january in two parts of the month; the first part of the month was quite a bit softer, the second part of the month, we saw demand pick up mid-single digits, which is kind of in line with what we saw, call it, october, november. so, clearly the holiday period created some challenges and softness for us. but exiting that second half of the month of january, we've seen kind of a normalcy or return to normalcy that we saw leading in.
john healy -- northcoast research -- analyst
got you. and then just one final question, coming off probably what's been a better calendar year for folks in the industry, is that helping or is that hurting your m&a pipeline, do you think?
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
that's a good question, and i can say that our pipeline has never been as robust as it has been for me since i've been here at monro. so, despite maybe a little more favorable calendar year, i think, now that the tax law certainty has kind of flushed its way through, our m&a activity is very robust and our pipeline is very active. so, we feel very good about our growth prospects going forward.
john healy -- northcoast research -- analyst
great. good luck this year guys.
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, john.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of bret jordan with jefferies. please proceed with your question.
bret jordan -- jefferies llc -- analyst
hi, good morning guys.
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
hi, bret.
bret jordan -- jefferies llc -- analyst
hi. just follow up on the amazon partnership. maybe if you can talk about how many stores we're doing now and what we're seeing as far as maybe attached sales as those customers are coming in, how that amazon customer profile differs from other, either online referral or core customers?
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
yes. sure, bret, i'll take it. look, maybe, before i dive into the specifics on that, i'd like to maybe just reiterate why we're doing amazon. so, i think -- in our business at monro, we believe we're a value-added retailer/service providera real strong brick and mortar presence, and we think tires, like other services for your car that require installation or value-added provided to it, lends itself well for monro and other brick and mortar suppliers out there to participate. so, you couple that with pretty low penetration rate today of tires being bought online by consumers and our current strategy, right, we felt pretty compelled to go and partner with amazon as we did with others.
as it relates to amazon, we won't comment specifically around why or how those particular programs are performing, bret. but in general, i'll say this, right, we're still pleased with the relationship with amazon as well as others. we can't give out any details of course, but in its entirety, we still believe supporting online installers gives us the opportunity to do three or four things: one is, drive incremental traffic to our stores; two, participate in the high value-added services that comes with installation, gives us the attachment rate. now, i'll just reiterate what we've shared before as a general comment about the attachment rate and profitability, but our average ticket overall as a company is $160 plus. the average ticket that we see on a tire installation is north of $120.
the nature of those services are dramatically different, of course. the $120 ticket is very high margin, high labor content. so, generally speaking, it's still early innings, but we still feel pretty good about the economics in line with what we see with the broader program. as i made comments in the prepared remarks, we currently stand at 400 stores with amazon and we're going to look to partner with them over the calendar year here to expand that to all 1,200 stores of ours going forward.
bret jordan -- jefferies llc -- analyst
okay, great. and then one quick follow-up question, also on the m&a, are you seeing anything changing as far as valuation expectations? and as you're doing deals now, are the sellers expecting more?
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
no, i won't (ph) say really status quo, but we've seen -- quarter to quarter, it's been a pretty stable environment in terms of, let's say, valuations. but the activity, certainly for us, certainly has picked up in the last quarter in particular.
bret jordan -- jefferies llc -- analyst
and i guess just on that topic, i mean, obviously since you've been there now for a bit over a year, the prior management team used to talk about 7 times, 8 times ebitda or x percent of sales or replacement cost, what is your thought as far as expected valuation ranges on deals?
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
yes, one thing that i don't want to do going forward is kind of signal what our valuation process is. but i think we can share with you, we typically see 2 turns to 4 turns of synergies whenever we acquire companies. and given the emphasis that we're placing on driving standardization and consistency in our stores, we feel like there's opportunities to expand those synergies going forward by driving not just cost synergies, but revenue synergies when we acquire companies.
bret jordan -- jefferies llc -- analyst
okay. great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of rick nelson with stephens inc. please proceed with question.
richard nelson -- stephens inc. -- analyst
thanks brett, just to follow up on acquisitions and the pipeline, i'm curious if you're facing more competition these days for deals (inaudible) 5 to 40 stores, so you could put some revenue brackets around that, that would be helpful, whether you're shopping primarily in northern markets or southern markets?
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
let's talk first about maybe the markets. as you saw with our recent announcement, we've now entered louisiana in our quest to continue to diversify our store footprint and target the sunbelt, if you will, the growing demographic areas of our country. and look, we're going to continue to do that going forward. related to competition, look, i would characterize really no change there; no more, no last, just status quo. certainly, there's a number of players out there competing for deals. we still feel like monro represents a great opportunity for owners to exit their business and to create opportunities for their people to grow and develop. we feel like we're a good credible buyer. and with the synergies i mentioned now that we would expect to see both on cost and top line, we feel like we're going to remain a real strong buyer going forward.
richard nelson -- stephens inc. -- analyst
great, thanks for the color. perhaps a question for brian on the tax rate, 15%, came in below where we were. when you talk about some of the one-timers involved there, how should we think about the tax rate in your march quarter and as we push into next year?
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, i think, we'll be -- in our guidance, we guided to a 22% rate for the year. and for next year, i would anticipate it to be a little bit north of that, just because we obviously won't have the benefit of the onetime item this year. so, i would expect that to be closer to the 24% that we had originally guided to this year.
richard nelson -- stephens inc. -- analyst
great. and just to follow up on the january -- i know you discussed the weather challenge really in the quarter changed for the back end of the quarter. is there anything else in january that you think could be impacting that (inaudible) from some other retailers, maybe the government shut down had some impact in the first half. i'd like to get your commentary there.
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
yes, good question, rick. maybe a couple of things. look, i know, i always hate to talk about the weather and we tell our team that internally, we don't like to talk about the weather. but i will say we do monitor, we measure, we analyze weather and the correlation it does have on our business, and in particular our tire business. and as we talked about earlier, we did see maybe some demand pull in november, given the fact the snowfall came early year-on-year. that reversed itself in december. and certainly, the early part of january was softer from a weather point of view year-on-year.
the other dynamic that we saw, i think, around the holiday was certainly some softness that maybe other retailers have talked about during the holiday season itself. and i would book in that around a couple of weeks leading into the holiday season and a couple of weeks leading out of, so we certainly saw a reversal and back to kind of mid-single digit normalcy for us in the second half of january. we have studied pretty significantly the government shutdown. tough to determine, of course, in macro, the impact of that, given the dispersed nature of the employees everywhere. but we do have a pretty high concentration of stores, high-volume stores in the washington d.c. area.
and brian, do you want to provide any color on that ?
brian j. d'ambrosia -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so, we looked at our stores in the baltimore-d.c. area, which are primarily our mr. tire stores, and during the shutdown, while this isn't going to have a big needle mover on the consolidated entity, but what we did see though at the store level was, we saw some significant traffic and sales declines versus the benchmark, other parts of that geography as well as the chain -- the tire chain as well as the company as a whole. so, it did have an impact on the stores and the operations in the greater d.c.-baltimore area. but as you roll it all up, really not a large needle mover in total.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of stephanie benjamin with suntrust robinson humphrey. please proceed with your question.
stephanie benjamin -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
hi, good morning, thanks for the question. i had -- first just as a quick clarification, when you spoke about the launch of the new operating procedures, is that -- you know, the educational selling approach, is that across just those 31 stores you refreshed or is that companywide that you launched those new procedures?
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
yes. it's a good question, stephanie. that was launched just across the 31 stores in rochester. so, we wanted to pilot the procedures. we call it the playbook, by the way. so, regardless of what banner is on the outside of our building, whether it's a mr. tire, a monro or a tire choice, the procedures that we execute in-store are going to be consistent across our 1,200 locations. so, we're piloting two things, one is the playbook and two is the actual reimaging to the brand standards in rochester, but it only happened in those first 31.
the playbook will roll out at a much faster pace over the next couple of years than the reimage, just given the ease of execution there. but at this stage, right now, we're just at 31 stores with the new playbook.
stephanie benjamin -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
got it. and then, is there an opportunity, based on the results of these first 31 stores, or even as you kind of move to, like you said, reimaging some of the newer -- newly acquired stores to really kind of accelerate the reimagining or any of this? or is it kind of set in that three to five year timeline?
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer
i think, we're being pretty methodical about this, as you can tell. first step for us was to pilot it, and we're piloting for two reasons; one, just refine the procedures to where we can then get them to scale. the second thing is, we wanted to value engineer all the investments that we're making in the store, from fixtures to signage, et cetera. as i'd made comments in our prepared remarks, we're in the process now of running request for proposals to leverage our scale now to do this across our portfolio, and that work is going to be completed by the end of this quarter.
we'll then start up reimagining in q2. and i think it'll -- q2, how fast we move across the 70 stores we have planned -- excuse me, in our first quarter of next year, i should have said -- how well that goes will determine the pace from that point forward, that we'll determine. but at this stage, i think, it's still too new.
stephanie benjamin -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
got it. that's all the questions i had. i appreciate it. thank you.
brett t. ponton -- president and chief executive officer

2018-Q4,MNRO,,"prepared remarks:
maureen mulholland -- vice president, general counsel, and secretary
good morning, everyone, and welcome to monro's investor day. my name is maureen mulholland. i'm senior vice president, general counsel, and secretary at monro. i'd like to thank everyone for joining us here in person, as well as those of you listening via webcast. we're excited to be hosting our first investor day, and we appreciate your time this morning. a copy of the presentation, as well as a replay of the webcast, will be available on our website at monro.com.
i'd like to start by drawing your attention to our customary safe harbor statement. we encourage you to read it in its entirety. certain statements made in this presentation are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, and monro assumes no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new information becomes available in the future. additionally, the company's presentations may include certain non-gaap financial measures.
today, brett ponton, our president and chief executive officer, and brian d'ambrosia, our chief financial officer and senior vice president of finance, will provide you with a detailed overview of the company's new strategy and financial outlook. through the course of this morning, you will also be hearing more detail on our strategic initiatives from evan naylor, our chief operating officer, and deborah brundage, our senior vice president of marketing and merchandising. as you all may be aware, evan and deborah recently joined the monro team, and we are thrilled to have them here today. with that, i'm pleased to introduce monro's president and chief executive officer, brett ponton.
brett ponton -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, maureen, and good morning, everyone. we're happy to be hosting our first-ever investor day and very pleased to have you all here with us today. we're really excited about our strategy at monro and look forward to sharing more details about the initiatives we're driving across our business. building off a very solid foundation, we're thrilled about the changes we're making at monro and believe we will be well positioned for strong future growth.
i'll start things off this morning with an overview of our company and the industry we operate in, outlining how we at monro are positioned to benefit from the tailwinds we anticipate in the automotive aftermarket over the next few years. next, i will introduce our strategy and the initiatives we are implementing, as well as the foundational tools we have already set in place across our business. then, you'll hear from deborah and evan, who will provide more detailed information regarding our marketing and teammate-related initiatives. finally, brian will walk you through our m&a strategy and financial targets for fiscal year 2019 and beyond.
we will also provide a brief overview of our fourth-quarter and fiscal 2018 results, which were reported earlier this morning. following our presentation, we will have a question and answer session in which those of you in the room with us, as well as those of you listening on the webcast, are invited to ask questions.
so, let's get started. before we dive into our strategic initiatives, i want to provide a brief overview of monro, our key differentiators, and the dynamics at play in the industry we operate in. with over 1,160 owned stores, 98 franchise locations, and nine wholesale locations across 27 states, monro has grown into one of the leading automotive service and tire companies in the country, generating record revenue of $1.12 billion in fiscal 2018.
our growth has been driven by our disciplined acquisition strategy, and over the past six years, we have completed 29 acquisitions, which added 386 new stores and about $520 million in annualized revenue. these acquisitions have not only given us greater scale but have enabled us to enter eight new states and pursue our expansion into adjacent markets to the south and west of our core northeast region. as you will hear us talk about today, we operate in a very fragmented and attractive industry and have a very unique operating model with strong competitive advantages that will enable us to capitalize on significant growth opportunities going forward.
turning to slide 8 -- and, for those of you less familiar with monro, i would like to start with monro's two-store format strategy and an overview of our retail brand portfolio. we operate two store formats in the majority of our key markets with a focus on increasing store density to drive higher operating margin as we share inventory and leverage our distribution network across our store base.
monro muffler started as a specialty retailer in rochester, new york over 60 years ago, and our business model has evolved over the years, responding to changes in the marketplace. today, our 547 service stores focus on brakes, tires, and preventative maintenance services like oil changes and other scheduled services, along with under-car services for ride control, and of course, exhaust. over the last 16 years, we have also acquired tire stores, specifically to fill in our existing markets with a second store format. we like the competitive advantages store density offers us and we utilize the two-format strategy to maximize our density in the markets we are in.
as you can see on the slide, over the years, we have acquired several regional retail brands with strong local reputations and great brand equity in the markets they operate in. in addition, we also operate nine wholesale locations, which contribute to strengthening our competitiveness in the market while providing service to our own stores, and also creates new organic growth opportunities for us at monro.
moving on to slide 9 and our vertically integrated and diversified supply chain that drives our cost leadership position, a key component of our strong operating model. our centralized purchasing model and controlled distribution system for parts and tires, coupled with our store density, provides us with significant pricing power and cost leverage. our far-reaching supply chain for parts provides us the opportunity to source high-quality, low-cost auto parts from sources in southeast asia.
we service our stores through our network of three distribution centers and nine wholesale locations that provide coverage to over 90% of our stores. having diversified our business with the acquisition of wholesale locations, this has improved our ability to service our own retail locations while opening up new revenue streams for the company. maintaining our cost leadership position remains a key priority for us going forward. we will look to further leverage our integrated supply chain as we create a scalable platform to drive sustainable growth.
now, i'd like to take a moment to walk through the favorable industry trends we are seeing in the marketplace. the automotive aftermarket service space is experiencing a substantial shift. with the vehicles in operating expected to grow significantly over the next five years, monro is poised to benefit from these dynamics, which we have outlined on the next few slides. new car sales have been robust the past five years, resulting in consistent growth in the number of vehicles on the road.
the age of vehicles continues to get older, averaging approximately 12 years today. the cars on the road are also being driven more miles per year on an average. these dynamics, combined with the declining number of service outlets and bays, coupled with the increasing complexity of vehicles, which i will come back to shortly, are important traffic drivers for us as consumers go to outlets they trust to provide tires, maintenance, and repair services for their vehicles.
turning to slide 11, we would like to share some data that we believe outlines a very compelling industry environment for monro over the upcoming years. using 2017 as our anchor year, you can see the differences in the compounded annual growth rates over the past five years as well as the forecast for the next five years for vehicles in the 0-to-5-year cohort, the 6-to-12-year cohort, and for vehicles over 13 years of age. over the past few years, the industry has been growing significantly in the 0-to-5-year cohort driven by the growth in new car sales after the great recession. conversely, the 6-to-12-year-old cohort, which we consider our targeted segment or our sweet spot, declined 4% over the past five years.
these macro trends have created a significant structural headwind to our organic growth in recent years. however, as you can see on the charts, the headwind we have experienced has been transitory and is expected to turn into a tailwind for us over the next few years. while growth in the 0-to-5-year cohort is expected to be flat, we are looking at significant momentum in our targeted cohort with a cagr of approximately 4% over the next five years. we believe these favorable macro trends help position monro to deliver more consistent and sustainable organic growth than we have over the past few years.
as illustrated on slide 12, the continued shift from ""do it yourself"" to ""do it for me"" is another favorable trend in our industry. the automotive aftermarket is estimated at approximately $287 billion in the u.s. and is primarily concentrated on the ""do it for me"" channel, which represents about 80% of the market. there has been an acceleration in the shift from ""do it yourself"" to ""do it for me,"" and we expect that trend to continue with the increasing adoption of technology in new vehicles. as customers choose difm more frequently, monro's strong customer value proposition positions us well to captures these opportunities.
first, and relative to the new car dealer, we offer significant price advantages to the consumer, as we are able to leverage our vertically integrated supply chain and capitalize on our focused menu of services we provide consumers. secondly, the convenience we provide our customers through store locations and operating days and hours is another strong competitive advantage for us. when looking at the competitive landscape on the right-hand side of the slide, the tire stores and general repair channels have experienced growth, both of which are where monro operates using our two-store model strategy. we expect to benefit from more vehicles on the road and fewer outlets available to service them. lastly, our industry remains very fragmented, creating significant opportunities for us to continue to grow via acquisition.
moving on to slide 13, i'd like to provide additional color on vehicles in our targeted segment or our sweet spot of 6 to 12 years, and why our competitive advantage is particularly relevant in that segment. vehicles generally need more service and repairs as they advance in age. however, think about consumers who hold on to cars longer. their willingness to pay higher prices decreases when their vehicle becomes older and therefore less valuable. monro is able to offer better value than the new car dealers to these consumers, who are more price-sensitive.
monro's service menu is also focused on the sweet spot of the market, focusing on items that provide good purchase frequency, like oil changes and other scheduled services, along with higher-value services like tires, brakes, and other under-car services. going forward, we will take a thoughtful approach to focusing on scheduled maintenance services with our goal to be more relevant to consumers sooner in their vehicle's lifecycle. we will talk more about this later when we discuss our strategic marketing initiatives.
as you can see on slide 14, vehicles in the 6-to-12-year cohort represent about 45% of the vehicles we serve at monro, while they only represent about 30% of the vehicles in operation. as a recent influx of newer vehicles post-recession continues to age, we expect the 6-to-12-year cohort to grow faster than the market, which provides us with significant runway for growth. vehicles 13 years and older represent 28% of our traffic, providing evidence that our average age of vehicles continue to rise and that consumers continue to invest in and maintain their vehicles even as they get older.
now, on to slide 15, and as i mentioned earlier, the increased adoption of technology in vehicles is another trend shaping the future of our industry. vehicles today are more complex than ever before, accelerating the shift from ""do it yourself"" to ""do it for me."" as described on slide 15, the forecast for the vehicles in operation in year 2030 projects a modest shift to hybrid or full electric vehicles in the u.s., with the vast majority of the market still being traditional technology, which is internal combustion engines. hybrid vehicles generally require the same services today that traditional vehicles require, with the addition of more battery- and electrical-related services, and any meaningful shift to fully electric vehicles will create opportunities for expanded services to complement the tires, ride control, brake service that we believe will still be required on those vehicles.
monro is well positioned to capitalize on these evolving vehicle needs as we provide our technicians with the necessary training to remain on the cutting edge of these changes, and these changes, however, create challenges for smaller competitors, who will struggle to make the investments needed to keep up with the evolving marketplace.
so, in summary, we believe monro is very well positioned to capitalize on a variety of favorable trends in our industry. we expect the increasing number of vehicles on the road, particularly in our sweet spot of 6 to 12 years, the accelerated shift from diy to difm, and the declining number of service outlets and bays to drive more consumers to our stores over the next few years. we also remain very excited about the m&a prospects, as we intend to capitalize on the strong opportunity for further consolidation in our industry.
turning now to slide 17, i would like to take a moment to discuss what we are doing internally to ensure we are capitalizing on this favorable industry backdrop. as you know, since joining the company, i've begun the process of implementing new strategic initiatives at the company, which we'll discuss in a few minutes, but let me be clear: while we are in the early stages of executing that strategy, we have already begun to capture some of the benefits, particularly as it relates to our foundational technology and tools that we rolled out during the fourth quarter. this includes the investments we have made and will continue to make in technology and data-driven analytics.
i am pleased to report that we successfully launched tablet-based dashboards and a cloud-based standardized store review process during the quarter. the feedback from our leaders in our store operations organization is very positive, and we are confident that these tools will help us execute on our strategy by providing our leadership team at all levels of the organization greater visibility and better insights into our business. our tablets and dashboards will allow our store operation leaders to more effectively evaluate and manage each store's performance across numerous key performance indicators, such as customer satisfaction and online reviews, traffic and sales trends by category, margin performance, and staffing and labor metrics, to name a few. managers will have the ability to track these metrics versus budget, historical trends, and their peers with the information flowing to them near real-time.
our store review process now is standardized across all districts in the company and will drive increased visibility into the field. we call this customized app that we develop ""soar,"" s-o-a-r, which stands for store operations and asset review. this standardized store review process allows us to take both a quantitative and qualitative approach to assessing our store performance, evaluating each store regularly on 135 points across five areas, ranging from store appearance to operational performance. in addition, we launched a new technology-supported customer satisfaction and online review management system as well that we believe is key to supporting our broader strategy. we will discuss this item in more detail later and the impact it has had on some very important leading indicators in our business.
overall, we believe our data-driven approach and related investments in technology will drive efficiency in our stores and our field management organization, reducing the time that they spend identifying underlying causes of performance issues and allowing them to prioritize their time and attention to coach our store teams on improving the results. the cloud-based systems will also increase the transparency and accountability throughout our organization and eventually drive consistent improvement in execution across all of our stores. importantly as well, we will leverage these tools and the analytics to track our progress of the larger operational initiatives going forward. in addition to having accomplished this important initial step in our strategy, we also have generated improved operating performance and expect to build on that momentum as we exit the fourth quarter.
as illustrated on slide 18, we are encouraged by our top-line recovery at the end of the fiscal year 2018. we achieved comparable store sales of 2.4% in the quarter on a 52-week basis, driven by higher average ticket and overall strength in our tire business. we also generated $13.8 million in revenue from new stores, including $8.7 million from recent acquisitions. this is further supported by the improvement in our two-year stacked comparable store sales performance over the past few months, which has shown consistent improvement since january and positive in april and may month-to-date.
as we enter the spring service selling season in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we continue to see positive trends as we advance in the quarter. the temporary softness we experienced in april due to a late spring arrival was offset by a return to positive comps month-to-date in may, up 3%. when looking at comparable store sales by category, as provided in this morning's press release, we experienced an increase of 5% in tire comps, our largest category. in our service and repair categories, we saw positive comps in brakes and front-end shocks while alignments and maintenance declined year over year.
we are also pleased to announce that we have successfully added $20 million in annualized sales through our acquisitions completed in fiscal 2018, and as highlighted on slide 19, this includes the previously announced appalachian tire acquisition we closed during the fourth quarter, which adds $7 million in annualized sales. similarly, as you saw in this morning's press release, we also completed the acquisition of free service earlier this month, including 12 retail commercial locations and four wholesale locations, which are expected to add $47 million in annualized revenue. this acquisition is filling in our existing market of tennessee and expanding our footprint in the south.
i also want to draw your attention to the gross margin impact of this acquisition, as the acquired wholesale locations operate at a lower gross margin, primarily due to higher sales mix of tires without installation. we expect the sales mix to reduce gross margins until we lap the acquisition next year. looking ahead, we remain very well positioned to capitalize on favorable accretive acquisition opportunities, which brian will comment on later this morning.
now, i'd like to move on and talk more about our monro.forward strategy. since i assumed the role of ceo in october, we have completed a rigorous and comprehensive business assessment highlighting a number of areas where we can improve. i spent a lot of time with our teammates in the field during the first 90 days of my tenure. my goal was to get a clearer understanding of the consumer experience in our stores and how our teammates interact with the customer. i also wanted to understand the level of support our teammates receive from us at corporate to better understand our go-forward initiatives.
our assessment has revealed significant opportunities to improve in-store execution and the customer experience across our store base to drive higher traffic with a focus on customer lifetime value. we have developed our strategic plan based on these observations, as well as the experiences of our leadership team, all of whom have executed similar initiatives in our careers.
today, we will be unveiling more detail around our strategy, monro.forward, which is focused on the following four key pillars. 1). improve the in-store customer experience, 2). enhance the level of engagement with our customers with data-driven marketing strategies, 3). optimize our product and service offerings in-store and online, and 4). accelerate our in-store productivity and teammate engagement. these four key pillars, supported by investments in technology and data analytics, will create a scalable platform for sustainable growth over time.
we are looking forward to sharing further details about our strategy today and are very encouraged by the support and excitement we have received thus far from our teammates throughout our organization about the future of monro. our teammates have been quick to embrace our new strategy and are working hard as we roll out our initiatives. we are also pleased to have strong alignment with our board of directors, who have been instrumental in helping to shape our strategy and have provided their full commitment to supporting us as we execute monro.forward over the coming years.
now, let's take a deeper dive into the initiatives we will be implementing as part of our strategy, starting first with improving the customer experience. this includes three key areas of focus. first, improving our online reputation, second, delivering a consistent five-star experience to our customers in-store, and third, improving the appearance of our stores. when it comes to the customer experience, the changes we are making at monro are more than just about online reviews. at its core, we are fundamentally changing our culture, shifting away from a transactional mindset to one that is focused on the overall lifetime value of our customers and how we can deliver a five-star experience to them every time at every one of our store locations.
we recognize the importance of online reviews in helping us achieve this goal. we will leverage what we learn from our reviews in order to learn more about what our customers want and need, and how we can always deliver a five-star experience to them. equally important: ""improve customer experience"" is a virtuous cycle as it leads to improved online ratings that drive better visibility online, which in turn leads to increased conversion and ultimately, higher future traffic to our stores.
one of the first initiatives i launched as ceo was investments in technology to increase our customer feedback. in fact, since january of this year, we have received over 50,000 customer surveys and online reviews. we are using technology to help us solicit feedback from our customers across all major areas of the experience with our brands. we want to get a better idea of what is working well in our stores as well as the changes we need to make to improve. we are leveraging the insights and feedback we gained from this data to provide constructive coaching to our teammates and drive improvement across our stores.
as you can see on slide 25, this renewed focus has already begun to drive an improvement in our online reputation, as represented on the chart. we piloted our online reputation management program in january, which i will talk about more in a moment, and we launched this program across our entire store base in late february and into early march. our increased efforts to solicit customer feedback has driven a fivefold increase in the number of online reviews. leveraging the insights from this feedback, we are making improvements to our store operations, which, in turn, is leading to a material improvement in monro's overall star rating across online review sites.
last year, we ended the year as a company with an average star rating of 3.6 stars across our store portfolio, and today, we are now at 4.1 stars across our 1,160 locations. we are very proud of these results, as much of this has come from our teammates' increased awareness and attention to the customer experience. we have communicated that the customer is our top focus, and our teammates have done a fantastic job of embracing our new culture.
so, you might be asking yourself, ""hey, that's great, brett, but why should i care about online ratings so much?"" let me show you why, based on the results of our recent pilot program. to begin our online reputation efforts, in january, we launched a pilot program across 185 stores across our two-store formats in two different regions. here, you can see that materialize in an increase in the number of reviews we received, as well as the overall star ratings, represented in the top left chart. this, in turn, has led to improved search traffic as measured by search engine optimization, or seo, which is shown here on the top right chart.
higher online traffic has led to more actions being taken by consumers, whether that is to click to call a store, click to get directions to a store, or click to a link on our website to make an online appointment or get more information about our products and services offered. most importantly, in the bottom left chart, you can see that these actions have driven a material increase in traffic in these stores year-to-date. while early in our launch, these are impressive results that give us confidence as we ramp up this initiative at all of our stores.
as we work to effectively manage and improve our online reputation, driving consistency and quality across our store base is paramount to delivering a five-star experience. in order to do this, we are creating brand standards for how we operate across our store base. we are also developing standard operating procedures for how we execute across every major touchpoint. from the first impression to the final review, we want to provide a best-in-class experience for our customers, and we want that experience to be the same no matter which store our customers decide to visit.
this new playbook will be an education-centered approach for our customers and will include clearly defined roles and responsibilities for our teammates. we want to position our teammates as expert advisors who can clearly and professionally provide our customers with options and choices for the work their vehicles need. by providing a consistent and high-quality experience to our customers every time in every store, we hope to increase overall customer lifetime value.
to create our five-star experience, it is also important that these standards for how we operate are aligned with the appearance of our stores. as monro has grown through the years by way of acquisition, we have built a store base that includes a wide range of stores and formats. we are standardizing our appearance to drive consistency across our markets. in order to accomplish this, we will be executing our store reimage initiative that will begin in q3 fiscal year '19. to determine the appropriate scope of refresh needed, from a refresh lite all the way to a renovation plus, we have examined the age, size, and market demographics of each of our stores that ensures we are investing the appropriate amount of capital to achieve the right level of customer experience at the highest possible returns.
on slide 29, you can see some of the intended results of this refresh. through this reimage initiative, we want to ensure our stores are inviting, contemporary, and functional, all while remaining practical and appropriate for what our customers have come to expect from the monro brand. importantly, we will work with the assets we have to drive consistency without making structural changes to our stores.
so, in summary, we are excited about the opportunities ahead of us. we are exiting q4 with a great deal of momentum, we have strong industry tailwinds, improving financial performance, and the recent launch of new technology will help us capitalize on the opportunities ahead. our shift to a focus on customer lifetime value and delivering a five-star experience is well under way, and we are pleased with the results of our pilot program for online reputation management, which are showing impressive results thus far. lastly, we are pleased with the strong support we've received from our entire organization and look forward to executing our monro.forward strategy.
next, you'll be hearing more about our strategic initiatives from deborah brundage, our senior vice president of marketing, and evan naylor, our chief operating officer. as maureen mentioned, both deborah and evan are new to the monro team and we are thrilled to have them on our leadership team. as we began to build out our strategy, we recognized the importance of bringing on additional team members who would ensure we executed on the initiatives we laid out. the expertise in their respective fields that deborah and evan have shared with us have been instrumental in shaping our monro.forward strategy and we look forward to continuing to execute on these initiatives together. please let me welcome deborah brundage.
deborah brundage -- senior vice president, marketing and merchandising
thank you, brett. good morning and thank you all for coming. i'm excited to share our plans to enhance our customer-centric engagement, and our core strategies include driving customer retention, or simply keeping the customers we have, by delivering the right message for the right service at the right time via a data-based crm platform. our second strategy is customer acquisition, or gaining the customers we want, by leveraging analytics to segment the market to identify our highest-value customers. third, developing an omnichannel presence with a seamless buying experience for our customers.
at procter and gamble, we prided ourselves as being exceptional brand builders with the ability to deliver the right message at the right time. we also took a data-driven approach to unlock key consumer insights and trial barriers to define our target consumer. and, we invested in high-roi channels to meet them where they are. after 16 years of experience at p&g, i'm definitely up for the challenge to implement our monro marketing strategies.
leveraging crm, or customer relationship marketing, is our no. 1 priority to keep the customers we have. crm allows us to develop long-term one-to-one relationships with our customers based on specific vehicle needs. it just makes business sense. we're able to be more efficient and productive to leverage analytics to deliver tailored messages to our customers, especially after they've just received a five-star experience in-store.
our second priority is to bring new customers in, and to do that, we have to shift to the channels where they are, which is digital. in fact, 60% of our web traffic is mobile. lastly, to ensure we reach our current and future customers where they are, we are investing in high-roi channels like digital and crm.
slide 35 communicates why driving retention is such a priority. it's critical to deliver the right message for the right next service at the right time through the right channel. as brett mentioned, retaining customers starts with a better in-store experience. our goal is to provide quality professional service while educating our customers on services recommended based on our complimentary courtesy inspection form and oem scheduled maintenance. through this education, we want our customers to feel like they're part of the decision-making process. because we've already captured valuable vehicle information in-store, we're able to leverage our crm platform to deliver a recommendation for their next service, and based on spending habits, we can send the right offer to drive traffic back in-store.
slide 36 explains why driving loyalty is such a key part of customer retention and why a private-label credit card is key to any retailer loyalty program. why, you ask? because we're in the customer's wallet, which drives top-of-mind awareness, especially for the cost-conscious consumer who knows the exact amount of their available credit. encouragingly, we can continue to leverage the drive card to drive improved traffic and in-store conversion, especially for big-ticket items. a set of four tires can cost anywhere from $800.00 to $1,200.00, and interest-free financing for six months on a large purchase is definitely a consumer benefit.
we had a strong year 1, and as we begin year 2, we're continuing to see nice growth on applications, and early indications are showing higher loyalty and higher spend versus non-drive card users. lastly, we'll leverage our crm platform to retain these customers by tailoring offers that drive them back in-store.
let's move to slide 37 to talk our second core strategy of customer acquisitions. it all starts with trust. for most consumers, a car is their second most valuable asset, and they want to ensure that it's properly taken care of. we shared how an improved in-store experience can lead to increased ratings and reviews, which in turn gives us higher visibility for seo and sem. 97% of customers read reviews online, and if these reviews are positive, they're much more likely to allow us to service their vehicle because they now trust what they've read.
separately, we're partnering with a customer analytics firm to provide market segmentation and demographic data specific to a geographic area in close proximity to a monro location to identify high-value lookalikes and market directly to them. this market segmentation and customer demographic information will also help us identify key markets for greenfield expansion and acquisition.
slide 38 outlines our third strategy, which is to develop a robust omnichannel presence by creating a seamless buying experience for our customers. we're going to do this in a two-phased approach. the first phase is modernizing the primary channel by which we reach our consumer, and that's through mobile and the website. we can leverage this opportunity to ensure our communication strategy clearly amplifies our value proposition. our second phase is to create a seamless omnichannel approach, and we're primed to win. we've got 1,166 brick-and-mortar locations, 1.4 million tires in inventory, and access to all major retail tire brands. this approach will allow our customer to view and purchase tires online, seamlessly schedule an appointment, and go in-store for installation. this creates a better one-stop shop customer experience that monro can own from start to finish.
slide 39 illustrates the importance of being a preferred tire installer for third-party online sellers, and this strategy allows us to leverage our core marketing strategies, which first, we get to meet the consumer where they are, which is purchasing tires online. second, we can drive new customer acquisition since 50% of these consumers are new to monro. this gives us the opportunity inspect their vehicle, recommend any add-on service, and drive conversion in-store. once the customer is in-store, we can drive retention by adding them to our crm database and begin to build long-term one-to-one relationships.
in conclusion, our core strategies will enhance our customer-centric engagement with a focus on the following: increasing customer retention by delivering the right message for the right next service at the right team through our crm platform. we'll begin to roll this out in q2. second, drive new customer acquisitions by targeting high-value consumers, working with our consumer analytics firm, which we will roll out in q4. third, invest in marketing channels with the highest roi to meet our consumers where they are -- and, you saw we're beginning to shift to digital, so that's ongoing.
create a seamless omnichannel experience for our customers to buy tires online and install in-store. our two-phased approach with website modernization will roll out in q2 and omnichannel will roll out in fiscal year '20 q1. lastly, we will continue to support online retailers as their preferred installer to drive traffic. that will be ongoing. next, i'd like to introduce evan naylor, our chief operating officer.
evan naylor -- chief operating officer
well, thank you, deborah, and good morning, everyone. my name is evan naylor, and i'm monro's new chief operating officer, and i'm excited to be with you here today. prior to monro, i had the opportunity to work for some great retailers. working with both large-box companies like target and home depot as well as in the smaller-format c-store industry with murphy usa, i developed a unique retail perspective. through all these experiences, a common theme rings true. retail is about a clearly defined strategy that is well-executed consistently across all locations. i am passionate about achieving this consistent execution by building teams focused on operational excellence and delivering great experiences for our customers. i'm excited to join monro in the early innings of monro.forward and lead our team through this positive transformation.
you heard from brett and deborah about the first two pillars of this transformation. i would like to share with you the last two pillars of the monro.forward strategy, our optimized product and service offerings, and our initiatives to accelerate productivity and team engagement. turning to slide 43, i will provide an overview of our redefined selling approach through our new customer inspection process, which will focus on improving our in-store conversion, and also our good-better-best merchandising strategy and improved tire sell strategy, which is focused on educating our customers and providing them with clear options tailor-fit to meet their specific needs.
first, we are improving our customer inspection process by providing our guest with an easy-to-understand form. this form will educate them on the results of their vehicle inspection while also providing our technicians with an easy-to-follow process to ensure consistent execution of the vehicle courtesy check. providing the customer with a clear understanding of their vehicle's needs gives them peace of mind that their vehicle is safe and operating at optimal performance.
as part of our inspection process, we also provide customers with a new scheduled maintenance review. this will educate them on any recommended services from their owner's manual. we will provide customers with dealer-quality service and maintenance for significantly less.
in the future, we will also introduce an electronic version of the courtesy inspection. this will improve the overall inspection process and will also provide our customers with real-time communication about their inspection.
as highlighted on slide 45, we also believe that we can drive higher in-store conversion and expand margins with a stronger merchandise strategy across good, better, and best product options that are relevant to all consumer price segments. here, we show our multiple packages for oil, brake, and tire installation. we are also refining our selling approach so our teammates can properly educate our customers about their vehicle care needs and offer them the right products and services at the right prices.
we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of our product and service offering to develop a clearly defined merchandise strategy. as a result of this analysis, we launched good-better-best service packages in q1 fiscal 2019 to provide customers with clear options to choose the right services for their vehicle. offering several options keeps the customer education and in-store selling process simple and gives our teammates the opportunity to trade customers up to higher-value packages and also increase attachment sales.
finally, we have optimized our tire pricing strategy. historically, monro has included the price of the tire installation with the price of the tire while the majority of the industry sells these items individually. unless the customer has read the small print, this may have led them to believe our tires were priced higher than our competitors'. to alleviate any potential misconception, in q4 fiscal '18, we changed our online pricing approach to unbundle tire from installation.
moving on to slide 46, i would like to provide more detail around our improved tire sales strategy. tires are an important part of monro's category given that they represent half of our sales. therefore, it is critical for us to offer the right tires at the right price point. through our product assessment, we identified considerable gaps in our tire offering, especially at the higher and mid price points. we have taken near-term steps to correct this and optimize our tire assortment by leveraging the breadth of our tire brand portfolio.
going forward, we also see great potential in leveraging data analytics to align our tire inventory assortment with consumer demographics so that we can provide the right-sized vehicle for the vehicle population surrounding our stores. this will further be supported by better sales tools and visual merchandising to educate our customers on their tire options, which we plan on launching across our stores in q1 fiscal '20.
we are confident that our redefined selling approach combined with our optimized tire assortment will contribute to improving the customer experience and maximizing our ticket through higher conversion. overall, our new customer inspection process coupled with the introduction of good-better-best products provide customers with better options and help our teammates inform and advise them with what option is right for their vehicle. leveraging these tools and initiatives will ensure we are delivering a consistent five-star experience while also improving in-store conversion and expanding margins.
now, on to slide 47, let's shift gears on how we accelerate our productivity through our highly engaged teammates. as outlined on slide 48, we will focus on optimizing our store staffing model and offering our teammates a clear path for career advancement, including an enhanced training program, while aligning their compensation with behaviors that drive optimal financial performance.
turning to slide 49, as a service business, staffing and scheduling is a critical aspect of our productivity. based on our initial analysis, we have identified labor productivity opportunities for improvement to our staffing and scheduling model. we want to make sure that we have the staffing in each store that is aligned with its needs in order to achieve greater store efficiency and deliver a consistent five-star experience for our customers. we will do this by optimizing the right headcount, including both part-time and full-time teammates. day part scheduling gives us more flexibility to ensure our staffing matches customer traffic patterns. having the right people in the right place also ensures that we have the right skill levels for each store based on sales and volume mix as well as that store's growth potential.
additionally, we are implementing a new data-driven scheduling system. this will help us drive further efficiency for our teammates. this system, which we rolled out in q1 fiscal '20, will move us away from current paper schedules that are determined solely based on a store's gross sales. the new model will use key labor drivers such as customer account, sales by category, and labor cost of service to pinpoint the right staffing complement for each store and schedule teammates based on peak traffic trends. in parallel, the mobile app for our teammates will allow them to easily pick up shifts and give them the flexibility that they need to increase their hours and earnings.
moving on to slide 50, i would like to spend a moment to highlight our strategic initiatives to attract, develop, and retain talent. this is a critical aspect of our productivity initiatives because a teammate who is given the proper training and development, as well as a clear career path, is likely to be more engaged, more productive, and less likely to leave. we are strongly committed to supporting our teammates' personal and professional growth. our goal is to ensure that we have the right hiring and onboarding procedures for our new teammates, to develop and advance our people into roles with increasing amounts of responsibility and leadership, and to provide our teammates with a clear pathway for career growth.
to attract the right talent and build the best team in the aftermarket auto industry, we are focused on providing our people with the right tools to optimize their performance. to accomplish this, we will roll out a robust cloud-based curriculum called monro university in q3 fiscal year '19. this will provide our teammates with the technical training needed to effectively serve our customers today and prepare them to handle future technician requirements as vehicles become more complex with the increased adoption of technology.
our retention efforts with our teammates will benefit greatly from the previously mentioned electronic scheduling system, which optimizes our technicians' ability to earn hours and pay while also providing them with transparency into their schedule. we also expect to drive higher retention by providing more transparency into career opportunities and to aid the team in charting their own course toward advancement, which will be further supported by annual reviews, which will align their business as well as their developmental objectives.
turning to slide 51, the final piece of the puzzle to optimize productivity and drive team engagement is to make certain that our incentives are tightly connected to desired performance. this is a significant opportunity for us, as the previous compensation model was based solely on profitability, which in some cases can lead to poor customer experiences. our new compensation model will be based on a balanced scorecard that rewards same-store sales growth, profitability, and the customer experience.
the incentives are designed to increase as the teammate's performance improves with maximum payouts for outstanding performance. this new compensation plan will also streamline all previous bonus programs, creating consistency and providing us with the ability to use labor more productively across our stores and markets.
in conclusion, we are very excited about the opportunities to accelerate productivity and team engagement across our business. normalizing our processes across all monro stores will deliver a better five-star experience for our customers by creating a consistent way of doing things for our team and ensuring our teams are doing those things consistently day in and day out. our good-better-best service and products will educate our guest on what's right for them and lead them to trade-ups which will enhance our margins, coupled with our new customer inspection process, which provides us with more opportunities in-store.
at the same time, we are committed to using our labor more efficiently with a data-driven store staffing model and electronic scheduling system, which will allow us to leverage our people more effectively while improving our customer experience. we are also confident that the introduction of monro university, along with our talent management initiatives, will place our teammates in the driver's seat of their own development and career advancement, helping them stay on the cutting edges of shifts in technology and the shift from ""do it yourself"" to ""do it for me,"" which in turn will improve our overall business performance. with that, i am pleased to hand the presentation over to brian.
brian d'ambrosia -- chief financial officer and senior vice president of finance
thank you, evan, and good morning, everyone. to begin, i would like to walk you through how the execution of our strategic initiatives will allow us to drive a scalable business model capable of sustainable growth. turning to slide 55, we believe the execution of our strategic initiatives will provide us with multiple avenues for growth through same-store sales improvement as well as acquisitions and greenfield expansion.
first, as we have described earlier, we expect to drive higher customer retention and acquisition rates through our monro.forward strategy. we are confident that our renewed focus on the customer will provide us with a clear pathway to drive organic growth, positioning monro to capitalize on the momentum in our industry. additionally, by driving consistency and increased productivity across the business, we'll be able to more efficiently integrate acquisitions. our clear standards for how we look and how we operate will also benefit our integration process, increasing the value we realize from the companies that we acquire. finally, we will continue to expand our store base through greenfield locations. we will use our data-driven analytics to select the best markets to pursue store openings and we will realize more value from the companies we acquire.
turning to slide 56, i would like to provide additional detail around our acquisition strategy, which remains a pillar of our growth strategy here at monro. our commitment to this strategy is evidenced by our recent appalachian tire and free service tire acquisitions, which, as we previously mentioned, will collectively add $54 million in annualized sales. we have completed 45 acquisitions in the last 16 fiscal years, adding 681 locations and $900 million in annualized revenue. over the last six years, we have completed 29 of these acquisitions, entering eight new states and expanding our presence in southern and midwestern markets.
going forward, we will leverage data-driven analytics to further support our growth strategy. we have a robust pipeline of high-quality acquisition targets. currently, we have over ten ndas signed on opportunities ranging from five to 40 stores. as we build upon our robust m&a pipeline, we anticipate the market will remain ripe for consolidation given the significant fragmentation in our industry. as you can see on the chart on the left-hand side, the top 10 national automotive chains have only 14% of the market share, with the other 86% being smaller operators.
using consumer demographic analytics will allow us to better identify targets that operate in the markets with favorable demographics and customer trends, ensuring we enter regions who are poised to benefit most. finally, we have added talent and structure to our m&a teams, who will work with our management team to ensure we capitalize on the momentum in the market.
turning to slide 58, i would like to provide a brief overview of our fiscal 2018 results, followed by a discussion of our fiscal 2019 outlook as well as our three-year organic growth targets. i will also provide a few comments on our disciplined capital allocation strategy and continued focus on growing shareholder value.
starting with our financial results on slide 59, we are very pleased to deliver fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2018 performance in line with our expectations. sales for the fourth quarter increased 13.3% year over year to $285.6 million, driven by a comparable store sales increase of 10.3% on a reported basis or 2.4% when adjusted for an extra week of sales in fiscal 2018. we also benefited from sales from new stores of $13.8 million, including $8.7 million from recent acquisitions.
gross margins increased 70 basis points year over year to 37.7%, primarily due to a decrease in distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales as we gained leverage on these largely fixed costs with an increase in comparable store sales. labor costs decreased as a percentage of sales as compared to the prior-year quarter and material costs as a percentage of sales remained relatively flat.
operating margin increased 270 basis points to 10.7% as the additional expenses from 32 net new stores, $1 million in management transition costs, and expenses related to the extra week were offset by the leverage we gained on distribution and occupancy costs and operating expenses with higher comparable store sales.
diluted earnings per share were $0.52, up 79% year over year, and included $0.02 per share in management transition costs, $0.04 of net tax benefit from the newly enacted tax legislation, and $0.10 of contribution from the 53rd week. the net tax benefit totaled $1.4 million or $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter and is comprised of $0.02 per share related to the reduction of approximately 300 basis points in our estimated annual effective tax rate during the fourth quarter as well as $0.02 per share related to revaluing our net deferred tax assets to reflect the new u.s. federal corporate income tax rate. this resulted in an effective tax rate of 27.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to 34.4% in the prior-year period.
for the full year fiscal 2018, sales totaled $1.128 billion, up 10.4% year over year, in line with our guidance. the total sales growth was driven by a $96.2 million increase in sales from new stores, including $73.5 million from recent acquisitions, while comparable store sales increased 1.8% on a reported basis and were approximately flat on a 52-week basis, compared to a 4% decline in the prior year.
diluted earnings per share were $1.92 for the full year, at the high end of our guidance range. fiscal 2018 diluted eps included $0.04 per share in litigation settlement costs, $0.06 per share in management transition costs, and $0.06 per share related to the net expense impact of newly enacted tax legislation. it also reflected $0.10 of contribution from the 53rd week.
lastly, we opened eight greenfield locations during the fourth quarter, bringing our total greenfield store openings to 22 in fiscal 2018. as a reminder, greenfield stores include new construction as well as the acquisition of one-to-four-store operations. these locations are expected to add approximately $1 million each in annual sales. as of march 31st, 2018, the company had 1,150 company-operated stores and 102 franchise locations as compared with 1,118 company-operated stores and 114 franchise locations as of march 25th, 2017. during the fourth quarter, we added 15 company-operating stores and closed three.
turning to our outlook for fiscal 2019 on slide 60, based on current economic conditions, the contribution of recent acquisitions, and our performance quarter to date, we anticipate comparable store sales to increase 1% to 3% in fiscal year 2019. please note that fiscal 2019 is a 52-week year, while fiscal 2018 was a 53-week year and benefited from an extra week of sales in the fourth quarter. we expect fiscal 2019 total sales of $1.17 billion to $1.2 billion, representing an increase of 3.7% to 6.4% year over year.
as mentioned previously, our comparable store sales decreased 1.7% in fiscal april and have increased approximately 3% through the first half of fiscal may. may results reflect strengthening traffic trends and higher average ticket, a positive trend we expect to continue in fiscal 2019. our full-year guidance includes eight newly constructed greenfield store locations in fiscal 2019 as well as contribution from recently completed acquisitions. as always, our guidance does not contemplate any future acquisitions.
our fiscal 2019 guidance assumes stable overall tire and oil costs compared to fiscal 2018. given these assumptions, we continue to expect to generate earnings growth on a comparable store sales increase above 1%. based on these assumptions, we expect fiscal 2019 earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.40, representing earnings growth of 20% to 25%. this includes approximately $0.01 to $0.03 in accretion from fiscal 2018 acquisitions. the free service acquisition is expected to be break-even to diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2019.
as brett mentioned earlier, the commercial and wholesale locations we acquired as part of the free service acquisition operate at a lower gross margin, primarily due to higher sales mix of tires, and with respect to the wholesale locations, a higher sales mix of tires without installation. therefore, we expect this change in our sales mix will reduce gross margin by approximately 80 basis points on an annual basis and 60 basis points for fiscal 2019. the midpoint of our fiscal 2019 guidance assumes a 20-basis-point decrease in operating margin year over year. excluding the free service acquisition, operating margin is expected to increase 10 basis points in fiscal 2019.
i would also like to provide an update on our expected tax savings in fiscal 2019. we expect the reduction of the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate to reduce our annual effective tax rate from approximately 37% to 24%, providing us with a benefit of approximately $0.40 to diluted earnings per share. this expected diluted earnings per share benefit is lower than the $0.45 to $0.50 that we previously expected due to a slight increase in our expected state income tax rate as a result of the new federal income tax legislation as well as lower expected pre-tax income primarily related to the reinvestment of approximately 30% or $0.13 of these tax savings to support our monro.forward strategic initiatives.
these reinvestments, of which $0.11 are recurring and $0.02 are one-time in nature, will include approximately $0.04 for our initiatives dedicated to improving the customer experience, $0.01 to enhance customer-centric engagement, and $0.08 for our initiatives to accelerate productivity and team engagement. lastly, at the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect interest expense to be approximately $29 million, depreciation and amortization to be approximately $54 million, and ebitda to be approximately $186 million. this guidance is based on 33.4 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. a complete bridge comparing the midpoint of our fiscal 2019 eps guidance with fiscal 2018 adjusted eps is presented on slide 61.
turning to slide 62, i would like to provide additional color on our capital expenditures for fiscal 2019. as you can see on the bar chart on the left-hand side of the slide, we anticipate a 20% increase in our capital spending for the year, the majority of which will be driven by our store refresh program, which will be rolled out in the second half of the year, and to a lesser extent by it investments. a breakdown of the store refresh initiative is provided on the right-hand side of the slide and reflects an appropriate level of investment based on store age, size, and the demographics of the market in which the store is located.
i will now walk you through our three-year organic growth financial targets. we anticipate our strategic plan will accelerate same-store sales growth, which will drive operating leverage and double-digit earnings growth. this excludes any impact from future acquisitions. as illustrated on slide 64, we expect our monro.forward strategy, supported by favorable industry trends, will accelerate same-store sales growth from 2% at the midpoint of our fiscal 2019 guidance to above 4% by 2021. we expect the accelerated top-line growth to drive operating leverage and result in operating margin reaching 12%-plus by 2021 while also supporting monro.forward investments. lastly, we expect to consistently deliver organic diluted earnings-per-share growth between 10% and 15% by 2021.
as outlined on slide 65, we are executing on our growth initiatives while maintaining a disciplined capital allocation strategy. first, we plan on spending an incremental $75 million in capital expenditures above our normal run rate over the next five years, primarily to support investments in store reimage and technology. secondly, we will continue to capitalize on attractive acquisitions in the marketplace. we believe m&a opportunities represent potential 10% annual sales growth and an additional 12% to 17% earnings growth by year 3.
we also remain strongly committed to returning cash to our shareholders, as evidenced by the increase in our dividend 13 times since we initiated the dividend program 13 years ago, including the 11% increase in the dividend announced today. lastly, we will maintain a flexible balance sheet which supports our business objectives. we ended fiscal 2018 with strong leverage ratios and ample debt availability to execute our growth strategy. during fiscal 2018, we generated approximately $121 million of cash flow from operating activities and reduced our debt under our revolver by approximately $34 million.
so, to conclude, we are confident that our sharp focus on executing our monro.forward strategy combined with our disciplined capital allocation will allow us to build a strong, scalable platform for growth. looking ahead, our top priorities are to drive organic growth through our strategic investments while continuing to execute our acquisition strategy and returning cash to shareholders. we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on favorable industry trends and to achieve our three-year financial targets. i'll now turn it over to brett to provide some closing remarks before we move to q&a.
brett ponton -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, brian, and hello again, everyone. as we wrap up today, we wanted to give you a look at some of our most important initiatives across our four key areas. we will use this timeline in order to track our progress and to hold ourselves accountable as we continue to execute monro.forward over the next few years.
in closing, we are well positioned for the future at monro. we have an experienced leadership team that is ready to build upon the strong foundation of our business and the growing momentum we are seeing in our industry, specifically in the cohort we are operating in. we have made the investments in technology and data analytics needed to support our strategic initiatives, which will drive increased consistency and productivity across our business, ultimately increasing the lifetime value of our customers. we see a strong opportunity to capitalize on the fragmentation in our industry and will continue to consolidate through highly accretive acquisitions. lastly, the execution of our strategy will strengthen the scalability of our business, driving a sustainable platform for long-term growth and strong shareholder returns. that concludes today's program. we'll now move on to q&a. maureen?

maureen mulholland -- vice president, general counsel, and secretary
thanks, brett. before we start taking  , just a couple of notes. for those of you in the room, if you'd like to ask a question, please raise your hand. we will bring a microphone over to you. when the microphone is handed to you, if you would please state your name and the name of your firm for the benefit of those who are listening via webcast. for anyone who is listening online, if you would like to ask a question, please post your question via the webcast.
matthew fassler -- goldman sachs -- managing director
good morning. it's matt fassler from goldman sachs. thanks a lot for your presentation this morning. my question relates to third-party tire sellers like amazon, presumably, and others. can you talk about your expectation for the role that this cohort plays in the market and how that's expected to evolve? also, can you talk about the mechanics of what a transaction involving a third-party seller at monro look like, just so we can understand exactly how this plays out at retail? thank you.
brett ponton -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, matt. first of all, as deborah mentioned in her slide, we at monro are committed to first of all, developing our own omnichannel strategy, but we want to control the experience from buying tires online and having them installed at our 1,160 brick-and-mortar locations. having said that, we also recognize that consumers are choosing other channels to purchase their tires, and in that respect, we want to be part of the installation network for any online seller of tires.
so, we have relationships today -- like we have had for a number of years -- with online sellers that represent the 7% penetration rate that we shared with you today of tires that are bought online. look, matt, i think we see the penetration rate increasing over time for tires being bought online. however, i think there are some nice, defensible barriers that we have in this industry as it relates to our brick-and-mortar given the fact that tires still require installation. most consumers can't ship tires to their house because they don't have the equipment to mount and balance the tires on their car, and in most cases, we would recommend aligning your tires as well to get the most out of the investment in those tires. so, certainly, at a brick-and-mortar, it creates a nice advantage for us.
the other thing i think we need to understand about tires is for the most part, tires are a low-interest category for consumers, meaning consumers in many cases don't know they need new tires until they go in for an oil change or brake service, we inspect the car -- like evan had mentioned -- and identify the fact that that consumer needs new tires for their vehicle. i think the reason why we see a spike in tire demand during winter driving season -- because in many respects, that's the first time a consumer will get a stimulus that suggests to them that they need to buy new tires. either their tires spin or their traction control light will go off on the dashboard. so, again, we believe there are some nice barriers -- advantages, i should say -- to us having brick-and-mortar locations.
so, let's talk a little bit about the economics. we also think it's pretty attractive for us just installing tires. we mentioned earlier we have a lot of experience in installing tires for existing players today and we're able to compare the average ticket that we see on those installation purchases. our average ticket overall is north of $160.00 for an installed tire purchase. for an online seller, it's about $120.00. so, what comes with that is the price to install the tire, and of course, any installation or attachments that will come with that -- for example, tpms reset or the opportunity to inspect and add on other services when the customer is in the store. so, as deborah also mentioned, 50% of the time, those customers are new to our brand and we see that as a good opportunity to drive traffic to our store, get those consumers into our database, and leverage the crm program to communicate to them going forward.
matthew fassler -- goldman sachs -- managing director
thank you.
brian nagel -- oppenheimer and company -- managing director
good morning. brian nagel from oppenheimer. so, brett, thanks for all the detail -- and, your team, too. can you talk a bit about -- right at the beginning of your presentation, you discussed briefly your prior roles. how much of what you're doing here at monro is similar to what you've done at other companies?
brett ponton -- president and chief executive officer
thanks for the question. first of all, i think most of you know my background. i spent 15 years with goodyear and have a marketing operations background. i had the opportunity to run goodyear's company-owned store retail locations, where we underwent a similar approach to driving operational excellence and reimage stores to improve the customer experience. the last two roles prior to joining monro i spent in private-equity-backed companies that were more operational turnarounds, one being a jiffy lube franchise business where we operated just under 400 locations and grew that company to just under 600 locations in four years, and most recently, at the parent company that owned aamco, which was a little bit unique in the sense that it was a franchise business primarily but had some of the uniqueness -- some of the similarities that we talked about today.
so, as it relates to your question, the playbook that we're executing here is very consistent with the strategies that i have implemented in the two previous companies i've been at. a lot of the vendors that we had talked about today are existing vendors that i had relationships with in my past life. i've seen firsthand the value of the services and the technology and how that translated into improved performance. one, in particular, is around online reputation management. we've selected the same vendor i've used for the last eight to nine years, and i'm encouraged that we're seeing similar results -- if not accelerated results -- using that same vendor that we have in the past.
as it relates to standardizing in-store operations, i think it's pretty typical and can happen to a lot of companies that grow pretty quickly through acquisition -- inconsistency can creep up across your portfolio, requiring the need to come back and be very disciplined and very standardized about how you approach in-store operations. i've had to do that in the past two companies that i ran. similarly, one of the reasons why we hired evan is we like his background of seeing what good, strong, process-driven retailers do at home depot and target, and also, i liked his experience that he had in specialty box retail in the c-store space that sometimes can experience a little higher turnover environment, a little harder, sometimes, to control the experience from point to point. i think those are all relevant experiences that evan brings as coo now for the company. so, we're excited about having him on board. thanks, brian.
john healy -- northcoast research -- managing director
thank you. john healy from northcoast. brett, i wanted to ask two questions. when i think about the slides that you put up there today -- and, you talked about the organic growth going from 2% to 4% over the next few years -- could you talk about it by category, whether it's tires, exhaust, brakes, or front end? how do you see those categories being positive contributors or headwinds? secondly, i was hoping you could talk a little bit about some of the changes in tire distribution that goodyear, bridgestone, and michelin have all undergone or are setting up to undergo later this year. do you see that impacting your wholesale business meaningfully, and what does it mean for installers like yourself?
brett ponton -- president and chief executive officer
good question, john. first of all, it relates to category growth. as we've shared, 50% of our business is tires today, and certainly, as evan walked through, that's going to be an area that we're going to apply some stronger analytic rigor to our business to ensure that we can drive and maximize unit volume as well as margins through better price mix management through optimizing our product screens and getting the most out of that category. so, we certainly are going to expect growth out of tires. brakes is another key category for us.
the other areas of emphasis i will add color to that evan touched on are around scheduled maintenance services, ranging from oil changes to other services that are triggered by the consumer's odometer as well as time intervals. that is an area of emphasis for us. we started our emphasis there in q1 of this year with the launch of three new packages, with the objective being help our teammates in-store communicate the value to the consumer, and options and choices to buy different products or fluids for their vehicle creates good trade-up opportunity for us and the opportunity to expand margin. we'll continue to execute that better as that strategy unfolds.
as it relates to tire distribution, clearly, our industry is in a major state of change and consolidation. we obviously know that we are a consolidator with our emphasis around taking out some of the fragmentation at retail. certainly, there's a lot of consolidation and changes with tire distribution. with michelin's joint venture with tbc followed on by bridgestone and goodyear joining forces on tire hub, it's created some interesting dynamics as relates to distribution.
i will say this: we buy tires direct from our tire manufactures. all the major brands, we have a direct relationship with, as well as we have access to a supply chain in southeast asia that gives us access to more opening-price-point-sensitive brands. so, we don't see the changes necessarily impacting us a great deal early on, just given the fact we buy tires direct and how those manufacturers choose to deliver tires to us certainly is going to change a little bit in the case of goodyear with their decisions around another national distributor, but we're going to have to work through some short-term transitional issues there that we feel confident will be non-disruptive to us. so, we don't see any significant change. our focus here clearly is to deliver the best experience to our consumers in-store for tires, for both online retailers as well as our own business.
jamie albertine -- consumer edge -- analyst
hi. jamie albertine from consumer edge. thanks again for a great presentation, great to meet everybody. one clarification: you mentioned in your next-year outlook a 1% comp leverage point. just wondering if it's fair -- can we push that forward to also assume that it stays 1%-ish over the longer-term outlook that you provided, or will that move somewhat as you achieve this normalized run rate with the digital investments and so forth? as well, a follow-up to your point on technicians and sweet spots -- i noticed on your chart you said transmissions start to tick up in years 12 and 13. i remember monro always being a ""keep it simple"" service model, and i'm wondering -- as you're looking at hiring new technicians, are you envisioning more complex services, and would that have any impact to inventory turns, bay turns, and so forth over time that we should consider?
brett ponton -- president and chief executive officer
why don't i take the second part of the question, and brian, you can take the first part? as we articulated in the industry slide that showed types of service that are done, i just want to clarify that that doesn't indicate that that's our intention to get into those services necessarily, it's just to indicate when those types of services are done on a consumer's vehicle based upon the lifecycle. so, coming back to your question, jamie, one of the things i like about monro is how we've been very focused on our service menu.
i think we are well positioned in the sweet spot of the industry. that balances a couple things. one is good purchase frequency with the services we do coupled with higher-value services with tires and brakes. the third part of that equation is it allows us to stay very focused from a labor point of view on keeping our labor model very focused and cost-effective. that gets strengthened with the introduction of monro university, where we see the opportunity to recruit technicians at an entry-level capacity and create opportunities for them to grow and develop by leveraging the online training that we're going to develop with monro university.
so, today, our technicians have the ability to diagnose issues, plug scanners into the obd and pull the necessary codes to diagnose problems. we feel like going forward -- especially once we have monro university installed -- we'll stay on the cutting edge of those changes going forward to respond to any more sophisticated changes with technology going forward. but, we don't have intention today of adding more complexity to our service offering because i really like where we're positioned today, but i think there's an opportunity to improve the penetration rate that we have in the categories that we are in today that we had talked about earlier.
brian d'ambrosia -- chief financial officer and senior vice president of finance
just to answer the first part of your question, jamie, we've considered in our three-year outlook a similar inflation hurdle, and like you said, carried that forward. certainly, we would expect some of the efficiencies that we've talked about in productivity to affect that, and potentially, in a positive way. we also know that a lot of that hurdle is driven by macro conditions, whether it's the tire pricing environment or oil, so we're surely not making any different assumptions on those in the out years and keeping it at the 1%.
stephanie benjamin -- suntrust robinson -- vice president
hi, good morning. stephanie benjamin from suntrust. thanks again for your time. my question really just goes back to the long-term same-store sales growth target acceleration from 2% to 4%. could you break that down a little bit between what we're seeing now from a category growth of that 2% and what categories will take it to that acceleration of 4%? again, rough numbers are fine.
brett ponton -- president and chief executive officer
i think very consistent with what i mentioned earlier, our core business today is tires -- 50% of our business -- followed by brakes and scheduled maintenance services. our emphasis is going to be on our core categories and to drive deeper penetration and growth there, and i think we really see the opportunity to increase our penetration on scheduled maintenance services, other services that are more routine, for two reasons. it creates great opportunities in-store to drive ticket increases through attachment, but the other advantage to that emphasis is that it allows us to be more relevant to consumers sooner in their car lifecycle today.
our average age of our vehicle today is in line with the industry. we have a desire to be more relevant to consumers sooner. the entrée to be able to do that is to be a bit more relevant on scheduled maintenance services that we'll emphasize going forward. a lot of that is triggered by two things. one is -- evan took you through that this morning -- around improving our inspection process in-store that allows us to identify and educate the consumer on what their vehicle needs. the second piece of that equation is leveraging the data that we know about the consumer's vehicle in terms of what's in your owner's manual on what services are required for those services at that particular point in time. if we execute well in-store and leverage that data in our crm platform that deborah talked about, we see that as the formula that's going to allow us to drive better penetration on scheduled maintenance going forward.
scott stember -- c.l. king and associates -- senior vice president
hi. scott stember from c.l. king. thanks for taking my questions. you mentioned up 3% in may. can you talk about april and may? was that 3% number that you gave april and may combined, or -- you had alluded to the fact that april might have been a little bit soft.
brett ponton -- president and chief executive officer
we provided the april results. may is -- at the midpoint of may, we are up 3% in may.
scott stember -- c.l. king and associates -- senior vice president
is that just for the month of may/
brett ponton -- president and chief executive officer
just for the month of may.
scott stember -- c.l. king and associates -- senior vice president
got it. maybe just talk about the weather. obviously, that's been an issue the last couple of years, and nobody wants to blame things on the weather, but clearly, when you don't have winter, it hurts. this year, we had it. can you talk about how that's helping your business and the categories you will typically do well in, such as tires? maybe some of the other areas and how you would expect that to play out for the rest of the year.
brett ponton -- president and chief executive officer
as we talked about in our q4 performance, you saw that we were up 5% in tires, and certainly, tires is driven a lot by weather conditions, and certainly, in the early part of the fourth quarter, we had a favorable backdrop on that. so, we would consider the weather certainly helping our performance in the fourth quarter on tires. i also think another factor -- evan mentioned that we had made the decision to decouple tire pricing from installation pricing. we've seen some favorability in our demand based upon those changes that we've made. harsher winters create a nice, favorable backdrop as well for more services, and we have seen some strength in our brake business, our front-end business as a result of more corrosion, potholes on the road, et cetera.
a little bit of a step back in april driven by a slow start to spring, a little delayed spring, and certainly, an extended winter. i think as it relates to vehicles, particularly tires and other categories, we always want a traditional winter season that rolls nicely into a traditional spring selling season. when you get a little overlap on that, it creates some issues, but i think net of that, we feel confident that rolling out of the april season, we saw a nice bounce-back in sales in may, as we reported this morning.
scott stember -- c.l. king and associates -- senior vice president
thanks.
bret jordan -- jefferies llc -- managing director
bret jordan with jefferies. as we think about the capex cadence, obviously, you're looking at about a $10 million increase this year as you start the store reformats in the second half of this year. what do you think about next year and the following year? is there going to be a big investment cycle or are you going to keep capex roughly flat? and then, a quick follow-up: on the quarter just ended, could you talk regional performance, north versus south?
brett ponton -- president and chief executive officer
i'll start with the first part. both regions of our business were up in q4 and the north outpaced the south marginally, but both sides were up. as it relates to the capex cadence, i'll let brian add some color here, but look, we provided color to you that suggests that we're going to spend $75 million over a five-year period, and that implies a little bit longer timeline to do the refresh. that's subject to change. part of the reason why you do pilots is you want to really refine how much capital we truly we believe we're going to invest via the store segment that we've laid out, but it also helps us understand the difficulty in execution.
certainly, our expectation at this point is that it's a five-year timeline, pretty linear in how that rolls out, but we'll further refine that once we get through the pilot period and the first part of the rollout that's scheduled. i think one of the things we want to be mindful of is mitigating the disruption to our business, and having done this before in a couple of other formats, we want to be thoughtful about the pace that we roll out, especially within the context of the other initiatives that we laid out this morning as well.
brian d'ambrosia -- chief financial officer and senior vice president of finance
i think brett was spot-on there. i also would like to add that we are -- one of the advantages of this rollout as well as our other initiatives that we're doing here is they're flexible in nature in terms of our ability to react to conditions on the ground and open the spigot, turn the spigot off in terms of the pace at which we move. so, certainly, we are not committed to anything long-term in terms of commitment, so we're able to be really flexible here and be able to navigate this as the pilots and as the rollout start to take step.
bret jordan -- jefferies llc -- managing director
one last question -- on your comp expectations, what are you thinking price versus traffic in that mix? are you saying pricing is a tailwind in comp, or is the online competition in tires going to limit what you can get in price on that side of the business?
brett ponton -- president and chief executive officer
i think early on, the early years, we're expecting early in the cycle, maybe a little more of the comp coming from price mix versus traffic, and as the initiatives take hold around customer retention, we would expect that to shift more favorably to traffic trends deeper into our three-year plan.
matthew fassler -- goldman sachs -- managing director
it's matt fassler from goldman sachs, and i have two follow-ups. you didn't speak about it much, but the sg&a this quarter -- when you back out the management transition costs -- was certainly well below our expectations, and the growth rate per store -- backing out the extra week -- was well below what you had been doing prior. is there -- what did that result from? i'm talking dollars now, not just ratio. what did that result from? i know you spoke about reinvestment, but how do we think about whether that sets any precedent for the fore? and, i'll wait on my second question.
brian d'ambrosia -- chief financial officer and senior vice president of finance
we really saw some benefit from our higher comp sales. really, that was what drove our improved leverage on sg&a. there wasn't anything significantly structurally in the quarter. certainly, here at monro, we've always been focused on cost control. i wouldn't say there's anything unique to this quarter that wouldn't be something we would expect to carry forward.
matthew fassler -- goldman sachs -- managing director
my second question relates to acquisitions and to the whole notion of capital allocation and cost discipline. if we look at your history as a firm over the past five or six years -- and going back longer -- your eps have typically grown slower than your net income. that has to be, in part, a function of what the company has paid for deals. so, can you talk about the competitive environment for deals, given that there are a couple of private equity entities that are quite focused on the space alongside you, and also, how you intend to think about the returns that you are likely to attract on transactions?
brett ponton -- president and chief executive officer
i'll take the first part and brian can take the second part. in terms of environment, i think we've made this comment the two previous calls, and i think the landscape is still pretty consistent. for the deal size that historically been in our sweet spot, the 5-to-40-store deal range, we haven't seen meaningful appreciation in the multiples there, certainly on what we would consider more platform-sized deals -- large-sized deals -- where private equity firms create an entry point in the marketplace. certainly, the multiples have appreciated there.
i think our approach and thought process going forward at monro is 1). i'm probably not going to be as transparent on disclosing what multiples we're paying because i think from a competitive point of view, that's put us at a disadvantage, but 2). i think we're very focused on creating value, and if we can find deals that allow us to create value for the company and our shareholders, we are going to do those deals. we've got plenty of room on our balance sheet. as you've seen with the monro.forward initiative, our objective here going forward is to not just leverage cost synergies that we can gain from these companies, but also see our way to revenue and margin synergies with becoming a more scalable, data-driven, sophisticated operator as a result of that.
brian d'ambrosia -- chief financial officer and senior vice president of finance
related to returns, certainly, we feel that while we haven't changed our return targets, we certainly feel we have a much better opportunity, as brett said, to achieve those return targets around our acquisitions. and, certainly, we feel that we have an opportunity very similar to our operating to continue to expand our overall return on invested capital as an organization, both through the same-store sales growth and also through more effective integration of the acquisitions we do.
matthew fassler -- goldman sachs -- managing director
thank you
george schultz -- nitorum capital -- analyst
hi. george schultz, nitorum. so, i had a question for you about tire costs. given at the manufacturer level, they have pretty rapidly rising raw material costs at the moment, how does it impact you and what do you have baked into the guidance at the moment?
brett ponton -- president and chief executive officer
we've seen a pretty stable and consistent environment, both on our cost side for tires as well as -- i would consider it a very stable retail pricing environment as well. brian mentioned our assumption -- our fy '19 guidance is sustained stability there. i think what gives us confidence around sustained stability there is the leverage that we have, and the diversity in our supply chain, and the options that we have as a large buyer of tires to create a lot of flexibility in where we source tires. so, to answer your question directly, we're forecasting a pretty consistent environment in fy '19.
george schultz -- nitorum capital -- analyst
and, one follow-up, if i may. in the question earlier about the install business, you said that the average ticket was $120.00 when you do the install as $160.00 as your corporate. what is that $120.00? i thought it was a $20.00 installation when you were doing installation.
brett ponton -- president and chief executive officer
in addition to that, that would also pick up any attachment. so, when the customer comes in for the installation of the tires, in some respects, you require a tpms reset or new tpms sensors on your tires. in addition to that, we do add other services -- in some respects, an alignment for the vehicle would be one example of attachment that would come with that installation, driving the ticket from $80.00 to $120.00 on average.
seth basham -- wedbush -- analyst
hi. seth basham with wedbush. can you remind us of the relative gross margins across product categories and how you see those evolving over the next few years?
brian d'ambrosia -- chief financial officer and senior vice president of finance
if you look at company baseline, our brakes and service categories -- think about it as a plus-10 and think about tires as a minus-10. so, as brett was just mentioning, as we think about the installation business, certainly, the higher margins are going to be on the attachment items, such as the alignments and the tpms resets. the actual tire installation -- the tire sale itself -- of the product is going to be at a lower margin. so, certainly, as we move forward -- and, brett already made some commentary on what products and categories would drive the growth -- think about it and put those relative margins in mind.
seth basham -- wedbush -- analyst
so, no significant change in terms of product category for each of the margins?
brian d'ambrosia -- chief financial officer and senior vice president of finance
other than through our in-store execution on the good-better-best options that we talked about earlier -- that evan talked about earlier, we think that we have a real opportunity to educate the customer and put them into the right level, whether it's oil change, brake service, or tire installation.
seth basham -- wedbush -- analyst
thanks.
brian nagel -- oppenheimer and company -- managing director
hi. brian nagel from oppenheimer again. just a follow-up -- with regard to the test group of stores you do that you displayed, to what degree was there variability in the performance of those units? overall, any surprises as you ran down the initial test?
brett ponton -- president and chief executive officer
it was actually pretty consistent, candidly, between the two. one was the midwestern market and the other was the mid-atlantic market that we ran in. one of the businesses -- one of the regions -- was up prior year, the other one was down prior year, but candidly, what we saw there, brian, was good, strong execution with the leaders that got behind that initiative, really embraced it, got their team aligned, really started to get out in front of this cultural change and this focus on customer lifetime value. we saw pretty darn consistent performance across those relative regions.
kyle kavanaugh -- palisade capital -- senior vice president
hi, kyle kavanaugh, palisade capital. i was wondering if you can talk a little bit about your technicians as you roll out these new initiatives. in the past, you've mentioned you might be adjusting their schedules, and i was wondering if there's any potential for disruption on the technician side. i think that some of the dealers have also said that one of the gating factors for improving their comps on the service side has been the availability of technicians, so i was wondering if you could comment on those things.
brett ponton -- president and chief executive officer
sure. let me provide some context on how we see technicians because i think technicians come in different shapes and sizes with a wide variety of technical skillset. i think when a lot of the dealers talk about technicians, we're talking about real high-end technicians that are asc level 1 certified, and i think we would share the view that there is a shortage on technicians that are highly skilled to perform high-end, high-level diagnostics. at monro, our service menu dictates the level of technician that we need to attract and develop in our business. the nature of the services we do are not necessarily requiring the level of certification that a technician at the dealer does. so, i think we're a little bit different in that respect.
having said that, i think i've commented before that when i looked at monro's technician turnover rate, it's probably a little higher than what i've seen in my past experience, which has driven a lot of the initiatives we had talked about earlier around creating good, clear career paths for technicians to where they can hire in at an entry-level position and grow their skills, and develop, and create opportunities for them to grow personally and professionally by leveraging monro university. it's a very similar playbook that i've executed in past companies, where we've created career path and opportunities to develop, and we've seen a meaningful reduction in the level of turnover as a result of that. i would expect the pattern to follow here to monro as we launch monro university.
as it relates to staffing and scheduling stores -- evan alluded to this -- i think the key in any retail business is the lineup, the right quantity of people in-store to service the consumer, as well as, in our particular case, make sure the technicians have the right skillsets to perform the services on our menu. that works two ways. one is we want to make certain that we are not under-skilled -- the technicians that have the skills appropriately to do quality services -- but also, there's a flip side to that where we have to make certain that we're not over-skilled, which is defined as if we have too many more qualified technicians doing work that doesn't require those qualifications, then we certainly are creating margin pressure as a result of that in our business.
i think there's a real opportunity for us to dial in and optimize to get the right quantity as well as technicians that have the right skillset, but for us to unlock that value, i think it requires a cloud-based, data-driven system to be able to support that across 8,000 teammates that we have in the company today.
scott stember -- c.l. king and associates -- senior vice president
scott stember from c.l. king again. maybe just talk about what you mentioned earlier about omnichannel and your plans to expand that in the future -- maybe just give us a better understanding of the timeline and the types of products beyond tires that could possibly be pushed through an omnichannel method. thanks.
brett ponton -- president and chief executive officer
let's start with the timeline. deborah mentioned this. we're thinking about this in two phases. it all starts first with making certain we have our foundational technology in place vis-à-vis our website. our website today is not designed mobile-first, so job 1 for us is to modernize and make the website more contemporary, and we have that slated for q2 of this year. coming in behind that, we'll work on the e-commerce capability, so by q1 of fy '20, we see ourselves in a position at that point to have consumers shop online for tires, make purchases online for tires, and of course, get those tires installed in-store.
as relates to the second part of the question, 50% of our business is tires, and certainly, of all the categories that we offer the consumer, the category that lends itself to buying online and shopping online certainly is tires. however, having said that, i think when a consumer is on our site purchasing tires, there's a nice opportunity online to attach an add-on -- oil changes, scheduled maintenance services, et cetera -- and as we fully develop the crm platform where consumers can have a login information about their car, we can be a bit more prescriptive for them about what items or services they should be adding on to that particular purchase at that point in time.
carolina jolly -- gabelli securities -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. carolina jolly from gabelli. first question -- with the dealerships -- i was recently at another investor day that had to do with tires, and there was this conversation around dealerships getting more aggressive on the tire channel. can you talk about if you've seen that, and if you have seen it, how you combat that?
brett ponton -- president and chief executive officer
i think as relates to dealers and as relates to tires, first of all, the dealers have been in the tire business for 12 or 13 years now, so i don't think that's necessarily a new strategy for them. i think what we've seen from dealers -- and, recognizing that there has been a pretty significant gap in the price/value equation with consumers, i think they've made a lot of moves to close that gap, not necessarily with being more aggressive on price, but i would characterize it more as increasing the value through investments in their experience, showroom, et cetera. so, for the most part, that's what we've seen strategically that they have done.
similar to that, of course, monro -- we are making similar investments in our level of experience, and as we identified this morning and shared with you, we feel like over the last four or five years, the market backdrop set up very favorably for the dealers in the sense that most of the industry growth was in that 0-to-5-year cohort that lines up pretty well with their targeted consumer, but rolling forward, we see those tailwinds now moving more in our favor. the other area that gets contemplated a lot between the aftermarket and the dealer is the dealer certainly wants to keep consumers longer in their brand, and i think in the aftermarket -- certainly, in the case of monro -- we have every desire to be more relevant to consumers sooner in the lifecycle, but as we assess the situation, we see that that battleground is not necessarily on our turf. that battleground is more on others' turf that creates share opportunities for us going forward versus concerns about share loss with their respective initiatives.
jamie albertine -- consumer edge -- analyst
jamie albertine again, consumer edge. two quick follow-ups. apologies if i missed this in the prepared remarks. could you just update us with where your private-label tire penetration is? over the years, that's bounced around a lot with chinese tire tariffs and a lot of different macro noise out there. so, as a baseline, as we get into good-better-best, i'm just wondering what the margin opportunity could be there from a selection perspective. and then, separately, you talked about a 20% increase in capex on a year-over-year basis, which i forget the absolute dollar, but it feels like $10 million to $12 million. is that for 30 stores only -- the vast majority of that -- with retrofitting, and does that suggest that $75 million might be somewhat conservative as you think about bridging that onto the rest of your portfolio over time? thanks.
brian d'ambrosia -- chief financial officer and senior vice president of finance
i'll take the second question first and have brett take the first part. no, the incremental is this year assuming a successful third-quarter pilot and a further rollout in q4. that incremental is not specific to the 30-store pilot.
brett ponton -- president and chief executive officer
as it relates to our tire mix, jamie, about 35% to 40% -- in that range -- is what our internally sourced opening-price-point tires would represent as part of our mix. certainly, going forward, as evan mentioned, we want to be very data-driven and sophisticated about how we set up our tire product screens to optimize balancing volume and price mix -- ultimately, optimizing margin -- based on laying out those assortments, understanding clearly all the options and choices that we have as a multi-branded retailer that has access to every major brand, but also, access to our supply chain in southeast asia -- which, by the way, is quite flexible in and of itself.
when the tariffs came up two or three years ago, it forced us to be a bit more flexible in our supply chain to where we have access to supply not only in china but also throughout southeast asia, as we articulated this morning. so, we've got a lot of flexibility on our tire brands. i think the real opportunity for us is to figure out how we optimize margins based on the brands, the tire lines, and the options that we have to create max value for us as a company.
jamie albertine -- consumer edge -- analyst
thank you. along those lines, regarding maximizing margins on the categories, i know some of the tire manufacturers have talked about larger-diameter tires giving them more margin the last couple of years from a price mix standpoint. as those cars go through the replacement cycle -- maybe it begins in the next three years -- do you think the larger-diameter tires will actually produce a better gross margin to you as an installer, or do you think that gets competed down, and is there anything associated with that in the guidance that you're talking to?
brett ponton -- president and chief executive officer
when we look at our tire category historically and roll forward, we've seen a shift to higher-value tires, if you will, large-size tires, and certainly, the vehicles in operation is what's driving that. as you might expect, the bigger the tire, usually, the higher the revenue, and also, we've seen margins that would fall in line with that higher revenue as well. i think the real question for us going forward is as those vehicles age in the lifecycle, as we all know, as we talked about earlier, the consumer's appetite to pay higher prices also becomes a little bit diminished, so in terms of how that lifecycle plays out on tire pricing, i think it remains to be seen. but, early innings and where we're at today, we certainly see higher revenue per tire and higher margin per tire on the larger rim sizes.
maureen mulholland -- vice president, general counsel, and secretary
we did have a question online. it's been asked in part already, so i'll just ask what hasn't been touched on already. this is from adam schwartz at black bear value partners. he's asking about the auto dealers -- again, so, this is really a follow-on to carolina's question -- ""do you feel that the auto dealers are shifting to private-label parts and selling service plans, and how do you compete with them given they see the customer first when they buy a car?""
brett ponton -- president and chief executive officer
i'll start with the second part. look, the car dealer does have the advantage because they sell the car new to the consumer and they get the opportunity to service that vehicle with warranty follow-up, and as the value of that vehicle remains relatively high after purchase, the consumer's appetite to pay higher prices certainly is there. as we identified in the slide this morning, we think our value proposition becomes much more compelling to consumers as their car gets older, the value of the vehicle drops, and as a result of that, their willingness to pay higher prices to service that vehicle also drops. so, we believe monro is very well positioned with vehicles in that 6-to-12-year cohort. we feel very well positioned to win that going forward. as it relates to the private label parts, i can't comment specifically about what their strategy is around part sourcing.
