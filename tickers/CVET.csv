operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. and welcome to the covetrus 4q '19 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] after the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions]
please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions]
it is now my pleasure to introduce, vice president of investor relations, nicholas jansen.
nicholas jansen -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, andrew. good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for covetrus' q4 2019 earnings call. joining me on today's call are ben wolin, our president and chief executive officer; and stuart gleichenhaus, our interim chief financial officer. ben and stuart will begin with prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take your questions.
during this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. all statements other than statements of historical fact made during this conference call are forward-looking including statements regarding management's expectations for future financial and operational performance and operating expenditures, our plans to reduce our net debt and our business strategy, and timing and impact of transactions.
forward-looking statements may be identified with words such as will, may, expect, plan, anticipate, upcoming, believe, estimate or similar terminology and the negative of these terms. forward-looking statements are not promises or guarantees of future performance and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in these forward-looking statements. these risks and uncertainties include those under the heading risk factors in our most recent annual report on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q, and other periodic reports filed with the sec which are available on the investors section of our website at ir.covetrus.com and on the sec's website at www.sec.gov.
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements. during this presentation, we will also provide certain pro forma results for the three months and fiscal year ended december 2019 and 2018 to help investors understand the underlying trends in the business as if the merger of the animal health business of henry schein and vet's first choice closed on december 31, 2017.
note, however, the historical combined financial statements do not necessarily reflect what the results of operations would have been had we operated as a combined company as those results would depend on a number of factors including the chosen organizational structure, what functions were outsourced or performed by employees, allocations of certain corporate and shared expenses, and strategic decisions made in areas such as information technology and infrastructure.
you can find this afternoon's press release announcing our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results on this call on ir.covetrus.com. we will continue to use our site to distribute important and time-critical company information. the press release also contains further information about the non-gaap financial measures that we will discuss during this call.
these non-gaap financial measures exclude from our gaap financial results, certain non-cash or special items such as costs directly associated with the spin-off and merger and the ongoing integration process, including certain infrastructure investment expenses, separation program costs, executive severance, and goodwill impairment charges. we believe that in order to properly understand our short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of these items as a supplement to financial performance measures determined in accordance with gaap. please refer to this afternoon's press release announcing our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results for a reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to our gaap financial results.
and with that, i will now turn the call over to ben to provide the highlights.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, nick. and good afternoon everyone. it has now been a little more than four months since i assumed the role of acting ceo at covetrus. and as we announced today, i will now be taking on those responsibilities on a permanent basis. we have a lot to get through and i do not want to spend too much time on that, but i will say this. we have a solid organization and culture here that are only getting stronger, and i look forward to working with this team.
looking back at the last several months, we have taken a number of significant steps as a company. we focused the organization on core drivers of our business, supported and strengthened the platform and emphasized a culture that will deliver on the opportunity covetrus has in the animal health marketplace. i'll discuss those further in a few minutes but first, i want to take the opportunity to provide you with a better sense of what i've learned in this initial period, and how i see the company moving forward from here.
this time has revealed a lot about this company and its people. the most important lesson is that we have a talented, passionate and hard-working team that is focused on executing and delivering value to our customers, business partners, manufacturers and shareholders. it also highlighted the growing pains we have faced over the past year, as well as the challenges and hard work that still remain for us to deliver on the attractive opportunity presented by this market. it is clear to me that the team has a deep desire to succeed and possesses the ability to overcome those challenges.
the willingness of everyone to embrace this change has helped us focus the business and begin making the needed improvements that will allow us to successfully execute our plans moving forward. to achieve our goals, we will continue to emphasize the core themes that i shared with you on our last call, relentlessly focusing on the core drivers of our business, emphasizing innovation and execution and continuously building a culture of success. these are the foundation for both our strategy and new way of working, and i believe that by continuing to focus and execute while strengthening the platform we will build on the significant initial steps we have taken as an organization.
some of these action plans are already in process. over the last several months, we have enhanced our execution and increased accountability within the organization. this sharper focus was evident in our q4 results, which exceeded the high end of our guidance we established back in mid-november for both net sales and adjusted ebitda. and importantly, we improved the pace and our approach to integration, focused our investments on the core drivers of our business, and begin to eliminate activities, projects and initiatives that were not central to our core drivers. this was the key message delivered during our third quarter conference call and our q4 results reflect the early benefit of this approach.
we also implemented certain leadership changes in q4 and early 2020. this included combining our software and prescription management business units to drive tighter integration of our teams under one leader, georgia wraight, and to begin to deliver a unified product roadmap that will help enhance workflow for veterinary practices. mike ellis and david hinton, two of our most tenured animal health executives, also now have additional responsibilities to help execute our strategic plan in north america and our refocus global sourcing organization. additionally, we made a significant change in our finance team with stuart gleichenhaus stepping in as cfo on an interim basis to help us deliver against several critical short-term priorities. retaining and recruiting talent has and will continue to be a critical focus as it is paramount to building a shared culture of success.
additionally, we with the support of the third-party we brought in during q4 have identified meaningful opportunities to not only improve our organizational health but to also deliver enhancements to our commercial and sourcing strategies. we are optimistic around the possibilities and benefits that these initiatives could deliver later this year and beyond as we execute on these initiatives. we also made progress on our efforts to streamline our focus and divest non-core assets with the pending sale of scil animal health -- scil animal care for $125 million, and the announced joint venture in spain with distrivet, significantly enhancing our financial flexibility and reducing complexity in our tsa exit strategy for spain.
and while stuart will provide more details in his prepared remarks, i'm pleased to also report that we have successfully amended our credit facility late last week, delaying the step down of our net leverage covenant by one year until the second quarter of 2021. while we are confident that our 2020 outlook would have supported the terms in our previous credit agreement, the amendment as well as the anticipated scil animal care proceeds provides us with even greater flexibility to execute our strategy, as well as to continue to invest in the business for future growth.
something that has not changed through this effort is our commitment to our customers and innovations. we are focused on delivering better experiences and outcomes, which includes relentlessly advancing our customer successes. we are also intently focused on leveraging technology across all facets of our business to lower costs, improve service and deliver greater value back to our customers, manufacturers and partners, and we believe additional investment in support and product capability strengthens our ability to drive deeper engagement with our sizable customer base.
as we think about 2020, we will build on these steps. we will continue to streamline and focus on the core drivers of our business in order to improve effectiveness and efficiency and to seek to deliver more consistent and profitable performance, particularly in north america. reducing our cost to serve and better managing overhead are critical priorities as we look to deliver operational improvement and build momentum into the second half of the year. and our investments in global sourcing will lay the foundation for margin enhancement and reinvestment in the years ahead. we will also invest in our team and organizational and operational culture and to learn and better understand the needs of our customers and manufacturer partners in order to bring our collection of capabilities together in an integrated value proposition.
this foundational focus will make us smarter and stronger as a team and enable us to more effectively deliver on the global opportunity, moving forward. we are prioritizing and also making investments in our higher-margin proprietary products and solutions in 2020. this includes leveraging our customer access to provide more solutions for their compounding and specialty pharma service needs, which is an increase in customer and pet owner need that drives a fast-growing market where we are already an industry leader.
we also are making it easier for our customers and their clients to engage on our prescription management platform in 2020 and we are focused on driving even greater utilization as we more effectively leverage our manufacturer partners, our software integration and workflow, the e-commerce experience and our marketing capabilities to provide even greater value to all stakeholders.
we expect these initiatives will accelerate same-store sales beyond the 16% achieved on the platform in 2019 over time and based on investor feedback, we are committed to providing more disclosure on these efforts in other parts of the business beginning in q1.
in summary, our mission, our strategic priorities and our 2020 plans are now sharper and focused. while there is still much work to be done to fulfill the promise and value, the covetrus model can and will deliver. these past few months have demonstrated that the approach we are taking can yield positive results for all of our stakeholders. by continuing to enhance our culture and organization and relentlessly executing on our priorities, we will work collaboratively toward growth and success in 2020 and beyond.
i will now hand the call off to stuart to provide a detailed review of our q4 and full year 2019 results and our 2020 financial guidance.
stuart gleichenhaus -- interim chief financial officer
thanks, ben. and good afternoon to everyone. thank you all for joining us today. i will focus my comments for the fourth quarter and the full year 2019 on our non-gaap pro forma results when applicable, as these items provide the most insight into the underlying trends impacting our businesses. please refer to today's press release for a more detailed description of our q4 2019 and full-year gaap financial results.
covetrus net sales were just over $1.0 billion in q4 and approximately $4 billion for the full year 2019. non-gaap pro forma organic net sales increased 4% year-over-year in q4, and 3% year-over-year in 2019. as a reminder, non-gaap pro forma organic sales growth includes vets first choice in both periods, excludes the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations and m&a and normalizes for net sales adjustments for manufacturer switches from direct to agency sales in the us, which can impact our year-over-year comparisons.
these results include the impact from the previously announced customer loss in north america and the impact in apac, asia pacific that is, tied to a manufacturer moving to a direct sales model during the fourth quarter of 2018. normalizing for these two events, underlying pro forma organic net sales growth would have approached 7% in q4 and 5% for the full year of 2019.
moving to our operating segment net sales performance. north america pro forma organic net sales increased 2% year-over-year in both q4 and the full year 2019. the previously announced loss of a supply chain customer negatively impacted north america organic growth by 4% in q4 and 3% for the full year.
our supply chain pro forma organic net sales growth decreased modestly year-over-year in q4 or increased 2% when the previously announced customer loss is excluded. overall veterinary practice patient visit growth was modestly softer in q4 versus q3 in north america but in general, the market remains stable and growing. for all of 2019, our supply chain pro forma organic net sales growth in north america would have increased 2% when excluding the impact from this specific customer loss.
total vets first choice net sales increased 37% year-over-year to $74 million in q4 and 33% year-over-year to $270 million in 2019. we ended 2019 with more than 10,200 practices on our prescription management platform achieving our goal of ending the year with at least 10,000 practices. beyond new enrollments, we continue to have success in driving growth from our existing customer base and as ben mentioned, we delivered approximately 16% year-over-year same-store sales growth in 2019.
importantly, all of our cohorts, which date back to 2012, continued to grow double-digits year-over-year during 2019. turning to europe, pro forma organic net sales increased 7% year-over-year in q4 and 4% year-over-year for the full year 2019. our uk pro forma organic net sales, which is our largest european market increased 5% year-over-year in q4. our uk business continues to benefit from the expansion of our relationship with a large corporate group, which we announced on our q2 2018 call as well as continued solid execution by the team. we also experienced healthy pro forma organic net sales growth in most of our other european markets, including strong performances from our businesses operating in ireland, poland and the czech republic.
moving on to apac and the emerging markets, our team delivered an 8% year-over-year increase in pro forma organic net sales in q4 and 2% for the full year 2019. normalizing for the impact of a manufacturer that went to a direct sales model in this market in november 2018, the apac and emerging markets segment grew 12% year-over-year in q4 and 8% for the full year 2019, driven by continued growth in the number of customers served and strong performance in new zealand and brazil. overall, this team continues to execute well and deliver robust financial results.
before moving to the rest of the p&l, i wanted to share that our form 10-k, which will be filed soon will also provide details on our annual net sales for business lines by geography, including supply chain, software and prescription management, which we hope the investment community will find useful. we remain committed to delivering increased transparency on the core drivers of our business.
turning to the consolidated gross margin. our gaap gross margin was 18.7% in q4 versus 17.6% in the prior year period. in q4, we changed the classification of shipping expense at the legacy vets first choice business from selling, general and administrative expense to cost of goods sold to be consistent with the rest of our business. in q4 the classification represented approximately $7 million shift from selling, general and administrative expense to cost of goods sold expense, and for the first nine months of 2019 the classification represented a $16 million shift. there was no impact on adjusted ebitda.
on a pro forma basis which excludes the classification change and includes vets first choice for the prior year period, our gross margin would have been 19.4% in q4 2019 as compared to 19% in the prior year. for the full year 2019, the pro forma gross margin would have been 19.3% as compared to 19.4% in the prior year, as growth in our higher margin services, including our prescription management platform and proprietary products were offset by moderate margin pressure in supply chain.
our gaap selling, general and administrative expenses were $214 million during the fourth quarter of 2019, and $808 million during the full year 2019. this includes the impact of the separation and merger, certain special items, and the ramping of operating expenses tied to infrastructure investments and the cost of being a stand-alone public company.
non-gaap adjusted ebitda was $47 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 versus $52 million in the prior year period on a non-gaap pro forma basis. the 10% year-over-year decrease on a non-gaap pro forma basis was driven by an increase in the corporate selling, general, and administrative expenses, lower north american supply chain profitability, a $3 million headwind in europe tied to certain general and administrative benefits in the prior year results that did not recur in 2019, and a $1 million overall negative impact from changes in foreign exchange.
these headwinds offset the year-over-year improvement in vets first choice profitability, the modest contribution from 2019 acquisitions and underlying organic growth in apac and emerging markets during the fourth quarter of 2019. on a segment adjusted ebitda basis, north america and apac and emerging markets witnessed year-over-year growth while europe declined year-over-year as a result of foreign exchange and the g&a dynamics just described.
for the full year, non-gaap pro forma adjusted ebitda was $200 million in 2019 versus $219 million for the full year 2018. looking at the rest of the income statement, we had approximately $11 million in net interest expense in q4. our q4 gaap net loss was $37 million or a loss per share of $0.33 per diluted share, and $1 billion or a loss of $9.50 per diluted share for the full year 2019. non-gaap adjusted net income was $20 million during q4 versus $21 million on a pro forma basis in the prior year period. for the full year 2019, non-gaap pro forma adjusted net income was $82 million versus $94 million in the prior year impacted by the aforementioned decline in non-gaap pro forma adjusted ebitda in 2019.
turning to the balance sheet and cash flow metrics, covetrus generated $103 million in cash flow from operations during 2019, and $64 million in non-gaap free cash flow when subtracting net purchases of property and equipment of $39 million. we ended q4 2019 with $130 million in cash and cash equivalents, $1.2 billion in debt, and no borrowings against our $300 million revolving credit facility. our net leverage ratio as defined by our credit agreement stood at approximately 4.6 times for the trailing 12 months ended december 31, 2019, well inside the 5.5 times covenant.
and as ben mentioned earlier, late last week we entered into an amended agreement with our syndicate of lenders regarding the step down of our net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio covenant that was scheduled to go into effect for the quarter ended june 30, 2020. under the amended terms, we have pushed out the step down of our net leverage covenant for one full year with the drop to 5.0 times net debt to bank defined adjusted ebitda, now beginning with the quarter ended june 30, 2021. additional details of this amendment will be included in our annual form 10-k that we plan to file today.
also subsequent to quarter end, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our scil animal healthcare business to heska for $125 million. the transaction is expected to close on or about april 1, and we plan to use $60 million of the net proceeds to pay down debt including the payment of our debt on march 31, and including the prepayment of the remaining quarters of the year q2 to q4, quarterly under the credit agreement for mandatory required principal amortization payments. the balance of the cash will be used for general corporate purposes including reinvesting back into the business.
turning to our 2020 guidance, which assumes a second quarter close for both the scil animal healthcare divestiture and the joint venture with distrivet sa, and no significant supply chain disruption or economic impact related to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 or covid-19, we forecast that our 2020 net sales of $4.025 billion to $4.125 billion. so repeating that again, $4.025 billion to $4.125 billion forecast 2020 net sales. embedded in this outlook is non-gaap pro forma organic net sales growth of 3% to 5% current foreign exchange rates and the impact from our m&a activity in 2019, and the previously announced 2020 transactions.
our outlook incorporates modest expectations for our north american supply chain business, continued strong performance in our prescription management platform, and healthy underlying organic trends outside the us.
turning to adjusted ebitda. we are forecasting 2020 non-gaap adjusted ebitda in the range of $190 million $195 million, so $190 million to $195 million. in 2019, our non-gaap pro forma adjusted ebitda excluding the scil animal care business was approximately $193 million. the midpoint of our 2020 adjusted ebitda guidance reflects relatively flattish year-over-year growth over the pro forma 2019 results when excluding the scil animal care business.
before going into the details, i just wanted to reiterate our commitment to delivering against the expectations we set forth to the investment community as we seek to continue to build investor confidence after a more challenging start out of the gate. underlying growth at the segment level for all our geographies in 2020 is offset by the timing impact from corporate overhead investments in 2019 associated with running a stand-alone business which did not begin to ramp until late q2 2019.
while we do not provide specific quarterly guidance, we would point out that the first quarter, q1, represents our most difficult year-over-year comparisons given the timing of overhead investments last year. and as a result, you should keep q1 2020 adjusted ebitda to approximately 20% of our full-year outlook. keep this in mind that our q1 corporate overhead adjusted operating expenses in 2019 were approximately $3 million as compared to the average of $12 million per quarter over the balance of the year and continuing into this year. this dynamic creates an approximate $10 million headwind when compared to q1 2020 results with a comparable year-over-year period.
we expect to drive better operating leverage from our corporate adjusted operating expenses as we progress through the balance of the year. lastly, and as more disclosed in our form 10-k that will be filed shortly, management has identified a new material weakness related to taxes caused by issues associated with the transition to establishing expanded in-house capabilities. these issues impacted the implementation of the tax controls to review and analyze the company's income tax provision and deferred income tax balances, remediation plans for this issue as well as the information technology, general controls identified last quarter are under way and further disclosed in our annual report for 2019.
now, i'll turn this back over to ben for some brief closing remarks.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, stuart. before opening the call for questions, i want to reiterate my excitement for the opportunity that we have ahead and these last four months have only solidified my thinking that we can build a formidable company in a large and growing end market. we've demonstrated as a company in q4 that we are making progress and that we are on the right path forward. q4 also showed that we are still in the early stages of that process and that much hard work remains to be done as we seek to fulfill the promise of this company. i'm energized by the team we have in place, and i'm looking forward to charting the path -- this path and delivering on the commitments we have set forth for all of our stakeholders in 2020 and beyond.
this concludes our prepared remarks and now i will turn the call back over to nick to moderate the q&a session.
nicholas jansen -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, ben. we want to take as many questions as possible, so we ask that you limit them to two and then reenter the queue should you have additional ones. so andrew, please provide instructions for the q&a session. and we are then ready to take the first question.
",":
operator
certainly. [operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of john kreger with william blair.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
hi, thanks very much, ben and stuart, i think you guys said that guidance does not reflect any coronavirus impact. can you just expand on what you're actually seeing as you've watched q1 rollout? have you seen any impact, particularly in asia, but also in the us and europe. thanks.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
sure thing. john, good afternoon. so yes, current guidance does not reflect any impact from coronavirus. to-date the impact has been minimal but as you know it's a very fluid situation that's changing day by day. and we are managing or monitoring the situation closely. i think that we're first and foremost focused on the safety of our employees and our customers and our suppliers and so we are being prudent in how we manage the business going forward but to date so far no material impact.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
great, that's helpful. thank you. and then my second question is, can you give us a sense about where you think you stand with the us distribution operationally, it seems like that was where you have the key issues in '19, what more do you need to do there to get that business sort of back on its full footing? thanks.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
thanks. yeah. so yes, the north american distribution business is one of the key areas that we had challenges with in 2019. i think as i pointed out in the prepared remarks, we've made some leadership changes on that front. and we had a decent quarter in q4 that i would say was in line with our competitors and how the overall market prepared. in order to accelerate that business, we need to continue to focus on executing and delivering against the core value proposition of driving market share for our suppliers and providing exit and reduce cost to serve back to our customers. so early days, and as our guidance reflects, i would say we have modest expectations for that business, but also a business that we're expecting to have more stability out of in 2020.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of nathan rich with goldman sachs.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great, thanks for the question. ben maybe starting with the vets first platform, i think you mentioned kind of potential to accelerate same-store growth on that platform. it seems like you've also continued to see to add new practices of the platform. so i'd just be curious kind of as we think about into 2020 and beyond, kind of what you see as the key opportunities for that business and if you have any comment on profitability. it sounds like we might get more disclosure starting in q1, but could you help us think about how the profitability of that business has trended in 2019?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
sure thing. so, nathan in terms of 2020 in our areas of focus, we're very much focused on what we internally called engagement, which is getting active customers to continue to utilize or expand the use of the platform. while we've made nice progress at 16% year-over-year same-store sales growth, we certainly believe that we can achieve more than that when we shift the majority of our attention to engaging our existing customers. that, of course, doesn't mean that we're not going to have new customers enroll and we would expect total net enrollments to increase on a year-over-year basis, but the majority of the organization's focus is really on utilization of the platform.
and we believe frankly that better utilization on the platform of existing customers will only make enrollment of new customers easier and more cost-efficient going forward. in terms of your second question around profitability, i'd say in 2019 we were profitable, but it was de minimis in the big scheme of things, given the overall ebitda of the business. but there is clearly a focus of our business of improving or proving out that incremental revenue can flow through to ebitda in 2020.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great, thanks. if i could just ask a quick follow-up on margins, it seems like the guidance for 2020 assumes margins roughly flat to kind of where they ended 2019. so i'd just be curious kind of, you talked about opportunities to kind of streamline operations. i noticed you didn't mention cost synergies specifically, but could you maybe just talk through opportunities you see on the cost side and maybe balance with any investments you need to make on the business and any form factors we should keep in mind as we think about the margin outlook for 2020? thank you.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so a couple of thoughts on margins. yes, you're right, we're expecting margins to remain largely consistent from 2019 to 2020. there is a couple of different components when you think about the overall blended margin, so increasing prescription management of the former vets first choice platform is a margin improvement for the business, which is offset by potential margin compression in other areas of the business, largely driven by customer or manufacturer consolidation. i think, however, what we are focused on from an operational standpoint is getting more efficient either from how we organize ourselves or how we source product from our suppliers to offset some of those margin headwinds that could occur in 2020.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of erin wright with credit suisse.
erin wright -- credit suisse -- analyst
great, thanks. has there been any changes in your vendor relationships that are built into expectations for 2020? any sort of agency or buy-sell relationships that have changed? and then can you quantify also the opportunity associated with along recent rationalization, their distributor relationships and how maybe the transaction could also benefit you as well or any other vendor relationship dynamics that you can speak to? thanks.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yes. hi, erin. nice to hear from you. no significant changes with our suppliers in terms of how we do business with them. in terms of specifically elanco's consolidation of their distributors, obviously, we are pleased to continue to expand how we do business with them. however, it's not a huge number of distributors nor a huge piece of the business. so marginal pick up but always good to like i said, expand our business with one of our key suppliers.
erin wright -- credit suisse -- analyst
at this point, what is your guidance assume in terms of the north american market growth and demand trends? do you anticipate stabilization over the course of 2020 and how are you thinking also about the competitive landscape at this juncture, particularly as it relates to the alternative channels? thanks.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
we are looking for stability in 2020 and growth pretty much in line with what we experienced in the back half of 2019. in terms of alternative channels or just even competition within the distribution market, we feel well-positioned and believe we have a unique set of assets. obviously, we need to execute and get the benefit of the combined asset to really differentiate our business over time. but we are looking forward to a year in which execution starts to show up in the numbers and we can report out on that success in future quarters to come.
erin wright -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay, great. thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of jon block with stifel.
jon block -- stifel nicolaus and company, inc. -- analyst
hey guys, good afternoon. the more simple one first maybe. ben, just the timing of the vfc rollout in international markets, is that something that we might see in late 2020 or you all about sort of engagement and that might wait until 2021?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
hey, jon, we are very focused on engagement on the vets first choice platform as well as making sure that we're operating with excellence across all of our business so one of the areas that we slowed down on was rollout of the platform. and i would not anticipate any launch in 2020 although i would expect to see capital spend against i would call laying the foundation for that opportunity in the future.
jon block -- stifel nicolaus and company, inc. -- analyst
okay, great, very helpful. and then the increased transparency is great but i think even in the past you did give a lot about value capture in details there. but you also talked about simplifying the organization and targets with wall street. so i'm just curious, are you going to break those out anymore going forward? and then part two to that same question is with the flattish 2020 margins, but i'm guessing some synergy capture, does it imply compression for the underlying business? and maybe you can just expand upon that. thanks, guys.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
sure thing. so as i said either in prepared remarks or in individual meetings, we find the value capture metric a bit arbitrary because it forces you to try to allocate savings to one activity versus the other and you spend a lot of time trying to come up with whether your underlying business or some new activity. and so what we decided is we're going to not give a value capture number but instead just focus on the overall company ebitda and our progress against delivering against that ebitda target.
that doesn't mean that there aren't synergy opportunities and that we aren't very focused on finding those opportunities, whether it be on the sourcing side of the business where we see a lot of progress, especially if vets first choice continues to expand and take advantage of the north america buying power, i should say, and certainly other areas of focus. in terms of the outlook and the implied compression gross margins, we expect to remain relatively consistent from 2019 to 2020. the big delta from an ebitda margin would be the corporate overhead -- overhang especially when you're looking at a year-over-year basis from q1 to q1.
so stuart mentioned in his prepared remarks that corporate overhead expense is almost $10 million greater in q1 2020 versus q1 of 2019 and that's not reflective of the increase in spend from the back half of 2019 to 2020. it really is consistent with that trend, but for a variety of reasons on a pro forma basis, the q1 corporate overhead number was greatly reduced and under representative of what was actually required on a go-forward basis.
jon block -- stifel nicolaus and company, inc. -- analyst
great. thanks, guys.

thank you. and our next question comes from the line of david westenberg with guggenheim.
david westenberg -- guggenheim -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my question. so just on the guidance. i appreciate you don't give quarterly revenue guidance, but as i'm looking at last year. i am looking at kind of the first half, q1, q2. it looks like there was negative growth there versus the back half of the year. so the temptation in terms of modeling is to go with where the easiest revenue comps are. so maybe if you can give us a little bit of color on how we should think about cadence. i'm not looking for anything quarterly here. i'm just thinking about how we should be modeling the way -- the cadence in 2020. thank you.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
i think if you take a step back and look at the different component parts of the business, which i think is maybe a more useful way of thinking about our growth. in the us, we're very much looking at stability on an annualized basis. certainly, on any individual period you could see some volatility, but we're expecting a stable revenue base. in europe and apac, i think we will continue to see growth coming from those businesses in line with the growth that we saw last year and feel good about the early progress in 2020.
and then vets first choice, we're expecting to see growth continuing in line with what we experienced last year. and as stuart mentioned in the prepared remarks what was especially nice to see was in q4 a growth rate of 37% which was higher than the annual growth rate of 33%. so we saw an acceleration on a larger revenue base, which a lot of companies can't do, especially when they hit scale. so that's how we think you should be thinking about the different revenue growth rates for the various businesses.
david westenberg -- guggenheim -- analyst
thanks. just a little continuation of erin's question around corporate. and i appreciate there is no specific corporate or new accounts to call out for 2020 but can you maybe talk about if there has been a change in terms of corporate strategy? and then this doesn't necessarily mean, refer to corporate strategy but can you talk about how things are going in terms of integration of legacy vets first choice with legacy henry schein? is that helping leverage with corporate groups and just customers in general? thank you.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so following up to erin's question and your question, we've seen stability on the supplier side and stability on the customer side, especially with corporate. so no major changes there as well. i think that we have ways to go, to be honest, on both getting the value of a combined asset as it relates to our customers as well as deeply aligning with our customers or integrating with our customers in a way that is really unlocking new potential. so right now, i would characterize our business is where we have gotten some of the benefit of being together, but largely, we are still transacting along the way that we did when they were separate entities.
and that is my expectation for a lot of 2020 that that will still remain the same as we continue to focus on driving the individual value and really kind of accelerating into 2021 starting to synchronize those businesses as we figure out the exact right commercial strategy and how we partner with our customers to unlock value for both of us.
david westenberg -- guggenheim -- analyst
thank you for taking the question. i'll ask the rest offline.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of andrew cooper with raymond james.
andrew cooper -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks, guys. a lot has been asked already so i'll be quick. but i guess when we think about shifting the focus of vets first choice and going more toward reaping the benefits of the new accounts you've already added, how do we think about sort of what you're changing from a sales incentive perspective and how you take what was a really successful group of kind of hunters and turn them into farmers and how do you change those incentives? any help there would be great.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
happy to shed some light on that, andrew. i think it's pretty simple, we're shifting the incentive structure to focus on engagement versus just new enrollments. as you know, new enrollment is great but in a sense, it's a free trial or it's really just the top of the funnel and until someone engages on the platform, you don't really drive any revenue both for your customer as well as for yourself. so a lot of the sales force and marketing team, it's taking the activity that they've learned through the years in terms of driving engagement by really making it the primary focus of the business and partnering with our customers in a deep way to drive volume for that business.
and i think one of the nice things if you look at our 10,000 plus customers, they obviously don't all perform the same. we have like a lot of businesses, a group of customers that are driving outsized proportion of revenue and it's those successes that we're modeling a lot of the engagement activity that we're focused on. so if we can get the bottom half of that 10,000 customers to look a lot more like the top half we're going to not only really ramp the revenue for the business but also help drive the profitability of our business in a pretty significant way.
andrew cooper -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then lastly, when we think about, i think it was good to see the scil divestiture and will be good to see that closed, but as we think about sort of the asset base right now and taking that kind of step back and thinking about what needs to be there and what doesn't, is there anything else that comes out to mind and what should we be expecting from a timing perspective if there is anything? and then in terms of use of proceeds how to think about debt pay down pacing from that perspective?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah so i'll answer the first part of that question, and hand the second over to stuart to address the use of proceeds. but so in terms of the asset base, nothing imminent to announce. we're obviously always focused on driving the right return for our shareholders but with the sale as well as the covenant amendment, we feel very comfortable where we are at and feel like we have the room to operate the business in the way that we want.
over time we definitely want to decrease the net leverage ratio but for 2020 and 2021, we feel like we're in good shape and we'll continue to look opportunistically at opportunities to improve the balance sheet. i'll let stuart really answer the question about use of proceeds and how we think about that going forward.
stuart gleichenhaus -- interim chief financial officer
sure. with the scil transaction was a good example. we had $125 million gross proceeds on that after transaction fees, taxes and so on. it's less than that and we've chosen to an agreement with the banks to apply $60 million of that toward the reduction of the term debt. and in fact, we have prepaid or will pay early the remaining principal payments for the rest of the year, march 31, june 30, september, december of $15 million each against that. so it was a good use of proceeds for us in the short term. also gave an immediate deleveraging effect for the lenders as well as the shareholders to see that.
and so that was a good example of what we chose to do in this particular transaction. as ben mentioned there's not any other particular transaction right behind that. so there's really nothing to talk about or discuss about that, but we did think for all constituencies, it made sense to use some of the proceeds from scil to deleverage where we sat today.
andrew cooper -- raymond james -- analyst
great. i appreciate it. thanks, guys.
stuart gleichenhaus -- interim chief financial officer
yeah.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of erin wright with credit suisse.
erin wright -- credit suisse -- analyst
great, thanks. i'm curious how successful you've been in converting agency sales to the vfc platform that presumably was a considerable component of the original vfc synergy opportunity. is that something that's gaining any traction now or is that something that's more of a longer-term opportunity just given some of the differences in economics there for an agency sale across legacy schein versus vfc? thanks.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
no, i would say that there hasn't been tremendous traction there nor would i expect huge opportunity there going forward.
erin wright -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay, thanks. and then also, do you see a meaningful indirect i guess benefit from mat pricing that was implemented across some of the alternative channels from competitors? how much is that influencing your profitability in the latest quarter, for instance, and how should we be thinking about that sort of dynamic as we head into -- i guess as we lap that mat pricing implementation midway through this year? thanks.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i would say it's hard to quantify the impact of mat pricing on the business, but we certainly believe that it is beneficial to have more price parity between us and the other channels out there. in some cases, the platform is still priced higher on an individual product-by-product basis, but the price differential is much smaller even in those cases and so we don't believe that there is a large enough price delta to actually drive the consumer from one channel to the other. so i couldn't specifically say that mat pricing drove any increase in profitability on the platform in the near term, but i also would say that it's certainly a net positive for the business and we expect it to continue to be so going forward.
erin wright -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay, great. thank you.

benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, nick, and good afternoon, everyone.
we know this is still a very challenging time for everyone listening in, and we hope you are all safe and managing through covid-19 as well as possible. to start, i'd like to say that i'm thankful to all the veterinarians and animal health professionals across the globe who continue to push forward and operate as an essential service. their passion for the well-being of animals and their clients is inspiring and motivates our entire team as we seek to provide even greater value and service to enable our customers to continue to thrive and grow. i'm also very proud to see our team rise to the challenge as i have witnessed and heard of numerous stories from around the globe as to how our employees are going above and beyond normal expectations to help. it is very heartening to see our company in action and keeps me energetic and optimistic about the future.
now turning to the state of covetrus. i would like to review three main topics on today's call. first, our overall health as an organization, second, our commitment to our strategy and how we are executing against the core drivers of our business, even amid the disruptions presented by covid-19, and third, how we have prepared and continued to adapt for near-term uncertainty while positioning our company for sustainable growth through the eventual recovery. as nick said at the opening of the call, we have included a presentation to accompany our prepared remarks, and i will be referencing some of those slides in the next couple of minutes.
so starting with slide 3. first and foremost, our top priority is the health and safety of our employees. throughout the pandemic, our leadership teams have done an excellent job supporting safety measures within our facilities. we have enforced social distancing and increased hygiene and protective measures, and we were able to pre-emptively reduce our on-site staff by enabling extensive work-from-home solutions for over 60% of our employees around the globe. we have augmented our existing protocols as necessary to meet covid-19 specifics in accordance with local government and health organizations, including illness reporting and case management.
beyond the physical safety measures taken, we are focused on the support of our employees' overall well-being. from providing online training modules to continuing access to employee assistance programs, we are encouraging professional growth opportunities and team connectivity during these uncertain times. as parts of the world begin to reopen, our planning efforts will anticipate a slow and gradual return of employees to our offices. we will be deliberate in our planning, and we'll maintain our focus on keeping our team and our customers' businesses as healthy as possible. and to do so, our phased return-to-work approach may, in some cases, be more conservative than local regional restrictions.
while covid-19 has created a new set of challenges for our company and the animal health community at large, our focused approach, which is detailed on slide 4 of the accompanying presentation, involves executing against the core drivers of our business, emphasizing our commitment to our customers and to innovation and continuously building a culture of success. these are the foundation for both our strategy and new way of working. and our actions and strong q1 results, including 10% year-over-year pro forma organic net sales growth and $48 million in adjusted ebitda, both of which exceeded external expectations, reflect the early momentum we have achieved in these efforts.
turning to slide 5. to achieve our strategy, we outlined four priorities earlier this year. one, maximizing effectiveness and efficiency. two, driving proprietary products and solutions. three, expanding capabilities and developing sourcing excellence. and four, creating a high-performing customer-centric culture. and while we are still early in this process, we have taken a number of significant steps as an organization over the last quarter as we execute against our strategic plan. for example, we made progress on our commitment to improve effectiveness and efficiency and delivering more consistent and profitable performance in our north american distribution business.
in q1, our distribution business generated 4% pro forma organic net sales growth when excluding the loss of a customer in early 2019 and modestly increased its contribution to adjusted ebitda as compared to the prior year. and by entering into multi-year renewals with several of our largest customers and winning new corporate accounts in the second half of 2019 and thus far in 2020, we believe our market position is in a much healthier place as compared to this time last year.
another highlight i would point out is accelerating same-store sales delivered by our prescription management business, as seen on slide 6. as a reminder, we made the strategic decision late last year to pivot from an enrollment-focused organization toward customer and client engagement as we seek to drive even greater utilization on our platform. while covid-19 provided an incremental tailwind to our internal efforts in late march, the 25% same-store year-over-year net sales growth and stronger performance out of our 2019 cohort as compared to prior ones are a testament to the initiatives we launched this year across our entire organization. these efforts include, better leveraging our manufacturing partners, improving our software integration and workflow, upgrading the e-commerce experience, and enhancing our marketing capabilities. importantly, the prescription management business continues to successfully scale their operations with profitability improving both year-over-year and sequentially compared to q4 2019.
with the support of the external third-party advisor we brought in during q4 2019, we have also started to successfully execute against the initiatives identified earlier this year that could deliver significant savings from improved direct and indirect sourcing and overall g&a expenses. as we further centralize and coordinate purchasing activity and leverage our global scale, we expect to improve our operating efficiency significantly. we also continue to prioritize service and innovation as we believe additional investment in support and product capabilities, particularly in times like today, strengthen our ability to drive deeper engagement with our sizable customer base.
for example, to help veterinarians respond and deliver continued care during the covid-19 pandemic, we created specific resources for use by veterinary practices, including launching a series of webinars featuring industry thought leaders, practice managers, and owners discussing strategies and real-world tactics. in april 2020, we also began embedding secure video teleconferencing capabilities across our global suite of practice, information management systems, client communications and prescription management solutions. this new functionality provides a seamless and easily accessible way for veterinarians to service their clients and patients remotely by practicing telemedicine using their existing covetrus technology solutions. and we are proud that within the first weeks of the launch that we were able to facilitate more than 1,250 telemedicine visits between our customers and their clients.
lastly, retaining and recruiting talent has and will continue to be a critical focus of ours as it is paramount to building a shared culture of success. and i am pleased to announce several developments on this front. in a separate release issued this afternoon, we announced the hiring of matthew foulston as global chief financial officer, steve palmucci as global chief information officer, and matthew malenfant as president of our north american distribution business. we are thrilled to appoint these high-quality individuals to critical roles within our organization, each of whom bring impressive experience of working in and through periods of transformation. it is a testament to our continued momentum and employer brand that we now have a very talented and industrious group of leaders in place, and i'm confident their addition to our team will continue to charter a positive path forward for covetrus.
now let me address covid-19's financial impact on covetrus and how we are preparing for near-term uncertainty and eventual recovery as well as future growth. to start, our commitment to serving our customers and their clients has never wavered, and our approach remains centered on delivering better experiences and outcomes for these customers. we believe this philosophy has served us well, and we took necessary action to control costs within the business as net sales softened during the last few weeks of march and into april as outlined last month in our q1 pre-release, while still investing in our team's capabilities and innovation to maintain the momentum of executing against our strategic plan.
we believe our ability to successfully invest in, serve and support animal health professionals during these uncertain times positions us well as we look toward a global recovery in the weeks and months ahead. and we believe some of the emerging market trends tied to the pandemic, including veterinarians embracing technology to stay connected to pet owners, are central to our core strategy and could facilitate new business growth with our customers and drive opportunity for our manufacturer partners. as we consider the near-term financial impact on our business, net sales from our global distribution and supply chain services businesses experienced a negative impact from declining wellness-related visits at veterinary practices, and to a lesser extent, softer clinical activity.
as seen on slide 7 of the accompanying presentation, a data set from approximately 6,500 of us veterinary practices that leverage our prescription management platform indicate that clinic traffic was down 20% to 25% in late march through mid-april, with trends over the last few weeks showing signs of an ongoing recovery. patient visits, for example, declined a little more than 10% during the week ending may 1.
similarly, as seen on slide 8, the trend line for our business has also improved week-to-week since the trough experienced in early to mid-april, with an 8% year-over-year decline in our global supply chain organic net sales during the week ending may 1 as compared to the 17% year-over-year decline during the week ending april 10. importantly, our supply chain organic net sales during the week ending may 1 in north america declined only 8% year-over-year and apac & emerging markets actually increased 5% year-over-year as these end markets have either recovered at a faster pace or were impacted less than the rest of the world, respectively.
additionally, our legacy vets first choice business continues to track ahead of our expectations with organic net sales increasing in excess of 55% year-over-year during april, a continuation of the momentum seen in q1. this is despite the deterioration in veterinary practice client visit trends during the month that impacted certain office use products in our specialty business. the covetrus platform, which represents more than 80% of prescription management net sales, grew a fantastic 70% year-over-year in april, including same-store sales year-over-year growth of 31%. this strong growth continues to be driven by increased practice engagement as well as from pet owners that have historically not purchased through their veterinary practices online pharmacy service powered by covetrus.
we expect these pet owners new to our online pharmacy service to behave similarly as compared to our existing pet owner clients. it has also been encouraging to see increased manufacturer engagement and support recently, which has allowed the veterinarians in partnership with us to be very competitively priced versus traditional e-commerce.
overall total covetrus april non-gaap organic net sales declined only 8% year-over-year, and we believe the result would have been stronger if not for the inventory stocking activity that incurred in march in many of our international markets, which pulled forward more than $30 million in net sales into q1 as previously reported. for additional perspective, year-to-date non-gaap forma organic net sales growth through april was positive 5%. and while near-term trends are likely to still face a headwind in connection with covid-19, the stronger relative performance of the global animal health category as compared to other healthcare markets highlights the attractive nature of the businesses in which we operate, our strategic positioning within the markets in which we compete and our very compelling portfolio of value-added capabilities. additionally, it speaks to the resiliency of the strengthening human companion animal bond, which connection provides the foundation for growth in our categories in the years ahead.
longer term, we remain enthusiastic about the prospects of the global animal health market and the recent balance sheet actions as described on slide 9 that we have taken since april 1, which we expect will collectively reduce net debt by approximately $340 million as compared to 31 march levels and provide additional liquidity in the short term, position us well to execute against our strategy while navigating the pandemic.
our team is focused. our priorities are clear. our ongoing investment in people and innovation differentiates us. and importantly, our balance sheet is now stronger. we are confident in our strategy and path forward and are well positioned to capitalize on the market recovery and to accelerate our long-term opportunity.
lastly, before i turn the call over to stuart, i would first like to thank him for his significant contributions to covetrus over the last five months as interim cfo. he has played an integral role in stabilizing our core operations and improving our balance sheet. so on behalf of all of us at covetrus, thank you very much. we're so glad that you joined us.
on that note, stuart, can you please provide a financial review of our q1 results?
stuart gleichenhaus -- interim chief financial officer
yes. good afternoon, everyone, and thanks, ben, for those kind words.
we have accomplished a lot over the last five months, and covetrus will certainly be in great hands with the hiring of matthew foulston as the company's global cfo.
with that, i will now review our q1 results. the focus of my comments will be on our non-gaap and non-gaap pro forma results when applicable as these items provide the most insight into the underlying trends impacting our businesses. please refer to today's press release for a more detailed description of our q1 gaap results. covetrus net sales were approximately $1.07 billion in q1. non-gaap pro forma organic net sales increased 10% year-over-year in q1. as indicated when we previewed our q1 results last month, january and february net sales reflected the positive momentum the business had entered -- had entering 2020.
march net sales benefited from accelerating prescription management growth and certain stocking activity in several geographies in connection with the covid-19 pandemic, which helped offset a portion of the net sales impact from reduced purchases over the last two weeks of march when many of our customers began to experience declining client visits tied to certain global measures to slow the spread of covid-19. we estimate that q1 non-gaap pro forma organic net sales benefited by approximately 4% from customer inventory stockpiling activity that occurred in the several international markets during march in connection with covid-19.
moving to our operating segment net sales performance. north america pro forma organic net sales increased 6% year-over-year in q1. our distribution business pro forma organic net sales growth increased 1% year-over-year in q1 or 4% when the previously announced customer loss from early 2019 is excluded. notwithstanding the impact of covid-19 on the market, we believe our quarterly results demonstrated stability in the underlying business dynamics, particularly now that we have lapped last year's loss of a large customer entering q2 of 2020 and have also recently entered into multi-year renewals with several of our largest customers.
total covetrus prescription management or legacy vets first choice pro forma organic net sales increased 47% year-over-year to $84 million in q1, and we ended the quarter with more than 10,500 practices on our prescription management platform. prescription management net sales were off to a strong start to the year following the launch of new customer and client engagement strategies late last year and the business further accelerated in march due in part to covid-19. in the aggregate, same-store prescription management platform net sales, defined as customers enrolled on the platform in 2018 or earlier, increased by more than 25% year-over-year during q1.
turning to europe. pro forma organic net sales increased 13% year-over-year in q1, of which management believes approximately 7% is due to customer stocking activity in connection with covid-19. excluding the estimated inventory-related stocking activity in response to covid-19, our european team executed extremely well during the quarter despite the pandemic and delivered healthy pro forma organic net sales growth in most of our european markets, including strong performance from our businesses operating in ireland, the czech republic and poland. the uk, the company's largest market by net sales, also delivered double-digit year-over-year net sales growth during the first quarter.
moving on to apac & emerging markets. our team delivered a 20% year-over-year increase in pro forma organic net sales in q1, including an estimated benefit of approximately 8% from customer stocking activity in connection with covid-19. overall, the momentum of the business segment had -- overall, the momentum the business segment had exiting 2019 continued into the first quarter of 2020, and this team continues to execute well and deliver robust financial results. total company non-gaap adjusted ebitda was $48 million for the first quarter of 2020 versus $50 million in the prior-year period as calculated on a non-gaap pro forma basis. the 4% year-over-year decrease was driven by higher corporate selling, general and administrative expenses tied to establishing covetrus as an independent global public company and a $1 million overall negative impact from changes in foreign exchange.
as a reminder, q1 2019 included only a partial quarter of corporate overhead, whereas q1 2020 was burdened by the near full-year run rate of stand-alone expenses. this approximated a $14 million headwind year-over-year and was generally consistent with our commentary discussed on the q4 earnings conference call back in early march. these added overhead costs offset the significant year-over-year improvement in vets first choice profitability, underlying organic growth in our supply chain businesses across many geographies and the modest contribution from 2019 acquisitions. additionally, management estimates that the customer inventory stocking activity in march in many of the company's international markets added approximately $3 million to $4 million in non-gaap adjusted ebitda in the first quarter of 2020.
looking at our segments. segment adjusted ebitda increased 17% year-over-year in north america, driven by the improving contribution of the company's prescription management business as well as modest growth in our supply chain business. in fact, our prescription management business in q1 delivered more adjusted ebitda than all of 2019 combined as we continue to increase the scale of our operations and leverage strong net sales growth. segment adjusted ebitda increased 13% year-over-year in europe and 40% year-over-year in apac & emerging markets, driven by operating leverage from strong net sales activity, including the customer inventory stocking benefit in connection with covid-19. our total company q1 gaap net loss was $33 million or negative $0.30 per diluted share. non-gaap adjusted net income was $20 million during q1 versus $19 million on a pro forma basis in the prior-year period.
turning to the balance sheet and cash flow metrics. covetrus used $76 million in cash flow from operations during q1 and had negative $87 million in non-gaap free cash flow when subtracting net purchases of property and equipment of $11 million. the timing of certain year-end payables and growth in accounts receivable from the strong march sales performance drove the increased use of cash in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the prior year. as a reminder, the company historically experiences a use of cash in the first quarter, and then we drive cash flow improvements through the balance of the year. note that our cash balance was also impacted during the quarter by deferred m&a payments related to transactions that closed in 2019 and fees paid for the credit agreement amendment executed in late february of this year.
we ended q1 with $1.185 billion in term loan debt outstanding and $190 million borrowed against our $300 million revolving credit facility, much of it at the end of march when covid-19 was declared a pandemic, which improved our liquidity position as we ended the quarter with $205 million in cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. our net leverage ratio, as defined by our credit agreement, stood at approximately 4.8 times for the trailing 12 months ended march 31, 2020, well inside the 5.5 times covenant maximum threshold.
immediately following quarter end, covetrus announced the closing of its divestiture of scil animal healthcare to heska corporation for $110 million, or approximately $100 million net of deal-related fees and other transaction items and before any tax on that transaction. the company used $45 million of those proceeds to prepay the remaining quarterly term loan principal amortization payments for 2020. adjusting for these actions, the company would have had at quarter end march 31, 2020, approximately $260 million in pro forma cash and equivalents, $1.14 billion in term loan debt and $190 million outstanding on the company's revolving credit facility. our leverage ratio, as defined by the company's credit agreement, would have also modestly improved pro forma for the scil proceeds and subsequent debt reduction.
additionally, on april 30, 2020, covetrus announced a $250 million investment from cd&r, from which we expect to receive the proceeds on or around may 19, 2020, next week. the net proceeds from the perpetual convertible preferred equity issuance to cd&r will be used to repay a portion of the company's revolving borrowings, provide additional short-term liquidity and support general corporate purposes. the additional capital from the sale of the scil animal care and perpetual convertible preferred equity issuance meaningfully strengthens our financial profile by reducing net debt by approximately $340 million as compared to 31 march reported levels, allowing us to continue executing against our strategic growth objectives while simultaneously navigating the near-term uncertainties tied to the covid-19 pandemic.
the structure of the investment and our improved financial profile also better positions us for additional conversations with our lending syndicate about obtaining further operating flexibility under our current credit agreement. we may have more to comment on this in coming weeks.
lastly, as indicated in our april 22 press release that provided a preview of our q1 financial results, we withdrew our full-year 2020 financial guidance as a result of the uncertain demand outlook for our veterinary practice customers caused by covid-19. while complete and accurate visibility into the trajectory of the future recovery of our end market remains relatively uncertain, we have been encouraged by the sequential improvement in our net sales growth over the last couple of weeks following the slowdown seen in late march and early april. as ben mentioned, despite the inventory stocking benefit seen in march that pulled forward sales from april and the additional covid-19-related headwinds, covetrus non-gaap organic net sales declined only 8% year-over-year during the month of april and non-gaap organic net sales declined only 4% for the week ending may 1.
and as we think about profitability over the near term, we've taken certain measures to help better align our cost structure with sales performance, including executive board and other senior level employee compensation reductions, employee furloughs in certain european countries, several shift eliminations in different localities, a global hiring freeze and discretionary spending deferrals. additionally, we've made progress on some of our direct and indirect procurement initiatives that we've rolled out in partnership with an external third-party advisor to drive greater efficiency through our organization. these actions should partially offset some of the lost gross profit from lower net sales tied to the impact of covid-19 and the potential negative $5 million impact to adjusted ebitda year-over-year from foreign exchange volatility if rates remain at current levels.
we'll continue to monitor this evolving situation on a week-by-week basis and will take additional action as necessary to balance the short-term uncertainties with our desire to continue investing in our team and global capabilities needed to execute our strategy and accelerate our sales and profit trajectory alongside the recovery.
i'll now turn the call back over to ben for some brief closing remarks. ben?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, stuart.
before my closing remarks, i want to take a moment to thank david shaw, who retired from our board earlier this week, for his combined 10 years of leadership and service to covetrus and predecessor company, vets first choice. his experience and industry knowledge played a critical role in the creation and growth of the company, and we are appreciative of all of his efforts. david will remain a close friend to me and the organization, and i wish him all best as he continues to champion multiple philanthropic activities.
in closing, and as outlined on slide 10 of our presentation, i want to reiterate that i am proud of our team's accomplishment and their tireless efforts to support our customers across the globe as we all navigate and adapt to the covid-19 pandemic. our strong first quarter results are evidence to early progress as we have achieved by focusing on the core drivers of our business. veterinary care remains an essential service, and we are encouraged by the moderately improving trends we are beginning to see with many of our customers over the last few weeks.
as the recovery in our end market continues, i believe the combination of our strengthened financial profile and organizational health position us well to accelerate growth and create shareholder value over the long term.
this concludes our prepared remarks, and i will now turn the call back over to nick to moderate the q&a session.
nicholas jansen -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, ben.

[operator instructions]
and your first question comes from the line of john kreger from william blair.
john kreger -- william blair & company -- analyst
hi, thanks very much. ben, i was hoping to dig in a little bit on the very good trends in prescription management and curious if you think they're sustainable. are you seeing any stocking there? i know you mentioned in international markets you were, but curious if you think you're seeing any stocking driving up the numbers in prescription management.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, john. good to speak to you. i think the short answer is not really from a stocking standpoint. while there certainly could be an individual consumer or two that would be ordering large quantities more than they need in the short term, most of the activity is really coming from our existing customers engaging with their own customers at just a much greater rate. as covid picked up, the desire of our customers to maintain continuity or connectivity with their own consumers increased. and what we saw was just greater engagement across the board.
as i mentioned in the prepared remarks, we started to see a lot of that progress even pre-covid, and obviously, covid has been a bit of fuel on the fire. so we're excited about the progress and expect to continue to drive that business forward aggressively.
john kreger -- william blair & company -- analyst
great. thanks. and then a follow-up, and i think you just touched on it, but to dig a little bit more. as you look at where the growth is coming from within prescription management, does that tend to be from kind of legacy schein customers? are you seeing any interesting patterns between kind of henry schein legacy versus people using other sources of distribution? thanks.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. sure thing. so if you use the slide presentation that we provided, one of the nice things is that you can see that all of our cohorts, going all the way back to 2012, have continued to grow. and that would be a mix of customers who are using covetrus for distribution and those that are less reliant on covetrus for distribution. i think one of the nice things that i would point out is that when the company came together, the new customers that we had started to engage with in 2019 have been a very strong cohort for us, and that really has continued to occur in 2020.
so time to revenue for new customers getting onto the platform has decreased, and revenue scale on the platform has increased substantially. so whether it's the combination of our services and the excellent job that our -- the variety of our sales teams are doing across distribution and technology, the combination of that with covid and the continued investment in the technology platform, all of those things together are really creating a dynamic environment for that business. and it's exciting to see the growth and -- as well as the ebitda contribution.
john kreger -- william blair & company -- analyst
very good. thank you.
operator
and your next question is from nathan rich from goldman sachs.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good afternoon, and thanks for the questions. maybe just sticking about the prescription management platform. when we think about the consumers who are maybe trying their vets' website for the first time due to this pandemic, historically, kind of what's been the conversion rate from those kind of first-time purchasers into more loyal regular customers on the site? and are there any metrics you can kind of share around that just in terms of purchase frequency or basket size for the more loyal customers on the platform?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think maybe the metrics that i can point you to that is maybe most relevant is kind of same-store sales growth because i think that captures the -- what is going on as a consumer enters the platform for the very first time. and as i said in the prepared remarks, we saw 25% year-over-year growth in q1. in april, we saw a 31% year-over-year growth. and our -- the early data on people who've joined in q1 is that there really is no sign of those consumers being any different than historical consumers in terms of average order value and potential lifetime value of that consumer.
so i think that the foundation that we're building here really starts to get exciting as those customer cohorts just continue to build throughout the year and next year and the year after.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks. that's helpful. and maybe as a follow-up, last week, elanco announced, i think, what's a more -- can kind of be described as a more targeted distribution strategy that i think will result in just lower inventory levels for its products in sort of the distribution channel. can you maybe just give us your view on kind of what that means for covetrus? and does it impact how you think about going to market on those products?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i don't want to comment too specifically on any one manufacturer. but i think if you look at the results in q1, especially in the us with that business growing 4% on a pro forma basis, we feel really good about the progress that the team did across all of our manufacturers. and that really has continued here into the second quarter as demonstrated in the slides that we prepared. so i would say there's always going to be some movement around the suppliers as they figure out the best way to use distribution. but we're excited about the progress that were made and the stabilization of that business.
and maybe one other just point to highlight is that, i think as covid continues to move on, in some ways, the distribution rep becomes even more powerful, the veterinarian wants to see less and less people in their practice or needs to space them out. they don't need sales teams from every manufacturer calling on them. and i think we sit in a pretty unique position in terms of being able to bring lots of different products to market and combine that with a very compelling prescription management platform.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thanks for the time today.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you.
operator
and your next question comes from the line of erin wright from credit suisse.
erin wright -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks. a follow-up on the elanco question. just starting, i guess, this year, earlier, it already narrowed its distribution partners from eight to four. how much did that transition benefit you in the quarter? and how big of a relationship is that for you? and then now that it's taking another step forward in terms of narrowing or a more targeted approach, how do you think other relationships with vendors evolve in response to elanco's kind of recent commentary? and do you think there is a competitive response from this move? thanks.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think the company is very well positioned. we're the only company that can bring together distribution, prescription management, pims on behalf of a manufacturer and on behalf of a customer. so i think as suppliers look to partner with companies, we obviously sit in a very compelling position given the variety of services that we can offer and the scale that we can do it. as it relates to this -- elanco narrowing it's distribution relationships, that certainly helped a bit in the quarter and probably here in the balance of 2020. but those are relatively small players in the market, and i don't think it moved the financials significantly in any given direction.
erin wright -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. that's interesting. and then my second question is, do you think overall parasiticide purchasing patterns will be different this year, regardless of the severity of the season? and given some of the covid dynamics, but also in light of the product launches such as simparica trio, do you think there will be any differences from what you typically see in a normal -- in terms of normal purchasing patterns for parasiticides? thanks.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
it's a good question. we're obviously paying close attention. we'll see how that plays out. i think if you look at the trends that we put forward in the presentation and some of the trends that have been talked about by other parties, you definitely saw this dip in late march and early april, but it really has come back. and now you're talking about year-over-year revenue for a vet practice in the first week of may to be about down 5%, and you can see our total business down about 5% in that same period of time. so while there certainly could be some short-term decline in that market, we're seeing a pretty resilient and healthy marketplace. so i think we feel good about the overall position of our company and just the overall health of the industry, frankly.
erin wright -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay, great. thank you.
operator
and your next question comes from the line of jon block from stifel.
jonathan block -- stifel nicolaus and company, incorporated -- analyst
thanks, guys. good afternoon. the 16% same-store sales growth the vfc last year experienced a real big step-up to 25% in 1q, and it certainly seems to have validated the strategy you laid out last quarter of focusing on the installed base. i'm just curious, with the outbreak of the pandemic, is there any want to try to drive new practices a bit more? i'm just guessing, they're now more than ever in need of an online solution. so from you guys, is there any want to try to juggle both, if possible, the same-store and the new enrollees? and then i got a follow-up.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. a great question and one that we ask ourselves, too. i think we're staying true to our priorities and focus on engagement. however, i would say, as you pointed out, new customers are even more hungry to get on the platform, and we've seen a lot of organic progress. i believe stuart highlighted a number of 10,500 practices at the end of q1 2020, which is almost double the number of practices on the platform since 2017. so some of that is happening on its own or maybe with a less concerted effort given where we decided to focus. and i think you'll see us increase the aperture of things that we can focus on as the business has stability, and that we'll be able to make some market share gains on that front.
i think the other dynamic that i would point out is that not all practices are equal in terms of their use of engagement of the platform. so as important as adding a new practice, it's getting that practice to really engage with us. and what we have seen really differently in the past, our corporate customers, our consolidators really pushing hard to work with us in conjunction to use all of the aspects of client communication on the platform, and that's a huge leverage point for the practice. so the short answer is, yes, we'll add more practices, but we're going to continue to focus on driving that engagement because there's just so much opportunity with our existing customer base.
jonathan block -- stifel nicolaus and company, incorporated -- analyst
got it. great. thanks for the color. i think just second question to shift gears. the $44 million-ish, if you would call it, normalized ebitda, ex the stocking, that i still believe was handily ahead of what you conveyed back in the fourth quarter call, which was -- and that was in early march. i'm just sort of curious what drove the upside on a normalized basis? and then what regions drove the upside relative to your expectations? thanks, guys.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so i would say it was just solid performance all around by the business. the big drivers were continued cost control, so operating leverage going down below gross margin. the prescription management platform and the gts team did a really excellent job, and as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, had not only year-over-year ebitda growth or -- and sequential quarterly growth. but likewise, the distribution businesses across the world, europe, apac and us, all were having good quarters even prior to covid coming in, and that really got accelerated. so i think we feel just, all in all, very pleased with the progress. it's one quarter and there's many more quarters to come, but a very good start to the year.
jonathan block -- stifel nicolaus and company, incorporated -- analyst
perfect. thanks for your time, guys.
operator
and your next question comes from andrew cooper from raymond james.
andrew cooper -- raymond james & associates -- analyst
hi guys. thanks for the questions. i guess first, just as we look at kind of the margins, i think one of the comments you made was that north america distribution or supply chain ebitda was -- contribution was up. but can you give us a little bit of color just how to think about the mix as to [phonetic] what were margins doing in the core supply chain business in the quarter? and then i have a follow-up from there as well, but anything around helping us kind of splice out the moving parts on margins would be great.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so pre-covid, i would say, modest improvement to margin on a year-over-year basis in the supply chain in all regions. and different moving parts below that, but just kind of continued either steady or slightly improving performance in all parts of the globe.
andrew cooper -- raymond james & associates -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then i guess, maybe higher level, as we think about layering in telemedicine into the capabilities and the pims, is that something, as you think about building out sort of new capabilities, that you can really leverage? do you see opportunity there in terms of prescription management, scheduling, things like that, where you can really tie even closer to your customer, the vet practice, but also the end consumer as well? and how do you think about what doors layering that in may open up?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think at a big picture, covetrus is positioned to be the leading technology-enabled services and solutions company for the industry. and i think telemedicine is just a great example of our team responding very quickly to a dynamic market, taking advantage of our installed base of practice management or information management systems, taking advantage of all of the sales relationships that we have across distribution and technology, and rolling out a much-needed application for our end customer, who they could, therefore, use with their end consumer. so i expect to see more of that in the quarters and years to come. as our customers' needs evolve, so will our platform, and it's exciting to see some of those early steps being taken.
andrew cooper -- raymond james & associates -- analyst
great. i'll leave it there. thanks, guys.
operator
and your next question comes from the line of david westenberg from guggenheim.
david westenberg -- guggenheim securities, llc -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking the question. i'm actually going to jump on andrew's question, and maybe talk about monetization ability of telemedicine. are you finding that vets actually are able to monetize it? and maybe if you have a script attachment ratio or something along the lines that can help us figure out how vets might incorporate that in practice because it actually would help them drive their p&l.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. look, first of all, it's obviously early days on telemedicine. and when we brought that to market, the first thing we really thought about was just allowing our customers to stay in business and continue to practice medicine and get pet owners and their pets care. and so we rolled that out as a free solution to start. what we have seen from our customers is that they are liking it and that they can start to deliver some of the care that they had done previously in practice via telemedicine and continue to generate revenue for themselves.
over time, that practice -- that solution will evolve and be something that we generate revenue for ourselves. but we cannot -- we benefit when our customers benefit. so when they are proactively prescribing, they'll end up using the prescription management platform. if they're using specialty via telemedicine, they can use our specialty services. anything that keeps our customers healthy and growing is generally a good thing for our business. so the data is still early, but mostly, we are excited to allow them to stay up and running and providing continuity of care with their own consumers.
david westenberg -- guggenheim securities, llc -- analyst
all right. got it. thank you. and then just to ask a few questions on potential external exposures related with covid. can you remind us, i know it's a small amount, but end customers that are related to production animal? and then just on geography exposure, is there any certain geographies that might be a little bit higher relative to the rest of distribution? for example, are you a little bit heavier in the northeast relative to maybe other distributors? thank you.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so in terms of your first question, production versus companion, it varies by region. companion animal is the vast, vast majority in the us and a significant majority in apac. in europe, there's a much more significant production animal split, especially in the uk. so you're much closer to a 60-40 ratio between companion and production. and i would point out that production through the first quarter remained very solid and consistent on a year-over-year basis. it was really in the companion animal space where you saw a lot of volatility.
as it relates to the second question, we have such a significant market presence that our distribution footprint really maps to the us, and we don't over-index in any one area compared to a different distributor or at least the top two or three distributors. so i don't think we have either any benefit or headwind as it relates to our competitors on geographic footprint, at least in the us.
david westenberg -- guggenheim securities, llc -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and your last question comes from kevin kedra from g. research.
kevin kedra -- gabelli & company -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my questions. first, i wanted to ask about the prescription management platform. when vfc and henry schein got together, part of the idea was that the prescription management platform or essentially the legacy distribution business could essentially be a lead for placements for the prescription management platform. but given some of the dynamics of covid and the demand for digital platforms, could we essentially see this turnaround? could the ability to offer the prescription management platform potentially lead to opportunities to pick up business on the distribution side going down the road?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, absolutely. i think as the company becomes more and more -- or i should say, better positioned as the core partner to the veterinarian with a combination of technology-enabled services from distribution to specialty to proprietary brands and of course, prescription management, i think what you'll start to see is that it's really the collection of these products and services that allows us to be successful in the marketplace. and in some cases, a customer is going to be over-indexed on prescription management, and that relationship is going to allow us to broaden into distribution or other parts of the business. and in many other cases, it'll be the other way around.
obviously, when the companies were brought together, the benefit that schein brought was a tremendous customer footprint on the practice management side and on the distribution side of things, and that led to a lot of leads. but the other benefit, i would say, is that, that sales force has done a great job of just helping even our existing customers use the platform at an even greater rate. so in general, we're excited about the collection of assets and know that we have a ways to go in terms of how we bring them to market in a way that's really beneficial to our customers and our manufacturing partners. but the most recent quarter's results, i think, is certainly a very positive step in the right direction.
kevin kedra -- gabelli & company -- analyst

2020-Q4,CVET,2021-03-01 08:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the covetrus fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
i would now like to turn the conference over to your host, mr. nick jansen, vice president strategy and corporate development. please go ahead.
nicholas jansen -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, jerome. good morning and thank you for joining us for covetrus' q4 and full year 2020 earnings conference call. joining me on today's call are ben wolin, our president and chief executive officer and matthew foulston, our executive vice president and chief financial officer. ben and matthew will begin with prepared remarks and then we'll be happy to take your questions.
during today's conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. all statements other than statements of historical fact made during this conference call are forward-looking, including statements regarding management's expectations for future financial business, operational performance and operating expenditures.
forward-looking statements may be identified with words such as will, expect, believes, should, or similar terminology and the negative of these terms. forward-looking statements are not promises or guarantees of future performance and are subject to a variety of risk and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in these forward-looking statements.
these risks and uncertainties include those under the heading risk factors in our most recent annual report on form 10-k and other periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission which are available on the investors section of our website at ir.covetrus.com and on the sec's website at www.sec.gov.
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements. you could find this morning's press release announcing our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results and the accompanying slide deck for this call on ir.covetrus.com.
the release and presentation also contains further information about the non-gaap financial measures that we will discuss today. please refer to those documents for a reconciliation of non-gaap measures to our gaap financial results.
with that, i will now turn it over to ben to provide the highlights beginning on slide 3.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, nick. good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. i hope everyone is staying safe and i'm looking forward to the day, hopefully sometime later this year, when we all can spend time again together in person.
on the call this morning, we will provide an update on the state of the companion animal end market; highlight our stronger than expected q4 and full year 2020 financial results; detail our investment, growth and margin priorities for the upcoming year; and outline why we think 2021 will be another period of growth and operational progress as we capitalize on the opportunity in front of us.
now, starting on slide 3, with our perspectives on the current state of the companion animal end market. as many of you may already know, the companion animal industry is a growing market and has proven to be quite resilient despite the disruption that covid-19 has caused around the world. increased pet adoptions, the ongoing humanization of pets, innovation around enhanced standards of care, and the expansion of new service channels have raised global demand for our products and services.
our u.s. internal data confirms veterinarians were as busy as ever in the second half of 2020 with double-digit practice revenue growth fueled by a moderate increase in new clients and higher spending per visit. covid-19 in many ways accelerated the already favorable end market backdrop and helped our market positioning, which we believe will continue through 2021.
certainly, there will be months and/or quarters where we might face challenging comparisons versus 2020 activity. but the underlying factors driving our market endure and we are well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity in the years ahead.
these strong end market backdrop coupled with our improved sales execution and enhanced focus in operating discipline was clearly evident in driving our full-year numbers in 2020, as seen on slide 4. we delivered 10% year-over-year pro forma organic net sales growth and 13% year-over-year adjusted ebitda growth in 2020, with our business trajectory accelerating in the back half of the year.
our robust performance is spread across all three of our business segments, where we not only grew adjusted ebitda but also expanded our segment adjusted ebitda margins. our prescription management business increased pro forma net sales by 50% year-over-year and meaningfully improved its profitability. we also made solid progress increasing sales of our covetrus branded and proprietary brand portfolio, which combined our now in excess of $325 million with gross margins that are approximately double our consolidated average. i'll speak more on this opportunity later in my prepared remarks.
finally, the financial progress we made this year also enabled us to meaningfully improve our balance sheet with net leverage now at approximately 3.5 times, which affords us flexibility as we think about funding organic growth and external investment opportunities entering 2021. obviously, 2020 was a year like none other with the covid-19 pandemic.
yet i am so proud of how our team responded and exceeded expectations across nearly all elements of our strategic plan as seen on slide 5. first and foremost, we invested in our people, which led to significant improvements in our organizational health scores; an engaged and motivated workforce translates into better operational performance. that in turn helps us attract talent to help drive our transformation forward.
we increased our distribution market share in the u.s. and in certain international markets as we focus the company on the core drivers of our business. we sold non-core assets and exited our french distribution business to streamline our company and focus on markets where we have greater opportunity. we also successfully exited all of our tsas providing us direct operational control in many of our international markets.
we delivered robust prescription management net sales growth as we successfully executed our customer and client engagement strategies launched at the start of 2020. and lastly, we established global sourcing capabilities to drive our covetrus branded and proprietary brand product strategy entering 2021.
clearly, there were a significant number of accomplishments to be proud of. and this was evident in our better-than-expected fourth quarter results. as we look forward and turning to slide 6, we are focused on accelerating the contribution from our higher margin businesses and investing in innovation to sustain our leadership position.
to date, we have repositioned our portfolio of businesses, improved our execution and distribution and delivered against some of our initial strategies for our higher margin products and solutions. while we certainly made good progress in 2020, increasing our overall sales mix and generating more gross profit from our higher margin businesses, which now collectively represent more than 40% of our total company gross profit, there is still significant room to increase both elements in 2021 and beyond as we execute against our priorities.
for example, we recently combined our u.s. sales and marketing organizations that we believe will significantly improve our north american commercial effectiveness in 2021. this has created greater strategic and financial alignment with our customers, which we believe will help us secure new business, grow our share of wallet and reduce our cost to serve.
we have also doubled down on our prescription management engagement strategies in 2021 and have also increased our focus on new enrollments to sustain the strong growth delivered in 2020. we are also investing heavily in technology and e-commerce and have added focus to our covetrus branded and proprietary products and solutions to enhance our value proposition.
through these actions, we anticipate making good progress in 2021 as we march toward our longer-term aspirations of delivering adjusted ebitda margins that approach 10% as compared to the 5.2% adjusted ebitda margin achieved in 2020.
drilling deeper and looking at the path to future margin expansion and shareholder value creation, you can see on slide 7 the north american gross margin and net sales trajectory of our proprietary products and solutions compared to traditional distribution of third-party products. clearly, the profile dynamics of our proprietary products and solutions are significantly higher than traditional distribution and we have now aligned our resources including our sales compensation metrics with value creation.
as we drive engagement with all in covetrus customers and increase the penetration of these higher margin products and solutions inside our existing base, we expect to see steady improvement in our consolidated margins. importantly, approximately two-thirds of our 2021 capex budget is growth oriented and focused on these higher-margin businesses, as we are aggressively seeking to expand our market position in north america and as we think about future m&a and capital deployment moving forward, we believe such activity will be heavily skewed toward advancing these growth and margin objectives.
clearly, the opportunity for consolidation on our market is high and our global reach and customer access puts us in a position to create value through focused capital deployment. with our increased focus on our covetrus branded products, proprietary brands and compounding solutions, i thought it would also be useful for investors if we were to talk more about some of the levers we are pulling in 2021 to work to accelerate our growth trajectory in these categories. as seen on slide 8.
first for covetrus branded products, we have launched several new commercial initiatives that have made it easier for veterinary practices during the ordering process to see the value they derive from these products versus alternatives. we have also launched several of these covetrus branded products on our prescription management platform providing new savings opportunities for pet owner seeking lower cost alternative.
second, we have developed new sales and marketing programs that -- for our family of own brands. these includes vi, kruuse, calibra, and smartpak to accelerate our penetration in existing geographies and new markets. we've had significant success, for example, in driving adoption of vi and kruuse throughout europe by leveraging our broad supply chain footprint in those markets and we look to replicate this strategy in the u.s. in 2021 and beyond.
additionally, we plan on making available later this year our market leading brand of smartpak supplements to horse owners, barn managers and trainers in canada with its strong e-client sports tradition.
third, we have a funnel of new products and compounding solutions launching into the market over the next six to 12 months that can deliver covetrus branded value and meet the needs of both customers and pet owners.
and finally, we are opening the newest and most technologically advanced compounding pharmacy and 503b outsourcing facility later this year, which is designed to significantly enhance our operating capacity and increase our commercialization capability for office use and patient specific medications.
in total, these investments offer us the opportunity to advance our customer's objectives and meaningfully accelerate the growth of our proprietary products and compounding solutions in 2021 in the years ahead.
as we think through the roadmap of our technology investments on slide 9, 2021 will be an active year for us with a number of major milestones that will not only enhance our value proposition to our customers and our clients, but will also unlock significant sales growth for margin potential for covetrus.
for example, while i already mentioned our new state-of-the-art compounding and outsourcing facility scheduled to open in arizona in q2, we also have a major pharmacy project under way in maine that is expected to open in the second half of 2021, which will allow us the ability to deliver products more quickly to our veterinary practice customers and pet owners in the large northeast u.s. market.
one of the bigger investments in technology solutions we are making in 2021 is the build out of our unified cloud based offering that will bring together our practice management software and our prescription management platform into one module.
this new product offering will streamline technology solutions for the veterinary practice, support greater prescription compliance, simplify pet owner engagement and improve our practice manager's inventory while creating added visibility into practice management. this build out will take 12-plus months to complete, but in the meantime, we'll continue to provide upgrades and improvements to our existing practice management software capabilities, which are designed to make it easier for these practices to leverage our prescription management and client engagement services.
for example, in q4, we launched the initial functionality that allows veterinarians to create a prescription inside our avimark and evetpractice practice management software solutions and the general release will be available in q1. we expect additional product features to be introduced to the market throughout 2021.
lastly, i would highlight a number of planned investments and technology enhancements in the consumer experience for pet owners buying products through our prescription management platform including, optimizing the user's journey and mobile experience to increase conversion rates, improving auto-ship management and delivering better personalization and dynamic content.
we are also investing in employment management and other consumer initiatives that strengthen the connectivity between the veterinarian and the pet owner. we are also launching upgrades in 2021 to our b2b e-commerce platform experience for both distribution and compounding and pursuing new software integrations and partnerships, which are designed to make it easier for our customers to seamlessly order products from covetrus including our proprietary products and compounding solutions.
clearly, we have planned for a lot of operational capacity and innovation to bring to market in 2021, which puts covetrus in a fantastic position to help our customers grow their businesses and aid our manufacturer partners to achieve their strategic objectives. our team is energized by the momentum we have going for us in the market and we look forward to another year of great success in 2021.
i will now turn the call over to matthew to provide more details on the financials.
matthew foulston -- global chief financial officer
thanks, ben. good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. i will now review our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results and provide additional details on our 2021 guidance. the focus of my comments will be on our non-gaap results where applicable as these items provide the most insight into the underlying trends impacting our businesses.
please refer to today's press release for a more detailed description of our fourth quarter and full year 2020 gaap results. as summarized on slide 11, we finished 2020 with momentum across our businesses with all three reporting segments contributing to our growth and outperformance versus expectations for the fourth quarter.
favorable end market conditions and our strong operating execution drove a 19% year-over-year increase in adjusted ebitda and fueled 30 basis points of year-over-year adjusted ebitda margin expansion during the fourth quarter. additionally, our net leverage ratio improved to 3.5 times and we ended the year with approximately $590 million of liquidity, including $290 million in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet.
turning to the details and starting at the top of the income statement on slide 12, covetrus net sales were approximately $1.12 billion in q4, an increase of 11% year-over-year on a reported basis. organic year-over-year net sales growth was 12% during the fourth quarter and 10% for the full year 2020 reflecting underlying healthy companion animal market trends that are tracking at or above pre-covid-19 levels across our major geographies, improved sales execution and market position in a number of our key markets, and the positive trajectory of our prescription management business.
while there were some discrete items in europe that will impact consolidated net sales growth in 2021, which i will detail later, we anticipate another year of strong underlying growth as we capitalize on positive end market conditions and execute our strategic priorities, while still investing for growth.
turning to slide 13, consolidated non-gaap adjusted ebitda was $56 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $47 million in the prior year. the 19% year-over-year improvement reflected strong contributions from our north america and apac and emerging market segments, which more than offset the impact from the divestiture of scil and continued growth in overhead as we complete the build-out of the infrastructure necessary to support our independence as a public company.
for the full year 2020, as shown on slide 14, consolidated non-gaap adjusted ebitda was $226 million compared to our november guidance that called for $213 million to $218 million in adjusted ebitda and the $200 million reported in the prior year. i would also note that full year results came in significantly ahead of our initial 2020 guidance offered at this time last year, despite the uncertainty created by the covid-19 pandemic.
the 13% year-over-year growth reflected significant improvements in profitability in our prescription management business in north america as well as the increased earnings contribution from our supply chain businesses in all three reporting segments, which reflected healthy top line performance and the impact of cost containment actions. this growth was partially offset by the aforementioned increase in corporate overhead to support our transformation as a new public company on the lost earnings contribution from the divestiture of scil animal care. additionally, there was also a several million dollar year-over-year headwind in 2020 tied to increased bonus accruals compared to 2019, given our stronger financial performance that exceeded internal expectations.
moving to our quarterly commentary for our operating segments, beginning on slide 15. north america net sales increased 17% year-over-year on both a reported and organic basis in q4 and segment adjusted ebitda increased 25% year-over-year with segment adjusted ebitda margins expanding 50 basis points versus the prior year. strong net sales growth in our supply chain business and another quarter of greater than 40% net sales growth in prescription management contributed to our positive performance in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year.
drilling deeper into north american segment trends, starting on slide 16, our supply chain business organic net sales increased approximately 14% year-over-year in q4 and 7% for the full year, reflective of healthy end market demand and our improved market position.
external third-party data indicated that our u.s. distribution business grew companion animal market share during the fourth quarter relative to the prior year, driven by new account wins, better execution over the last 12 months, as well as the benefit from certain manufacturers, reducing the number of distributor relationships they utilize in the u.s. market.
encouragingly, we were able to leverage our improved market position and double-digit organic net sales growth to deliver a significant improvement in profitability with supply chain adjusted ebitda increasing to $37 million compared to $26 million in the prior year period. our north american software business was generally stable during the quarter and for the full year. as ben mentioned earlier, we are making significant investments in our software capabilities that we expect to drive growth in 2022 and beyond.
turning to slide 17, on our prescription management business in north america. during the fourth quarter of 2020, net sales increased 46% year-over-year to $107 million and we ended the year with more than 11,100 practices on the platform. of note, we added approximately 200 net new enrollments during the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 15 additions during the third quarter.
we have a funnel of good customer prospects and an aligned sales force to drive an increased number of practice enrollments in 2021. the 46% year-over-year prescription management net sales growth delivered in q4 was an acceleration over third quarter growth rates. and once again tracked above our pre-covid-19 trajectory as the business continues to benefit from new customer and client engagement strategies.
same-store prescription management platform net sales, defined as veterinary practices enrolled on the platform in 2018 or earlier, increased 26% year-over-year during q4 and 28% for the full year, which was well ahead of the 16% year-over-year same-store sales growth reported in 2019. impressively, all cohorts experienced double-digit year-over-year net sales growth for the year and the 2019 cohort had the most productive first year in company history.
encouragingly, the early full year data on the 2020 cohort suggests similar strength as our 2019 cohort. we also continue to make progress in scaling the financial performance of our prescription management business with q4 adjusted ebitda of $2 million, or $6 million when excluding a $4 million legal reserve taken during the quarter for historic litigation at legacy vets first choice, giving us a $3 million underlying improvement versus the prior year.
for the full year and when adjusted for the legal reserve, 19% of the year-over-year dollar growth in pro forma net sales dropped down to adjusted ebitda, which is at the high end of our 15% to 20% target on a rolling 12 month basis. as a reminder, investments tend to be lumpy quarter to quarter and therefore, we believe, looking at this metric over a 12-month period is the best way to evaluate our success in driving disciplined growth in this business.
turning to our european business segment on slide 18, organic net sales increased 5% year-over-year in q4 and 6% for the full year, reflecting end market growth and strong sales execution by our european team despite the challenges presented by covid-19. we had healthy q4 organic net sales performance from our businesses operating in the netherlands, ireland and romania. strength in these markets helped offset significant weakness in germany and france.
as a reminder, and our 3pl transition in germany has not been as smooth as anticipated and we exited our low margin supply chain business in france at the end of the year, given market challenges. these two items will collectively reduce 2021 revenue by more than $70 million relative to 2020 levels.
turning to profitability; european segment adjusted ebitda in q4 was flat year-over-year at $18 million with margins declining 10 basis points year-over-year to 4.5%. it's important to note that if we exclude the impact of the divestiture of scil, the noise around our jv in spain and the impact of fx, european segment adjusted ebitda increased 15% year-over-year and margins expanded 40 basis points reflecting solid underlying operating leverage on mid-single digit organic net sales growth.
moving onto our apac and emerging market segment on slide 19. our team delivered a 14% year-over-year increase in organic net sales for both q4 and full year 2020, maintaining our recent momentum and reflecting our strong sales execution. we continue to see strong double-digit growth in australia and brazil with more modest growth rates in new zealand.
gross margins expanded 90 basis points year-over-year in q4 as we continue to make good progress driving our proprietary products. segment adjusted ebitda increased 80% year-over-year during q4, and margins expanded by 280 basis points year-over-year driven by gross margin improvement and the positive operating leverage from better than expected net sales as well as strong cost discipline.
turning briefly back to our consolidated results. q4 gaap net loss was $4 million or a loss of $0.04 per diluted share. non-gaap adjusted net income, which exclude special items as well as acquisition related intangibles amortization and other items was $28 million during q4 versus $20 million in the prior year period.
now turning to our balance sheet on slide 20. our reported net leverage at the end of the fourth quarter was 3.5 times as compared to 3.6 times at the end of the third quarter and now sits at the top end of our long-term targeted range of 3 times to 3.5 times.
our cash balance dropped to approximately $290 million at december 31, 2020 as compared to $355 million on september 30, 2020, primarily reflecting our decision to prepay the $60 million in term loan principal amortization for 2021 in december of last year, which will reduce our interest expense by more than $600,000 this year.
underlying cash generation was positive during q4 and the improvement in adjusted ebitda year-over-year enabled the sequential improvement in our net leverage ratio at year end. we ended q4 with nearly $590 million in available liquidity and with 2.3 times of headroom under our net leverage covenant as defined in our credit agreement. with our balance sheet now in a much stronger position, we have flexibility in 2021 to fund both internal investments and pursue external growth opportunities.
now turning to our 2021 guidance as outlined on slide 21. we continue to forecast adjusted ebitda in the range of $240 million to $250 million for 2021. this outlook balances the underlying momentum we have across many of our businesses entering the year with planned investments to support future growth, as well as the impact of discrete challenges in europe.
additionally, our outlook assumes an end market growth rate that is closer to the historical trend line of mid-single digits versus the above trend growth rates seen in many of our markets in 2020 driven by covid-19. with this market framework in mind, our year-over-year organic net sales growth is expected to be 2.5% to 3.5% in 2021.
this includes strong net sales performance in north america, which is expected to grow low teens year-over-year organically, including 30% to 40% year-over-year growth in prescription management mid-to-high single-digit year-over-year growth in supply chain.
europe is expected to decline low teens year-over-year in 2021 on an organic growth basis. this includes an approximate 30% year-over-year sales decline in the uk tied to a manufacturer and customer loss and the continued challenges in germany tied to our ongoing 3pl transition, which we forecast will reduce net sales in that market by nearly 20%.
excluding these two markets, our european segment is expected to grow low-to-mid single-digits and in line with market growth rates for the region. apac and emerging markets is also expected to grow in the low-to-mid single-digits year-over-year in 2021 on an organic basis, off a challenging year-over-year comparison.
in total, and when excluding the discrete headwinds in the uk and germany, our organic year-over-year net sales growth in 2021 is expected to be in the high single digits, which is more reflective of our long-term growth opportunity.
other elements of our 2021 guidance including capital expenditures of $55 million to $65 million, of which approximately two thirds is focused on growth, an adjusted ebitda to free cash flow conversion between 30% and 40%, which is an improvement versus 2020 performance as we cycle through some of the more significant one-time cash costs tied to our transformation, we continue to target 50% adjusted ebitda to free cash flow conversion over the longer term.
and as we think about the quarterly cadence for 2021, we expect the first half of the year to reflect more challenging year-over-year comparisons given the temporary cost containment actions implemented last year during the height of the covid-19 uncertainty, the timing of certain investments in 2020, and the spike in net sales seen in our prescription management business tied to the start of the pandemic last year.
additionally, the first quarter of 2021 has too few -- too fewer selling days year-over-year has faced some incremental weather related headwinds and will face some more difficult comparison, as a result of the covid-19 inventory stocking dynamics during march of 2020 in many of our international markets.
lastly, we anticipate growth in our prescription management business to track toward the lower end of our 30% to 40% year-over-year growth target in the first half of '21 and the higher end of the target in the second half of the year, reflective of the covid-19 related year-over-year comparison dynamics just described as well as certain discrete factors such as major supplier shortages in therapeutic diets and some shipping challenges at our primary carrier in the first quarter.
taking these aggregate net sales items as well as the timing of certain investments into consideration, we expect adjusted ebitda in the first half of the year to approximate 45% of our full year 2021 guidance.
with that, i'll now turn the call back over to ben for some brief closing remarks.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, matthew. in closing, and as outlined on slide 22, we have a solid foundation in place after delivering a very successful 2020 and we have good visibility and a clear plan for our efforts to deliver another strong year in 2021. our end market is healthy and has proven durable throughout covid-19 and our differentiated value proposition is resonating in the marketplace, which is giving us confidence to further invest in people and innovation to advance customer's growth objectives.
we are confident in our strategy, and believe we are well positioned to deliver improved outcomes for our customers, their clients and our manufacturer partners; and create shareholder value as we capitalize on our opportunity and expand our margins.
this concludes our prepared remarks and i will now turn the call back over to nicholas jansen to moderate the q&a session.
nicholas jansen -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, ben. now, we begin the q&a section of our call. we want to take as many questions as possible, so we ask you to limit them to two and then reenter the queue should you have an additional one. so, jerome please provide instructions and we are ready to take the first question.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of john kreger with william blair. your line is open.
john kreger -- william blair & company -- analyst
hi, thanks very much. hey guys. ben, could you talk a little bit more about how you're going to address some of the issues that you've mentioned in germany, in particular? how long will it take to get that fixed and when would you expect growth in that region to normalize?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, thanks, john. good to hear from you. the team has obviously been very focused on that. we are disappointed with how challenging the transition was. it has started to get better really in q4 and early into q1. but i expect it will still be challenging through the first half of 2021, but we do think that our market position will be able to be -- will start to grow again in the back half of next year -- of this coming year. sorry.
john kreger -- william blair & company -- analyst
got it, thank you. and then you outlined -- it sounds like you're investing in compounding with some new fulfillment assets, any plans to take that to europe or asia?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think in the long-term, that's certainly an opportunity. there is obviously, as you know, different regulatory environments in those different countries. i think for now, at least in the short term, the focus is squarely on north america when it comes to compounding. we feel like we really are in a unique place, given our sales access, our prescription management platform, our investment in facilities, product development. so i think that can be a big growth driver both on the top and bottom line in 2021 for us.
john kreger -- william blair & company -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of balaji prasad with barclays. your line is open.
balaji prasad -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
hi, good morning and congratulations for results. couple of questions from me. firstly, on the operating margin side, i find it interesting that apac and em at 7.9% is higher than north america at 7.4%. so, can you help us understand those dynamics and also try to get a sense of the underlying ebitda or optimal ebitda for both of these regions?
secondly on vsg, are you in a position to provide some update now since your investment, any operational changes done? and anything in terms of tangible progress or changes that we can see in the near term? thank you.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
sure thing. why don't -- i'll let matthew answer the first part of your questions on apac, operating margins and i'll handle the second part of the question on vsg.
matthew foulston -- global chief financial officer
yes, i think, we enjoy a really nice market position in apac. we've got a fantastic team down there that's been really delivering tremendously for the last 18 months. and in fact, we see nothing but further opportunity down in that region as we think about the possibility of taking the prescription management platform down there.
so i think that's an area where you will see us focus and we're really proud of the performance. we talked a lot about the work we need to do to improve our margins across the board and drive that ebitda margin closer toward 10% over time. and a lot of what ben talked about is our focus in those key areas on that slide around prescription management, around the proprietary brands and around compounding, where we do enjoy those premium margins and that's where the focus of our investments and our efforts are.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and balaji, as it relates to vsg. obviously, we're about one quarter into that acquisition. so far so good. it really is a great asset, uniquely positioned as a study group partner for the veterinary industry and in the coming quarters, what investors as well as vsg members should come to expect is more and more innovation coming out of covetrus that is brought to them in a unique fashion whether that's bringing things like prescription management and compounding, combined with distribution together with them in a unique selling model. so, it's still early but we're cautiously optimistic about the progress that we can make on that front.
balaji prasad -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of jon block with stifel. your line is open.
jonathan block -- stifel nicolaus and company, inc. -- analyst
great. thanks, guys. good morning. long first one and i'll try to keep the second one tighter. but for the quarter, the $56 million versus $47 million in adjusted ebitda, so up $9 million. but i just want to make sure, scil was a $3 million headwind and the $4 million legal, matthew is in the $56 million, call it, and then maybe, it depends on how we want to count both bonus payments.
i guess, what i'm trying to get out there is normalized, do we think about year-over-year growth closer to 30% plus versus what you guys printed? and then, a tack on to that is, how do we think about the corporate overhead in '21 versus '20. i think that was a pretty big $22 million headwind in 2020? thanks.
matthew foulston -- global chief financial officer
yeah, let me start with the legal reserve that is in that number and was a headwind. and obviously, as you mentioned scil was another drag on earnings. so q4 was a positive surprise for us. we had strength in all three markets beyond what we expected. i think when the markets go into deeper lockdown, it seems to drive more activity with people and their animals and we were pleasantly surprised across all three markets in the fourth quarter.
jonathan block -- stifel nicolaus and company, inc. -- analyst
okay, great. and for that -- the follow-up just for the '21, how we think about corporate in terms of the year-over-year headwind?
matthew foulston -- global chief financial officer
yeah, i don't think, you'll see anything really material in corporate. it'll be up [phonetic] few million, nothing like the progress we had to make in getting off those 72 tsas in 2020, which took a lot of stand up of corporate capability.
jonathan block -- stifel nicolaus and company, inc. -- analyst
got it. perfect. and then sort of a longer-term question, ben. if you could just talk to -- i think you alluded to the 10% long-term adjusted ebitda margins that you drew out there. maybe if you could talk to the timing behind that and the construct. in other words, do we think about a supply chain and software bids of call it 7% to 8% or high single digits prescription management 15% plus. and then when you weight the two out, you arrive at that 10% bogey. thanks for your time.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think the -- it really is reflective of a revenue mix shift that is already occurring inside of the business. in my prepared remarks, i mentioned that gross profit on a total basis is now -- 40% of that gross profit is coming from products and services that are unique to the company, whether that'd be proprietary brands or compounding or prescription management.
so, the driver of going from 5% to 10% adjusted ebitda margin is that increased penetration of those unique services. we do think distribution revenue will continue to grow, but certainly not grow at the pace of those other efforts. in terms of timing, it's a multi-year ambition, but we think that every year that we can make steady progress in that direction, and i think 2020 was reflective of kind of first step on that path.
jonathan block -- stifel nicolaus and company, inc. -- analyst
perfect, thanks for your time, guys.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah.
operator
your next question comes from the line of david westenberg with guggenheim. your line's open.
david westenberg -- guggenheim securities, llc -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking the question and congrats on a really great year here. just briefly talk about the prescription management potential in europe. i know, early in the acquisition rationale, it was about the revenue synergy about building on the covetrus or the legacy henry schein business there and how that kind of -- might help you in terms of your growth in kind of a tough macro in europe?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, clearly there is long-term opportunity all over the world, i think, for prescription management. i mean generally, the value proposition is one that we think can resonate in every market. for the company, what we're balancing is just obviously a wide hot opportunity here in the u.s. and how much capital we should invest in the short term against international expansion versus u.s. opportunity.
so, i do think that it can help us in a market like the u.k., which we mentioned is under pressure, in terms of our value either to customers or manufacturers. but i think in terms of the p&l, we don't expect significant impact in 2021 on any international expansion.
david westenberg -- guggenheim securities, llc -- analyst
got it. all right. no, thank you very much. and then, how do we think about the move to the cloud in pims? and then strategically, how we should think about the pims business? should we still think about this as kind of a bridge between distribution and prescription management or maybe that was how i thought about it, not necessarily how you thought about it in terms of a long-term strategic use of your very high market share in the pims, and obviously, that's my last question. thank you.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. no, i think it's a good way to think about the business. it's clearly kind of a nexus for the other parts of the business and while it hasn't been a big top line grower, it's obviously a very significant ebitda contributor. and on top of that, it's a real gateway to our other products and services.
so one of the things that we mentioned in the script is, we are now surfacing prescription management opportunities embedded into avimark and evetpractice and that's just kind of one of many different things that we look to do in terms of using our pims footprint to drive adoption of other covetrus products and services.
so, the investment in the cloud is really all about both a modernization of that system, which should be a benefit to both our customers in terms of ease of use, maintainability, access to upgrades as well as an ability for the company to do factor integrations of various products and services across the covetrus family.
david westenberg -- guggenheim securities, llc -- analyst
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of nathan rich with goldman sachs. your line is open.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking the questions. i guess, i wanted to start off with the ebitda guidance and trying to kind of marry it with the top line outlook that you gave, it seems like when we think about the growth in the prescription management business that seems to be the primary driver of the ebitda growth year-over-year.
and i guess -- matt, i guess i'd be curious just to kind of get your view, when we look at kind of the underlying businesses across the different regions, do you feel like that the kind of growth in kind of north america and apac is kind of balanced by the headwinds that you called out in europe. so we should think of that kind of the supply chain business as relatively flattish and the prescription management business as kind of driving that incremental growth in ebitda year-over-year, if that makes sense?
matthew foulston -- global chief financial officer
yeah, i think in a general sense, that's a good way to look at it, clearly dropping down 20% of the incremental revenue to ebitda in that business as we consistently shown now is a nice driver of profit going forward. we think the distribution business is going to be strong in north america and we think, it will be pretty strong again in apac.
europe does present a bit of a drag here, both in the uk and germany. as ben said earlier, we think we can see a path to things improving in germany in the back half. but i think, that's sort of the broad strokes. i think, you got it right.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and, ben, maybe looking a little bit longer term, it's interesting the slide that you guys had on sort of the incremental gross margin across the different businesses. when we think about like the software services business, that growth seems to have been relatively flattish.
i guess, what do you feel like it's going to take to drive growth in that segment? and what type of growth do you think is reasonable kind of over the long term, because if you can grow that business, obviously very accretive from a margin standpoint. so would just be curious to get your outlook for that segment there?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. you know 2020 was such an interesting year on so many fronts. i think on products and services that require the customer to make significant changes to their business. we saw a huge pull back and i think, you hear about that from other peers in our category as well. so software clearly fits into that category and i think that we're just not in a position to want to make large wholesale changes to their practice.
so we do think that business can reaccelerate into kind of a mid-single digits grower. i would also just point out though that for us and david westenberg kind of alluded to this in his questioning. the pims is really this great gateway to other parts of the business. so, like in the u.s., where we're close to 60% market share for that business and with prescription management sitting at around a third of market share, the combination of those two software assets together from an end-user standpoint provides us great on-ramp for prescription management.
so when i evaluate the success of that business. i think about both, on a stand-alone basis how much revenue and ebitda is it producing as well as its ability to drive other incremental products and services for covetrus. and certainly in 2020 and 2019, we would have never had the prescription management growth that we did if it weren't for the installed base of our pims business.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
makes sense. thank you.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah.

operator
good afternoon. my name is yan, and i will be your conference operator for today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the covetrus first quarter 2021 earnings conference call.
i would now like to turn the call over to mr. nicholas jansen, vice president, strategy and corporate development. please go ahead.
nicholas jansen -- vice president, strategy and corporate development
thank you, yan. good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for covetrus' q1 2021 earnings conference call.

benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, nicholas. good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. i hope everyone remain safe and well.
on this -- on the call this afternoon, we will discuss our strong q1 financial results and the increase to our 2021 full year guidance, outline the progress we are making in driving sales in our higher margin businesses, provide you with an update on some of the recent milestones tied to our strategic initiatives that we outlined earlier this year and highlight our commitment to social responsibility and sustainability ahead of the launch of our first-ever esg report scheduled to be released later in 2021.
starting on slide 3 with our quarterly highlights. q1 was strong across nearly every metric in the business, including 4% year-over-year organic net sales growth or a more robust 12% when excluding the impact from the previously announced items impacting our uk and german distribution businesses. importantly, our north america segment grew organic net sales 16% year-over-year.
when looking at the broader market, we can see that the companion animal end market remained healthy during q1, a continuation of the positive trend we have seen since shortly after the pandemic started. and our sales execution continues to drive above market growth in many of our geographies, with particularly strong performance in the u.s., as i just described.
importantly, we leverage this positive top-line growth into 19% year-over-year adjusted ebitda growth, as we continue to drive above average growth in our higher margin products and services, and maintain cost discipline.
we also had another strong quarter in prescription management, which delivered accelerated year-over-year same-store sales growth and the highest number of quarterly new gross practice enrollments on the platform in over 12 months.
additionally, we made good progress on our synchronization efforts during the quarter, with our aligned north american commercial organization driving increased adoption of the all-in covetrus solution, which represents approximately 10% of our combined u.s. customer base or a 40 basis point improvement relative to the prior year. revenue for all-in customer grew more than 20% year-over-year in q1 or double the rate of growth of our average revenue per customer in the u.s. we continue to see a significant opportunity to drive deeper engagement with our customer base as we gain further traction with our commercial model, which incentivizes our team to drive adoption of our portfolio of higher margin solutions.
finally, we also made significant progress on bringing new talent into the organization that will help accelerate our transformation efforts, including several new senior roles to covetrus: link welborn as our chief veterinary officer of north america; deb sharkey as our chief consumer officer; and pete perron as president, strategic partnerships. this list is that includes several other critical hires in the areas of technology brand and consumer that we believe will strengthen our product roadmap and accelerate our progress against our strategic objectives.
on this note, and as discussed on our year-end call back in early march, we are focused as an organization on accelerating the financial contribution of our higher margin businesses and investing in innovation to sustain our leadership position.
as seen on slide 4, we made good progress in delivering against this objective during q1, where we drove double-digit year-over-year growth in net sales and gross profit in these categories in the first quarter when excluding the divested scil business in the prior year period. these growth rates were well in excess of the rest of our portfolio and these businesses now collectively represent more than 40% of the company's consolidated gross profit or nearly a 400 basis point year-over-year increase. we are encouraged by this trajectory and expect to see more progress in the quarters ahead as our recent strategic actions build momentum. and while distribution gross profit was relatively flat year-over-year during the first quarter on a global basis, our businesses in north america and apac & emerging markets did see growth and we remain optimistic that the challenges in europe are isolated and temporary.
prescription management, smartpak, kruuse and vi, all had strong performances in q1, and we expect to see further momentum in areas like covetrus-branded product and compounding as we progress through the balance of the year based on recent investments in innovation and capacity expansion plans for those businesses. as we drive innovation and continued growth in our existing portfolio of higher margin businesses, we should expect continued gains in our consolidated gross margin, which expanded 40 basis points year-over-year during q1 when excluding scil in the prior year period.
we also believe that capital deployment can help further advance our growth and margin objectives. clearly, the opportunity for ongoing consolidation in our market is high and our global reach, software assets and customer access put us in a position to create significant value through focused capital deployment. opportunities where we can own more margin, strengthen our relationship with the customer, drive demand and win with the pet owner are our primary areas of focus.
turning to slide 5. i now want to highlight several of our recent operational highlights that support some of the strategic priorities we outlined earlier in the year. in q1, we made significant progress on a couple of our larger capital projects that are currently under way, with the build-out of a brand new state-of-the-art compounding and 503b outsourcing facility nearing completion in arizona and anticipated to be opened by the end of the second quarter. as a reminder, this project is designed to significantly enhance our operating capacity and increase our commercialization capability for office use and patient-specific medications.
we also continue to roll out new technology in our distribution centers across the u.s., which will provide several key benefits for our customers, while providing significant efficiencies and working capital benefits for covetrus. and our new pharmacy in texas to support large animals opened in march, providing access to a new growth opportunity in the small, but growing vertical for the company.
our recent investments in our consumer organization also started to pay initial dividend during the first quarter, where we deployed new marketing capabilities and tested new preventative messaging to pet owners that drove a 26% year-over-year increase in the number of new pet parents to the prescription management platform in q1. these incremental investments exceeded our return thresholds for lifetime value and further support our goal to deliver 30% to 40% net sales growth in our prescription management business in 2021. we've also seen great retention of the buyers acquired last year during the covid-19 pandemic, and we continue to see healthy enrollment and growth in our autoship services, which provides the underlying foundation for our sales trajectory.
additionally, the team continues to optimize the consumer experience on the storefront, which has improved site navigation and checkout for pet parents and is driving encouraging conversion metrics. the addition of certain covetrus branded and proprietary product skus onto the storefront also serves as an incremental opportunity as we drive future adoption of our own products.
and before turning to software, our consumer team has also done a tremendous job driving growth in our equine e-commerce business smartpak, where subscriptions grew an impressive 9% year-over-year during the first quarter.
moving to our technology solutions, we are now ready for the full launch of built-in e-prescribing capabilities inside our avimark and evetpractice software systems, which is a major milestone for the company, as we look to drive tighter integration and improved functionality between our prescription management and practice management software systems. combining this added functionality with our investments to make it easier to upgrade to our latest software versions provides added value to our existing software customers and should unlock new revenue opportunities for covetrus, including in areas like credit card processing.
we are also making great progress on the build-out of our next generation cloud-based software solution, which we continue to target for q4 launch with the additional functionality rolling out throughout 2022. this new product offering will streamline technology solutions for the veterinary practice, support greater prescription compliance, simplified pet owner engagement, and improve our practice manager's inventory while creating added visibility into practice performance. we believe this new platform will drive significant value for our customers and for covetrus.
finally, on slide 6, with covetrus now being public for a little over two years and with our first ever esc reports set to be released later this year, i thought this would be a good time for us to share some of the good progress we are making with respect to all our global esg initiatives currently under way and provide an update on the company's commitment to sustainability, social responsibility and good governance.
as a global animal health company with a mission to advance the world of veterinary medicine, we are dedicated to providing ethical, sustainable and socially responsible solutions that improve the lives of our employees, customers and partners, while positively impacting the communities we serve. over the past year, we have found ourselves living in a time that reminds us of the importance of community support and the need for organizations and individuals to simply do good; one of our core values.
within covetrus, the spirit of social responsibility has always been strong and all the time we are developing new ways for covetrus to better serve its various stakeholders. from our long-standing support of animal shelters and assistance dog programs to our team's resolve during moments of crisis like the australian bush fires and now covid-19, covetrus is making a difference all around the world. we've also committed to cataloging and benchmarking our own environmental footprint and building resilience to climate impacts into some of our business models in order to improve sustainability and to reduce our collective environmental impact.
this also includes our company's commitment to drive real and lasting change, taking affirmative steps to garner support of an anti-racist, diverse, inclusive and equitable culture at covetrus. to drive this change, we have devoted dedicated resources and defined a new global diversity and inclusion governance in community set up inside the organization.
and as part of our path forward, we have made five commitments: first, to have a diverse workforce that is demographically reflective of our society at all levels; second, to do good by changing both covetrus and the industry we work within; three, to foster diversity and inclusion for all employees throughout extensive training across the company; four, to create a workplace of inclusion and belonging with the launch of a new employee resource groups; and fifth, to be transparent and be publicly accountable for a more diverse workforce at all levels like we are doing here today.
this is our initial commitment to not only do good, but to be better, and we will keep you informed of our progress in the quarters and years ahead.
in summary, our foundation is solid, our market positioning is improving, and we continue to make good progress on many of our strategic initiatives, which gives us the added confidence to increase our full year 2021 guidance for organic net sales growth and adjusted ebitda. and i am so proud of the resilience of our team and their desire to drive real and lasting change and to deliver better outcomes for our customers and their clients, which makes me increasingly optimistic about the trajectory of our business and our opportunity moving forward.
i will now turn the call over to matthew to provide more details on the financials.
matthew foulston -- global chief financial officer
thanks, ben. good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today.
i will now review our first quarter 2021 financial results and provide additional details on our positive revision to our 2021 outlook. the focus of my comments will be on our non-gaap results where applicable as these items provide the most insight into the underlying trends impacting our businesses. please refer to today's press release for a more detailed description of our first quarter 2021 gaap results.
as summarized on slide 8, q1 was another strong quarter for covetrus, with 4% year-over-year organic net sales growth and $57 million in adjusted ebitda, both of which eclipsed expectations as we continue to successfully execute against our strategy and deliver strong results in an end market that continues to see above trend growth. this was particularly evident in our north america and apac & emerging markets segments, and in many of our businesses in europe.
as ben mentioned, our continued focus on driving double-digit net sales growth in our portfolio of higher margin technology, e-commerce and proprietary products, which now collectively represent 43% of our consolidated gross profit, also help fuel 70 basis points of year-over-year adjusted ebitda margin expansion during q1.
finally, while our reported net debt to last 12 months adjusted ebitda ratio did increase a modest amount as compared to year-end levels to 3.7 times, given the normal seasonal cash outflows we typically see in our business during q1, our use of cash during the quarter did improve versus the prior year period, and we remain on track to deliver our targeted 30% to 40% adjusted ebitda to free cash flow conversion in 2021.
turning to the details on slide 9, covetrus net sales were approximately $1.1 billion in q1, an increase of 3% year-over-year. organic year-over-year net sales growth was 4% during the first quarter, reflecting a healthy companion animal end market, strong sales execution and continued growth in prescription management. these positive trends were partially offset by the difficult comparison we had in the prior year when we experienced approximately $35 million in inventory stocking that pulled forward demand into q1 out of q2 because of the onset of covid-19, as well as the headwinds previously disclosed in our uk and german markets. excluding these two markets, total company pro forma organic net sales increased 12% year-over-year, highlighting the underlying health of our overall business.
turning to slide 10, consolidated non-gaap adjusted ebitda was $57 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $48 million for the prior year period. the 19% year-over-year improvement reflected positive contributions from all three segments, particularly in north america, as well as a modest fx tailwind which more than offset the impact from the divestiture of scil and growth in overhead as we complete the final build-out of the infrastructure necessary to support our independence as a public company. i would also mention that the covid-19 inventory stocking demand pull forward witnessed in march 2020 created an additional $4 million of adjusted ebitda headwind year-over-year during q1. in other words, the year-over-year improvement in adjusted ebitda was even more impressive than the headline.
moving to our quarterly commentary for our operating segments, beginning on slide 11. north america net sales increased 15% year-over-year in q1 and 16% year-over-year on an organic basis. segment adjusted ebitda increased 27% year-over-year in q1 with segment adjusted ebitda margins expanding 70 basis points versus the prior year. positive leverage of double-digit net sales growth in our supply chain business and mid 30% net sales growth in prescription management contributed to our segment margin expansion during q1.
drilling deeper into north american segment trends, starting on slide 12. our supply chain organic net sales increased 13% year-over-year in q1, reflective of healthy end market demand, our improved market position in distribution and continued momentum in smartpak. supply chain adjusted ebitda increased to $37 million compared to $30 million in the prior year period as the company was able to deliver operating leverage off the robust net sales performance during the first quarter. our north american software business was generally stable from a net sales perspective, but we were able to drive year-over-year gross margin and adjusted ebitda improvement during the quarter due to the mix of revenue delivered in q1.
turning to slide 13, and our prescription management business in north america. during the first quarter of 2021, net sales increased 33% year-over-year to $112 million and we ended the quarter with more than 11,400 practices on the platform. we added approximately 300 net new enrollments during the first quarter of 2021 compared to 200 net additions during the fourth quarter of 2020. our aligned commercial organization helped drive the sequential improvement in net additions and we have a strong funnel of additional prospects heading into the second half of the year.
the 33% year-over-year net sales growth delivered in q1 was modestly ahead of the commentary that we laid out on our q4 earnings conference call back in march, and includes an approximate 300 basis point headwind from a change in corporate policy tied to the recognition of certain manufacturer incentives, which are now reflected as a reduction in cost of goods sold versus previously included as a net sales, and the 400 basis point headwind from two fewer selling days year-over-year.
in other words, the underlying trends in this business remain quite strong. in fact, march 2021 net sales of $46 million increased 40% year-over-year despite the policy change and the challenging comparison created by the beginning of the covid-19 demand spike in the prior year period. while q2 faces an even more difficult year-over-year comparison, our recent results keep us optimistic regarding the trajectory for this business and we remain on track to deliver against our outlook the quarter of first half 2021 prescription management net sales growth to be at the low end of the 30% to 40% forecasted range for the full year year-over-year growth.
same-store prescription management platform net sales, defined as veterinary practices enrolled on the platform in 2019 or earlier, increased 30% year-over-year during q1, which was an acceleration from q4 and full year 2020 levels, aided by the inclusion of our sizable and highly productive 2019 cohort, entering the same store base. all cohorts, once again, experienced double-digit year-over-year net sales growth during the first quarter.
we also continued to make progress in scaling the financial performance of our prescription management business with q1 adjusted ebitda of $6 million, a $2 million improvement versus the prior year. over the last 12 months, and when adjusted for the legal reserve taken in the fourth quarter of 2020, 15% of the year-over-year dollar growth in net sales has converted to adjusted ebitda in our prescription management business. while we certainly faced a challenging year-over-year comparison during q2 for adjusted ebitda in this business given the mismatch of higher revenue and reduced expenses in the prior-year because of covid-19 market dynamics and certain temporary cost actions taken by the company in response to the uncertainty last year, we remain committed to converting at least 15% of the year-over-year dollar growth in net sales to adjusted ebitda for this business for the full year of 2021.
turning to our european business on slide 14. organic net sales decreased 12% year-over-year in q1, reflecting the previously disclosed headwinds in the uk and in germany, and the difficult comps from the prior-year period from covid-19 inventory stocking, which more than offset strength in our business is operating in netherlands, ireland and belgium. we also had very strong performance in our proprietary brands businesses of kruuse and vi, where organic net sales increased double digits year-over-year. encouragingly, we have made good progress in germany in stabilizing our customer base and improving our service levels following the challenged 3pl transition during q4, which gives us confidence we can begin to return to growth in that market in the second half of the year.
turning to profitability, european segment adjusted ebitda in q1 increased 17% year-over-year to $21 million with margins expanding 150 basis points year-over-year to 5.8%. the european team did an outstanding job managing expenses considering the sales challenges in the uk and the business also benefited from the strengthening covetrus branded and proprietary brand sales, which enabled a $3 million year-over-year increase in segment adjusted ebitda despite net sales declining $65 million year-over-year due to the aforementioned headwinds.
moving on to our apac & emerging markets segment on slide 15. our team delivered a 7% year-over-year increase in organic net sales in q1, reflecting another quarter of strong sales execution, particularly in our brazilian and australian markets. we also delivered strong results in proprietary products in our small but rapidly growing business in china. this growth was particularly impressive considering the difficult year-over-year growth comparison from the prior year, which included covid-19 inventory stocking benefits.
gross margins expanded 140 basis points year-over-year in q1 as we continued to make good progress driving our proprietary products. segment adjusted ebitda increased 43% year-over-year during q1 and margins expanded by 150 basis points year-over-year, driven by gross margin improvement and the positive operating leverage from better-than-expected net sales, which more than offset the headwind from the covid-19 inventory stocking benefit that occurred in the prior year.
turning briefly back to our consolidated results, q1 gaap net loss was $16 million, or a loss of $0.11 per diluted share, versus a net loss of $33 million, or a loss of $0.30 per diluted share, in the prior year period. non-gaap adjusted net income, which excludes special items, as well as acquisition-related intangibles, amortization and other items, was $29 million during q1 versus $20 million in the prior year period.
now quickly turning to our balance sheet on slide 16. our reported net leverage at the end of the first quarter was 3.7 times as compared to the 3.5 times at the end of the year. our cash balance was approximately $211 million at march 31, 2021, which was lower compared to $290 million at december 31, 2020, primarily reflecting seasonal cash flow use. we ended q1 with approximately $510 million in available liquidity and with 2.4 times of headroom under our net leverage covenant as defined in our credit agreement. our cash position provides ample financial flexibility to pursue our internal and external growth initiatives, and we remain committed to driving 30% to 40% conversion of adjusted ebitda to free cash flow in 2021.
now turning to our 2021 guidance as outlined on slide 17. we are now forecasting organic net sales growth of 4% to 5% and adjusted ebitda in the range of $245 million to $255 million for 2021, an increase of $5 million from our previous guidance. this outlook reflects stronger results than we originally forecasted in q1 and the momentum we have in many of our markets, which is reflected in the increased organic net sales growth in all three of our segments. this increase is balanced by the uncertainties still lingering associated with the ongoing pandemic.
while we do not provide specific quarterly guidance, we remind investors of the specific cost actions taken in q2 2020 because of the onset of the covid-19 pandemic, as well as the spike in growth in our prescription management business, which alongside recent investments creates a challenging year-over-year comparison for the quarter. with this in mind, we expect q2 2021 adjusted ebitda to be flat to slightly below the prior year levels before returning to year-over-year growth in the second half of the year. our increased full year 2021 adjusted ebitda guidance implies 11% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the outlook and continued steady progress against our long-term adjusted ebitda margin expansion goals.
with that i will now turn the call back over to ben for some brief closing remarks.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, matthew.
in closing, and as outlined on slide 18, we are off to a very strong start in 2021 on the heels of what was a very successful 2020. we have a solid foundation in place and a clear plan to accelerate the contribution of our higher margin businesses. and we are investing heavily in new capabilities to accelerate our growth and deliver against our strategy and believe we are well positioned to drive improved outcomes for our customers and their clients to successfully capitalize on the opportunities ahead. we are in the early innings of delivering against our long-term goals and see a path to significant shareholder value creation as we work to drive growth, expand adjusted ebitda margins and improve free cash flow generation.
this concludes our prepared remarks, and i will now turn the call back over to nick to moderate the q&a session.
nicholas jansen -- vice president, strategy and corporate development
thanks, ben. now, we begin the q&a section of our conference call. we want to take as many questions as possible, so we ask you to limit them to two, and then reenter the queue should you have additional ones. so, yan, please provide instructions, and we are then ready to take the first question.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of john kreger from william blair. your line is now open.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
hey guys, thanks. ben, can just elaborate a little bit more on what your plan is to get europe back into a growth mode? i think matthew just said it's -- you expect it to be down about 10% for the year. do you think it can be sort of comparable to asia or north america next year?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. john, it's a good question. i think if you look at europe, obviously, we have two very specific issues; one in the uk and one in germany. the rest of europe is growing. i think as it relates to those specific issues, germany, i think, we have a light at the end of the tunnel, have resolved our operational issues and are starting to market and acquire -- or reacquire customers, i would say, and expect that that will start to grow here in the back half of the year.
in terms of the uk, that business has stabilized, but isn't going to be a grower here in the short-term until we move into 2022. and of course, i would just probably point out in terms of kind of quality of revenue and value to the business, despite the 12% decrease in revenue, you had a 17% increase in ebitda in the quarter. so, while you're never happy about revenue going the wrong way. certainly from a margin profile and type of revenue, we were happy with our ability to manage the business and get growth in the key areas that are going to provide long-term value to the business.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
great. thanks. and my follow-up is actually you just touched on it, do you think that 5.8% ebitda margin in europe is sustainable as you go through the year and into next year?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i believe so. i mean, again, it really comes down to the mix and the quality of the revenue. so, i mentioned in my prepared remarks, kruuse, vi, proprietary product, technology, all of that is growing. the margin profile of that is obviously significantly higher than, say, distribution revenue in the uk. so, if anything we should have margin expansion over time as the mix changes in europe. and while it won't get to apac or u.s. overnight, that certainly is a long-term aspiration.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
sounds good. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of jon block from stifel. sir, please go ahead.
jonathan block -- stifel, nicolaus & co. -- analyst
great. thanks, and good afternoon. ben, first one for you, slide 4 is just very helpful, and helpful breaking out the gross profit from third-party products versus proprietary. if i remember the slide i think proprietary was 23%-ish of sales and almost 2x the gross profit dollar. so, that seems to be a big part of the story for you guys in where you want to go. are there goals on where you want some of these statistics over the next 12 to 24 months? i know you have the long-term margin aspirations about -- i believe 10% up from almost 2x or 5%. but if we were to get more granular, how do we think about that bar chart maybe evolving in coming quarters?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, absolutely. i would say from an overall margin complexion, we want to certainly be moving into north of 20% next year. and long term, we'd like the proprietary products to make up almost the inverse of what it is today, so 60% versus 40%. while we haven't given a timeframe to get there, we certainly think given the mix of products and the momentum that we have that that is a realistic goal to achieve.
jonathan block -- stifel, nicolaus & co. -- analyst
got it. thanks for that. and matthew, second question for you. the 1q '21 ebitda beat handily [phonetic]. you walked up the guidance, but the corporate still seem like a pretty big anchor, and it seem like the -- i don't even know maybe the raise would have been bigger. but corporate i think was up $8 million year-over-year, if i annualize that, it's like a $30 million drag. and i get it, it could be a little bit chunky. but if i remember correctly, last quarter, you thought corporate wasn't going to be a big step-up in '21 versus '20. is this a timing thing or did something change where corporate is going to be a little bit higher in '21 yet you're still able to walk up the guide? thanks, guys.
matthew foulston -- global chief financial officer
yeah. no, great question. and there's some complexity within there and you absolutely shouldn't multiply it by four. there's two things in there. one is, there is a combination of $2 million of fx on into co-notes [phonetic], which you should view as one-time and not repeating, and could easily go the other way on us. and then secondly, there was about $1.5 million of short-term incentive. this year, we think we have a pretty good line of sight to delivering on our internal commitments. as you can imagine, last year, our outlook was quite a bit rockier and firmed up as we got deeper into covid, so we hadn't accrued quite as much. so, getting on for half of that eight is unique circumstantial.
jonathan block -- stifel, nicolaus & co. -- analyst
perfect. thanks for the color.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of nathan rich from goldman sachs. your line is now open.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, good afternoon, and thanks for the questions. matt, if i could maybe start with your commentary on the prescription management business, it seems like there are a couple of moving pieces that i just wanted to clarify. i think you had said there was an accounting change in terms of how you -- or where you place manufacturer incentives, it was about 300 basis points drag to the prescription management growth and then another 400 basis point impact from the two fewer selling days. so, normalizing for that would something closer to 40% be, how we should be thinking about the growth of that business in the quarter? and i think you said march was a little bit north of that 40% range as well. so, i just wanted to make sure i understood the moving pieces there.
and then on margins for that business, could you talk about how we should be thinking about the trajectory going forward? it seems like the margins have been around 5% to 6% the past few quarters. do we start to see that accelerate, given that you've been investing a lot to support the growth of that business, maybe as you leverage those investments over the next several quarters, should we see that margin improving? thank you.
matthew foulston -- global chief financial officer
yeah. let me take them in the order you posed them, and you've got it completely right. the growth as reported was 33%. we moved some manufacturer incentives from revenue to cogs prospectively. we didn't go back and adjust the prior periods, because of all the workload for relatively small impact to the total business. so, that was a 300 basis point drag, and the two selling days was about 400 basis points. so, like-for-like, it was a 40% quarter, which we're extremely happy with. and then when you look -- go back to the 33% we reported, it grew really strongly through the quarter. started out slow, and ended terrifically in march with 40%, even with the accounting drag in that number. so, we were super pleased with that.
pivoting to the margins, when you look at profits in that business sequentially, they were pretty much flat. and we took a decision late in the quarter to make some very discrete investments that we knew weren't going to pay back in the period, but with the extra -- what's the right word, granularity and precision with which we are targeting where we spend the money, we think the returns on it are going to be phenomenal. so, it was a sort of late in quarter decision. we put about $1.3 million of extra investment and that dragged down the margin a bit. so, we just see a lot of runway ahead here. and we think the growth is very valuable rather than driving the margin up in the short term. so, we're going to constantly be fighting that balance, but generally within that commitment to drop 15% of the incremental revenue down to ebitda.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thank you. if i could just ask a quick one, shifting to the north america distribution business, another quarter of strong growth, i think up 13%. obviously, the market has been very strong as well. but just be curious to get your view on how you're performing relative to the market? and what's driving that growth? and how we should think about the outlook over the balance of the year as the comps do get tougher in the back half?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i'll give some qualitative feedback, nathan. so, i think you're right. very strong growth. our channel checks and i think from third-party data shows us picking up market share vis-a-vis the competition. i think what's driving that is the all-in holistic solution that we provide. we clearly are the only company that brings together distribution, software, compounding, prescription management under one roof. and as we more and more focus on driving a better outcome, whether that be a healthcare outcome or a business outcome for the vet, i think that we're going to see more and more consolidation bias in the marketplace going forward.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks for the questions.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of erin wright from credit suisse. please go ahead.
erin wright -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks. kind of a broader question on the prescription management business. and as we exit the pandemic here and we think about changing behavior potentially at the consumer purchasing level, what are you doing differently potentially to enhance engagement across vfc? and did you get specifically -- and sorry if i missed this, did you get specifically what your anticipated growth rate is for that business embedded in your guidance for the year? thanks.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so, just taking the second question first, we said that 30% to 40% year-over-year growth was our anticipated guidance, and obviously, we're right smack in the middle of that in q1.
in terms of the changing dynamic, i think when you look at the prescription management business, you really have to look at the two sides of the coin; what's going on with the veterinarian, and what's going on with the consumer. the veterinary, as we do a better and better job of selling value and extending the revenue opportunity for a vet outside the clinic, we're getting more and more activation within those practices. so, we saw a pretty nice uptick in terms of the number of practices that were proactively prescribing, marketing and adopting the platform in the last quarter or so, and we expect that to continue.
in terms of the consumer, we really see no going back on that front. clearly, they value the convenience, whether that being able to communicate with their vet online or get something shipped to their home, whether that be a parasiticide or compounded medication, then we don't expect that trend to slow down in any way. and as we continue to invest and focus, i think matthew outlined in some of his remarks, in our ability to refine how we market and communicate with the consumer, we think we're just going to get better and better at those consumer initiated prescriptions and the retention of those consumers over time.
erin wright -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. and then just elaborating on that a little bit more. i mean, can you speak to some of the opportunity around like the technology solution in terms of built-in e-prescribing capability at avimark? and will that be meaningful for you in terms of increasing customer engagement overall?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, absolutely. if you look at our product roadmap, again, whether it's on-prem solutions or in the cloud or with appointment management, it's all about bringing these things together in a holistic solution that -- whether that be for the customer or the consumer. so, we announced recently the full rollout of prescription management embedded into avimark, and that's just makes it one less step, one less obstacle for the veterinarian when driving in e-prescription. and that -- things like making recommended medication choices available to the vet, one-stop shopping for the consumer based on their pims data, all of the integration or the synchronization of those solutions, we believe is making it more and more compelling for both the vet and the pet parent.
erin wright -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of elliot wilbur from raymond james. please go ahead.
elliot wilbur -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon. question for ben i guess. with respect to the gross profit contribution from your higher margin segments technology, e-commerce and proprietary products, looks like the margin there is about 35% roughly. can you provide some specific commentary in terms of the relative contribution of the branded products portfolio and compounding businesses versus the tech and e-commerce? and then just thinking about the longer-term contribution from your new 503b compounding facility, i don't know if you've ever talked about sort of what you think the incremental revenue opportunity associated with that, but maybe just some commentary there with respect to capacity, technical capabilities and how that business once it's scale could impact the overall margin profile of your higher margin segments? thanks.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. you're welcome. elliot, can you ask the question again? i'm little -- i just want to make sure i'm answering the right question in terms of -- were you asking about the split of gross profit between technology and proprietary brands or the different margin profiles?
elliot wilbur -- raymond james -- analyst
specifically, different margin profiles. differential between the branded products/compounding versus tech and e-commerce, and ultimately where that could go as the compounding facility starts to become a bigger contributor to the overall revenue picture?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure thing. so, i'll kind of break out a couple of different profiles -- types of things. and i would say these are illustrative just because as you get into the detail at a sku level, it can start to vary. but you've got prescription management that is roughly around 30% gross margins. you've got end-to-end margin of a branded product like a kruuse closer to 40% plus. you've got compounding 50% plus, and technology even a slight nudge about that in the 55% to 60%. and so obviously there's different growth rates and different market opportunities for those things. but the whole blend -- the mix obviously is substantially better than third-party distribution.
in terms of the 503b facility and the new investment in grandview or phoenix, arizona, we really believe that that could be a game changer for the compounding business [indecipherable] front. from an operation standpoint, our level of efficiency and capacity and quality control goes way up. so order to ship, ability to innovate, ability to scale with that business just improves immensely. and i think from a customer and marketing -- customer satisfaction standpoint, people can know that not only are we keeping up with the regulatory requirements and side of that business, but we're going to really have a best of breed solution out in the marketplace. so, we're extremely excited for that investment. they start paying dividends here in the back half of 2021.
nicholas jansen -- vice president, strategy and corporate development
operator, you can move to the next question.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of david westenberg from guggenheim. your line is now open.
david westenberg -- guggenheim -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking the question. i want to talk a little bit -- i think it's kind of continuation of erin's question on the prescription management business. you are about to lap some just very interesting comps, and it's just hard for me to get really comfortable just around growth rates in the back half of the year, just given the fact that there has such strange comps. i don't mean to give kind of quarterly -- ask for kind of quarterly guidance here, but is there any way you can give any kind of commentary around what happened late march, early april as we lap this kind of very strange unique circumstance in the prescription management business? because, i mean, obviously everyone was ordering everything online at the time. you did highlight 300 new additional accounts. but it would just be interesting to hear this as we -- just see sort of the lapping of that strange behavior.
matthew foulston -- global chief financial officer
yeah. let me take a crack at that, and then ben may want to weigh in. if you go back to q2 of last year, the year-over-year growth in prescription management was 66%. so make no mistake, lapping that is going to be a challenge. if you take our comment about the annual growth between 30% and 40%, the way we see the first half together is at the low end of that range, and we see the second half at the high end of that range. so you can probably triangulate what we think the second quarter is going to be like, and it's going to be a struggle with that kind of comp.
david westenberg -- guggenheim -- analyst
got it. okay. all right. i'll take it as -- that's great. i appreciate the extra commentary. on the initiatives, you talked about the consumer marketing effort. i think of covetrus or legacy vets first choice is kind of the back end of prescription management where you're kind of marketing for the veterinarian. you kind of in that slide, i think, said something around the lines of increasing awareness in pet parents. is that increasing awareness of your brand specifically? can you give us a little bit more color on that brand engagement as for that you're doing? just given the fact that like i think of traditionally as vets first choice around that paradigm is kind of vets first choice like the pushing the brand to the veterinarian. so, is there been any kind of change in that paradigm? and kind of what are you doing with that marketing effort? and why you think that's going to have such a good roi? thank you.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. no, nothing has changed. we're always working on behalf of our customers, the veterinarian. but what i would say is that if you look at the total prescriptions, the majority of them are what we call consumer initiated. so, there is an outbound communication or marketing to the consumer, the consumer requests -- makes the purchase request for script versus a proactive prescription that's coming out of the pims at point of care to the consumer from the vet. so, when we talked about consumer marketing what we're really referencing is marketing on behalf of the vet to the pet parents to drive awareness, engagement and eventually conversion.
david westenberg -- guggenheim -- analyst
got it. thank you very much for taking questions.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of balaji prasad from barclays. please go ahead.
balaji prasad -- barclays -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. so, just following up on the earlier question -- your explanation of the cadence of growth for prescription management was helpful. can you remind us of the drivers of ebitda margin in this segment? and as you lap the higher end of the range for h2, how should we think about ebitda margins for this -- for the segment?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think on a long-term basis, we think about 15% to 20% flow through to ebitda on a trailing 12 month basis. and the reason we talk about trailing 12 month is because, as matthew mentioned in his prepared remarks, there can be times where we decide opportunistically to heavy up on marketing, because we think we can acquire a consumer to say an autoship program in a very profitable way, and so that might take down margin in the period, but pays dividend in the long-term. so, we're really balancing growth and profitability in this business to exit q1 at a 40% year-over-year growth rate, and to basically be at a $500 million plus run rate already and growing 30% to 40% is impressive. but we think we're really at the beginning of the journey there. and so, we don't want to sub-optimize a business by squeezing out too much profit when we think there's a lot of consumer activity to go acquire here in the next couple of year period.
matthew foulston -- global chief financial officer
i think the other thing is, when we look at the stickiness of these customers and these cohorts, they go all the way back to 2012 and we're still getting double-digit growth. the value of the customer acquisition versus the short-term margin is pretty clear to us.
balaji prasad -- barclays -- analyst
understood. and in your other remarks you called out market share gains in the distribution business. is there any quantitative numbers that you can provide to us there?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
i think somewhere in the 50 bps range is what we would be thinking. again, it's a bit qualitative from market tax and third-party data. but i think if you just go and look at maybe some of our competitors' public announcements and look at our north america growth versus theirs, i think that's another way of triangulating that data.
balaji prasad -- barclays -- analyst
understood. thank you.

i would now like to turn the conference over to your host, mr. brian mcdonald, vice president of financial planning and analysis. please go ahead, sir.
brian mcdonald -- vice president of financial planning and analysis
thank you, grace. good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for covetrus' q2 2021 earnings conference call. joining me on this afternoon's call are ben wolin, our president and chief executive officer; and matthew foulston, our executive vice president and chief financial officer. ben and matthew will begin with prepared remarks, and then we will be happy to take your questions. during today's conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. all statements other than statements of historical facts made during this conference call are forward-looking, including statements regarding management's expectations for future financial business, operational performance and operating expenditures. forward-looking statements may be identified with words such as will, expect, believe, should, or similar terminology and the negative of these terms. forward-looking statements are not promises or guarantees of future performance and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in these forward-looking statements.

with that, i'll now turn it over to ben to provide highlights beginning on slide three.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, brian. good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. i hope everyone is safe and well. before jumping in, i just wanted to recognize that brian has replaced nick jansen for the day. nick and his wife are delivering a baby today, and we're wishing nick and katy a happy and healthy day. we're thinking of you. now on to the business. i have four items to discuss with you on the call today: one, the health of our business as reflected in our solid q2 results; the progress we are making in executing our strategy and driving growth within our higher-margin products and services; the enthusiasm and long-term opportunity we have in wellness plan administration through our recent acquisition of the market-leading platform, vcp; and fourth, highlights from the company's first-ever esg report that was also released today. as you can tell, we have a packed agenda for the call this afternoon, so i will dive right into some of our recent highlights, starting on slide three. overall, q2 marked another strong quarter for covetrus, where we delivered 12% year-over-year non-gaap organic net sales growth and $66 million in non-gaap adjusted ebitda, both of which were a bit ahead of the expectations we have outlined on our q1 earnings conference call in early may. our team executed very well, and we once again improved our market position and advanced our value proposition to our veterinary practice customers and their clients in what remains a healthy but dynamic end market. and all of this was done in the face of the unknowns tied to the reopening of the global economy and the impact on consumer behavior and the supply chain in what is also an increasingly tight labor market, which remains a real challenge. importantly, we continued to make good progress during q2, executing against our product road map and advancing our strategic objectives.
for example, we launched an sms or a text-based reminder notification service for pet parents who received a prescription from their veterinary practice. and we also streamlined the e-prescribing experience for our market-leading practice management software solutions. we also added another net 300 practices to our prescription management platform and delivered a 17% sequential increase in net sales and $5 million sequential increase in non-gaap adjusted ebitda versus q1 in prescription management. while prescription management's year-over-year growth rates were modestly below our aggressive aspirations that were set back in january, which was before the significant supply chain difficulties in the diet space, which i'll touch on later, i think it is important to recognize that these sales have nearly doubled over the last two years and actually accelerated on a two-year stack basis to 85% during the second quarter, highlighting our execution and our leadership position. i remain extremely enthusiastic on the opportunity we have in front of us in the context of what is still a vibrant and growing pet prescription end market and the role we can play in helping veterinarians improve clinical and business outcomes for their practice. we also announced in q2 and subsequently closed in q3 our acquisition of vcp, the market-leading veterinary software platform for wellness and care plan administration. we see tremendous opportunity to accelerate and scale this solution inside of covetrus.
finally, we continue to bring new talent into the organization, which we believe will further accelerate our transformation efforts, including several senior roles over the last several months such as bekki kidd as head of north american operations and global operational excellence; andras bolcskei as president, international; and drew coxhead as vice president, corporate controller and chief accounting officer. overall, i'm very energized by the talent we are attracting as we build upon our leadership position in veterinary healthcare solutions. and this opportunity can be best summarized in how we are still in the early innings in driving growth and a positive shift in our business toward our higher-margin products and services, as seen on slide four. during q2, we delivered double-digit year-over-year growth in net sales and gross profit in these categories, and i was particularly pleased with the results achieved in our covetrus-branded and proprietary brands during the second quarter. the collective growth rate of these products and services continued at a pace faster than our overall portfolio, and these products and services now represent 43% of the company's gross profit or a 200 basis point increase versus the prior year and a 600 basis point improvement versus 2019 pro forma levels. we expect this positive shift to continue as our strategic accounts across our segments build momentum, and we see a pathway to more than 50% of the company's gross profit tied to these higher margin products and services over the next 18 to 24 months. this team is doing a great job.
turning to slide five. given the significant opportunity in our covetrus-branded and proprietary brand product portfolio and the anticipated benefit that this growing contribution will make to the company's profitability, i thought it would be useful to investors to share some additional color on these products, highlight our recent financial progress during the second quarter and key areas of focus for the company as we think about the second half of 2021 and beyond. our increased focus on covetrus-branded products during the second half of last year is starting to drive tangible financial progress in 2021 with non-gaap organic net sales for these products increasing 21% year-over-year during the second quarter. this includes an even more impressive 25% year-over-year non-gaap organic net sales growth rate in north america, partly driven by the organizational changes we made last year. we are optimistic that we can deliver continued strong growth during the second half of the year in our covetrus-branded products, driven by the ramp-up and launch of 75 new products globally this year, including several that are now available through our prescription management platform in north america, emphasizing the synergies between all aspects of our business. we are also entering a couple of new, high-growth geographies in 2021, which we believe can further enhance our opportunities in the years ahead. the company's portfolio of proprietary brands, which includes kruuse, vi and calibra, also saw strong adoption during the second quarter with non-gaap organic net sales growth of 13% year-over-year, a continuation of recent positive trends.
this growth is being supported by strong commercial execution, and we anticipate new product introductions and geographic expansion to drive further growth. we also continue to actively explore m&a and partnership opportunities in this area as we seek to leverage our unique channel access and scale to accelerate growth. and turning to compounding. we delivered double-digit year-over-year net sales growth during the second quarter of 2021, and with the recent opening of our new, state-of-the-art compounding and 503b outsourcing facility in phoenix, arizona this may and the launch of our new e-commerce platform and integration with third-party ordering sites, we are well positioned to build upon our opportunity as we drive innovation and leverage our customer relationships and membership organizations. moving now to slide six. i'm extremely excited about our recently completed acquisition of vcp, the market leader in veterinary wellness and care plan administration software. as many of you are aware, now more than ever, pet owners need help budgeting for pet care and treatment, and veterinarians are looking for ways to drive compliance, strengthen their relationship with their clients and offer innovative plan solution for all types of treatment needs based on best practices, and that is where vcp comes in. vcp has built a proprietary wellness plan management solution, providing a comprehensive, end-to-end technology platform that simplifies and enables the process of creating, launching and managing a wellness program at the practice. vcp's innovative wellness technology and proprietary business of wellness process enables veterinary practice customers in launching successful wellness solutions, care plans and lifestyle programs for their pet parent clientele.
the practices adopting the vcp platform report up to a 10% revenue growth in the first year with significant increases in spending pet -- spending per pet over time. and the pet parents adopting these plans value the convenience and customization of the programs, which has led to strengthened relationship with their veterinarian. vcp is currently experiencing strong demand and has a growing customer base of more than 1,000 veterinary clinics with more than 350,000 pets on plan. importantly, we currently have a large backlog of signed but not yet onboarded clinics and a significant pipeline of new opportunities, providing visibility into double-digit growth and high-margin recurring revenue in 2022 and beyond. what's even more exciting to us is that this is all before the uplift we anticipate from vcp joining forces with covetrus as we leverage our customer relationships and membership organizations and build a unique platform that can integrate practice management software, prescription management and wellness into one offering for the practice. by accelerating the adoption of and enhancing the impact from wellness and care plan, we believe we will drive enhanced clinical outcomes, empower veterinarians to run better businesses and deliver an unparalleled experience for the pet parent. we will speak more to this opportunity in the quarters ahead as we work to execute our strategy and deliver the anticipated synergies.
finally, on slide seven, i wanted to turn investor attention to covetrus' first-ever esg report, which was also released this afternoon. just over two years ago, covetrus was established as a new company. the company was the result of a merger of a collection of animal health businesses from around the world, many with their own sustainability initiatives and corporate social responsibility commitments. now as one unified company, we are bringing a more comprehensive focus to our esg efforts. our initial progress is demonstrated in today's report through stories of our team's actions around the globe, including our covid-19 response for our employees, customers, pets and pet owners; a commitment to sustainability to continuous improvement and reduction in plastic consumption; the launch of the diversity and inclusion program; and support for animals around the world. we aspire to lead in everything that we do. this report is both a celebration of where we are today as well as a commitment to where we are going, and we are just getting started. in summary, i'm so pleased with the progress the company has made during the first half of 2021, and i'm energized by the opportunity that still lies ahead as we continue to execute against our strategy. while there's still plenty of work to do as we drive forward our transformation in what remains a dynamic end market, i am confident in our value proposition and market position and anticipate that we will continue to build upon our momentum in the second half of 2021 and beyond.
i will now turn the call over to matthew to provide details on the financials.
matthew foulston -- global chief financial officer
thanks, ben. good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. i will now review our second quarter 2021 financial results and provide additional commentary on our full year expectations. the focus of my comments will be on our non-gaap results, where applicable, as these items provide the most insight into the underlying trends impacting our businesses. please refer to today's press release for a more detailed description of our second quarter 2021 gaap financial results. additionally, where applicable, we have also provided financial comparisons for our second quarter 2021 results to the second quarter of 2019, given the lumpiness of our performance created by the covid-19 pandemic during the second quarter of 2020. as ben mentioned and summarized on slide nine, q2 was another solid quarter for covetrus with 12% year-over-year non-gaap organic net sales growth and $66 million in non-gaap adjusted ebitda, which represented a 5% year-over-year increase. we are pleased with our overall performance, which exceeded expectations, particularly given the unknowns we faced and, during the quarter, tied to the global economy reopening during q2 and the challenging year-over-year comparison we had. as a reminder, last year's results benefited from the covid-19-driven spike in demand in our prescription management service, which led to a 66% year-over-year growth in low sales during the prior year period and the significant cost-reduction actions we took across our global footprint that approximated $4 million in temporary benefit in anticipation of the uncertainties created by the onset of the covid-19 pandemic.
as we previously discussed, those temporarily lower costs were progressively reinstated to near prior levels when the impact from covid-19 on our overall business ended up being less severe than originally anticipated. importantly, our growth in non-gaap adjusted ebitda and the $47 million in free cash flow generated during q2 led to a sequential improvement in our net debt-to-ltm non-gaap adjusted ebitda ratio of 3.6 times at the end of q2 2021. now turning to the details on slide 10. covetrus net sales were $1.2 billion in q2, an increase of 16% year-over-year. non-gaap organic year-over-year net sales growth was 12%, reflecting healthy companion animal end market demand trends across many of the company's markets compared to the covid-19 disruption experienced in the prior year period and solid sales execution across many of our global markets. the previously disclosed challenges in our u.k. and german markets continued to negatively impact year-over-year results, although these trends have relatively stabilized as compared to q1 activity. turning to slide 11. non-gaap adjusted ebitda was $66 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $63 million in the prior year period. the 5% year-over-year improvement reflected positive contributions from all three reporting segments as well as a modest fx tailwind, which more than offset growth in corporate overhead and the reversal of the temporary covid-19-related cost actions implemented last year.
non-gaap adjusted ebitda margins were 5.6% during q2, a 50 basis point year-over-year decline, which is primarily a reflection of the temporary cost actions taken last year and the spike in prescription management demand, as discussed. compared to q2 2019 levels, non-gaap adjusted ebitda margins increased 50 basis points, reflecting the margin benefit as we drive growth in our higher-margin products and services. additionally, when we compare to q1 2021, our non-gaap adjusted ebitda margins improved 40 basis points. moving to our operating segments, beginning on slide 12. north america net sales increased 18% year-over-year in q2 on both the reported and non-gaap organic basis. segment adjusted ebitda increased 7% year-over-year in q2 with segment adjusted ebitda margins declining 80 basis points versus the prior year, again, a reflection of the temporary covid-19 cost actions taken in 2020 and the elevated contribution in the prior year from the spike in prescription management demand at a time when we also paused investments due to covid-19 uncertainty. north america segment margins expanded 50 basis points versus the second quarter of 2019 and 10 basis points versus the first quarter of 2021, reflecting the growing contribution from prescription management and covetrus-branded products. drilling deeper into north american segment trends, starting on slide 13.
our supply chain non-gaap organic net sales increased 19% year-over-year in q2, reflective of healthy companion animal end market demand, our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year market share growth in distribution, along with continued strength at smartpak. supply chain non-gaap adjusted ebitda increased to $42 million for the quarter compared to $37 million in the prior year period with a strong top line growth, partially offset by the reversal of the temporary cost-reduction actions implemented last year. our software services was stable during the second quarter, while we continued to invest in building our next-generation, cloud-based practice management technology solutions. turning to slide 14 and our prescription management business in north america. the second quarter faced some unique comparative challenges given the demand spike last year tied to initial covid-19 lockdowns that drove a 66% year-over-year increase in sales in q2 2020; and the evolving consumer behavior this year tied to the reopening of the economy. additionally, supply chain constraints for certain product categories, particularly diet food, continues to be a source of pressure. while net sales fell modestly short of the aspirational growth assumptions set in early 2021, primarily during the month of may, net sales of $131 million still increased 19% year-over-year in q2 or 22% when excluding the 300 basis point headwind from our changing corporate policy related to how we recognize and report certain manufacturer incentives, which are now included as a reduction to cost of goods sold. additionally, on a sequential basis, q2 net sales increased 17% and notably are now nearly double where they were just two years ago.
on a two-year stacked growth basis, which we believe is a better way to look at performance, given last year's 66% comp, our growth rate was 85% and actually accelerated versus recent trends, highlighting the positive fundamentals we are seeing in the business with june marking our highest month of prescription management net sales in company history. additionally, we added another 300 net new enrollments during q2, and we ended june with more than 11,700 practices on the platform, demonstrating the continuing demand for our services. for the first six months of 2021, prescription management net sales were up 25% year-over-year or approximately 29% year-over-year, excluding the accounting change. these results include an estimated $5 million to $10 million headwind tied to certain diet constraints, which has resulted in an increase in canceled shipments, given the backorder issues and production challenges at some of the major veterinary diet food suppliers. with this headwind likely to continue through the balance of the year and acknowledging the inherent volatility of the overall e-commerce market alongside the reopening of the economy, we now estimate prescription management net sales to approximate $508 million to $528 million for 2021 or 20% to 25% year-over-year growth, which is equal to 28% to 33%, excluding the accounting change. this range includes the anticipated impact of certain growth initiatives and the contribution from recent enrollments in the second half of the year and is balanced by the negative impact from supply chain disruption in diets in this quarter. turning to profitability. q2 prescription management non-gaap adjusted ebitda was $11 million, which was flat versus the prior year as we lapped a period when there was a significant spike in demand without a corresponding increase in client acquisition costs or in operating expenses, given the initial uncertainties tied with covid-19.
i would point out that we did increase non-gaap adjusted ebitda by $5 million as compared to last quarter on a $19 million sequential increase in net sales, highlighting the scalability of the business as net sales continue to track higher. overall, for 2021, we remain focused on converting approximately 15% of the year-over-year dollar growth in prescription management net sales to non-gaap adjusted ebitda, recognizing we do have to overcome duplicate costs in 2021 tied to the launching of the new pharmacy in phoenix as well as the incremental challenges we are currently experiencing in veterinary diet foods. turning to our europe business segment on slide 15. non-gaap organic net sales increased 1% year-over-year in q2, reflecting healthy underlying companion animal end market demand and easier comparisons from the prior year due to covid-19, primarily offset by the previously disclosed year-over-year headwinds we have experienced in our u.k. and german markets. our businesses operating in ireland, the netherlands and czech republic were notable contributors to the quarter, and as ben mentioned, we also had very strong performance in our proprietary brands businesses, our kruuse and vi, where non-gaap organic sales again increased by double digits year-over-year. turning to profitability. despite only a modest increase in non-gaap organic net sales year-over-year, our europe segment adjusted ebitda in q2 increased 25% year-over-year to $20 million with margins expanding 80 basis points year-over-year to 5.5%. the european team delivered another quarter of disciplined expense management, considering the sales challenges in the u.k. and germany, and the segment benefited from the strength of higher-margin, covetrus-branded and proprietary brand sales, as i just described. moving on to our apac & emerging markets segment on slide 16. our team delivered a 16% year-over-year increase in non-gaap organic net sales in q2, reflecting another quarter of strong sales execution on top of what was an easier comparison from the prior year due to the covid-19 impact. brazil, new zealand and australia all delivered notable year-over-year growth during the second quarter.
segment adjusted ebitda increased 80% year-over-year during q2, and segment adjusted ebitda margins expanded by 200 basis points year-over-year, driven by positive gross margin trends and the ongoing operating leverage from better-than-expected net sales, which more than offset the reversal of temporary cost actions taken in the prior year alongside the initial outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic. now turning to our balance sheet on slide 17. our net leverage at the end of q2 was 3.6 times as compared to 3.7 times at the end of q1. our cash balance of $230 million at the end of june was $19 million higher than march 31, 2021, primarily reflecting positive free cash flow generation during the second quarter, which more than offset the $23 million in combined cash outflows primarily tied to the buyout of our brazilian minority partners during q2 and the final payment tied to last year's formation of distrivet. we ended q2 with $529 million in available liquidity and with approximately two turns of headroom under our net leverage covenant, as defined in our credit agreement. we expect our cash balance to decrease modestly in q3 tied to our acquisition of vcp in july, but we believe that our liquidity and net leverage ratio will improve in q4 as we grow non-gaap adjusted ebitda in the second half of the year and generate additional cash in line with our available seasonality. now turning to our 2021 guidance, as outlined on slide 18. we are now forecasting non-gaap organic net sales growth of 5% to 6%, 100 basis point improvement versus our prior forecast.
this increased net sales forecast factors in our strength in q2, and the positive end-market conditions that have continued across many of our markets against a slower recovery in our u.k. business and the modest reduction in our prescription management net sales discussed previously. looking at non-gaap adjusted ebitda. our outlook remains unchanged, and we continue to forecast a range of $245 million to $255 million, which represents 11% year-over-year growth at the midpoint and steady progress against our long-term margin-expansion objectives. an extremely tight labor market; increasing inflation; supply chain disruption in certain product categories, particularly diets; and general uncertainties tied to covid-19 reopening are offsetting the positive earnings contribution from the higher non-gaap organic net sales growth forecast. as i take a step back and look at where the company stands today versus where we were less than two years ago, i see a business in 2021 with non-gaap adjusted ebitda that is forecasted to be 25% higher than 2019 despite navigating the challenges of the global pandemic, withstanding a significant increase in certain corporate costs tied to becoming a stand-alone public entity while still investing in our capabilities to drive our technology road map. our team has a lot to be proud of, and i am optimistic on the opportunity in front of us to create additional shareholder value as we work to drive net sales growth, expand non-gaap adjusted ebitda margins and improve free cash flow generation.
with that, i will now turn the call back over to ben for some brief closing remarks.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, matthew, and i want to echo all the points you just made. our team executed very well in q2, and it's a lot to be proud of. in closing and outlined on slide 19 of the presentation, we have a solid foundation in place and are investing in our platform to sustain momentum. we have secured new business and are making good progress on driving our strategic initiatives, including increasing the contributions in the company's higher-margin products and services. we are also investing in talent, wellness, proprietary brands and our next-generation software road map to accelerate our opportunity. we remain in the early innings of driving toward the company's long-term potential and are poised to deliver shareholder value as we execute against our strategic plan.
this concludes our prepared remarks, and i will now turn the call back over to brian to moderate the q&a session.
brian mcdonald -- vice president of financial planning and analysis
thanks, ben. now we begin the q&a section of our conference call. so grace, please provide instructions, and we're then ready to take the first question.

operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of john kreger from william blair. your line is open.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
thanks very much guys. ben, can you maybe just, now that we're a year beyond that sort of initial surge of prescription management, kind of reflect on what has been sticky and what has been proven to be a little bit more temporary and, sort of as a result of that, what you view the kind of longer-term growth outlook for prescription management? is it still sort of in that 30% range?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, john. good to hear from you. i think as we look at the business, we continue to see lots of positive momentum and data points. initiatives like integrating prescription management into pims is clearly starting to pay dividends. it's still early days, but what we see in terms of proactive prescriptions that come right out of pims at the point of care is starting to drive some velocity in the business. we've also added a bunch of new accounts, which will pay dividends in the future years. i think in terms of the short-term challenges, i think a lot of it really is external to the business. the end market has remained robust. the interest from customers and consumers remain robust. we definitely had challenges on the supply chain and the diet space, probably to the tune of $10 million in q2, and we definitely are anticipating that to continue in the back half of the year. i think if it weren't for that, we'd probably still be in that 30% to 40% growth range but just to be cognizant of the challenges that is going on in that category, and i think it also got referenced by some of our competitors as a headwind. we feel good about it. but even absent that headwind, which hopefully is short lived, we feel really good about the position of the business.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
great. and a quick follow-up, germany. can you give us a sense of where you think that stands? and -- or any sign that you're starting to reclaim any lost share?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i think q2, we got back to the service levels that we were premigration and that are on par with the rest of europe. so we feel really good now about the foundation. commercial activity is starting to be turned on really now that the foundation is there. but i don't think it's showing up in the numbers quite yet, and we anticipate that to start to show up in q4 and heading into 2022. and as a reminder, of course, we lap that event in october of this year.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of balaji prasad from barclays. your line is open sir.
balaji prasad -- barclays -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. thanks for taking the question. maybe first one -- two questions from my side. firstly, on the prescription management side. you had -- i think you had mentioned last quarter that you exited 1q at around 40% y-o-y growth and that march was at 46% y-o-y. so how did things shape up since then? and was there any element of pull-forward from 1q from 2q? and just asking also in the context of the revised guidance for the prescription management business. i was expecting that since the integration of pims with prescription management, you may probably see better or accelerated revenue growth. while i understand it's not going to be immediate, but the second half of the year seems to be slower than expectations.
matthew foulston -- global chief financial officer
yes. balaji, this is matthew. let me start by talking about the fourth -- second quarter growth. and i don't think we really saw any timing issue between first and second quarter, but what i think is really important to do is take a look at that two-year stack because the comp is so difficult last year when we were up 66%. so if you take a peek at slide 14 in the deck, you'll see that our two-year stack growth was actually 85%, which represented an acceleration from q1 and, in fact, where we've been in q4 and q3. so i think it was a solid quarter, not quite as good as we thought, but as ben mentioned, we faced a pretty tough headwind on the diet front. and a lot of diets from autoship, and when you lose the autoship, it's kind of gone for a while. it's not like a normal supply constraint, but the supply comes back on. so we've got to work hard to win those back. and then if i pivot to full year. last time, we're guiding in a range of $528 million to $568 million, so $548 million at the midpoint. we've now reduced that to $508 million to $520 million. so we've basically taken $30 million out of the year. $10 million of that is what has happened in q2, and what we've effectively modeled here is that, that repeats itself in q3 and q4, all around the uncertainty of the client situation.
balaji prasad -- barclays -- analyst
and maybe also just a follow-up there. can you describe the major categories now available on prescription management? and are there any opportunities for you to introduce newer categories there?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yes. absolutely. i think as you kind of look out further into the trajectory of the business, there's kind of two vectors that we'll focus on. one is using our access to the consumer through the vet, of course, and doing exactly what you're saying, providing new opportunities to buy products beyond, say, preventatives and diet, and we've started to do that. but it's very early days, and there's absolutely opportunity. so you would start to see that maybe average order value go up or the number of purchases that happen in a period of time. so that definitely is an area of focus of the business. it hasn't been historically, but it will be. the second is really using the technology access that we have to integrate prescription management. so we talked a bit about it on the pims side. wellness is obviously a key area that we're driving at. so as we go into '22 and '23, we would expect those offerings to be really very connected, one consumer experience with the vet regardless of how you're interacting with them. so lots of opportunities to expand share of wallet and strengthen the vet-to-pet bond as we move forward.
balaji prasad -- barclays -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. next up, we have katie tryhane from credit suisse. your line is open.
katie tryhane -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. can you speak to the underlying drivers of strength across the north america supply chain this quarter? and how have you evolved your strategy to drive these market share gains over the past couple of years? and then from there, i mean how should we think about the second half prospects for that business and some of the key factors embedded in your guide?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
sure thing. thank you for the question. so first is obviously just strong end market growth. i think you see that among us and all of our peers in the category. in terms of picking up market share, which we've continued to do, it's clearly coming from two kind of main areas of focus from the business. one was our decision to unify our sales force and have one face the customer. that's starting to pay dividends, and it's really continuing to accelerate across the business. second is we have an unparalleled collection of assets. there is no player in north america that can walk into a customer and say, ""we can help you on distribution and logistics, proprietary brands, compounding, pims, prescription management and now wellness."" and as you know from probably talking to customers, they have a lot on their plate, and someone can come in and connect all of these different offerings and not just make it easier to be serviced but have really an interoperable environment between them. you really have an opportunity to move the needle on behalf of your customer and for covetrus.
katie tryhane -- credit suisse -- analyst
yeah, thank you referencing.
operator
moving on, we also have a question from jon block from stifel. your line is open.
tom stephan -- stifel -- analyst
great. hey, guys. this is tom stephan on for jon. if i can start off with prescription management maybe next year. i understand you're working through this year some of the double road costs with the compounding facilities, and then there's been spend around software integration. i guess around 2022, is there incremental spend we should be mindful of? or do you think we can start to basically see some leverage return to the business?
matthew foulston -- global chief financial officer
i think one thing we've been very mindful of as we've been growing that business is getting the drop down from incremental revenue to adjusted ebitda in the 15% to 20% range. so that sort of guides us over a 12-month period. so you'll see us largely live within those constraints. it may be a little bit lumpy and bumpy from quarter-to-quarter, but that will really be what guides the growth.
tom stephan -- stifel -- analyst
got it. that makes sense. and then more of a longer-term question. your guidance for full year organic growth of 5% to 6%, i think it's still impressive, given the challenges in europe are kind of persisting and then some newer headwinds in prescription management in the supply chain. so as those things start to normalize maybe next year, is it unreasonable to think about the total business as maybe a sustainable, high single-digit grower longer term and maybe not just an above-market, mid-single-digit grower?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
i think a lot of it is predicated on how you view what's going to happen in the end market. obviously, our market has been robust, and we feel like we'll continue to certainly get above-market growth in those areas like prescription management as we go forward, and as the numbers get larger, it starts to influence the overall growth rate of the business where it might not have in the past. but certainly, we hopefully only have one event in germany and one u.k., and we're passing those, and we'll be growing above that and we expect to continue to have outsized market growth in north america and australia. so it really comes back to how you model the end market, but we feel like we're going to be able to continue to grow aggressively and grow at or above the end market in the years to come.
tom stephan -- stifel -- analyst
great, thanks.
operator
thank you. moving on, we also have a question from nathan rich from goldman sachs. your line is open sir.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great, thanks for taking my questions. i just wanted to follow up on the supply disruption in the prescription diets. i guess how much visibility do you have on when we might see this normalize? and has there been any impact on attach rates to drugs as a result of this? and can you maybe just talk about the profit implications as well from losing these sales?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks for your question, nathan. so in terms of visibility into what's going on, we have high visibility. we don't have a lot of control over what's happening, and i don't think we have great visibility to when it will end. i think you spend time with those manufacturers. all of them or half of it being driven by access to api or ingredients and some of it is being driven by access to labor. so if they have the product, they can't get it out the door. so it's been really challenging, and it's been covered in the press, and i think as i said in my earlier remarks, i think some of our competitors are having the exact same issues and called out some of those headwinds as well. in terms of what -- your specific question, it's a really good one. there's both the actual lost revenue of the diet as well as the residual effect or, what we call the attach rate, which is real.
so while we might have only lost, call it, $10 million in the first half related to diet of diet revenue specifically, it just has this downstream or effect, and it goes beyond just the actual diet sale. and that's where it gets challenging, and that's why we kind of adjusted our forecast, be it for the back half of the year because of that -- losing that recurring customer. the diet revenue itself, just to answer your last question, gets lower margin than the overall business, pretty significant, much closer into the 10% to 20% range, depending on the product. so it's not so much the lost revenue. i would say the bigger issue is the residual effect. now the good news, and then i'll wrap up my answer, is that i think every provider is having this issue, whether it be online or in-person, and so i think we're all equally being affected from access to diet products.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's really helpful. one of the other dynamics that been talked about recently has been just changes in consumer behavior as some of the restrictions that a lot of vet practices had on in-person visits have lifted. i guess have you seen any impact on channel dynamics or any changes in competitive activity as a result of this like kind of returning to kind of a more normal environment?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
on the fringes, i would say. but if you just, again, look at the core underlying fundamentals of the prescription management business, matthew called out the two-year stack of close to 80 -- north of 80%, you basically had this combo of diet plus this year-over-year comp. i mean we still grew 17% sequentially, had our highest quarter ever, grew basically 22% after a year of 66% growth in 2020. so i think i'm sure there are incidences of where someone used to get it delivered at home, and then they've gone back to in-clinic. but all the data points that we have, we just continue to see velocity in that business. and if it weren't for the supply chain stuff, i almost think we wouldn't be having a conversation.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. makes sense. thanks for the questions.
operator
your next question comes from the line of elliot wilbur from raymond james. your line is open.
elliot wilbur -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks, good afternoon. question for ben. just going back to slide five in the deck when you talked about some of the various branded and proprietary product initiatives. are there significant margin differences between these individual endeavors? and i'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about sort of the relative performance of these efforts within the rx management platform versus on a stand-alone basis. then i want to ask you a question on the rx management business itself in terms of just adding new practices and the relative ease of doing that in the current environment, degree of competitive intensity and just sort of where the new wins are coming from? is it new practices, competitive wins? is there still a lot of white space in terms of practices that don't have practice management systems? but just what the incremental opportunity is there.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yes. let me -- i'll try to go through your questions one by one, and please ask again if i miss them. i just want to make sure i captured them all. so i think your first question was about the margin differential of our proprietary products versus the core business. it is pretty significant if you think about a teens margin for the overall business. these proprietary products can range anywhere from as low as, say, 25% to as high as 50% or 60% on a gross margin basis. obviously, the things that are more unique to us, like a compounded medication, is going to be higher versus a more commoditized solution in some of the consumables business. so there's a pretty big range, but i would say that it's all substantially better than the rest of the business. and you can see that in the slide actually on the previous page on slide 4, which really shows the gross profit growth inside of the business, some of the things that are proprietary to us, and you can see that on a -- gross profit grew by 20% on the things that are unique to us, and that's why we got that improved balance to 42% of the overall total business. in terms of your second question, i think it was about tying to the prescription management platform, which i think jon had asked about as well -- or balaji, i'm sorry. i think it's still early days there.
we're definitely starting to focus on how do we ease that channel to push our own proprietary products as long as it obviously makes sense for our customers and the pet owners that they serve. but it is absolutely an opportunity, and when you think of things like consumables or generics or nutraceuticals, there's definitely a lot of opportunities to expand the average order value that happens on the platform and do it at a much higher margin than some of the third-party products that run on top of the business. in terms of your last question...
matthew foulston -- global chief financial officer
the last one was adding new practices...
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
adding new practice. sorry. thank you, matthew. the last question, adding new practices, we estimate we're close to 12,000. that's somewhere around 2/3 of the market had some sort of solution, either homegrown or third party. we're obviously the clear leader in the market. so there's definitely opportunity out there. the majority of the new practices are coming actually from a combination of switching as well as white space. so there's a lot of running room, both in the engagement on the existing practice as well as new practices to the platform.
matthew foulston -- global chief financial officer
and i think just to add a little bit more color on that, you only need to go back to q3 of last year when we were at 10,900 practices in the middle of a pandemic. now we're 11,700. so the trajectory here is pretty good.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
it is difficult, and i think this is your last question, in the moment to get a practice to focus. i mean when you spend time with customers, the first thing they're going to tell you is, ""i don't have enough veterinarians. i don't have enough vet tech. i don't have enough practice managers. i barely can see the people i have."" so the idea of implementing new software or changing workflow is something that they're not eager to do. yet at the same time, they understand the long-term implications of not having an e-commerce solution, and that's where we get the pickup.
operator
thank you. and your next question comes from the line of david westenberg from guggenheim securities. your line is open.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
hi, this is john on for david. thanks for taking my question. so just in relation to the prescription management business, how should we think about net practice adds and whether there's been a significant, like, effect from the covid environment and the uptick in cases relating to the delta variant?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
sorry, john. could you repeat the question? i'm not sure i was following what you were asking.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
has there been a significant effect on your ability to make practice adds during the quarter because of the increase in concern about the covid environment?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
no. i don't think so. i think if you just go back to the beginning of the pandemic, ever since then, you have a little bit more of a challenging environment because it is a considered sale, and it is a workflow change for the customer. so i don't think it's really changed from q4 of '20 to q1 to q2. in fact, you've actually seen a little bit of an acceleration of the new practice adds happening. i think until practices are fully open and able to kind of handle a sales call, whether it's because of covid or just because they're very busy, we'd expect it to kind of continue at a similar pace going forward.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
all right. and how do you feel about chewy's petscriptions? do you think it's a threat? and how should we think about that?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
i think chewy is trying to go around the vet, disintermediate them and it's a direct competitor to the vet. and so we don't view it as competition. we have a partnership with our vets to help drive a better outcome and whether that be healthcare or business, and we're not interested in trying to move consumers outside of the veterinary channel.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
okay, thank you. for the question.

with that i will turn it over to ben to provide the highlights beginning on slide three
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, nick. and welcome back good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us today. i hope everyone is staying healthy getting vaccinated and gearing up for hopefully and what normal upcoming holiday season with family on the gasoline call i will briefly discuss some of the highlights from the quarter and then focus the rest of my prepared remarks on covetrus' is broader technology strategy, which is a key pillar of the company's overall value proposition to our customers and a long-term driver of value creation for our now turning to the third so that's it delivered solid performance in q3, with good execution by the team as well as continued healthy end market demand. north america had another great quarter, where non-gaap organic net sales grew 12% year-over-year, and non-gaap adjusted ebitda increased by 22% year-over-year to $55 million as our broader value proposition continues to resonate in the market. with the exception of germany and the u.k., all other markets, our technology offering a proprietary brands delivered solid results leading to a 10% year-over-year increase in total gross profit and a 110 basis point increase in gross margin.
unfortunately, we did not have our historical flow-through from gross profit to adjusted ebitda due to $5 million of intercompany loan fx headwinds year-over-year and $3 million of unanticipated legal fees tied to recent developments, which created an $8 million year-over-year headwind in corporate expense. one of the clear highlights of q3 was the reacceleration in net sales growth within our prescription management business in north america, where net sales increased 24% year-over-year. this compares favorably to the 19% year-over-year growth delivered in q2. encouragingly, the number of proactive prescriptions continues to increase and the visibility we have to increased adoption of our auto-ship service continues to grow. and as of every quarter since going public, all cohorts going back to the original cohort in 2012, continued to grow double digits and our most recent cohorts in 2019 and 2020 have ramped faster than any cohorts before them.
we also saw excellent leverage in this business during q3, where non-gaap adjusted ebitda more than doubled year-over-year and increased 18% sequentially. this business is now on pace to deliver more than $40 million in non-gaap ebitda in 2021, which compares to a breakeven business just two short years ago. in the quarter, we delivered a 10% non-gaap adjusted ebitda margin in prescription management, which highlights the long-term potential for margin expansion for consolidated covetrus as this business grows alongside our other high-margin solutions, including tims, wellness plan administration, communication solutions, payments and solutions, smartpack and our proprietary brands. as highlighted in earlier announcement, we took a major step forward on this portfolio during the third quarter through the acquisitions of dcp, the market-leading platform for wellness for wellness and point master, a provider of integrated communication solutions for veterinary practices. we are clearly investing in these new capabilities and in our next-generation technology, and we see significant opportunity to scale the total portfolio as we leverage our channel access and our integrated ecosystem of solutions.
although we often focus on subscription management on these quarterly calls, it is important to note that with our recent growth our combined technology offering across prescription management, global software services and smartpack is now at nearly $800 million in annual sales and approaching $100 million in non-gaap adjusted ebitda. that is a substantial technology business in almost any industry. this provides a great segue to slide four and the opportunity at covetrus. at the company, everything we do is centered on helping veterinarians drive better health and business outcomes. while investors have come to appreciate the steady growth and scale of our in-clinic supply chain and proprietary products businesses around the world, our unique value proposition to our customer base stands from our portfolio of technology solutions that drive efficiency, revenue growth and better pet health as we strengthen our relationships with our customers and their pet parents. let me explain how this actually works. today, at a covetrus powered practice, a pet parent begins their journey by booking an appointment via covetrus' online booking tool. this appointment is followed up with text and email reminders from our communications platform.
one at the practice, a veterinarian manages this patient using our industry-leading practice information management system or fan, which provide medical meter storage, treatment path and workflow solutions. straight out of the pims and right at the point of care, veterinarians can now proactively prescribe medication and have that medication delivered via our prescription management solution straight to the pet owner's home. via the same e-commerce solution, pet parents can also sign up to use autoship programs and receive personalized medication from our compounding pharmacy. to drive compliance and provide financial visibility to pet parents, a covetrus practice can now enable care plans via our wellness plan administration solution, creating a subscription relationship with a pet parent. back at home, pet parents can shop online with their veterinarian, manage their prescription and communicate with their veterinarian via telehealth platform. it is this connected practice that allows the veterinarian to run an effective and profitable business. this portfolio that drives the connected practice has already seen significant upgrades over the last nine months and will continue to improve over the next year.
some highlights include first, the launch of our next-generation cloud-based sim solution, which are now live in australia and launching a beta in the u.s. this quarter. second, significant enhancements to our integrations with diagnostic and imaging partners. third, continued improvements to our leading on-premise tim solutions out-of-market impromed. fourth, tight integration of bcp's wellness plan administration software into tims and our e-commerce solutions further strengthening the best pet relationship; and fifth, a complete blending of prescription management and tims to support data interoperability, improved workflow and a better standard of care, a truly operating system for the practice. with such a substantial technology business, it's hard to say that we are just at the beginning of our technology journey, but it's true. over the coming quarters and years, covetrus will continue to enhance our solutions all with the intent of helping veterinarians succeed. with strong end market growth and the industry's leading technology platform, it's clear that our future is bright.
now i will turn the call over to matthew to discuss our q3 financial results.
matthew foulston -- global chief financial officer
thanks, ben. good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. i will now review our third quarter 2021 financial results and provide additional commentary on our full year expectations. the focus of my comments will be on our non-gaap results where applicable. please refer to today's press release for a more detailed description of our third quarter 2021 gaap financial results and reconciliations of non-gaap measures to gaap results. starting on slide six. consolidated non-gaap organic net sales increased 3% year-over-year and non-gaap adjusted ebitda decreased 2% year-over-year to $58 million. the previously disclosed challenges in our u.k. and german businesses as well as unanticipated fx and legal-related costs in corporate negatively impacted consolidated results and marks another quarter of strong performance in our north america and apac and emerging market segments.
we encouraging delivered 110 basis points of year-over-year gross margin improvement during the third quarter, including positive trends across all three of the company's operating segments. and we continue to scale prescription management, where non-gaap adjusted ebitda more than doubled versus the prior year period. additionally, underlying cash generation was strong with $45 million of free cash flow in q3. net leverage ticked up modestly in q3 because of the m&a activity that ben referred to earlier. we anticipate returning to our targeted three times to 3.5 times net leverage range in q4. now turning to the details on slide seven. covetrus net sales were $1.16 billion in q3, an increase of 3% year-over-year on both the reported and non-gaap organic basis, reflecting healthy companion animal end market demand across many of the company's markets against the backdrop of more challenging year-over-year comparisons as we lapped the surge in volume during the second half of last year type of covid-19 market dynamics.
the previously disclosed challenges in our u.k. and german markets continue to impact year-over-year results with non-gaap organic net sales growth negatively impacted by approximately 700 basis points. while these markets have stabilized operationally, we have not yet seen a recovery in sales volume, which has impacted profitability. we will be taking further action on this firm near term to better align our cost structure. moving to slide eight. consolidated q3 covetrus gross profit increased 10% year-over-year, with gross margin of 18.6%, expanding 110 basis points versus prior year period. encouragingly, gross margin expanded in all three of the company's segments. the underlying margin strength was driven by healthy growth in the company's technology e-commerce and proprietary products and services, where gross profit increased 23% year-over-year, led by strong performance in prescription management. collectively, these businesses now represent 45% of the company's consolidated gross profit, an increase of 400 basis points versus the prior year period and approximately 200 basis points from the second quarter of this year.
turning to slide nine. non-gaap adjusted ebitda was $58 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $59 million in the prior year period. the 2% year-over-year decrease reflected a decline in profitability in europe due to a combined $6 million negative impact from the challenges in the u.k. and in germany as well as higher corporate expenses, including a $5 million negative impact year-over-year from changes in foreign exchange on intercompany loans that are included in our non-gaap results, and a $3 million year-over-year increase in legal professional fees tied to recent developments. these headwinds more than offset another strong quarter of growth and margin expansion in north america and apac and emerging markets. non-gaap adjusted ebitda margins were 5% during q3, a 20 basis point year-over-year decline reflective of the headwinds in corporate just listed. i would also highlight incremental fee headwinds in canceled during the quarter that has now been repriced into our product offerings for q4, an additional $1 million to $2 million impact year-over-year from the rebound of certain sales and marketing expenses, primarily travel and entertainment as covid-19 restrictions have eased and trade shows that we started in person once again. moving to our operating segments, beginning on slide 10.
north america net sales increased 13% year-over-year in q3 on a reported basis and 12% year-over-year on a non-gaap organic basis. segment adjusted ebitda increased 22% year-over-year in q3 with segment adjusted ebitda margins expanding 60 basis points versus the prior year period, reflecting the increased contribution from higher profitability generating areas of the business, including prescription management and covetrus-branded products and incremental operating expense leverage. drilling deeper into the north american segment trends, starting on slide 11, our supply chain non-gaap organic net sales increased an impressive 11% year-over-year in q3 on top of what was a robust panel growth rate reflective of strong sales execution in a healthy companion animal end market as well as continued strength in our equine business smart. supply chain non-gaap adjusted ebitda increased to $34 million for the third quarter compared to $31 million in the prior year period, with the strong top line growth partially offset by increased freight costs and labor pressures.
moving to software services. the business continues to perform well and now includes a very modest contribution from our big [indecipherable] acquisition back in july. we expect additional investments near term toward that platform and the building out of our suite of next-generation technology solutions including our new cloud-based practice management software that ben highlighted earlier in his remarks. with these launches anticipated to accelerate the trajectory of our software net sales in the second half of next year and beyond. turning to slide 12 and our prescription management business in north america. while supply chain constraints to certain product categories, particularly done through remaining, we were pleased with the overall reacceleration in growth in that business during q3 with net sales of $129 million, up 24% year-over-year or 26% when excluding the headwind from our changing corporate policy related to how we recognize and report certain manufacturer incentives, which are now included as a reduction to cost of goods sold. same-store sales also bounced back to 20% year-over-year growth, reflecting continued strong engagement by our existing network of veterinary practice customers and the headlines.
year-to-date, prescription management net sales are up 25% year-over-year or approximately 27% year-over-year when excluding the accounting change. of note, while excluding prescription [indecipherable] sales in both periods, prescription management net sales have increased 30% year-over-year, highlighting the underlying health of the business. encouragingly, we saw signs of stabilization in the prescription diet food category exiting q3. this, combined with the anticipated sales we're driving for our customers during cyber weekend marketing activities should enable a solid finish to the year. in total, full year 2021 prescription management year-over-year net sales should increase by approximately 25% or 28% excluding the accounting change. turning to profitability. q3 prescription management non-gaap adjusted ebitda was $13 million or more than double the $6 million reported in the prior year quarter. this represents a 10% non-gaap adjusted ebitda margin during the quarter and reflects the team's overall focus on driving increased profitability after several quarters of increased investment. on an ltm basis and normalizing for the legal charge in q4 2020, we converted approximately 11% of the year-over-year dollar growth in prescription management net sales to non-gaap adjusted ebitda.
we continue to target approximately 15% flow-through for all of '21 despite the duplicate costs from opening our new compounding pharmacy and revenue, on the ongoing diet headwind we have previously discussed. turning to our europe business segment on slide 13. non-gaap organic net sales decreased 11% year-over-year in reflecting the previously disclosed challenges we are experiencing in the u.k. and german markets, which negatively impacted organic growth by 19%, and are more than offsetting healthy veterinary demand fundamentals across the rest of our european markets. our business is operating in ireland, the netherlands and czech republic, once again were notable contributors to our results with strong performance of proprietary brands in a number of our markets as well. we are taking concrete actions to address the u.k. and german challenges including leadership changes and cost cutting, and expect those markets to return to growth in 2020 -- in 2022, as we anniversary the headwinds and benefit from renewed commercial efforts in these markets.
turning to profitability. our europe segment adjusted ebitda in q3 decreased 16% year-over-year to $16 million, with margins declining 20 basis points year-over-year to 4.5%. the u.k. and german markets represented a combined $6 million year-over-year negative impact to profitability in q3. these challenges more than offset the growth seen in the rest of europe, and the benefits from increased penetration in proprietary brands. moving on to our apac and emerging markets segment on slide 14, our team delivered a 4% year-over-year increase in non-gaap organic net sales in q3 on top of the exceptional 16% organic growth rate reported in the prior year period, reflecting another quarter of strong sales execution despite the challenging emerson. australia and brazil delivered healthy, high single-digit year-over-year non-gaap organic net sales growth during q3. segment adjusted ebitda increased 25% year-over-year during and segment adjusted ebitda margins expanded by 120 basis points year-over-year, driven by 40 basis points of gross margin expansion and the ongoing operating leverage from stronger and service. now turning to the balance sheet on slide 15.
we generated $45 million in free cash flow in the third quarter, although our net leverage ticked up to 3.8 churns as a result of the $81 million spent on the two acquisitions completed in q3. we ended the quarter with $485 million in available liquidity and approximately 1.9 churns of headroom under our net leverage covenant as defining our credit. we expect our net leverage will come back within our targeted range by year-end, driven by growth in adjusted ebitda during q4 a normal seasonality of our cash flows. now turning to our 2021 guidance as outlined on slide 16. we continue to forecast non-gaap organic net sales growth of 5% to 6%. the outlook includes slightly higher net sales of previously expected in north america and apac and emerging markets, with europe continuing to be impacted by the challenges in u.k. and in germany. as a reminder, these two markets are expected to negatively impact quebetrasys consolidated organic net sales growth in 2021 by approximately 600 basis points. looking at non-gaap adjusted ebitda, our outlook also remains unchanged of $245 million to $255 million, but now includes the added legal professional fees and fx headwinds experienced during the third quarter.
as we look at year-over-year growth in adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter, we anticipate another quarter of healthy growth in north america, where we expect continued strong performance in prescription management profitability, including the non-repeat of last year's legal expense and improved results in supply chain. this growth is partially offset by increased corporate costs, reflecting the non-repeat of favorable fx in the prior year period. we are also monitoring the vaccine mainly in the u.s. and the potential disruption that may have on our business and our supply chain for us. we have not yet incorporated this into our outlook, given the many unknowns at this stage. looking ahead, it's too early to comment on our detailed 2022 plans, but based on the available information we have today, we are preliminarily targeting an overall modest acceleration in non-gaap organic net sales growth and non-gaap adjusted ebitda growth in 2022 versus our anticipated 2021 growth rates.
this is driven by the lacking of the specific challenges in our u.k. and german markets, which collectively are expected to negatively impact 2021 non-gaap adjusted ebitda and more than $15 million year-over-year. additionally, we anticipate continued healthy growth in net sales and profitability infrastructure management and an improvement in our software growth outlook with multiple new products coming to market in 2022. we also anticipate general stability in our supply chain businesses around the globe with continued focus on growing our higher-margin proprietary brands. some of this growth will be offset by higher freight costs, continued labor market tightness and the return of discretionary spend that got economies was over. we will provide additional detail on our 2022 outlook early next year.
with that, i will now turn the call back over to ben for some brief closing remarks.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, matthew. in closing and outlined on slide 17, we are aggressively investing in our tech platform to enhance our value proposition to secure new business and to accelerate our market opportunity. we are also very focused on driving our covetrus branded and proprietary product portfolio and streamlining operations to deliver increased efficiencies and to reinvest back into our platform. while q3 certainly had some noise in our reported results, i'm confident in our strategy and the momentum we have in the core drivers of our business. we remain in the early innings of driving for the company's long-term potential of above-market net sales growth and adjusted ebitda margin expansion, and believe we are on the path to sustainable shareholder value creation as we execute our strategic plan.
this concludes our prepared remarks, and i will now turn the call back over to nicholas jansen to moderate the q&a session.

[operator instructions] here's our first question, john kreger of william blair.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
thanks guys. maybe my first question, if you guys could just kind of go over some of the noise that had impacted your numbers in the last couple of quarters and where you think those items go in the fourth quarter? it sounded like you think the therapeutic food issue is maybe about to be alleviated. so if you could just clarify that. and what sort of assumptions you're making on that fx and legal cost item?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, john. on therapeutic diet side, we saw things begin to stabilize as we exited i hate to count my chickens before they hatch because it's a fairly volatile situation. and when you've been as far behind as we have, it doesn't take much of a pun. so not you off track. so i'd say we're mildly positive on the outlook for that, but certainly not a return to normal in the immediate short term. we still have quite a few skus on material that order, but better than we were. on the other two items, we had some headwinds in the quarter on fx on the intercompany loans. we assume in our guidance that we will not have a headwind or tailwind in the coming quarter. so we're basically assuming exchange rates stay flat. and then the final one, the legal, we're expecting a sizable reduction in q4 of legal expense. i think it's down $2 million to $3 million as we pass through those largely onetime items.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
that's helpful. and then a quick follow-up. ben, i think right there at the end, you said you're investing aggressively in the tech platform. should we assume that, that spend in '22 is sort of tracking with revenue growth or maybe more aggressive? and what sort of specific product or products would you call out that we should be looking for?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yes. look, what we kind of remain consistent about driving both the top and the bottom line. so i don't think we're backing off of that basic thesis. but obviously, as the business gets bigger and the opportunity it becomes even more robust for us. we want to continue to invest in that platform. so it's going to be a lot of the things that we mentioned in the past here, which is continued investment in our tim both in the u.s. and internationally. we're excited that we're in market internationally with a cloud or kind of plateau version as well as going to market in q4 here in beta.
we'll continue to focus on the integration of our prescription management because those students platforms, which we're very excited about. and then some of the more recent areas like our wellness plan administration through the acquisition of bct, we feel like there's just tremendous runway there and are getting lots of positive support from customers. so the tech business, as i mentioned in the prepared remarks, is almost $800 million in revenue, but we feel like there's just tremendous market opportunity, general secular shift in our favor going online, and it's right to invest in that opportunity. so it was great to see the reacceleration of the business in q3 versus q2. so we're feeling pretty bullish about the prospects for the tech platform and all of the things that surround it. thank you.
operator
and our next question is from jon block from stifel.
tom stephan -- stifel -- analyst
hi guys. this is tom stephan on for john. i want to start off with the 2022 preliminary guide on adjusted ebitda. matthew, i think you said the guide is for it to accelerate. so if it were to accelerate from -- the 10% growth implied in the guide for 2021 to call it, 12%, 13%, for instance. i think that'd be roughly $30 million of ebitda dollar growth. and i guess my question is, at a high level, how should we think about the contribution between prescription management and the rest of the business? is it 50-50? or do you maybe have confidence in one area of the business over the other?
matthew foulston -- global chief financial officer
yes. i mean, we were super excited with the reacceleration of growth in prescription management in this quarter compared to the second, we were up from 18 to 24 and has been went through all the cohorts at running double digits. so we're super excited about the potential of that business. we're not ready to peg a number in terms of growth rates for that. but we would anticipate continued solid contribution and continuation. so the only other thing i'd add is if you just look at the two-year performance of that business, it's gone from breakeven to $40 million of ebitda. so you can just start to extrapolate and look at the growth rates currently and roll forward a year or two, and you could see how the business expands its margins over time.
tom stephan -- stifel -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then kind of just as a follow-up there on prescription management. the $13 million in ebitda for the quarter was very solid as were margins. can you just elaborate a bit more on the drivers there, kind of structurally, to what extent do you feel the business is in the right position to potentially resume maybe that consistent 15% contribution margin? can we kind of model that out moving forward? or just any color there?
matthew foulston -- global chief financial officer
and i think one thing i sort of say is we do always look at this over a rolling 12-month period because of the lumpiness of the bumpiness in the investments. but we feel pretty good about the 15% for this year and a really strong fourth quarter coming up. and would think we'd be in that 15% to 20% range. as ben said, there's so much growth opportunity here. i think we're biased toward the lower rather than the high end, but because now is the time to grow. but we feel pretty comfortable about that.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yes. the only thing i would add to, matthew's comments is you're looking at a total pharmacy spend in the u.s. alone, north of $10 billion, growing very fast, the prescription management business, $500 million this year. we don't want to suboptimize the opportunity. so we are committed to driving profitability out of that business, but we are going to invest when we see opportunity either directly into prescription management or really around the things that we think will drive it like [indecipherable] and wellness and lime management all of those things contribute to the prescription management here going forward.
tom stephan -- stifel -- analyst
got it. thats all folks. thanks guys.
operator
and for our next question from nathan rich of goldman sachs.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon, i wanted to stick with the prescription management business. i guess as you've started to see some of these supply issues ease, have you seen impact of customers come back? and ben, i don't know if you'd be willing to maybe comment on either the september or october sort of exit rates for that business as we think about trajectory into the fourth quarter? and relatedly, was there any impact on practices that you could onboard onto the platform during this period of the supply disruption?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, nathan. so a couple of different ways of looking at it. i think the supply disruption was less of a clinic disruptor and more of a consumer disruptor, as you could imagine. and to put it in perspective, our pharma business on the platform this year will grow at double the rate of our diets business. and historically, those things used to grow kind of in line with one another. so you get a sense of the drag that dies has created for the business. i think in terms of exit rates and how we think about the near-term growth here.
we feel like the q3 growth rates look at a pretty good marker for the q4 growth rate. there's just good trajectory in the [indecipherable] and both matthew and i commented in our prepared remarks, all the cohort data, the repeat purchase data, the proactive prescription data, all of that is really quite positive. so i think if you just look in the short term, we feel pretty good about how the business has performed. and i think there was a lot of questions that are coming out of covid, was covid was a onetime phenomenon or how would the business grow. and so to be growing 25% on a year-over-year basis, even after covid. so like a two-year stack of almost 67% in the quarter. i just -- it just makes us feel really both proud of the work that the team is doing and confident in our prospects going forward.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. and then, matt, maybe a follow-up for you. i just wanted to go back to the ebitda step-up in the fourth quarter. i think with the onetime items you called out, that would probably get you into the low end of the annual guidance range, if i'm doing the math correctly. so i guess like maybe outside of those items, what are sort of the key factors that kind of would get you to the midpoint or the high end of the range for the year?
matthew foulston -- global chief financial officer
yes. i think when we look at the improvement, we talked about the noise when i was answering that first question, which was really the fx and the legal stuff. but we've also got a pretty strong improvement in north america, which is a combo of prescription management and supply chain. one of the phenomenons we've got is in q3, i would say, freight cost inflation gone a bit ahead of pricing. and we took that pricing right on the length in the quarter, and we think those to will be matched up in q4. so we won't have that it, which will help the sale. and i think we'll be up $1 million or so in europe and apac combined. thanks for the questions.
operator
and for the next question, elliott wilbur of raymond james.
elliott wilbur -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks. question for ben. maybe within the north american supply chain business, can you just talk a little bit more specifically about the performance of cet branded proprietary products with -- in that segment? i know last call, you had talked about fairly significant cadence of new product launches. and also some geographic expansion there, but just wondering how that business performed within the context of the overall segment?
and for matt, i guess, could you just remind us when we're talking about the u.k. and german challenges, exactly what you're referring to and which of those may have had a more negative impact than the other in terms of performance? and with respect to some of the steps you're taking in terms of cost management, is that something that can be done immediately so that the implementation of those steps will, in fact, start to benefit numbers in the early part of 2022? or is this something that has to be a little bit more managed so it doesn't impact top line trends?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, elliot. so you had a couple of questions in there. why don't i start with the proprietary brand growth in north america and globally. and then matthew can talk about some of the areas that we need to clearly prove upon. from a north america standpoint, the team just all around did an awesome job, i would say, north of 10% growth in totality. and i think you're really just seeing the benefit of this combined go-to-market team that can sell across proprietary products in clinic third-party technology solutions, wellness plans, etc. specifically on the proprietary brands, you saw a growth rate 50% higher than the total average, so high teens. and a lot of that just comes from again, strong effort by both the consumer or customer-facing team in north america as well as the global team that manages proprietary brands on a global basis.
so we're super bullish there. there's a great slide in the presentation, slide eight shows the mix of our business on a year-over-year basis. and you can see that for the products that we control, our technology and our proprietary brand, we had 23% year-over-year growth and it now represents 45% of the total gp in the business versus 41% just a year ago. so to be doing that on such a large scaled number, which is about $215 million, we're just really, really excited and get -- be closer and closer to kind of a 50% magic number that we've been pushing forward of getting our own -- our own products to represent 50% of gp. so just really excellent execution. and i think a sign that we're just picking up share in north america specifically on all in-clinic business, whether it be third-party or our own brands. and then matt, you can speak about specific challenges and where we're focused on and probably give us a sense of timing on the rebound there.
matthew foulston -- global chief financial officer
yes. let me take these separately because they're very separate issues. so i'll talk a bit about germany first. and it actually occurred first. and just to refresh your memory, germany was the last of the 72 tsas that we had to get off as part of the separation from henry schein. and we effectively came off of that tsa in october of last year, right in the middle of the pandemic. but what that actually involved was getting out of a shared warehousing situation with henry schein into a new third-party logistics provider, supplier and warehouse which was pretty difficult, and done in pretty difficult circumstances.
as we've mentioned on previous calls, the execution of that was port to put it timely and our service levels to customers were really, really unacceptable. it resulted in a lot of lost sales starting last october. so in terms of timing, we are now beginning to lap that. so we'd anticipate going forward, there's not a sales headwind in germany, although we far from fix the problem and align the cost structure, and i'll come back to that in a second. in the u.k., the situation now really revolves around two things that are related. we lost a manufacturer. and then as a result of losing that manufacturer, we lost a customer and it had a pretty severe impact on revenue, and that started in the first quarter of this year. so the lapping of that is going to take us a little bit longer.
obviously, big reductions in revenue, and we need to meet corresponding adjustments to our cost structure. we're working on that as we speak. and i would imagine having plans in place by year-end, obviously, in certain markets, the consultative process around making adjustments to the cost structure can take a little bit longer than expected. but certainly, no later than mid first quarter, we ought to have that behind us and be operating in a way we would like to to go forward. in terms of magnitude, i said the u.k. is just a little bit bigger than germany. it was a much bigger market for us. so that's winning on us just a little more. hopefully, that got your questions, eillot.
elliott wilbur -- raymond james -- analyst
yes. great. then i guess just as a follow-up to the cost question. how do you think about these moves in terms of potentially impacting the top line and sort of manage through that possibility?
matthew foulston -- global chief financial officer
well, i think we're looking to do two things. one is to recover the top line slowly but we're not going to get all of these customers back immediately. so it's going to take time. so the plan is to adjust the cost base get the returns back toward where they used to be and where we need them to be. and it's the top line response quicker than we expect, that will be growth.
operator
our next question is coming from erin wright from morgan stanley.
erin wright -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great.thanks. as you head into kind of 2020 or 2022 here and think about vendor negotiations, conversations with your manufacturer kind of partners here. do you anticipate any major shift in access to product lines by cell versus agency relationships? do you have any visibility yet on that front? i think you mentioned some access to new products maybe heading into next year, but anything else we should be thinking about?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
aaron, we don't anticipate any significant shift here. we're in the beginnings of those conversations with the manufacturers. and i'd say, the general message is i think people are excited about our omnichannel solution and the differentiation that we bring to the marketplace. obviously, there's always puts a base in these relationships. but i don't believe at this time that there's going to be any significant moves, positive or negative.
erin wright -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then in terms of the prescription management business, i mean, should we be thinking about that still as a 30% to 40% grower longer term? and i guess it's more about retention and engagement than it is about adding new platform users, but i did notice it was, i guess, flat on a sequential basis. was there any sort of reason for that?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i think we're not modeling or forecasting 30% to 40% growth. i think that the numbers in the mid-20s is kind of what we've been sticking to and what we think is appropriate. part of it is just a law of large numbers here at the business scales. growth is going to come from both new adds to the platform and engagement on the platform. if you look at the number of consumers on a practice basis, it's still a very small number. so we feel like there's lots of running room in the existing business. there's lots of running room for us to add new customers to the back.
matthew foulston -- global chief financial officer
and i think if you look at practice adds and you look back at last year, we were flat in the same quarter. it's a tough time to get into practices and make that sell in the holiday season. but we'd expect that to pick back up again.
elliott wilbur -- raymond james -- analyst

and for our next question, balaji prasad of barclays.
balaji prasad -- barclays -- analyst
alright, good evening and thanks for the question. so getting back to prescription management again, can you call out some of the big shifts at least in terms of the conversations that you're having and how we have to think about growth in the net adds? i mean, just called out that you still think that there's going to be significant and what's the pace that we can expect? and secondly, as i look at the ebitda component on your guidance, did you say that you have taken the inflationary or supply chain headwinds fully into account in your pricing reset and so the guidance incorporates that fully.
matthew foulston -- global chief financial officer
want me to take the last one first, ben, on freight pricing.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yes
matthew foulston -- global chief financial officer
yes. we if there's a massive shock in q4 in freight rates that we didn't see coming into it, we have a price for that. but we have priced for the rates we're incurring going in. so we think we're pretty cover in the guidance we've provided.
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
and then in terms of the first question about the types of conversations that we're having on prescription management. i think the general tenor in the market as advanced from one where home delivery of prescription management was kind of a defensive solution to now one where veterinarians believe that they need to have a solution in order to compete with retail and other players. so we're excited by just really kind of the general shift in the market on that front, and we think that will be beneficial to the business over the long term, both in terms of the engagement on the platform as well as the new people willing to adopt the platform.
balaji prasad -- barclays -- analyst
if i can have a follow-up here also on your trial with a lawsuit with chewy. so some of the response that you provided, you're commenting that chewy has been suppressing competition. can you give you any further updates on this? and also let us know if you need to take any provisions to either make for a potential trial or settlement going forward?
benjamin wolin -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, balaji, i obviously won't comment on active litigation. but what i will say is we feel very comfortable in our position. we know that we are well situated and we are the only business that is truly trying to drive a positive outcome for the veterinarian, whether that be a healthcare outcome or a business outcome and that veterinarians are well within their right to promote their own pharmacies. so we are -- have been heartened to see the response in the marketplace from our customers who are waking up to the potential disintermediation that an online retailer like chewy might be -- might provide.
balaji prasad -- barclays -- analyst
got it. thank you. thats all folks.
