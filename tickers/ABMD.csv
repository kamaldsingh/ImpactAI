thank you. [operator instructions]. and our first question comes from danielle antalffy from svb leerink. your line is open.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
good morning, everyone. thanks so much for taking the question. mike, i just wanted to touch on whether this could -- so i appreciate that some of this is execution. but it feels like maybe given the time that it's taking to drive a recovery we're at a different phase of the adoption curve, a little more push versus pool. and i'm wondering if, a, you would characterize it like that; and then secondarily, what does that mean for the sustainable growth rate going forward. do you feel confident that the internal initiatives and external initiatives that you talked about are going to allow you to realize the full value of the team [phonetic] here? thank you so much.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and ceo
thanks, danielle, for the question. the -- we are at different phase. so where i would characterize is, we are now moving our way through the early majority. and so, if you look at the numbers, 85% of our patients come from 50% of our accounts and those accounts are driven by the physicians.
so, the other half of our installed base are not utilizing impella the way they could with the best practices. it also means that because they're using inotropes and intra-aortic balloons, they're getting outcomes in shock and other areas that have been consistently in the 50% survival range. the big concern that we have with this next phase of physicians, whether they're at existing centers that we're already at or as we go into the community, is access and closure. so, you're seeing an intense focus now on the access, meaning putting impella in and then closing the 14-french hole.
and so, we're doing that with education. in the protect ii study, we have data showing vascular complications were numerically the same between impella and the balloon. we're doing it with clinical workshops and hands-ons events like we did at scai. and probably the most important educational tool we have now that's been validated and is on the scai website is our access closure manual with videos. it was a physician initiated educational program. and again, it is now on line and it was presented and it's utilized by the scai society, which is the interventional cardiology group.
so, that phase that we're at is exactly -- they have a bit of a different learning curve. and as we're going back out into the communities, we've shown that if folks follow the ncsi protocol -- which several of those hospitals are in the community, they can also duplicate those outstanding outcome. so, that's what we're focused on. and again, if i put it into the formula and training data and time, the access closure is really the big concern you'll find as you do your surveys.
now, when we get into the icu, that has to do a little bit with the patient management and we believe smartassist is a big key for that because it allows us to have information right on the console, know where the pump is. and then if alarms go off, people have support on site, on call, and at our impella connect centers, it's real-time being monitored.
for the data component, i also think we've had a recent batch of incredibly positive papers, maybe so much that they're getting watered down because they're all coming together. but the first is the scai paper. i mean this is a drastic change in survival compared to the historic norms of 50%, and again 98% have recovery. that's cost effective as well as it's what the patient wants.
the inova publication again showed a different unit, a different hospital system that followed their own protocols, but again utilizing impella early. they were also able to move survival from 44% to 82%. the burzotta paper, which is actually -- likely one of the reasons we're seeing an increase in high-risk pci in europe. again, it shows what protect ii or fda studies showed, that when you do a complete revascularization these patients see a permanent improvement in their ef. and then, as of today announcing from our cvad study, that's prospective and it's where we also do our fda post-approval studies that were able to minimize the rate of aki. so all those things together, the training and the data, and as we've mentioned today it will require a little more time to get to that next phase of users.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
thank you so much.

thank you. our next question comes from chris pasquale from guggenheim. your line is open.
chris pasquale -- guggenheim -- analyst
thanks. todd mentioned that the early momentum you saw in april really wasn't sustained over the course of the quarter. it sounded like you were attributing that seasonal weakness, but that would have been true in the year-ago period as well. so i'm curious at this point what drives your confidence that the rp letter is still the best explanation for the slowdown we saw in march. and if so, then why haven't just the passage of time and the updated communication driven a more immediate rebound?
todd a. trapp -- vice president and cfo
so chris, it is accurate and -- that the seasonal issue is true in both cases. however, the amount of organizational change and some of the external noise that was out there makes it more difficult to update folks and to drive that benefit that we did see in april.
the second part of your question is the confidence we have and the rp effect, is that the rp letter did come out. unfortunately, the process of physician letters from the fda is they still come out with the same headline. and it wasn't until the very end of the of the update that it talked about the safe and effective and closed it out. so even in the update that went out, there was a little bit of confusion on how it hits the web and there was a few media sources that again misinterpreted it.
the second thing is that there is a lot of the initial noise, it doesn't necessarily get clarified. so we are making progress. that's why the scai meeting was very important for us to have all that information there, and we did talk about it. i also think that some of these things require just a consistent period of time before people understand the context of what is a salvage patient and why are protocols so important.
so we'll continue to do that, but again we said the rp letter was the biggest driver of the external noise. there is other noise that's happening around us, that thing is to do with either staging or administrative changes or just perception that's out there on the product. and so, we continue to work through those as well by proving the product and also getting out the information on the clinical data.
chris pasquale -- guggenheim -- analyst
and mike, the distribution changes that you've made, are those now in place or is that a work in progress?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and ceo
it's both. so we -- because we're expanding management roles and because we're adding more heads, we haven't been able to fill all of those yet. but from the infrastructure and from this strategy, we know that when we go into these community hospitals that are somewhat large, there is tremendous upside because they again tend to be the biggest users of our inotropes and balloon pumps. so, we can customize the distribution in those markets.
and then from a strategy perspective, we really want to incorporate the hub-and-spoke broader, so that those sites that will set up their own systems of care have the option to transfer those patients, especially centers that do the expertise of the icu management and biventricular support.
even at existing sites, we have to get deeper so that we always have the physicians on call and we have the heart team approach. so for that, we're going to specialize training now around program. so whether it's a high risk protected pci program or whether it's a shock protocol, we're going to have to come out a little bit different for places that the physicians may have essentially required more handholding or have just a bigger concern about access and closure. and i think as you all survey users -- probably the number one thing you'll hear from folks that if they're not using it is they're still just concerned with access closure.
what we also remind people is with the right training and what we have, the catheter, french-14 at the -- french at the head, but the catheter itself is 9 french. so if we look at the stemi dtu study in the 50 patients, we only had two that had vascular complications and both of those were at x-plan [phonetic], which is again a heart attack patient and we probably shouldn't have issues that x-plan is the patients more stable. so those are things we're going to do with education, but we definitely have hit a next wave of users that really are concerned about access and closure.
chris pasquale -- guggenheim -- analyst
thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from margaret kaczor from william blair. your line is open.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
hey, good morning folks. thanks for taking the questions. first one first one from me, maybe it's just walking through kind of this new wider sales strategy focus on community hospitals versus going deeper into existing accounts at -- and just wanted to pick away at that in terms of how much of this was always in the plan even last quarter? maybe how should we assume for new site add sort of trend throughout this year, really how quickly can you get some of these new sites to ramp?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and ceo
so margaret, the -- 100 of the top us heart hospitals in the country, i think 99 have impella, it might even be a 100 now. so, we've done well at the hubs. for the most part, the hubs still have upside because we have escalation of patients. we have more patients that are not getting high-risk pci and then we have the community hospitals, our spokes. and so i think the evolution, if you look at the number i provided on, 85% of the patients coming from 50%, that means the other 50% are actually not utilizing the technology even though they have the same type of clinical challenges for high-risk pci and for shock.
we have best practice protocols. we have techniques and publications showing that you can get better outcomes for high-risk pci and for cardiogenic shock. so, there is no reason now that centers -- that the other 50% should not be utilizing impella. and there is also extensive clinical data on inotropes and intra-aortic balloon pumps documenting that they -- that they're in some cases harmful and when used before impella are statistical predictor of death.
so, we have to now evolve a little bit more so that when we go into the community hospitals, we really focus on the access closure training. we also give them the support they need on-site. we give them the support in the icu. and as we set up the network, a hub-and-spoke, if they have a patient that is too complicated or requires biventricular support, they feel comfortable and they have the option to then transfer that patient to the hub, to the center.
and so, i think we've evolved where we've done pretty well with the hubs. we're now moving to phase ii to get that next wave of the late majority and they're really -- those physicians are out in the community, at those hospitals and we need to do a better job there.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
okay. and then just as a follow-up, maybe guidance, if we kind of take todd's comments next quarter will be maybe down seasonally just a bit, and apply that into the model for this quarter, it essentially starts to imply kind of this 14% growth for the rest of the year i think for the us. incorrect me if math is wrong on that. but how much of that is really going to be driven by comps getting easier going into the fourth quarter and some of these initiatives really taking off in the fourth quarter relative to same steady progression throughout the year? thanks.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and ceo
so, margaret, we're giving you full transparency of the numbers, that's why we've provided april last quarter's call and given you the details this quarter. we obviously feel comfortable about what we're seeing outside the us, and japan is obviously a great opportunity for us to have sustainable growth for many years. the reason we're so focused on that next phase in the us is because we expect to get back a reacceleration of growth in the future. we do see a little bit of adjustment for this fiscal year. but with the training that we're doing, with the new clinical data, we expect to return to stronger growth with some of these new products, new indications, existing education. and then obviously, we've got the rest of the world, the new geographies outside of the us, germany and japan longer term.
so you -- will give transparency and you'll see what we're doing each quarter along the way. but right now, what we're really focused on is improving outcomes. and remember that the way you become a standard of care, the way you drive true adoption, is you just have to continue to improve outcomes for patients and make it cost effective. and the one thing on this call and the one thing of all these new publications is they consistently reiterate that we're able to get better outcomes for patients utilizing the impella technology.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
great, thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from raj denhoy from jefferies. your line is open.
raj denhoy -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, good morning. maybe mike, i can ask you, i think one of the things that's a bit troubling about the slowdown that you're in right now is that when one thinks about the market sizes we've always assumed for impella, 200,000 plus in the united states alone. you're still less than 15% penetrated in that. so, i guess what -- the question is really what gives you the confidence that the things you've identified, whether it's expanding the sales force, there's some -- issue with access and closure are truly the push-backs right. is there any other issues that maybe you're contemplating that might be behind the slowdown that potentially could be protracted here an extent even longer than maybe we're assuming?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and ceo
so raj, that's a good question and something we obviously have analyzed. so the first point i'd say is, up until march impella has been one of the fastest growing medical device products for about 5 years. so, that's a signal that the market is there.
number two is, we still have exclusively the fda labels for high-risk pci and shock. so, we're safe and effective and cms says we're reasonable and necessary. and so, those are things that come first before you get the mass production and that becomes a standard of care. and then as i travel around the field, unfortunately i see a lot of centers where they are not utilizing the impella technology or following best practices, or physicians are either turning down these patients completely or trying to get in and out. and the numbers show that.
so as you look at what's the number one killer in the us, it's coronary artery disease. and the numbers are huge, and when you talk to physicians or even you look at your market sizes, there is a lot of great technology out there impacting the plumbing or the electricity or the valves. but in the end, coronary disease is your -- it means that you have to treat the coronary arteries. and there is 15 million people in the us just alone with it. it causes 900,000 deaths. the advisory board put out a stat that high-risk procedures are projected to grow 47% over the next 25 years. this is the only area of growth for pci.
and remember that you die of organ failure, which means the pump stops, and so that's why this is the highest mortality patient population. it's also why these patients are turned down treatment in the cath lab and surgical suite. so while we go through this phase, it's also important remember the level of growth we've had, the complexity of these patients and how sick they are. and what we've put out is our current addressable market, not the total addressable but the current addressable market, because we know that there is 700,000 people in the us that have class iii, class iv with coronary disease. many of those are also at risk of aki.
and so, we've narrowed it down to the 121 for high-risk pci on a label that we exclusively have. high-risk pci in itself is a first-of-its-kind indication for impella and that there is additional data showing 300,000 plus patients have the ischemia and are undiagnosed. and then, of the 100,000 shock patients, these are patients that are already in the hospital today. and unfortunately, there is still probably 40 ,000, 50,000 intra-aortic balloon pumps getting used in the us and there's over 100,000 patients getting inotropes every year in the us, so that unfortunately this is still a clinical crisis and one of the biggest problems at hospitals.
and if you even look at the latest study from europe on just shock, culprit, the recent one showed that they had 50% survival in shock without impella used upfront where they just didn't do anything until after patients had already had lactates above 18 and were in profound shock.
so, we do feel confident. the numbers in the us and the numbers outside the us are incredibly conservative. and again, unfortunately you do see that high-risk pci unless you get complete revamped [phonetic] has poor outcomes. and for shock, unless you have a strategy to not only increase survival and drive for heart recovery, those patients have poor outcomes.
raj denhoy -- jefferies -- analyst
no, that's helpful. maybe i could ask kind of a -- bit of a follow-up, but maybe for todd. when you think about the new guidance of 15% to 20% for the year, how should we think about the second, third and fourth quarters? i mean are you going to be toward the low end of that and then accelerate as you move through the year or just really how should we even think about this current quarter, the second quarter?
todd a. trapp -- vice president and cfo
yes, well, thanks, raj. i said in my opening remarks that typically q2 is slightly down from q1, so you can do the math kind of the year-over-year growth rate there. and then we do expect to see growth pickup up in the second -- of the year. part of it is because we have easier comps. as you call recall, last year second half grew a lot less than the first half. and then, we have some of the new products like smartassist launch which should gain traction and then some of the changes we made on the us distribution structure, again reducing the [indecipherable] to help really drive impella adoption wider and deeper in some of that outside the us performance primarily, germany and japan. so, i do think growth will pick up in the second half of the year based on those initiatives
raj denhoy -- jefferies -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from matthew o'brien with piper jaffray. your line is open.
matthew o'brien -- piper jaffray -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my questions. just real quick one upfront -- or two parts upfront. the proposed reimbursement changes are going to go final here in a couple of weeks. are those incorporated or any kind of pressure there incorporated in guidance for the back half? and then, todd, i think the utilization rate of us impella was actually higher than the actual growth rate. was there a little bit of pricing pressure in the quarter? and then i have one follow-up.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and cfo
so, i'll take the us patient utilization. so yes, utilization was up 13% in the us. our revenue growth rate was up 11%. the big driver there is that we opened up fewer sites in the quarter. so if you went back and looked at the average sites we opened up the last four quarters, it's roughly 120 sites. we opened up 62 sites in the quarter and that impacted our revenue on a ballpark about $3 million, which translates to about 2% revenue growth. so, it's really just the lower site openings in q1.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and ceo
and matt, this is mike. so on the question of the cms update, we're coming -- will be coming out. the guidance does take that into account. and as we've communicated in the past, we just always want to make sure that cms has the accurate hospital charges based on all the changes that have been made in drg 215 over the last 3 years.
matthew o'brien -- piper jaffray -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. thanks, mike. and then the follow-up questions on the business going forward; japan's doing really well, europe is still growing nicely. it seems like there is a little lull right now in the us which is fixable. but i think what a lot of investors are trying to get their minds around is historically you've talked about 25% to 30% topline growth. are you guys more kind of a 15% to 20% consistent topline grower over a multiyear period going forward?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and ceo
so matt, we've only given the forecast for this fiscal year but we do expect to go back to be a better -- one of the better growing medtech companies. obviously, the -- lot of the numbers we've been getting bigger over the last five years. but again, i think that we now have half of our population that has incredible upside. we've essentially got a critical mass. we're in all the heart hospitals, but what we need to do is get with more physicians at those centers, and at those community hospitals we need to establish programs, not one-off users.
and so, that's what you're going to start to see a little bit of a shift, which means that there is upside. and then longer term, we do have the impella 5.5, we do have some of the improvements coming on the expandable sheath for the impella cp which will innovate away the concerns of access closure, and then we have also new geographies along with new publications and new studies that would be entirely new population. so, that's what we're focused on. we again always try to adapt and execute and be very efficient in both being a top grower but also a disciplined business that delivers an ever improving net income.
matthew o'brien -- piper jaffray -- analyst
fair enough, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jayson bedford from raymond james. your line is open.
jayson bedford -- raymond james -- analyst
hi, good morning. just a couple of quick ones. just on the us growth, is the slowdown widespread across your entire customer base or are you seeing slower growth on a specific segment of the user base? you've mentioned to me hospitals a few times. i'm just curious if there is a trend here from a user standpoint.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and ceo
jayson, that's a good question, as again as you imagine, since we collect data on nearly every commercial patient by hospital by name, we can review that weekly, daily, and we do. it is not widespread. it's essentially around 25% of in-pockets where they're flat to slightly down. and then the other part of the country has -- continues to see the kind of growth rates that we've been putting up historically. so, we've got ways to address the areas that are down. some of those areas are better alignment for the distribution, some are more heads and some have had potentially open spaces or turnover, or physicians have relocated that have been bigger champions for us. so, that's where we're really focused on. and to simplify it, it's an organizational design that allows us to go into those pockets and build the programs themselves.
jayson bedford -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then just secondly, did you mentioned growth in high-risk pci and shock? i apologize if i missed it.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and cfo
yes, we did. so growth in high-risk pci in the quarter was 12% and for shock it was 14%.
jayson bedford -- raymond james -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from david lewis from morgan stanley. your line is open.
david lewis -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, thanks. just a couple of questions. mike, just first off, pci was weaker last quarter, shock was much weaker this quarter. and these businesses have similar commercial channels but very different end markets. so, any thoughts on why we've seen kind of weakness in both in these last two quarters?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and ceo
yeah, so david -- so i would go through and analyzed both the quarter but i'd also look at it by month. so in q4, we saw march fall down, primarily on high-risk pci, not necessarily in shock. and then in april, we saw a rebound of 17% overall, but we saw a 16% for high-risk pci growth and 20% for shock. so, that april looked like we had adjusted enough to see already an immediate impact. but again as we got into the summer months, even though it's consistent with year-over-year, with the changes, with some of the noise, it did hold up in june. and so that's one of the things we're looking at.
and if i look at q4, to go back to where we were, again you were still seeing pretty -- much higher january and february months relative to high-risk pci and shock themselves. and so, i think that's -- the learning curve for us is understanding where we down, why were we down, because we do have areas that have very significant growth in high-risk pci around the us. and what's interesting is with the dr. burzotta paper from europe, we're seeing a nice lift in high-risk pci in germany, which historically had been more of a shock market for us. so -- and then of course, we've got -- always have pockets of extreme growth in new areas where we've invested.
so those are the things we're looking at, kind of measuring where that territory is relative to the adoption curve. but we're doing exactly the analysis that you're talking about.
david lewis -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. and just a follow-up on and a quick one for todd. just want to follow-up with you, mike, it's just that dynamic of large center traction getting more challenging, are you seeing that equally in pci and shock? and then for todd, to deliver the top end of the guidance our math is sort of momentum stability at the top end, so the question is, you talked about april trends, how did july trend? thank you so much.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and cfo
yeah, i mean david, we're not going to start given out monthly revenue by high-risk pci and cardiogenic shock. i would tell you that the -- we factored in the guidance of 15% to 20% based on how we exited q1 and what we've seen so far in july.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from chris cooley from stephens. your line is open.
chris cooley -- stephens -- analyst
good morning. i appreciate you taking the questions. just two quick ones from me at this point, maybe either for mike or todd. does the increased focus on the community hospitals here in the united states any way, shape or fashion alter your views on continued geographic expansion outside of your primary markets in germany and japan?
and then as -- just as a follow-up, just asking both here [phonetic] in succession; i'm curious, mike, you're talking about growing utilization in community hospitals and the focus there really being on education. but there's always been a very large clinical body of evidence in support of impella utilization. so i'm curious if you think it's really an education focus here or is it an economic understanding, both from an episodic standpoint of the procedure but also maybe from a continuum perspective at that community hospital level? and as a result, if it's the latter, does that really mean that we need to see drg 215 in its revised or whatever it may be rate of reimbursement first before you can really make a big push there that's sustainable? thank you.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and ceo
so, chris, a lot of questions there. i'll do my best to hit all of them, and i'll ask for clarification if i miss it. the first one is the increased focus on the community hospitals and how does that affect outside the us; the answer is it always has and it was part of our planning process. since we have this infrastructure in the united states that allows us to provide this support in the icu, on phone and now with impella connect, it's -- it allowed us to see the importance of protocols but also the importance of us being able to touch down -- touch them even over the phone. and because we know from our internal data that we have an we have an impact and we improve outcomes in the iq database.
as we've been waiting to plant the seeds and go around the world, one of the keys to that success is establishing trading centers in the countries and then bringing something like smartassist onto the console itself. so every time a patient is being supported, the console itself with the optical sensor and the information lets the physician and the nurses know where the pump is, how it's doing and how it's working with the heart, and also most important allow us to wean appropriately.
so smartassist really does make the management, the implantation much easier. and then what you're seeing in the next phase of this as we bring impella connect over the top, which is a real-time monitoring online. and so, we announced today that we received impella connect approval in japan. and you're going to see us roll it out in japan, so that countries like japan where we have a smaller number or other countries that we launch into will be utilizing impella connect to monitor their patients real-time to capture data to give benchmark analysis back to the hospitals so they can continue to improve their outcomes and also make ourselves more productive in the training process.
at a high level what that means is, instead of selling a product or focusing on at one patient at a time or procedure, we're really going to establish programs where people are getting a feedback loop on their outcomes and we're looking at some of the best practices, whether it's high-risk pci or shock. so, that's the first part of your question.
your second question had to do with the education level based on the quality of the data and you mentioned that -- or it wasn't an economic means, so are we waiting for the drg 215. so, what i would say for that is, impella -- first of all, if you recover somebody's heart and you increase survival, you're talking about one of the most cost effective applications in med-tech. so sending soma, our patient, home with their own heart, that's unitedhealthcare. that's a $1 million patient in hospital charges in the next 6 months to 12 months. so it's such an important thing to be cost effective, but in our case, this is life or death and the quality of life measurement from a cms again is reasonable and necessary.
on the regulatory side, there is also a mandated protection or liability in treating shock patients because of their risk factor. the fda safe and effective label allows our hospitals and our physicians to know that a regulatory body has validated this technology, and that to me is one of the most important components of our data. however, we continue to need to do more publications, more studies. and in the space of science, you can never have enough studies and there is always room for improvement and there is always room for more exploratory investigations, and that's where we are.
a lot of times, investors after reading all the clinical papers will say to me, how can it take so long. this is -- obviously the clinical data is very positive. and sometimes i remind them that they've already now read more information and more clinical papers that many of the physicians just because of the burden of work that's on the physicians, the lack of time they have in order to just do research and study because they're so deep and they've got so many different specialties, and so a lot of times we just have to continue to take this -- the summaries of our studies and simplify them. and today, i'd say that there is many people that still are not aware of all the details, even from our fda studies such as protect ii or some of the ncsi data. and so, that's up to us to do a better job.

before we begin, i would like to remind everyone that our presentation today includes forward-looking statements as it relates to discussion of our outlook. the company cautions investors that any forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that are not guaranteed in the future. actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements due to variety of factors. these factors are described under the forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and our most recent 10-k and 10-q filed with the sec. we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
with that, let me turn our call to abiomed's chairman, president and chief executive officer, mike minogue.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and ceo
thanks, ingrid. good morning, everyone. as we communicated in the last earnings call, we knew that we had some us headwinds to address in q1 following a poor performance in march due to external noise and a distraction in our internal focus. we acknowledge that the first half of fiscal '20 was going to be more challenging, in part due to confusion on the impella rp letter, tougher comps at 30% growth from prior year and the normal cath lab summer slowdown.
in q1, we implemented new training programs, organizational changes in distributions, and launched external initiatives that will require time to drive more growth in the future. therefore, our outlook for the fiscal year has been adjusted accordingly.
in the first quarter, abiomed delivered $208 million of revenue, up 15% year-over-year. operating margin for the quarter was 29.2%. outside of the us, we continue to see strong performance with european revenue at 28% on a constant currency basis and japan revenue of $8.5 million, up 227% year-over-year.
we are confident in our ultimate global adoption because we know our innovation improves clinical outcomes and patient quality of life. abiomed is creating the field of heart recovery and this proven clinical value will ultimately transform the standard of care despite a few challenges along the way. therefore, we continue to believe impella adoption is a function of training, data and time. over the last five years the impella product platform has been one of the fastest growing technologies in the medical device field.
for today's call, i will cover two topics. first, i will provide an update on internal changes we've made in q1; and second, i will discuss our progress on external initiatives. so first on the internal changes, we have adjusted our us strategy and distribution model in order to go wider into the community hospitals and deeper into existing sites by expanding the number of physicians with specialized training and education.
in the q4 call, we announced the creation of more us regions, increasing territories and account managers. this will reduce the span of control and enable our field team to target distribution into areas with lower penetration, spending less time in the car and more time at hospital sites. we feel this will help create more robust impella programs, expand users at existing sites and leverage our hub-and-spoke network into the community. this is where inotropes and intra-aortic balloon pumps continue to be first line of therapy despite the evidence that they are harmful and predictions of mortality when used before impella.
additionally, we've expanded our education and training on impella access, closure and icu management for the next wave of physician users, which is our biggest obstacle in this group. to address this, we have hosted additional training courses and created new educational content for physicians, which i will highlight later. we also simultaneously launched our smartassist platform for the fiscal year, which we believe will make our team more productive, improve ease of use in the icu and help expand patient utilization.
now, i'll transition to our external initiatives. we successfully closed out the impella rp physician letter with the fda. the updated fda letter on the impella rp was issued to healthcare providers on may 21st, validating that the impella rp heart pump is safe and effective for treatment of right heart failure. the fda also identified a new category of salvage patients that have been in cardiogenic shock for more than 48 hours or 2 days due to right heart failure and acknowledged salvage patients will have lower survival rates.
impella rp remains the most studied right-side device and is the only right-side heart pump technology with fda pma approval. we welcome and acknowledge that this fda approval requires a higher standard of data collection and transparency than other off-label products. we are continuing to expel remaining confusion on the impella platform, and note that this will take time. in q1, impella rp grew 18% year-over-year and was down 20% sequentially. we opened 23 us sites compared to 50 sites in the prior year, lowering overall revenue by $1.3 million.
now for the most important and positive update for the quarter; in may, at the 2019 society for cardiovascular angiography & interventions conference or scai, the latest national cardiogenic shock initiative or ncsi clinical data was presented and simultaneously published in catheterization and cardiovascular intervention, cci.
the clinical data from ncsi investigators was presented during late-breaking scientific sessions by dr. bill o'neill and was followed by further in-depth presentation and discussion at our abiomed sponsored session. a link to the ncsi presentation is included in our press release.
similar to all prior-year cardiogenic shock studies, the data prospectively revealed that in placing the impella heart pump pre-pci, 171 consecutive ami cardiogenic shock patients from 35 sites demonstrated 72% survival with 98% native heart recovery at discharge. as a reminder, this compares to the 50% mortality rate that cardiogenic shock patients have experienced for the last 20 years without impella. this study yet again demonstrates that a protocol-based approach to increasing survival rates in cardiogenic shock is reproducible in academic and community hospitals across the us.
i would like to share a recent patient story. last january, soma ambadapudi, 49-years-old, began experiencing severe chest pain while running the houston half marathon with his daughter. mid-race, soma collapsed and the emts were called. he was in cardiogenic shock. soma received cpr and was shocked several times on the way to memorial hermann texas medical center.
at this point, dr prakash balan immediately placed the impella cp before stenting soma's 99% blocked lad artery. after 5 days of impella support and unloading therapy, the impella was removed. today, 7 months later, soma's heart function has returned to normal with an ef of 55%. he is back at work and living an active life with his family. he and unitedhealthcare, his private insurance, will now not spend over $1 million in future hospital charges by avoiding the cascade of the most invasive and expensive treatments that would have continued for the duration of his life had his heart not recovered.
also at the scai meeting four of the six pci live cases incorporated impella support and successfully demonstrated the new smartassist features, including peak flows above 4 liters per minute and metrics on the console to assist in weaning the patient post procedure.
in order to address a primary obstacle for growth, we held one of our largest events on impella insertion access and closure at scai with more than 120 physicians in attendance. simultaneously, scai released and highlighted an interactive physician-initiated access and closure online training manual with videos to simplify techniques and best practices. this online tool exists on the scai website where it has been well received by the clinical community and has already surpassed 7,500 hits and downloads. we recognize that access and closure remains a key area of focus, and we are taking action to train away these concerns.
in the future, we will also innovate to minimize this concern with our expandable 10-french sheath for impella cp and our new product, the impella ecp 9-french pump. at scai, presentations were also given by physician experts on the stemi dtu study, the inova-shock protocol and potential for reduction of acute of acute kidney injury or aki, with impella used during high-risk pci.
today, we are announcing a cvad study publication in catheterization and cardiovascular interventions on impella's reduction of aki, validating previous publications which you will find summarized in our quarterly slides. the paper evaluates 223 consecutive patients from our cvad study and demonstrates a 78% lower aki rate relative to the expected rate in this patient population. specifically, aki rates in these impella patients were 4.9% compared to the 21.9% predicted rate. it is exciting to see new data around the potential for impella to reduce the risk of aki, which remains a critical problem for heart failure patients undergoing pci, tavr and cabg. patients with aki are estimated to have a 10% in-hospital mortality. and if escalation to dialysis is required, the in-hospital mortality increases threefold to 34%.
in conclusion, we are confident in our technology, people and our ability to improve outcomes. today, there is no other product like impella and no other fda approvals for this patient population. as a company, we remain financially prudent and profitable with $527 million in cash, no debt and an ip platform that now encompasses over 700 patents with nearly 600 pending. we believe that impella adoption is a function of training, data and time, and we remain dedicated to our mission and improving the standard of care.
i want to thank our investors for their support over the years. i also want to recognize our customers and employees for creating the field of heart recovery. i will now turn the call over to our cfo.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and cfo
thanks, mike, and good morning, everyone. in the first quarter, we delivered revenue of $208 million, an increase of 15% on a reported basis, versus a tough comparison of 36% growth in q1 of last year. by region, us revenue grew 11% to $175 million, driven by a 13% increase in patient utilization. outside the us, revenue was $32 million, up 50% on a constant currency, driven by strength in both europe and japan.
in the us, at the end of our fiscal q1, the impella 2.5 has been placed at 1,237 sites and impella cp is at 1,387 sites. the impella 5.0 is now in 605 sites and the rp is in 469 sites out of the potential 1,000 plus heart hospitals. we opened up fewer sites in q1 than historically, as we prioritized patient utilization and physician training at our existing sites.
reorder performance in the quarter was solid, with the rate slightly above a 100%, consistent with q4. average combined inventory at the hospitals for the impella 2.5 and cp was 4.4 units per site, again consistent with the inventory levels we saw last quarter.
we highlighted on our last call that march was a soft month for impella utilization, specifically for high-risk pci. and we mentioned that the april patient growth rate showed improvement over march. us patient growth in april was 17%. however, we were not able to sustain this rate of growth in the summer slowdown in june.
outside of the us, we are seeing continued growth in impella adoption. in q1, our european revenue increased 28% in local currency due to higher patient utilization in germany and further adoption in other countries like switzerland, austria, france and italy. we saw solid high-risk pci growth in germany, up 35%, likely fueled by a publication in the journal of interventional cardiology by dr. burzotta from italy.
of -- 86 complex high-risk patients who received an impella supported protected pci. the study found that six months after protected pci, the number of patients with left ventricular injection fraction greater than or equal to 35% increased by 205% from 22% to 67% of the patients, consistent with our findings in protect ii. additionally, the controlled roll-out in japan continues to gain traction as we generated $8.5 million of sales in the quarter due to patient utilization in new sites.
in q1, we opened 22 sites and are now in 82 hospitals with 126 approved by the government. we successfully treated our first japanese patient with our limited roll-out of the impella cp, and we expect to begin the product launch in the second half of fiscal year. we also received pmda approval for impella connect and look forward to bringing this new technology to japan.
moving forward, gross margin was 82.1% in the quarter compared to 82.9% in the prior year. the year-over-year variance was driven by smartassist launch and geographical sales mix. in the quarter, r&d expense totaled $24 million, an increase of 12% from the prior year, driven by investment in new product development. this includes the impella 5.5, which is ce marked and in a limited market release in germany; our expandable sheath, which had a positive first-in-man clinical experience in 15 patients outside the us; and our ongoing work around impella ecp, a low profile, expandable 9-french pump. these ongoing investments should result in sustainable growth rates in the future.
sg&a expense for the quarter totaled $86 million, 6% higher versus prior year. the increase was due to the investment in our global commercial team and training. we also had lower incentive comp in the quarter as compared to last year. in q1, operating income grew 30% to $61 million, translating to an operating margin of 29.2%. margins expanded 320 basis points due to higher volume, lower incentive compensation and timing on r&d project spend, with some shifting into q2.
gaap net income for the quarter was $89 million or $1.93 per diluted share versus $1.95 in q1 of '19. net income decreased 1%, driven by our tax rate, which was positively impacted last year due to excess tax benefits associated with our equity compensation. we also booked a $40 million pre-tax gain in the quarter for our investment in shockwave. excluding the impact of excess tax benefits and the shockwave gain, eps grew 28% year-over-year.
in the first quarter, we generated $65 million of operating cash flow, an increase of 39% versus prior year. as you know, q1 is typically a slower quarter on cash due to our seasonality and incentive compensation payouts. our balance sheet remains debt free, and we ended the quarter with $527 million of cash in marketable securities.
today, we also announced a 200 million share buyback program. this new program is a result of our proven ability to generate strong, consistent operating cash flow in our conviction of abiomed's long-term outlook. the share buyback program is in addition to our ongoing practice of using cash to cover withholding taxes on vested employee-restricted share units, of which we spent over $100 million in the last 18 months. with that said, our number one deployment priority continues to be investment and our internal growth programs and distribution, which we believe will generate high returns for the shareholders over time.
before turning to guide -- before turning to our update on full-year guidance, i'd like to remind investors of the seasonality of our fiscal year. q2 is typically a slow quarter for cardiovascular devices due to the summertime slowdown in the cath lab and physician vacations. as a result, and like years prior, we expect q2 revenue to be slightly down versus q1. given our performance in the first quarter and what we have forecasted in q2, we are revising our revenue guidance and now expect to be in the range of 15% to 20% for the fiscal year. we also expect operating margins to be in the range of 28% to 30% for the year.
as mike mentioned, we made progress on our actions that were discussed in the last earnings call, but understand that it will take some time to make the adjustments that we feel will better the -- position the company for the company for the longer term.
so in summary, we remain confident in our investment thesis. with new products, new indications and new countries on the horizon, we believe we have a path to long-term, sustainable growth. coupled with our strong profitability and robust balance sheet, abiomed is well positioned for the future.
operator, please now open the line for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from raj denhoy with jefferies. your line is now open.
raj denhoy -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning. i wonder if, maybe i could just start with a point of clarification, you guys used to break out i think us impella sales separately out of a total us number. i'm not sure if you gave that in the scripted remarks, i don't think it was in the press release. so can you give us the total us impella sales?
mike minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure, raj. in the quarter impella revenue was for the us $164 million and service was about $7.8 million.
raj denhoy -- jefferies -- analyst
okay, perfect. i guess the other question is just on the outlook here because i guess you guys have kept guidance the same, the low end of the range of 15 to 20, but it still does imply a little bit of a pickup in the back half of the year. and when we think about sort of last couple of quarters and i guess we've sort of now come to maybe believe this narrative that is just sort of difficult to get additional doctors to use the technology, additional cardiologists particularly in pci it seems with the 5% you reported this quarter. so i guess the question is around the confidence you have that what you're doing is going to accelerate that growth profile and whether it might be something a little more deep in terms of needing additional clinical data or other things to get more cardiologists onboard to using impella?
mike minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
so raj, thanks the question. we had a stronger quarter for cardiogenic shock and in the past we have seen a seesaw affect, but not to this extreme. but what we've learned over the last two quarters and starting in march is that we need to have high-risk pci programs at hospitals that are identifying and recruiting patients in the community that are -- either have advanced coronary disease or turned down for surgery. and as a result we've had individual users and champions that do multiple types of patients, but we haven't been able to get deep enough for the high-risk programs. so that when that person is either doing another procedure or is not in attendance, other physicians will either choose to treat the patient with protected pci or not turn the patient down or try to get in and out.
one of the benefits of watching the development of the heart team with tavr is really looked at the lessons learned on how they've developed a program. so the physicians are deep in the hospital, there is a funnel and a system in place to identify back then all the 80-year olds roles that have aortic stenosis, and then get them referred into the different hospitals. in our case, we want to leverage the same approach. the majority of our patients are much younger. so on average they are 69 years old, but we've really got to have a program versus individual physicians and there's two types of physicians. there are those physicians that are comfortable with tavr. so the access closure is not an issue. and then we do also acknowledge that there is a next wave of physicians that require a little more training and education around access and closure and there are those that are just dedicated to protected pci. so those three buckets or where we're working there a little bit of different messaging, but the best thing we have right now that gives us this confidence as you mentioned, is the protect iii data. and i think the opportunity to protect iii is first to tell the story that in protect ii impella lowered major adverse events. second is that impella lowered mace, it also these showed from discharge to 90 days, a statistical difference in those irreversible endpoints of death, stroke, mi and repeat procedures. and in protect iii, we continue to show that we can treat a sicker patient population many that have no other options and what we see is positive outcomes and most important these patients have an improvement in their ef which gives them that quality of life that they're entitled to and that should be the ultimate goal of protected pci.
raj denhoy -- jefferies -- analyst
that's helpful. maybe just as a follow-up. and i don't even know if there is an appropriate answer to this, but when you think about that group of cardiologists who maybe aren't as comfortable using the impella, you know, this next wave of doctors, if that's right way to put it. is there a way to characterize what is the major push back. is it the difficulty in using the impella access and closure as you've described it or is it something deeper maybe it's data or belief in the technology. is there any way that you can maybe parse out what the biggest push backs are in additional adoption.
mike minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
there is and i think there is no one-off or any one item, but, so for the doctors that are comfortable with tavr and access of large bore, their focus is time management, prioritization and making sure they have pci time as well as tavr time. for the next wave of user that's doing pci, they're not comfortable with access closure, the biggest push back for them is the fear of vascular complications and bleeding. and the way we approach them is starting with education in the protect ii data set, so the fda study impella had numerically the same vascular complications as the intra-aortic balloon pump and both had zero percent damage to the aortic valve. and so that's in an fda audited dataset. so we start with the training, what we've also demonstrated and continue to publish it from the original protect ii to now, we've been further able to reduce bleeding. and if you look at protect ii, the initial bleeding rates in balloon pumps studies has been 4% to 14% whether it's elective or high-risk pci.
and what's happened with the impella is it in 2008 we started at 11% for protect ii, but by the end of the protect ii study, we were in the 7% range. with the stemi dtu recent study, so this is a population of patients that are having a heart attack and they're being rushed, we had a 6%. but we really believe that on the elective cases with training and education, we can be at or below what the intra-aortic balloon pump was in the protect ii study in 2008. so as we start to train and go through access closure, different techniques, and we have an online tutorial manual that's on the interventional cardiology society website called scai, we're now getting into looking at the risk of bleeding and or the concern or fear of it versus the benefits of being able to do a complete revascularization. and we feel very confident that the results and education and training is really going to end up with outcomes, similar to the way tavr has brought down their bleeding outcomes. our difference is, we have a 9 french catheter in it and a 14 french motor head for the cp, whereas the tavr is started at 21 and is 14 french all the way through.
so we think we're going to get as good or better. it gets a little more complicated when patients go to the icu and so that's the other part of our training, but in the end, we think we can train that fear away. we can educate that fear away. and long term, we plan to innovate that away with the expandable sheath and the impella ecp. but one final point on the challenges of going through this is the benefit of impella is it's a unique one of a kind technology that's supported by our 600-plus patents and 600-plus patents pending. we do have an exclusive and first of its kind indication for high-risk pci. so that's the benefit, the negative is we're the only ones truly creating the protected pci market, truly talking about the benefits of complete revascularization for a population that probably half do not get to the cath lab today.
whereas in shock, it's more intuitive and there's many pharma and med-tech companies around both stemi and cardiogenic shock, whereas protected pci, we have to create a tavr like market individually as a single company.
raj denhoy -- jefferies -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from jayson bedford with raymond james, your line is now open.
jayson bedford -- raymond james -- analyst
good morning. just a few quick questions here. i wanted to ask about pricing and i bring it out just from the standpoint of, it looked like usage growth of 14%, which was quite strong and i realize there's a comp issue here with fewer new hospitals added, but i'm just trying to put that 14% with what looks like about 8% us impella growth.
todd trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
hi, jason, this is todd. i'll take that one. so as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are opening less sites and we opened up 73 fewer sites, which again impacted sales by about $3 million or 2% versus prior year. the other headwind that we had in the quarter was slightly a lower reorder rate versus prior year. so in q2 of '19, we had a reorder rate of about 103%. in this quarter, it was still a healthy 101% and where we have seen slightly lower reorder rate was really in the impella 2.5 and that makes sense, kind of given where we are transitioning to cp with smartassist at some of these sites. so again, as an organization, i mean, we're focused on that patient utilization number, that 14% in the quarter. again, which was about 1 point ahead of where we were last quarter.
jayson bedford -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and maybe a broader question, has there been any change in the breadth of growth in the us. more specifically, large versus small centers, new versus more established centers and have you seen an impact from the broader sales distribution?
mike minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
jason, one of the things we've seen is that we do have some centers that have big programs and they do -- they have high demand focus and they do, they do a lot of everything. so whether it's high-risk pci or structural [phonetic] heart they move back and forth. and so for an example, after we had an expanded fda label on high-risk pci we did see a bit of a bolus of high-risk pci and tavr's seen a little bit of a bolus the last two quarters on the anticipated approval and then approval of the low-risk patients.
and what we hear is the physicians want to capture kind of the bolus of patients in their community ahead of other hospitals, that would also apply to mitral valve enlargement. so what we need to do is identify whether they're big or small. we need to train a deeper bench of physicians that essentially prioritize and specialize in high-risk pci programs alone and they're out there. so for example, some other -- some of these other physicians that are in that bench, they want to get trained, they want to get comfortable with the access and the closure and they are not necessarily going to be tavr operators and their core skill set is really around pci. and as we're identifying those we're linking that to a current study we have called restore ef, and that's a single-arm study that's under way and it's with expert pci physicians and what we want to do is continue to validate these best practices in the real world and again show benefits of improvement in ef which has been demonstrated in all of our fda studies.
to our knowledge, if you look at stenting or angioplasty studies with the fda, you don't see a permanent improvement in ejection fraction or the quality of life for these patients. historically, you do see symptomatic relief, relief of pain in the chest, but with an impella supported pci to be able to achieve an improvement in ef gives that quality of life that these patients are looking for and it's why open heart surgery with cabg has been the gold standard, because you do establish complete revasc and these patients also see an improvement in ef.
so as we continue to work with these restore ef centers, these physicians that are utilizing the best practices, they are almost an analogy or they are much like the ncsi investigators that are utilizing the best practices for cardiogenic shock and we can continue to leverage the restore ef physicians to put out case studies and share their best practices for other physicians that want to get more hands on and more online training.
jayson bedford -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, that's helpful, mike. i'll keep it to two and jump back in the queue.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from chris pasquale with guggenheim. your line is now open.
chris pasquale -- guggenheim -- analyst
thanks, good morning guys. mike. i'm curious whether at this point, you have any sense of the impact smartassist is having on the business and if you look at the sites where it's being introduced is it impacting utilization at those sites. it's a tool that i would think would lead to more ubiquitous use of impella at sites that are adopting it. i'm just curious if you're seeing any of that?
mike minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
so, chris there is an impact. so number one, it is positive, the ease of use is there, the physicians are -- they now get information on weaning and the icu nurses, as well as the heart failure community in the icu gets to really understand what's happening to a patient. and that's a positive. we do see a somewhat of an increase in utilization with it. it's too soon to tell if it's sustainable, but part of it is when they get a new technology they were going to our top sites first, or they were already some of our bigger growers. now there is a downside to it which is maybe that it does require a lot of time and energy and coordination, because we've got to take the consoles back, then we've got to train the techs, we've got to train the icu. it is a bit of a distraction and it's worth it because we believe we're going to get better outcomes and more adoption, but it has been a bit of prioritization that we have to manage as a company.
and then the second important on the complexity is this hub-and-spoke network that we continue to try to maintain and leverage. so for example if patients are out in the spoke hospitals and the patient is then sent to the hub, we have to make sure that both sides have the new smartassist, the new consoles, and are trained appropriately. so that's been a bit of a challenge for us. but that's also why the new heads, the -- more management in the field and what i'd call right-sizing our distribution allows us to kind of anticipate that and manage it a little better.
chris pasquale -- guggenheim -- analyst
thanks, that's helpful and then just two updates on the clinical pipeline front, if you could give us any update on where the stemi trial stands, how that's going. if you think the original timeline there is still reasonable. and just curious, ecp has been sort of just over the horizon for a while now. when you think you'll get into first in man there? thank you.
mike minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. so two things, we anticipate our first in man stemi patient, what i would say is this month, in the next probably three weeks, we've had a lot of great progress. we've got a good executive committee of physicians, there is tremendous excitement and we'll give further updates on that in the future. that would be one of the subjects of our upcoming investor day that we'll have likely in april, may, which -- we'll announce that in the future. and on ecp, we feel confident, we're making good progress there and we expect to have our first in man by the end of our fiscal year in the march timeframe. i'd reiterate that is a game-changing product , because it's a 9 french all the way through and it's ideal for high-risk pci and as all of you have surveyed many times many customers, you know, that people are a little intimidated with the larger motor head, even though the impella has a 9 french catheter. but when you talk to physicians about a 9 french all the way through pump, you'll hear immediate positive responses, talk about adoption, and really that's the second half of the market that we'll get to as well.
chris pasquale -- guggenheim -- analyst
thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from danielle antalffy with svb leerink. your line is now open.
danielle antalffy -- sv8 leerink -- analyst
hey, good afternoon -- i'm sorry. good morning, thanks for taking the question. mike just wanted to follow up on the smartassist contribution and just curious how we should be thinking about that as we look at our models going forward? i mean it sounds like that will be a growing contributor. i assume that would have been in the service other revenue now included in impella. so just trying to think about how to think of those two separate lines as we go forward.
mike minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure, danielle, smartassist is not being charged for, our inherent belief is it will allow us to get better outcomes, it will make the management of the patient easier, and that will help us drive more adoption. clinically why it's so important is because when a patient is on smartassist, we're able to look at the pressure in their left ventricle, we're able to understand and in the future potentially predict some right heart failure. so we're going to integrate some of those algorithms. and essentially it gives the physicians for the first time real-time information about managing a patient. so although we're not in the majority of all our sites yet, we think that as that rolls out it has an overall positive impact. but there is some hiccups and there is some challenges with rolling this out while we're focusing on growth, but we're going to continue to try to take big chunks out of it each quarter.
danielle antalffy -- sv8 leerink -- analyst
understood. okay. so it's not actually, you're not generating revenue from that. that's helpful. and then one really quick question, well actually might not be so quick, but just curious how the conversations you're having with the sort of next wave of the doctors that are skeptical about the data, how is that conversation going. how much do you need to show them to bring them over the fence and get them to be a believer? is it a matter of just like, hey we'll hold your hand while you try this and getting them comfortable with the device itself and that gets them more comfortable with data.
can you talk a little bit about how those dynamics are working as you approach these sort of this next wave of physicians that have been using it, but not as much as they could or should? thanks so much.
mike minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. so i think the first part of the conversation, talks about the patient population that's in the cath lab today and how they could potentially do a better procedure. and the second part of the conversation is the patients that are out there that they don't get that they could potentially treat in the cath lab, the surgical turndown patients. so for the first part about the quality metrics and how they can improve is we put some information out in collaboration with some of the different groups and research firms that show some of these areas improvements. so for example, for all of pci for patients that get triple vessel disease, only 55% get complete revasc, that means 45% of the patients get incomplete revascularization. and if you get incomplete revascularization you actually don't get the benefit of the pci, you likely won't see an improvement in their ef and with complete revascularization, and this is published and well accepted in med analysis, you see a 30% to 50% reduction in mace. in the protect ii with dr. popma, we recently published and released the data is showing the exactly that, that if you've got complete revasc, you had a much better outcome rather than the control arm.
so that's the number one goal of doing high-risk pci. the second is about 14% of patients in the us are staged. and some of them are staged for the right reasons, some of them though they are staging them because they are worried about either too much contrast or the patient's stability on the cath lab table and unfortunately many of this staged patients don't come back for a second procedure. so the goal of restore ef, of our top physicians utilizing the best practices, is they are really focused now on doing complete revascularization in a single setting.
now you have the real concern about acute kidney injury, which is a significant problem for pci, tavr and cabg, and it's about 7% to 10% of all these patients or for pci get aki but for the high-risk pci population is around 50%. so we've got very compelling information and data and there is a sub-study in the protect iii data further demonstrating the ability of impella to reduce aki for these patients. and then last, we talk about and this is clearly demonstrated in the protect ii study is the quality metric of readmissions and in all pci cases, you'll see anywhere from 12% readmission rate for pci at 30 days and up to 25% at six months. so there is tremendous room for improvement for high-risk pci. and so what we're trying to do with physicians is look at their benchmark data at their centers and look at ways that we can improve that. and then on the second population that's out there is a tremendous number of patients that have advanced coronary disease. there was an article or a publication in jama yesterday and there was an article in the wall street journal demonstrating that for the first time they're acknowledging that from 2011 to 2017, there is an increase in heart failure, there is an increase in mortality in heart failure and there was an increase in mortality in heart for people that are aged 45 to 65.
so this is, that means the curve is now sloping back up and heart failure remains the number one killer and if we're going to treat these patients, we believe you treat them by doing complete revascularization with protected pci or you try to keep them alive and recover their heart muscle if they're in cardiogenic shock and in the case of heart failure, with tools like the impella 5.5 or the study like the stemi, we think we can prevent people from going into heart failure in the future. so that's just to the conversation.
danielle antalffy -- sv8 leerink -- analyst
thank you so much.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from margaret kaczor with william blair. your line is now open.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
hey, good morning guys. thanks for taking the question. and the first one from me and it's kind of got two pieces to it. first, it sounds like you're really identifying the use [phonetic] in the market for protected pci and you're trying to address them but granted they might take a little bit of time for those investments come to fruition. so maybe the first question is does guidance assume that high-risk pci growth improves this year and can it return to that double-digit growth.
and then second, from an operational level, how are you incentivizing the the organization to double down on trading for that second category of docs that you mentioned, when it seems like shock is actually reaccelerating pretty nicely right now. does that group maybe require more time or is it just education and training dollars on your part? thanks.
mike minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
margaret, the inherent belief about the growth returning in high-risk pci is purely based on the clinical need and the massive population, there is at least 121,000 high-risk pci patients today that have an opportunity to get better care, get treated with the cath lab with impella. and the indication itself for high-risk pci is a first of its kind and it also is based on our fda approval and our technology is the only fda-approved devise for high-risk pci. and then there is an additional 300,000 plus patients that are either turned down for surgery or don't want to have surgery and can get a benefit of protected pci.
so those numbers are very large, and if you look at any data sets or you talk to any physicians there is general acceptance that coronary disease is still the number one killer. even in tavr, there's papers demonstrating that if you do it -- if you do tavr on a patient that -- but if you leave ischemic disease or blocked coronary arteries, you also have a higher mortality at one year versus if you treat that patient and you treat them to get complete revasc. and then the second component is just going through and looking at the quality metrics of readmissions. what's unique about the protect ii study was that's the first time we looked at outcomes at 90 days and not at discharge and these physicians want better outcomes for their patients. the referring physicians want better outcomes. and so looking at the success rate of getting off the table is really not the end goal. the end goal is at 90 days later that patient's home and feeling better after having a minimally invasive procedure to address their heart failure symptoms.
so i think organizationally that -- those are the things we're going to lead with, the training data in time, and then from an incentive or a program or access that next wave, we are stepping up our training and education will be doing more online, and we'll be doing more tutorials and proctoring in the future at sites that have dedicated programs.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
okay, great. and then in terms of the expandable sheath. can you guys give us an update on timing and the regulatory process on that. and then when that does launch, is it going to take a little bit of time to train folks are pretty straightforward? thank you.
mike minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we've done 16 patients outside the us, we're working on that timeline right now, but to remind everyone, it's a 510 (k). so the regulatory process is a lot shorter and it's going to be utilized with the already fda, pma approved device and we're planning to bring into the market in the optimal time frame to ensure that we get great outcomes.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
thanks guys.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from david lewis with morgan stanley, your line is now open.
david lewis -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, good morning. just two for me like. mike appreciate the -- us revenue growth was slower than patient growth and i know, i appreciate your commentary around the drivers there, but do want to follow up on the commentary about lower reorder rate. can you kind of walk through in the us, what are some of those factors that are impacting lower reorder rate and then i had a quick product follow up.
todd trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, david, this is todd here, thanks for the question. i think when it's all said and done if i look at the products, the reorder rate by products, i mean the one that jumps out is really the 2.5 and that's slightly above -- below 100% as we stand here today, and again the big driver of that is just when we're rolling out smartassist at some of these sites, i mean they're just -- they're waiting the cp, it's just a much better pump. so we're seeing a little bit of a lower reorder rate on the 2.5. again, it's still a healthy overall over 100%. so some of it is just a little bit of timing at this point in time.
david lewis -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. but your comfort with the level of inventory that's in the us channel right now?
todd trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
yes.
david lewis -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. and then mike post tct and frankly for the last six months, you've been very focused on reducing barriers to access and reducing bleeding and thanks for the ecp update, you've also talked continuously about the expandable sheath and i kind of thought that was a product that comes out before the ecp.
what is the timeline for getting the expandable sheath into the us market? thanks so much.
mike minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
today with the expandable sheath is a 510 (k). we've done, we've done 16 patients. i'm not -- i haven't given the exact time, it's going to be as soon as possible, and it will be out before the ecp in the us, and it will be first in europe and then we'll come to the states. it's likely not as challenging for the impella 2.5, we just want to make sure we get it right for the impella cp because we want people to have the option, also to close the cp at a 9 french -- with a 9 french device. so that's our goal, that's what we're working on and we feel relatively confident that that will be on the market as soon as possible.
david lewis -- morgan stanley -- analyst
and this next year, is fiscal '20, a possibility for the us for that product?
mike minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, the goal is to have something in europe next year for sure. and the goal is to have a portion of a limited rollout, limited release in the end of next fiscal year in the us.
david lewis -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from matthew o'brien with piper jaffray. your line is now open.
matthew o'brien -- piper jaffray -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions. you know the quarter i think it was pretty good versus what [indecipherable] or thinking about versus, you know, what -- i think some people were thinking about. you reiterating guidance, we kind of push and everybody to the low end of the range i think is also going to be welcomed by investors but it does -- it is kind of a steep back half ramp sequentially. so i would love it if you could just deconstruct a little bit and you might be met with a little bit of skepticism just because it is so big sequentially. the last time you did this kind of sequential growth in the back half of the year was coming off of the national csi registry out at tct and the call to action. so you seen about $20 million sequential increase q3-q4 just for easy math and that's what we saw back in fiscal '18. so how do people get comfort that you're going to be able to deliver that type of performance, is it protect iii, is it 5.5, rp getting better at the same time as you're still building out the sales force in that group.
todd trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
so thanks, matt. good question. this is todd. i'll jump in. so again our range does imply some improvement in the second half of the year. and first, we have, i would say that normal seasonality where we've done typically 54%, 55% of the year in the second half and then as we mentioned on the call, we had some new product launches and investments that should drive some lift in the second half. so smartassist, which is the largest product launch yet for abiomed.
we did receive the fda pma approval in september for the 5.5. so we have that limited market release in the second half. so we expect to see some lift from some of these new product introductions and then quite frankly some of the investments that we're making in the us distribution structure around field leadership team should start yielding benefits in q4 and beyond. so one of the things to just mention is we do have some easier comps. i mean last year in the first half, we grew 37% and in the second half it was 24% and really the comps get easier in the fourth quarter. so i think it's a combination of all those things where we firmly believe that why we guided toward maintaining the 15% to 20% but guided toward the low end of the range.
matthew o'brien -- piper jaffray -- analyst
okay. and then the follow-up question would be just in japan. you've got the first thousand patients treated with impella. i'd love to hear just a little bit about -- the results there were really good. you know the performance in japan has been really good. but what can that data do for you to just continue to see really strong performance out of japan for the next maybe couple of years?
mike minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks for the question, matt. we've been very focused in japan to think about this for the next 10 plus years. japan does not necessarily utilize heart transplants. culturally they're opposed to sternotomies and heart transplant concept, they do them but an extremely small number. and the country of japan matches our focus around recovering hearts and saving lives. so as we've rolled out and really focused on the training and the execution and utilizing the best practices from ncsi and in europe, we're very pleased to see that for ami cardiogenic shock the survival to explant matches our top sites in the us and most important, the majority of all these patients, more than 90% are able to go home with their native heart.
so as we establish heart recovery as the standard of care in japan with the cp now being launched, we really have the ability to transform the focus. in japan the intra-aortic balloon pump is also a class iii indication, which means it's harmful and not recommended to be used. so they've already implemented and analyzed the data that's out there for the last 40 years. and so they are moving forward with impella and we're very pleased. and what it means is that the second largest market in medtech in the world will become our second largest medtech market and it will likely also help us drive more success throughout asia.
so i do, i'm really proud of what that team has done, we've got some great champions with the physicians there and we expect to see a plethora of clinical publications and further validation of heart recovery.
matthew o'brien -- piper jaffray -- analyst
got it. thank you.
mike minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the abiomed second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. at this time all participants' lines are in a listen-only mode. after the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions].
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, ingrid goldberg, director of investor relations. thank you. please go ahead ma'am.
ingrid ward -- head of investor relations
good morning and welcome to abiomed's second quarter of fiscal 2020 earnings conference call. this is ingrid goldberg, director of investor relations for abiomed and i'm here with mike minogue abiomed's, chairman, president and chief executive officer and todd trapp vice president and chief financial officer.
the format for today's call will be as follows. first, mike minogue will discuss second quarter business and operational highlights and then todd trapp will review our financial results, which were outlined in today's press release. after that, we'll open the call to your questions. before we begin, i would like to remind everyone that our presentation today includes forward-looking statements as it relates to discussion of our outlook. the company cautions investors that any forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that are not guaranteed in the future.
actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. these factors are described under the forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-k and 10-q filed with the sec. we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
with that let me turn our call to abiomed's chairman, president and chief executive officer, mike minogue.
mike minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks ingrid. good morning, everyone. in the second quarter abiomed delivered $205 million of revenue, up 13% year-over-year with an operating margin of 29.4% driven by continued strength in cardiogenic shock and overall growth in germany and japan. we executed on us distribution initiatives. our fda post-approval studies and received fda approval for impella 5.5.
we are pleased that this quarter, we released data demonstrating our best clinical outcomes overall, for high-risk pci, cardiogenic shock and right heart failure by utilizing our training and best practices. in the united states while cardiogenic shock was solid with 22% growth high-risk pci was light at 5% and we are now leveraging the protect iii data to drive utilization.
our innovation and our ability to improve clinical outcomes remains the driver for impella adoption through a function of training, data, and time.
for today's call, we will provide an update on the following. first we will discuss the progress that we have made around us commercial organization. second, we will highlight positive new clinical data for high-risk pci, cardiogenic shock and right heart failure. and third, we will discuss our recent fda approval of the impella 5.5 with smartassist and plans for the us launch.
so i'll start with our us commercial organization. on the last earnings call, we discussed the adjustments we are making to our us distribution model and the creation of more regional leadership positions to go deeper with customer relationships and implement our strategy. we are pleased to announce that with a healthy balance of internal promotions and external hiring, all zone general managers and regional directors are now in place. we also have expanded roles for front-line sales and clinical managers and approximately 80% are now in place. these new field leaders will face the normal learning curve and be responsible for building active impella programs, expanding users at existing sites and leveraging our hub-and-spoke network.
turning to new clinical data for both high-risk pci and cardiogenic shock multiple positive data sets were released at tct, highlighting optimal treatment pathways with impella that enable complete revascularization and improved patient outcomes. on the first day of tct dr. jeff popma from beth israel discussed data from the protect iii study, which is our ongoing prospective single-arm fda post-approval study for high-risk pci.
protect iii followed the protect ii randomized controlled trial and included 898 patients enrolled at 45 us sites. comprising more complex and high-risk patients protect iii demonstrated improved outcomes and lower mace at 90 days. patients in protect iii were statistically older at 71, more often women, received longer support and had more complex procedures with more vessels treated relative to protect ii. yet the 90-day mace rate in protect iii was lower with 17% mace versus protect ii's control arm at 31% and the impella 2.5 arm at 22%.
the protect series is now the largest data set in the world for hemodynamic assisted high-risk pci and spans 13 years of clinical practice. replays of both the physician breakfast and annual tct investor event are available on our website and at protectedpci.com. our studies and real world experience continue to demonstrate that impella assisted pci can enable better outcomes for patients like jim houge.
jim, a 67-year-old grandfather struggled with such extreme weakness and fatigue that he could barely walk from the parking lot to the field for his grandsons' little league games. he went to spectrum health and grand rapids, michigan, where a diagnostic catheterization revealed severe blockages and poor heart function with an ejection fraction of 25%. jim was referred to the advanced heart failure clinic where he was identified by the heart team as an appropriate candidate for protected pci. covered by cms, dr. david wohns and dr. kevin wolshlager [phonetic] implanted the impella 2.5 heart pump to support jim's weak heart while they placed multiple stents.
jim was discharged home one day later and within two months his heart function had returned to near normal with an ef of 55%. today, jim feels better than he has in years, attended our summer headquarters event at abiomed, and now climbs to the top of the stands to cheer on his grandchildren. this is the true benefit of protected pci and complete revascularization.
turning to cardiogenic shock updated data from the national cardiogenic shock initiative was also presented at tct, showing 250 consecutive patients from 49 sites demonstrating survival of 72% percent at discharge with 98% receiving or having native heart recovery. this compares to the historic rates of 50% survival without heart recovery as noted in the earnings slides posted today. based on learnings from the iq database, ncsi, cardiogenic shock working group and the cvad study, investigators are now instituting additional escalation protocols for left and right heart support that will be applied in the cath lab immediately after an impella supported pci.
this new escalation protocol allows physicians to identify and reduce future risk factors responsible for patient mortality within 72 hours of cardiogenic shock. we also recently announced with a press release that impella rp post approval outcomes now match the pre-approval study for patients meeting the fda study protocol. additionally this quarter abiomed announced the procedural outcomes data on the first one thousand patients treated in japan . protocols in japan were developed based on best practices learned from patients treated in the us and europe. today initial outcomes in japan mimic that of top us hospitals with 87% survival to impella explant with 90% heart recovery in the ami cardiogenic shock population. it is rewarding to see the profound impact of impella on patient survival and heart recovery across the globe.
moving to our product portfolio, we'd like to briefly touch on the significant milestones that we've achieved during the quarter. we continue the commercial launch of our smartassist platform, which improves ease of use for patient management and has weaning algorithms to optimize survival and native heart recovery. impella cp with smartassist is now being used in 328 of our 1401 cp sites. additionally, we received fda approval, pma approval for impella 5.5 with smartassist .
impella 5.5 provides a minimally invasive forward flow fully unloading heart pump to treat shock patients with acute or chronic heart failure and fills a significant clinical gap for a growing heart failure population. designed for heart surgeons the 5.5 is indicated for the treatment of all forms of cardiogenic shock and delivers peak flows greater than 6 liters per minute 45% shorter and thinner than the impella 5.0, the 5.5 is approved for up to 14 days and 30 days in the us and europe, respectively. we are excited to announce today that we've introduced the impella 5.5 in the us through a limited market release with over 10 patients treated in october at some of the best heart hospitals in the world. cedar sinai in la, cleveland clinic and hackensack hospitals. i believe this product is a breakthrough for heart failure. in conclusion, we've made progress on our key initiatives, but we still have more work to do.
we are a stronger and more advanced company today than ever before. we have just announced our best clinical outcomes across all indications and our innovation continues to improve and expand to optimize native heart recovery with smartassist. the last six months have driven us to adapt to the external noise and focus on internal execution. we will regain our momentum based on our flywheel of innovation and improving clinical outcomes. i personally have never been more confident that impella will become the global standard of care for high-risk pci, cardiogenic shock, stemi and heart failure
i would like to thank our employees and customers who put patients first every day and our shareholders for their continued support.
i will now turn the call over to todd.
todd trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, mike, and good morning everyone. in the quarter, we delivered revenue of $205 million, an increase of 13% on a reported basis versus a tough comparison of 37% growth in q2 of last year. by region, us revenue grew 9% to $172 million, driven by a 14% increase in patient utilization. in the quarter, we opened 62 sites compared to 135 last year, which impacted us sales by $3 million or approximately 2 points of growth.
outside the us revenue totaled $33 million, up 43% on constant currency driven by continued strength in both europe and japan. in the us at the end of our fiscal q2, the impella 2.5 and cp are in 1401 sites. the impella 5.0 has been placed in 624 sites, while the rp is currently in 498 sites. the number of site openings in q2 was the same as q1 as we continue to prioritize patient utilization and physician training at our existing sites. q2 reorder performance was solid with a rate slightly above 100%. average combined inventory at the hospitals for the impella 2.5 and cp was approximately 4.5 units per site. again consistent with the inventory levels we saw last quarter.
outside the us, we continue to see strong growth in impella adoption. in q2 our european revenue increased 27% in local currency, due to higher patient utilization in germany in both high-risk pci and cardiogenic shock and further adoption in other countries like switzerland, austria and italy. additionally, the controlled rollout in japan continues to gain traction as we generated $9.6 million of sales in the quarter due to new sites and patient utilization.
we opened 17 sites in q2 and now are in approximately 100 hospitals with 135 hospitals currently approved by the government. it is worth noting that we do expect to open fewer sites in the second half of the year as the team closes out the post-approval study and prioritizes a broader cp launch, which will require additional training at existing sites.
moving to key financial metrics. gross margin was 83% in the quarter compared to 83.6% in the prior year. the year-over-year variance was driven by the smartassist launch and sales mix, which more than offset plant productivity. we introduced smartassist at approximately 180 sites in the quarter and we continue to receive very positive feedback from our customers on this new technology. in the quarter, r&d expense totaled $24 million, an increase of 6% from the prior year, driven by our ongoing investments in clinical research, including stemi and our post-approval studies in the us and in japan.
we also continue to fund our pipeline of products such as the expandable sheath and impella ecp a true 9 french expandable pump ideal for high-risk pci procedures. sg&a expense for the second quarter totaled $86 million, 9% higher versus prior year. the lift was driven by the investment in our global commercial team, incremental physician training and marketing programs. we expect more investment in sg&a in the second half of the year as the commercial team continues to grow and we provide additional us field training for all zones in early november.
in the quarter, operating income grew 20% to $60 million translating to an operating margin of 29.4%. margins expanded a 170 basis points due to higher volume, productivity, and timing related to some r&d spend, which shifted into the second half of the year. we delivered strong margins, while making what we believe are the necessary growth investments. this highlights the benefits and leverage of our business model.
gaap net income for the quarter was $13 million or $0.28 per diluted share versus a $1.09 in q2 of '19. the year-over-year variance was primarily driven by a mark-to-market adjustment on our shockwave investment, which equated to an after-tax non-cash charge of $35 million or $0.75 per diluted share in the quarter. our tax rate for q2 was 24.7% versus 3.3% in the prior year due to $13 million of excess tax benefits in last year's reported rate compared to only $500,000 in the current quarter. excluding the impact from shockwave in excess tax benefits, earnings per share grew 27% year-over-year.
we also had another strong quarter on cash as we generated $74 million of operating cash flow, an increase of 23% from the prior year. the balance sheet remains debt free and we ended the quarter with $551 million of cash and marketable securities.
in q2, we bought back roughly $35 million of stock in the open market under our share repurchase program. however, our number 1 capital deployment priority continues to be investment in our internal growth programs, which we believe will generate higher returns for the shareholders over time.
based on our performance in the first half of the year and our projections for the next 6 months, we are maintaining our revenue guidance of 15% to 20%. that said, we acknowledge that the strategic actions we are implementing will take time and therefore are anticipating being toward the lower end of that range. additionally, we are maintaining operating margin guidance of 28% to 30% for the fiscal year.
so in summary, we are confident in our overall strategy in both the technical and clinical advantages of impella. there is no other product like impella and no other fda approvals for this patient population. we continue to see improved patient outcomes and build powerful clinical data like protect iii and ncsi. with new products, new indications and new countries on the horizon along with our strong ip portfolio of over 715 patents and 620 pending, we have a path to sustainable growth. coupled with our profitability and strong balance sheet, abiomed is well positioned for today and the future.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of raj denhoy from jefferies. your line is now open.
raj denhoy -- jefferies & company, inc. -- analyst
hi. good morning. what if maybe i could follow-up, todd, with what you finished with there just kind of on the trends over the near-term. i'm curious how things fell out over the months of november, december, early january. are you still in a period where you're seeing demand lower than you would expect and you're expecting a pickup or have you already started to see a resumption, may be a growth that gives you confidence that the fourth quarter will be a bit better?
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, raj, for the question. so, as i mentioned, we did see -- started seeing the covid resurgence in mid-november, and it did. i would say, escalate in december, and even further, i'd say, escalated probably toward the end of the last two weeks of december, and in the first few weeks of january. and so, yeah, both new cases and deaths. and so, for us, the impact on the hospitals in the procedure volumes because of patient fears and icu capacity. so, i think, like i said, it did accelerate toward the end of december and into feb and into march -- i mean, into january right now. and so, that's really what we're seeing from a trend perspective.
with what we've seen in the past, raj, is we know that when we do see these blips like we saw in q2 with florida and we saw a little bit in q3 in the southeast and the mid-atlantics is that, when we see blips, the patients typically come back, and again, the timing of it's tough to call, but we do expect to see some of these patients that we're missing in january come back in february and into march as well.
raj denhoy -- jefferies & company, inc. -- analyst
okay.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
and, raj, just to be clear, the forecast, the range i've given, 9% to 14%, it takes into effect what we saw in the month of january.
raj denhoy -- jefferies & company, inc. -- analyst
okay. helpful. and i just wanted to ask mike one question to you, just on ecp and the timing there. so, you're moving into this next phase, five more sites, you mentioned 15 patients. maybe you can offer just in terms of how this continues to develop beyond this sort of pilot study now, what a pivotal looks like, and what really the timing is when ecp could get kind of fully approved? and maybe also as a corollary to that, as you expand in these kind of follow-up studies, what it suggests in terms of the number of sites you will have access and how to think about that becoming a more important product for you?

raj, thanks for the question. i'll give you as much as we can confirm. no, we don't have a prudent prediction yet with the fda on the final study. we have to work our way through. the good news is, this is a breakthrough product. the first five patients went very quickly, and we submitted to the fda and they approved based on the data we provided that it was -- it hit the marks for safety. we're now in the pilot phase. so, we're now going to do another five centers, so we'll have 10 centers total, and we'll go to 20 patients total, which looks like, if you remember, protect i, which was a 20 patient population. so after that, we'll submit again with a pivotal where we'll target high-risk pci patients. we do not have confirmation about the size of that or, whether or not, we randomize to our own products or we're just going to compare to protect iii. we'll work directly with the fda. but what you'll be then looking at is how does the device do as compared to impella on adverse events for access closure and safety to the valve because the concept and the indication of high-risk pci has already been awarded to abiomed through impella. so it really will be then comparing the differences between the two devices and their ability to maintain hemodynamics.
that being said, i think we're ahead of everyone's timeline from what people thought was going to happen with ecp. that has to do with great execution by the team. great collaboration by the fda and a real demand and interest by our customers to have a true 9-french device for high-risk pci.
raj denhoy -- jefferies & company, inc. -- analyst
great. thanks. i'm going to squeeze one last one. and just you gave some statistics around impella connect, the 600 sites there, that are currently using that feature. is there any you can offer in terms of utilization in those sites that have adopted that cloud-based architecture versus those that haven't? are you seeing more pumps in those being used?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
so, raj, it's hard to kind of just compare it because you're biased in that, our top centers started first. but historically, yes, we've seen more usage, and most important, we've seen better outcomes. and we've seen less certain user errors. so, historically, if a site had our support and then got impella connect, we always saw a bump in outcomes, partly because it was more collaborative, and we are working with them, partly because they knew they had access to real-time information. and what's new is, we're able to help with identification of right heart failure, which obviously sometimes can be something that can be fatal for the patient and may not get picked up early. so we're now utilizing the software and suction alarms and looking at patterns that be able to predict or look at right heart failure. so we're excited about it. again, most important, it's improving outcomes and ease-of-use, and that is what drives a technology to be the standard of care.
raj denhoy -- jefferies & company, inc. -- analyst
great. thank you.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of matthew o'brien from piper sandler. your line is now open.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking the questions. just, i guess, mike, for starters on 5.5 that number in the quarter was obviously very strong. can you talk about any stocking that went on versus utilization? and then more importantly, what can 5.5 do from a growth trajectory perspective, maybe over the next couple of quarters just on its own, and then potentially bringing other interventionalists in to use cp or rp or whatever it may be, maybe this year and even in the next year?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's a good question, matt. let me walk you through. so the 5.5 is smaller and thinner than the 5.0. it's a new technology platform. it also has a sensor on it. so it's actually easier to place to the axillary artery or if the chest is open for a patient coming off a heart-lung machine after open-heart surgery, they can drop it in direct. and it's designed for surgeons. and so, there is a huge demand for a minimally invasive weanable full pump and that's what the impella 5.5 is. part of the new population that we can treat with it is this acute on chronic patient population. so we estimate conservatively there is another 100,000 of these patients in the us that's a subset of the almost 2 million class 3, class 4 patients. so that's an exciting component.
now, we are opening new centers, but we don't tend to put a lot of inventory on the shelf because we don't do consignment. and we are seeing just a strong growth in utilization overall. and most important, we're seeing the best outcomes historically documented for acute on chronic heart failure patients. anecdotally, we've even had patients that have been on extended support and seen recovery of their kidneys. so those are exciting trends.
and then from an overall perspective, at your -- second part of your question is working back and forth with interventional cardiologists, we do see our top centers the cedars, the cleveland clinics, the northwesterns, the tops, i can go around the country, top heart hospitals where they combined and they partnered as a heart team. the covid trend that we're seeing in 2020 is there is more surgical turndown patients going to the cath lab, so we want to collaborate that heart team approach so that you can do a protected pci, reduce the length of stay for the patient, reduce having to stage the patient for two procedures. so that's a good benefit. we also see the benefit of escalating those acute on chronic patients or those ami shock patients that need more on the left side, and we'll have more of a longer duration of weight, where they're going to want to get up and walk around. so that's worked well, but in order to anticipate and collaborate and promote that more, we've created a distribution designated for the heart surgeons and heart failure, and we've actually also added a heart failure physician in the company as well. so we're excited now for that next opportunity of those acute on chronic patients. we also think that the unloading will have a profound impact on both acute and chronic renal failure for some of these patients, and we do see this benefit, we see this heart team collaboration.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
matt, if i could just jump in and add. matt, if i can just add a few numbers. as we started to open it up the 5.5 sites in q3 of last year, so we opened up 26 sites last year, so obviously we opened up a few more, a little -- 10 or 11 more this quarter. so, most of that, i would say, the growth in the 5.5 is coming from patient utilization. i mean, obviously, a little bit from site openings, but most of it's coming from patient utilization.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. really helpful. appreciate that. and then, mike, i know there's a lot going on between now and btr with sheaths and ecp, but your comment on, i think you said first in man a year from now is interesting to me. is there any way just generally speaking to frame-up the process of studying that pump and how long it's going to take, and what are you going to compare it to an lvad or anything along those lines because that's obviously an enormous new patient population for you so the comment that you're getting close to first in man there is compelling to me, so i'd just love to hear a little bit more about that?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. matt, the 5.5 allows us to treat cardiomyopathy shock patients, those acute on chronic. so these are heart failure patients that have worn out hearts as compared to a patient that has a first symptom of a heart attack going into shock and ending up in the cath lab, where they're going to open the blocked artery. so this is more of that heart failure population, and we feel very confident that extended unloading has a benefit.
now, the impella 5.5 is not labeled for six months of use, even though we've had patients go a long period of time, and in the engineering labs, it will run consistently for more than 500 days, but you have to stay at the hospital. so it's really testing the benefit of unloading. and we do see benefit in four to five and six weeks of unloading. for the btr, you're now talking about something that can do a similar type of unloading. and if you remember, it is an lvad. but unlike the today's lvads you don't have to do a sternotomy. you don't core out the left ventricle, the apex of the heart and take out the muscle fiber and deplete coronary flow. the device goes across the valve and pumps with the heart. so it's ideal to wean off. and with the sensors, we're able to see what's happening to the patient and wean off appropriately or optimally looking at wall tension.
the other exciting thing is, there is future adjunctive therapies, whether it's entresto, which is a great drug, whether it's stem cells or other things to come, and a duration of unloading through the axillary artery combined with other things, we believe is going to get a lot of these heart failure patients back. the opportunity is enormous because it's really going to target the class 3 population that hasn't fallen off the cliff yet and become class 4. and there is tremendous new science coming around the benefits of unloading, as well as some of the hormonal connections between the kidney. so, more to come on that.
from a timeline, we'll wait and see, but we already have patients that are going on devices for extended period inside and outside the us. and while we're not approved for bridge to transplant, based on unos, a many of them will get a transplant in three to four weeks, and they go right on to a transplant with a virgin sternum. they've been up and walking around because it's implanted through the axillary in the shoulder, and it really opens up now an opportunity for chronic heart failure that hasn't been out there before.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst

thank you. our next question comes from the line of chris pasquale from guggenheim. your line is now open.
christopher pasquale -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
thanks. hey, guys.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
hey, chris.
christopher pasquale -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
mike, first, i was hoping you could update us on the expected approval timing for the cp-compatible xr sheath. i thought i heard you say that you are working on both the 510(k) and the pma supplement for that product, so some clarity on the regulatory path there would be helpful, too.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
chris, the impella 2.5 is the only device that has the xr sheath, if i think you cleared on it, and we're not doing anything different to the pump itself. with the impella cp, we will be pursuing the xr sheath with the 510(k) clearance, but we also will continue to enhance the product to make that even a better device. so when we change the impella components or change anything on the impella cp, that's a pma supplement. and you should expect that will be done in parallel, and you should expect that will continue over an extended period of time.
christopher pasquale -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
okay. but when you're going to be able to have the xr sheath compatible with the cp, is that still targeted for early fy'22?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's probably more than second half, but again, there'll be other things coming on top of it. so we're going to go after both. so you should first see an xr sheath clearance, and then you will also see some changes to the product to make that product work better with the xr sheath and those will be pma supplement, which should start in the second half of next fiscal year.
christopher pasquale -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
okay. and then, todd, i don't think i heard the break down between high-risk pci and shock in the us this quarter. i'm just curious, given the ebb and flow with covid headwinds, whether there was a differential performance between the two segments of the business.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. chris, good question. i think for high-risk pci, in the quarter, it was relatively flat. and from ami cardiogenic shock, it was down 2%. one thing to point out and i mentioned in my prepared remarks, cardiogenic shock had a really strong october last year where i think up over 30% for the month of october. and so, some of it is just more comps than anything else, and then, obviously, we had from a high-risk pci standpoint a little bit of the impact last november, december from aha. so i think it's more of a comp issue than anything else, chris, at this point in time.
christopher pasquale -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
that's helpful. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of danielle antalffy from svb leerink. your line is now open.
danielle antalffy -- svb leerink -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. thanks so much for taking the question. todd, just a question for you on guidance. just wanted to see if we could get some color from you around what's reflected at the low-ends and the high-end as it relates to covid recovery? and then i have one follow-up on margin.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
sure. thanks for the call -- question, danielle. so normally, as you know, we don't provide quarterly guidance, and we're just trying to be transparent with investors as much we can in this uncertain environment. so, as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, i mean, we do continue to see covid resurgence impacting the pace of recovery, especially in january across, i would say, mostly us and europe. so, however, as we've seen in the past, when these -- when we see patient utilization impacted, we normally see a recovery again, although, the timing of it is tough to call. so, at the low-end of my range 9%. we just assume that we see a slower pace of recovery throughout the quarter from where we are today. the high-end of the range, 14% assumes some of these impacted cities and regions snap back a little bit quicker, and we get to that 14%. so that's really consistent with my guide last quarter. it's low-end is slower recovery, higher-end it comes back a little bit faster in the quarter.
danielle antalffy -- svb leerink -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then, my next question on margins, you guys have been doing a great job on the margin side of things, another quarter of really strong operating margin, sorry. and you are investing more and you have been. and, i guess, i'm just curious as you start to reramp revenues as we get out of covid, hopefully, sooner versus later, how to think about the operating leverage going forward, particularly since you've been investing, even during this time you've been able to deliver strong operating margins? thanks so much.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, danielle. so, i think as you -- if i look out like next quarter and quarter beyond, i think we'll continue to see the absolute dollar increase, our opex with revenue. as you think about next quarter, for example, we do typically see higher payroll taxes and fringe as the calendar year starts over. and we're going to continue to invest in r&d. and so, i think we should stay somewhere in that 15% of sales as our clinical trials begin to ramp like stemi and p-4, and we continue to invest in the new products like breethe, and btr, and the sheaths, and ecp.
so, i think as you go forward, you'll see our opex creep up. we'll continue to spend more, i would say, on physician education, camp pci, and more on marketing programs. so, i think you'll see a bounce up a little bit over the next couple of quarters and that's all i could say at this point in time. we'll provide more color obviously at our next call with regard to margins for the next fiscal year.
danielle antalffy -- svb leerink -- analyst
thank you.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of jayson bedford from raymond james. your line is now open.
jayson bedford -- raymond james -- analyst
hi. good morning. just a couple of quick questions. can you help us reconcile the growth in europe, meaning procedure growth versus dollar growth? and, i guess, maybe, todd, could you quantify the fx impact there? and was there any stocking-related to the revenue growth in europe?
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
yes, jason. good question. i would say, from an overall, europe grew 12% on a reported basis. from an fx perspective on an organic basis, it was closer to 4%. so we had a pretty big tailwind from fx. last year, euro rate was around $1.11 versus average of $1.19 for the quarter. so, i would say, about 8 points were due to fx. so, patients were up, and i guess, at mid-single digits. high-risk pci was up 4%, shock was up 6%. and i would say, that's sort of the reconciliation.
we saw some nice performance, i would say, out of switzerland, germany, italy, continue to see, i would say, patient growth in those areas, and they were being offset by some of the hardest hit countries like uk, france, and belgium, which were down obviously double digits. so, a little bit of uneven growth over in europe. but overall, pretty strong growth overall when you think about with covid and what's going on over there.
jayson bedford -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. and then, you mentioned the 48% growth in your surgical business. you gave us a lot of metrics. i don't want to be greedy here. but is there any way that you could give us an approximate size of that surgical business or maybe just even the split between 5.0 and 5.5 in the us?
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, the overall, the split, it's about 15% of our business, jayson. and i can -- and without getting into the details, i would tell you that the 5.5 is growing over 300% and the 5.0 is declining. so, it's 5.5 becoming a bigger part of our business today, and we expect that to continue as we go forward.
jayson bedford -- raymond james -- analyst
is the 5.5 contribution bigger than the 5.0 contribution?
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
yes, it is.
jayson bedford -- raymond james -- analyst

thank you. our next question comes from the line of chris cooley from stephens. your line is now open.
christopher cooley -- stephens inc. -- analyst
thank you. good morning, and appreciate you taking the questions. lot of great detail this morning, and appreciate the transparency or the added transparency, i should say, here as we go into the fiscal year-end. but, todd, i guess, my first question is just simply on the guidance. can you talk about your expectations there when we think about the surgical franchise versus high-risk pci? should we kind of -- are we looking for similar trends here in the fiscal 4q where the growth is really being driven by these great outcomes you're achieving in the shock population, as well as now with the growth in the rp in conjunction with treatment of covid-19? and i just got a quick follow-up.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
so, chris, i want to make sure i just understand your question. is it more around what do we expect in q4 from a growth by surgical versus high-risk versus cardiogenic shock?
christopher cooley -- stephens inc. -- analyst
yeah. moving the slide [phonetic], looking at the mix here, basically going forward to the fiscal 4q, obviously, you're going to benefit from growth in the 5.5. i'm just trying to think about when we see a reacceleration to kind of abiomed or old abiomed-type growth in the high-risk pci segment as well.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
well, i think the mix of business that we saw in really in q3 will continue into q4 without getting into details by product, but i expect to see another strong quarter out of our surgical business, both the 5.5, and rp, and the 5.0. so i expect to see our surgical business continue to perform well. and we do expect to see ultimately at the end of the day high-risk pci and cardiogenic shock snap back from where we are right now and get better in february and march.
christopher cooley -- stephens inc. -- analyst
understood. and then maybe just a quick clarification here, mike, in your prepared comments at the outset, you mentioned direct-to-consumer marketing, both on the tv side, as well as through digital media. just i was trying to get a better feel for the scope of that kind of how that would roll-out and why now? thanks so much.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, chris, for the question. we have had selected commercials over the years, where we align in with protected pci centers. what we're doing now is really more of a general awareness campaign where we're partnering with the local hospitals. we're talking to the society, specifically, scai, is the intervention cardiology society and the chairman of scai is dr. cindy grines. and so, she has given several talks on the benefits of treating these essential patients and the need. scai also conducted a survey -- a national survey, and it showed that patient anxiety was keeping people from going to the hospital. one of the points was 51% of the people in the survey did not feel comfortable scheduling a medical procedure during covid-19. so, we're running these commercials. we're getting positive feedback, both for the hospitals, our customers because again they are general awareness, but allows us then to connect those patients that need to be treated.
and to be clear, our high-risk pci patients are not elective. they are essential. they're classified by cms and by the societies as essential because these people are having chest pain, and in many cases, they are admitted to the hospital. and what i would remind our investors that we try to be so transparent and give you as much detail as we can on our patients. there is a gray area between a high-risk pci patient and urgent patient that has non-stemi that's admitted to the hospital decompensating and someone having in ami going into shock because of a blockage or because of a virus. so, we always give you the top numbers. we try to break it down, but there is certainly now a blending of all of those together. and again, these people need to be treated, and they have a high mortality rate if they're not treated. and so, that's what the message is for, but we have stepped it up, and we're going to maintain it into the next fiscal year because we think it's very helpful overall.
christopher cooley -- stephens inc. -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of marie thibault from btig. your line is now open.
marie thibault -- btig -- analyst
hi. good morning. thank you for taking the questions. just one sort of high-level question for you here to start. as we think about abiomed 2.0's movement into the green phase here, is it fair for us to think about post-covid abiomed being able to return to sort of the mid-teens procedure growth we were seeing in the us before some of the disruption in late calendar year 2019? just want to get kind of a feel for how you're thinking about ex-covid performance?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
that's a good question and a normal question. so, first of all, what we want to do is, we want to outperform the rest of our peers. so, we want to have positive growth and then the best metrics on gross margin, operating margin, and of course, some of the best clinical data coming in and pursuing new indications, new products. so, we've got lots of catalysts. and as that happens, we will maintain a lot of the benefits that we implemented during covid with abiomed 2.0. things that make us better are training, education, regulatory submissions, clinical studies. and we do think we will have a lot of catalysts. catalysts on the ecmo, which is new. catalysts on some new indications, going after this acute on chronic heart failure population. we'll be collecting more data and submitting for vt ablation in the ep lab. and then, of course, we've got the xr sheath to help minimize the access closure concerns. we also just have regular education on access closure showing that the rates now for bleeding and vascular complications can be below 2% with training. and then you have the ecp rp growth 5.5, and then you also have some new countries. so, we're excited, and we believe that we'll maintain that top tier growth formula. and we think that today we're a much better company because of covid and we'll get the benefits of abiomed 2.0 in fiscal 2022 and beyond.
marie thibault -- btig -- analyst
that makes sense, mike. thank you for that, and obviously, i'll hang on for fiscal 2022 guidance, try to be patient there. one follow-up then on international, the trend around japan looks to be sustainable given all the data drivers you have going on there and some of the best practices that are being put to -- implemented there. so, i wanted to check if that made sense as a sustainable kind of growth driver going forward? and then, see if i could get detail on the new countries that abiomed is eyeing next? thank you.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
so, marie, you're correct. i mean, japan had a really strong quarter at over $12 million of revenue, up 38%, most of that was driven by patients. patients were up 37% in the quarter. so, again, we've opened up 156 sites. we still have another -- up to another 350 to get into. so we do expect to see a long sustainable growth in japan. again, for us, we're -- it's about getting the best patient outcome, so we can have, be the standard of care there for the next 10 years. so we're very excited about our performance in japan and more to come in that area.
in terms of countries outside, it's -- the next one is always tough to call, right? we are planting seeds in a lot of different countries around the world. if you think about singapore, and hong kong, and india, and the middle east, and there is just a variety of them. and so, the gating item for us in these countries is reimbursement. so, we'll typically go into these countries, work with some of the key opinion leaders, work with the physician societies. and just, it's a long sales process. so it's hard to call, but we are planting a lot of seeds, and we still have a lot of growth to go ous besides our top three countries that we're focused on, which are germany, us, and japan.
marie thibault -- btig -- analyst
thank you for that, todd.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of margaret kaczor from william blair. your line is now open.
margaret kaczor -- william blair & company -- analyst
hey. good morning, everyone. thanks for squeezing me in here. wanted to maybe follow-up a little bit about the cloud and the real-time monitoring that you guys referenced on the front end of the call. so, number one, i know at this point, you guys are sort of giving away the connected system, but how frequently can we expect new software launches for the program? and would you charge for some of those new features? and then, i guess, more specifically, if we look at calendar '21, what kind of updates should we look for, whether kind of just generic or more predictive algorithms?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
margaret, thanks for the question. and just to clarify, sometimes it's a confusing thing for some investors is smartassist, all the software we have on the system itself allows us to when we log in to see that and to utilize that and talk to the physicians about that, it helps us to predict things, such as potential right heart failure. impella connect, once the information is in the cloud and it's streaming, it allows us to do artificial intelligence and collect the data. and so, that can be done at a quicker pace. that means on some of those tools, we can do it from our phone or ipad. we don't have to go out to every single center and log and add that software to all the consoles.
and so, the analogy i give is smartassist is cobra kai and impella connect is netflix. and so, we're going to strike hard, and we're going to try to do everything we can at the hospital bedside with smartassist, but the ability for artificial intelligence to take data from all over the world on our patients and match it with outcomes to explant will give us tools in the future that we may add for or may add to charge for, but currently because of covid everything is given away. all the hardware has already been put in our cost of goods. that's why we have 500 sites. we just have to turn on the wifi, and we know that making ease-of-use and better outcomes is the formula for success, is the formula for adoption.
longer-term, we will have some new models for ai. we might have new models guaranteeing certain outcomes, whether it's improved ef or high-risk pci or reduction of readmissions for high-risk pci, or maybe even better outcomes. and if someone commits to follow the protocols and report that data, we can provide more of these ai tools. so, it's a lot of opportunity. we already have a very good gross margin. we're already profitable. so, we're going to do things that would make the best sense for the patient and our customers because, again, we believe we're going to be the standard of care for high-risk pci and shock in the short-term, and then we're going to expand on all these other indications later.
margaret kaczor -- william blair & company -- analyst
okay. so, if i could follow-up on that, and then another follow-up question. so, number one, should we assume kind of new updates, specifically over a four-quarter period and does it matter, i guess? do you need new add-ons, new shows to add on to the system?
and then as you're thinking about launching some of this, is it about convincing new clinicians in the accounts to use the system or is it about expanding the number of patients currently, existing trained clinicians, expanding the number of patients that use abiomed? thanks.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
margaret, our strategy number one is to make our team more productive and flexible and get better outcomes for the patients. so you can imagine in a covid environment with restrictions, it's a pretty great tool when our clinical rep in the field all of a sudden gets a text, and it tells them that there is a patient on support at this hospital, they can click on the button, and they can see the console immediately and watch how the patient is doing. so, as they drive to the hospital or as they get a call from the physician, in real-time they're looking at what's happening. so that's the big part.
ai is certainly gaining a lot of traction in the medical community. really the only challenge is people that have cybersecurity concerns, and what we do is, we explain to them that the impella connect and our software is fda approved, it's hipaa-compliant. it's a one-way transmit out so that it's not hackable back in. and we just got to continue to work with them, and it allows us to really do a great job of connecting their outcomes with their questions. and on the same impella connect portal, we can look up a patient, meaning a physician. we can look up how they've done in the past, what type of patients. we can look up hospitals. it gives us a level of information that allows us to help them improve their outcomes and that's the key these tools and the software. it's really ease-of-use and better outcomes. but the level that we go down is to start with our benefit to our people, benefit to the physicians, and we just have to overcome a little bit of the it fear at the hospital.
margaret kaczor -- william blair & company -- analyst

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the q3 2021 abiomed's earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, todd trapp, vice president and cfo. thank you. please go ahead, sir.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, and welcome to abiomed's third quarter fiscal '21 earnings conference call. this is todd trapp, vice president and chief financial officer, and i'm here with mike minogue, abiomed's chairman, president and chief executive officer.
the format for today's call will be as follows: first, mike will discuss third quarter business performance and operational highlights; and then i will review our financial results, which were outlined in today's press release. after that, we will open the call to your questions
before we begin, i'd like to remind everyone that today's call includes forward-looking statements. the company cautions investors that any forward-looking statements involves risks and uncertainties and are not guaranteed in the future. actual results may differ materially due to a variety of factors identified in our earnings press release and our most recent 10-k and 10-q filed with the sec. we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
with that, let me turn the call over to abiomed's chairman, president and chief executive officer, mike minogue.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, todd, and good morning, everyone. at abiomed, we continue to remain both focused and committed to our mission of recovering hearts and saving lives despite the challenging covid environment. i want to thank our employees and our customers around the world and recognize their determination and efforts under these circumstances.
abiomed delivered a record quarter of $232 million in revenue, up 5% year-over-year. we generated revenue growth in the us and double-digit growth in europe and japan despite the covid resurgence. operationally, we were disciplined and focused on executing our fiscal year tactical plan with multiple regulatory milestones and two first in human clinical studies. we achieved a 31% operating margin while investing at record levels of $33 million in research and development. our balance sheet strengthened to a robust $788 million in cash while maintaining zero debt.
we also achieved a significant milestone this quarter as we surpassed over 1,000 impella patents, and currently have 851 patents pending. we believe abiomed has one of the strongest ip portfolios in the medical device industry.
in summary, we executed our plan and had a solid quarter. for today's call, i'm going to provide three updates. first, i will outline our transition to the green phase in q4 by leveraging our abiomed 2.0 covid playbook. second, i will highlight the robust clinical data released in october. and finally, i will discuss our momentum with new products and regulatory approvals. so first, as a reminder to investors, we designated a three phase red, yellow, green approach for fiscal year '21 to address the evolving covid-19 environment. in the q3 yellow phase, we were focused on the acceleration of abiomed 2.0 as we endured the pandemic. this enabled us to achieve our tactical plan and reduce the covid impact on our commercial performance. these initiatives were accomplished without sacrificing our commitment to employee health or safety.
we ramped up our on-site antigen and pcr testing in both danvers, massachusetts, and aachen, germany for early virus detection and administered thousands of covid tests. this proactive testing reduced employee anxiety and allowed us to get production back to full capacity to build essential lifesaving heart pumps during a record quarter in our 40-year history as a company. because we provide essential patient support and training to our hospitals, more than 25% of our us field team has received the covid-19 vaccine from their local customers. we look forward to that number growing as the vaccine becomes more available in the months ahead for headquarters employees.
in q3, we executed on the milestones we control and grew revenue across all geographies. as a whole, hospitals today are managing better than they have previously during the pandemic with more testing, better protocols, and vaccinated caregivers. this allows for better patient management and treatment of both covid and non-covid patients. however, the virus resurgence in mid-november impacted utilization, especially in the us due to icu capacity and patient anxiety about seeking in-hospital treatment. at this point, we believe our abiomed 2.0 covid playbook will allow for a green phase transition in q4 despite the early january ramp up in covid cases. this playbook allows for patient monitoring in the cloud and makes our people more productive and valuable for the hospital.
our impella connect online capability is now live at 686 hospitals in the us, and there are an additional 500 ready-to-connect once hospitals approved wifi access. today, more than half of our us patients are monitored in the cloud with impella connect. this enables best-in-class 24/7 support on-site, on-call, and online.
as part of our abiomed 2.0 playbook, we monitor global and local trends at a state, city, and hospital level on impella usage, new covid cases, and icu capacity. this enables our flexibility with our people and resources to adapt quickly to essential patients. we have been working with physician societies, as well as hospitals to reinforce the importance and benefits of treating essential high-risk in cardiogenic shock patients. also, we are investing in educating the public with both online and broadcast tv commercials to encourage patients to seek treatment for their heart disease.
turning to my second topic, new clinical data. in october, at tct connect, we received and reviewed a robust set of clinical data showing improvement in outcomes. for high-risk impella-supported pci, data from protect iii, and restore ef demonstrated statistically improved outcomes, including better safety and improved heart function post-treatment. the improvement in heart function with more complete revascularization is now objectively proven in high-risk pci with impella support. the protect iv physician executive committee has locked the study protocol and we have already initiated site visits with first patient enrolled targeted for next quarter q1. we are grateful to these physician experts for the last year of study design work and affirmation of protected pci best practices.
for cardiogenic shock, we continue to see improvements in survival, validated using best practice protocols, such as placing the impella before the pci and minimizing inotropes. these best practices have been generated over the last five years and were derived from multiple prospective physician studies and real-world evidence, including fda studies. these 2020 updated cardiogenic shock best practices now include early identification of right heart failure with smartassist software and escalation to bipella support with impella rp. within the quarter, impella rp revenue grew 21% versus prior year due to strength in patient utilization and expanded fda emergency use authorization for covid complications, including pulmonary embolism.
recent studies in both italy and japan have also contributed to the validation of our cardiogenic shock protocols. as a countrywide initiative, japan now has one of the highest survival rates for cardiogenic shock in the world, 77% survival and over 90% native heart recovery in survivors. to note, just four years ago, the culprit study from top european heart hospitals published in the new england journal of medicine reported a 50% survival for cardiogenic shock patients using all devices as salvage post-pci. these higher survival rates contributed to japan's sales performance up 38% in revenue year-over-year despite covid.
moving to regulatory approvals and new products, our third and final topic. we made significant progress with two 510(k) clearances and two first in man studies completed within the quarter. we received 510(k) clearance for ecmo breethe oxy-1 system and treated our first eight patients with a mix of v-v, v-a, and ecpella cases in the united states. the feedback has been positive, highlighting the ease-of-use, portability of the console, and early mobilization.
additionally, we achieved two important milestones toward breaking the small-bore barrier to reduce physician access and closure concerns. first, we completed the first five patients from our us fda early feasibility study for the impella ecp, a true 9-french pump ideal for high-risk protected pci. this safety data was submitted to the fda and approved as sufficient data to support the expansion of the impella ecp trial to five more hospitals and 15 more patients.
second, we received 510(k) clearance for the impella xr sheath with the impella 2.5 heart pump. we treated eight patients with the xr sheath outside of the us in q3 and have now transitioned the majority of our focus to the impella cp for both 510(k) clearance and pma supplements. the xr sheath has flexible nitinol braids that momentarily expand during impella delivery then recoil, reducing closure challenges and complications at the access site. these milestones are important steps to drive ease-of-use, expand our customer base, and continue to drive better patient outcomes. however, it is important to note that bleeding and vascular complications in protect iii, our fda study, were less than 2% for both showing the technical and clinical progress made over time with training, education, and innovation.
our surgical platform continues to deliver strong performance, driven by the impella 5.5 with smartassist. our impella 5.5 is a minimally invasive forward flow, fully unloading heart pump designed for heart surgeons to implant directly with the chest open or through the axillary artery to avoid an invasive sternotomy. we created a dedicated surgical and heart failure team focused on heart recovery for acutely decompensating heart failure patients in shock. this week at the surgical fts conference, dr. ed soltesz from cleveland clinic presented data from a large study of 356 impella 5.5 patients at 16 hospitals in the us and germany. the study found a 79% survival rate with the majority of surviving patients recovering their native heart. in q3, our us surgical business grew 48% year-over-year, driven by strength in patient utilization. we have now treated more than 1,000 patients with the impella 5.5 and it's demonstrated an improvement in patient outcomes compared to historical rates.
while the impella 5.5 has exceeded a runtime of more than 500 days in our engineering labs, the impella btr pump is designed for -- designed to run for more than one year, and allow for home discharge with patient metrics in the cloud. the impella btr pump is now one year away from our anticipated first in human study. both 5.5 and btr have ideal designs because they are minimally invasive via the axillary artery and pump with the heart providing optimal weaning capability and improved forward flow to the kidneys.
i would like to end with the patient story from this summer. in august, chavez adams, a 29-year-old lawyer from north carolina tested positive for covid-19 and quarantined for two weeks. in september, chavez developed a fever and went to his local urgent clinical care, where they found his heart was racing above normal, and he passed out. chavez was immediately admitted to wakemed health with an ejection fraction less than 20% and went into cardiogenic shock. dr. neupane and his team determined chavez was experiencing cardiogenic shock from myocarditis likely due to covid-19. the impella cp was implanted to allow his heart to rest. after three days of support, the impella was weaned and explanted and care was covered by blue cross blue shield. chavez returned home with his native heart and now has a normal heart function. today, he is back at work and enjoying an active lifestyle with his wife, ashley.
in conclusion, abiomed, with our dedicated customers, continues to improve patient outcomes documented in global clinical studies which are posted on our website as we advance our product portfolio and best practices. as we enter the final quarter of fiscal year '21, we remain focused on achieving our tactical plan and transitioning to the green phase. abiomed is a stronger company today than before the covid pandemic and is uniquely focused on recovering hearts and saving lives for growing high-risk populations.
we are excited to close q4 as abiomed 2.0 and enter fiscal year '22 with our best-ever clinical outcomes from existing products, existing indications, and existing countries. next fiscal year, abiomed will expand into new products, new studies, new indications, and new countries. i'm sincerely proud of our employees and grateful to our customers who put patients first every day. we also appreciate the continued support of our investors and remain focused on growing shareholder value.
i will now turn the call over to todd.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, mike, and good morning, everyone. as mike mentioned, in q3, we delivered a record revenue quarter for the company of $232 million, an increase of 5% versus prior year. while our business continues to be negatively impacted by covid-19 trends, we were able to deliver positive year-over-year revenue growth in our top three markets by sticking with the priorities in our covid playbook, remaining focused, and leveraging our strengths for operating in this uncertain environment.
by region, the us reported revenue of $189 million, up 2% versus prior-year, primarily due to positive sales mix. us patient utilization was down 2% year-over-year. however, we had tough comps last year in october, especially for cardiogenic shock.
as mike mentioned, the covid-19 resurgence impacted continued recovery in patient utilization during the quarter. we started to see a broad-based impact from the resurgence beginning in mid-november. our ability to track covid cases and icu capacity at local levels enabled us to see trends between higher new cases and icu capacity and the impact utilization, and recovery. during the quarter, we were able to adapt and saw some areas began to recover.
at the end of december, in the us, the cp is now in 1,492 sites. we have placed the impella 5.0 in 660 sites and the impella 5.5 with smartassist is now in 158 sites, up 37 sites versus prior quarter. we believe that all 1,100 heart hospitals will acquire this breakthrough technology. our controlled rollout of the impella 5.5 continues to deliver strong performance as our us surgical portfolio reported a 48% increase in revenue versus prior year.
the impella rp is now in 569 sites, up 17 sites versus q2. rp had a strong quarter with revenue increasing 21% versus prior-year, driven by patient utilization. as a reminder, in july, the fda issued an eua to expand the use of impella rp to include patients suffering from covid-19-related right ventricular complications, which is a great validation for this life-saving device.
in the quarter, the reorder rate was 104%, the same percentage as the prior year. average combined inventory at the hospitals for the impella 2.5 and cp was approximately 4.7 units per site as compared to 4.6 in the prior quarter.
outside the us, revenue totaled $43 million, up 18% year-over-year. our european revenue increased 12% versus prior-year, driven by higher patient utilization in several key markets, including germany, switzerland, and italy, and a benefit from the euro-us dollar foreign exchange rate. within the quarter, both high-risk pci and cardiogenic shock grew mid-single-digit.
in europe, we started to see an impact from the covid resurgence early in the quarter, when certain countries began issuing national lock downs. however, we were able to pivot our strategy and began to see some recovery in patient utilization in mid-november through december. the covid pandemic continues to remain uncertain with differences by country on the timing of the recovery.
in japan, we had another strong quarter and delivered $12 million in revenue, up 38% over prior-year, driven by higher patient utilization. we opened 14 new sites during the quarter, bringing our total to 156 sites out of the potential 350 impella hospitals. we did see an impact in november as covid cases began to rise. however, we saw some recovery in december. japan's performance has remained more resilient than other countries during the pandemic because our patients are mostly in cardiogenic shock. japan also has been able to leverage their best practice protocols in the covid environment in order to treat shock patients, recover their native hearts, and deliver record survival rates.
moving to key financial metrics. our gross margin was 82.3% in the quarter, up 30 basis points compared to the prior year. the year-over-year variance was driven by higher production volumes, which more than offset the investment to accelerate the rollout of impella connect. one of our main objectives in our red, yellow, green approach to navigating the covid environment is to continue innovating and investing as we execute our strategy and our tactical plan. during the third quarter, r&d expense increased 29% versus prior-year to $33 million. we believe our targeted investments in technology in clinical data are critical for improving patient outcomes and sustaining long-term growth.
sg&a expense for the third quarter totaled $86 million, up 1% versus prior year.
we are managing our discretionary costs while continuing to invest in marketing and training programs, including camp pci in targeted advertising and to provide a safe environment for our employees.
in the quarter, our cost included over $0.5 million for covid testing and ppe for our people. this spend is being offset from lower expenses, such as t&e and trade shows among other postponed activities in the current environment.
in the quarter, operating income grew 2% to $71 million, translating to an operating margin of 30.8%. we delivered strong margins while making the necessary investments to support future growth.
gaap net income for the quarter was $62 million, or $1.35 per diluted share versus $69 million, or $1.51 in q3 of 2020. the year-over-year variance was driven by a mark-to-market on our shockwave investment and a lower effective tax rate. our tax rate for q3 was 23.4% versus 28.7% in the prior year, partly due to higher excess tax benefits in this year's rate.
our balance sheet remains very strong. we generated $79 million of operating cash flow in the quarter. we ended december with a cash balance of $788 million, up 32% over last year with no debt. our top priority for cash is to support organic growth initiatives and continue to build on our intellectual property advantage, which we believe will generate higher returns for our shareholders.
to continue to provide transparency during this time, we want to give our investors color on our top line expectations for our fiscal q4. in the first few weeks of january, the covid pandemic worsened further impacting patient utilization. however, as we have experienced during the covid era, we do expect to see recovery and patient utilization in revenue during the quarter. the patient population that we treat is high-risk, and our procedures are essential. although the timing is tough to call, we believe our covid playbook allows us to treat many of these patients as they work their way back into the system. also, we do anticipate a potential benefit as the covid vaccine becomes more widely available and infection rates decline. with these factors in mind, we expect q4 global revenue to be in the range of $225 million to $235 million, representing 9% to 14% growth compared to q4 of last year.
so, in summary, despite covid headwinds, we delivered a record revenue quarter. we believe that our focused strategy will serve us and our stakeholders well on our path to delivering long-term sustainable growth with new products, new indications, and new geographies. we are well-positioned for the future with the resources to invest in innovation and clinical data while delivering strong profitability with a robust balance sheet. we are optimistic about the future and the opportunity ahead as we continue to create the new field of heart recovery.
operator, please now open the line for questions.
",2021-Q3,ABMD

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of margaret kaczor with william blair. your line is now open.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. thanks for taking the questions. i wanted to start a little bit with guidance and then a bigger picture question. so first, can you provide any more clarity on march and april? and then as we look at kind of the q1 comments that you made, todd, it looks like -- and historically, maybe you're up 1% to as high as 6% the last several years. i mean, given that we're kind of on the back-end of the recovery and you're moving into the green phase, why shouldn't we assume that q1 maybe just a little bit better than that, given what we had seen in q4?
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, margaret, for the question. so if you think about the progression in q4, we did start off fairly soft in january that we highlighted on our last call and then we did see sequential improvement in february and march. i would tell you, if you look at just our high-risk pci performance in march, you can make an argument that there was a little bit of a bolus from procedures that were deferred, i would say, in december into january. so as it looks from an april perspective, we're not going to provide april actual performance at this point of time, i think we have factored that into the color we provided about q1 in our prepared remarks, that it would be flat to slightly above q4. but ultimately we think that's -- that makes sense at this point in time for based on what we've seen so far in april.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
okay, thanks. and then in terms of the beat, at least relative to our numbers, 5.0, 5.5 seems to do really, really well. any kind of color you can give there, differences in utilization accounts, maybe the upgrade to 5.5 from 5.0? or are you going deeper in accounts, given these product improvements?
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, mike's commented 5.0, 5.5, our surgical business was up over 40% in the quarter. so it continues to perform very well. we're in over 200 hospitals today. we'd expect that to continue. if you look at our patients, our patients are up substantially as well in 5.5, it's a great product and i expect to see that momentum continue into fiscal year '22.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
okay. and just kind of last one, again, kind of a little bit bigger picture, you guys have a lot of things out that you're investing in right now, whether it's the rcts, you've got the ecmo platform, even the shockwave investment on the side. there's a lot going on, ecp and the rest. as you think about kind of the next two to three years, how do you outline those various types of opportunities and what's the next thing that you're going to spend your cash on? thanks.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
so, margaret, this is mike. thanks for the question. on the big picture, we come out of covid-19 all-in on innovation, on clinical research and on distribution. and so i think you're going to continue to see that in the tactical execution. for innovation, you're going to continue to see the execution of these new products that are revolutionary, ecp, the impella connect, ecmo, ecpella, 5.5, bridge to recovery. i mean, these are -- this is the new innovation that's going to take heart failure and focus it on heart recovery. for clinical research, we're now taking all of the studies and the leverage that we've done and we posted a summary of the clinical studies on a slide in our -- on the website. but it's just we've learned now how to optimize high-risk pci, we've learned how to optimize cardiogenic shock and we've learned how to optimize survival and return to baseline for acute on chronic heart shock, so these are the cardiomyopathy patients.
and so those are the things we're working on. we think we're going to further our lead across the board. and, of course, we're going to solidify our patent position as we go. so we're very excited, because as i said in my prepared remarks, i do think we will have the path forward and create a new standard of care for high-risk pci, for stemi, for cardiogenic shock and for heart failure overall. so we're excited to be where we are coming out of the year.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
great, thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of chris pasquale with guggenheim. your line is now open.
chris pasquale -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
thanks, and congrats for nice finish to the year. a couple of questions. one just, todd, circling back on the margin guidance. that's down, obviously, from fy '21 down quite a bit from where you guys were in '19 and '20. i appreciate the investment, you guys got some clinical trial starting to ramp up here, but we're also coming off of the year in which r&d spending increased quite a bit. so just curious on the other elements of the investment there. what are you doing from a distribution standpoint that's different and will require significant step up? and do you view this as a one-year drop in the profitability and then you would start to see leverage again or is this a multi-year phase you're entering into?
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, thanks for the question, chris. when i think about our investments for this year, i mean we're all-in on our, what i call, growth enhancing investments. so it's innovation, its clinical evidence and its distribution. so when you think about innovation, it's smaller, smarter, more connected devices, ecp, the expandable sheaths, the ai algorithms. think about the investments we're making in btr, which again would open up another 100,000 patient population for us for heart failure and then continued investment in breethe. when i look at clinical evidence, it's really stemi, protect iv, the early feasibility study with ecp. i look at these as more digital events that require investment. they're not really long-term investments in r&d. so i think, over time, you will see r&d as a percentage of sales will moderate as we execute on our trials.
and then the third big bucket is around distribution. we are expanding our distribution team, chris. we are -- if you went back and looked at our performance over covid, we noticed that the smaller regions tended to perform better than some of our larger regions. so we've made the decision to go from 17 regions in the united states to 23. we started making that investment in q4, you'll see a little bit more of that investment in q1. so we are expanding our distribution team, putting more feet on the street and having more local leadership. we are expanding advertising in our direct-to-patient initiatives that mike highlighted in his comments, again targeting that 319,000 untreated population, utilizing protect iv. and then we're going to be doing a little bit more trade shows and education. so i think some of it in r&d and most of it in r&d is going to be, i would say, temporary over the next year or two. it's a big investment year for us. with that said, at our operating margin guidance of 24% to 26%, midpoint at 25% is still pretty strong, given the fact that we're driving 17% to 22% top-line growth.
chris pasquale -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
that's helpful, thanks. and then maybe just to follow-on there, you touched on this direct-to-consumer initiative, trying to get at some of these broader population of patients who could be appropriate for high-risk pci. but you're talking about patients who are undiagnosed, which always brings up questions about really the feasibility of getting at that type of population. it's not as if we're not looking for heart disease in this country. so how realistic is it to really bring those patients into the fold, especially since penetration of impella-supported pci within the diagnosed population is still relatively low today?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
chris, that's a good question and very insightful relative to why high-risk pci still remains out there. if you look at tavr when they started, they went out and identified the patients that were surgical turndowns. they weren't considered for the cath lab, because they didn't have the technology. the same is true with mitral as well as the watchman. when protect ii started, none of those patients went to the cath lab and nearly all those patients had already been turned down for surgery but not considered for high-risk pci. the exciting thing about protect iv and the engagement of the heart failure community and heart failure cardiology, specifically, is they don't consider pci in general practice and what they really look at is optical medical management or the invasiveness of a surgery, which many of these patients are turned down.
so moving forward, because they're involved in the design of protect iv and as one physician described it the other day in a broad presentation, he said the protect iv is essentially a heart failure study and what it does is it opens up another therapy for this growing population, these type 2 diabetes patients that have poor ejection fraction. they don't want or they're turned down for surgery and you can see a benefit with protected pci. what's unique about and what's new is that our protected pci patients show an improvement in their quality of life and show an improvement in their ejection fraction in 90 days. and so that's what's unique. and now that we look at the historic trends, when people do show up in the hospitals, they usually -- for these types of cases, they only look at it at the -- and try to look for coronary disease around 17% of the time and it's less than 5% of the time that people are actually getting revascularization in the index admission.
so there is a lot of opportunity there and it's not anyone's fault, it's just that the heart failure community has not been looking at or considering a protected pci solution, because in the past, pci did not improve ef. that was only done with open heart surgery with cabg. moving forward, that's something we've been able to show in multiple fda studies, protect ii, protect iii and also in restore ef. and that will be the gain and i believe that's why heart failure -- the heart failure community overall will get engaged.
chris pasquale -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of anthony petrone with jefferies. your line is now open.
anthony petrone -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks, and good morning. congratulations on the quarter. i hope everyone's doing well. i have one on reimbursement and one on protect iv. the first one on reimbursement is just sort of a rehash and a recap of the ipps proposals from earlier this week. maybe specifically on the proposal, the recommendation to shift high-risk pci out of 215 to adjoining codes, maybe just how, sort of, you're viewing that. it seems overall that this actually cleans up reimbursement going forward and maybe perhaps streamlines the process in future rounds. so maybe just some views there and then i have a follow-up on protect iv.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
anthony, thanks for the question. on cms and the reimbursement, we agree with your comments. we're pleased and we believe it now provides a permanent solution. what we've always talked about is that impella is a platform with multiple patients and so we positioned the products and the reimbursement and even in the future, some of the pricing. you have a four-hour pump per procedure, that's a high-risk pci. you've got a four-day patient, that's a cardiogenic shock patient in the icu on impella connect with smart algorithms, and you've got this acute on chronic shock patient, that's a four-month -- up to a four-month potential patient with the 5.5 and future btr pump.
so it definitely aligns completely with what we're doing. so, it allows for the differentiation for the type of resources and support that we provide. we do think it's a permanent -- more permanent solution and it also really aligns with our hub-and-spoke strategy. as todd mentioned, we saw that when covid hit, we saw a bigger growth in the small-to-mid-sized hospitals and regions. so we went a little bit leaner and a little bit faster by adding more regions and more team approaches. but we also saw in march a massive swing back in the large centers. and so part of that has to do with our hub-and-spoke coordination, where if a patient ends up in any cath lab, we're going to know about it, we're going to be there to support and we'll be in the cloud watching. but then we can also help monitor and work together with the top centers that do the most complex work with the spoke centers and we are -- and what cms also did was slightly increase our drg 268, which allows those outlying hospitals to place the impella, stabilize the patient and then make the decision if they want to send them to the high-end center.
the last piece of this has to do with our distribution. we are going to maintain this distribution overall in all the cath labs, but we do have a dedicated team now, that's a heart recovery team that's working directly with the heart surgeons and the heart failure cardiologists. we think that will help with the referral network. but it also allow us to go deeper to those transplant centers. there are about 140 of them that really do the most advanced work and those chronic patient care that we're excited now to bring 5.5, btr. and rp did rebound as well in this quarter. we're going to put smartassist on rp so we'll now get some of the information on a biventricular patient that has never existed. and we're going to make further improvements to the rp to ensure that the surgeons also have a way to utilize it. so lots of good things happening with cms. we appreciate the work and the thoughtfulness that they put into the final rule.
anthony petrone -- jefferies -- analyst
that's very helpful. and my follow-up on protect iv will be maybe just a broader view here and a sense on timing. it looks like you're targeting over 1,200 patients, 100 sites in europe, u.s. so i just want to get a sense of timing on enrollment and then maybe a question on the design, looking at dr. gregg stone, the lead pi, he mentions, obviously, the goal here is to operate on more complex cases and perform more complex revascularization and, mike, it brings me back to protect ii, when there was the rotational atherectomy arm. and so can you give us a sense if there will be cohorts based on specific surgeries and sort of how that will sort of evolve as this study gets under way? thanks.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
so, anthony, the protect iv study timing, we're not giving specific timing right now just because we want to get a few months away from the transition with the vaccines. we have described in detail the study, dr. chuck simonton did a webcast on it last year, so that's still up on our investor page. and we'll give more details. but to your specific question on the design, think of it as a on-pump pci, which is the impella-supported pci versus off-pump pci, which is where the majority of these patients today, they actually don't get a balloon pump. they get the in-and-out approach where the physician has to inflate the balloon or place stent quickly or otherwise the hemodynamics will collapse or they stage the patient or they do a combination of things or they limit the contrast because they're worried about acute kidney injury.
so there will be patients that they will have the option to use a balloon pump and they know that. they know that today, that's partly why they don't necessarily use it today, because for many people it's not something that's going to provide hemodynamic support if the patient gets in trouble. and the majority of these patients today are in-and-out. but what protect ii showed, and other studies with impella showed, is that these patients that when they get complete revascularization, with impella support, we've been able to demonstrate significant improvements in the ejection fraction or the quality of life of these patients at 90 days.
most recently, that was presented in the restore ef and what the protect iii study also showed is lower adverse events on bleeding. so we've made great progress on access closure, but we're also seeing that the physicians are doing a better job, leaving less ischemia and when they do that, that's where you really see the benefit for the patient. in the past cabg did, and does get an improvement in ef because what they're doing is taking a clean vein and rerouting the blood flow. so there is an improvement in ef but there is a price to pay with the sternonomy and the pump run and the recovery for a open-heart surgery.
and so in the end, what we -- what we'll have here is a design study that will be able to track everything in terms of quality of life, heart failure, readmissions, improvement in ef, and it's really a comprehensive heart failure study designed by the trialists and it will have an adaptive design. but we feel very comfortable that the physicians know the patients are out there and they're excited to work with their referral network and we're very excited that this is going to -- this is an on-label study. so we're excited to get out there and start identifying these patients.
anthony petrone -- jefferies -- analyst

thank you. our next question comes from the line of chris cooley with stephens. your line is now open.
chris cooley -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
good morning and thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on a very strong finish to an unprecedented year. if i could maybe just start with a question on international opportunities. in the past you've updated us a little bit about potential new markets to enter and i've realized that you are still very low rates of penetration sub-20% sub-5% when we think about europe and japan. but if you could just walk us through how you see the international market expansion taking place and also reconcile your slide on patient growth and revenue performance. you show a 12% sequential increase in japan in the most recent quarter and maybe it's a typo, but a 4% sequential decline in revenues. so maybe you could just help us with that. and then i've got a quick follow-up. thanks so much.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, chris, for the question. in terms of -- i'll take the first part in terms of the japanese performance in the fourth quarter. obviously, it continues to perform very well, over $11.5 million. patients in japan for the quarter was up 50%. revenue didn't grow as much, it was down sequentially. and really, the function is simple, is we opened up four fewer sites in japan this quarter versus what we did last year. it was about 10 sites this quarter. i think it was 14 sites last quarter. and so that's really what's driving, i would say, a little bit of a disconnect between patients and revenue in japan. so overall, very strong performance, up 50%.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
now your second question was around just countries outside of germany and...
chris cooley -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
no, i was just -- yes, i was just kind of curious about incremental markets and your thoughts there on timing.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. chris, the protect iv is a european study as much as it is a u.s. so the co-pi is an academic leader and recognized trialist. we've had strong growth and publications from italy. so the interventional cardiology society in italy has been very active with publications, registry data. that's the -- that was recently presented and published last quarter, showing the benefits of impella with high-risk pci and higher survival by placing the impella before the pci and achieving complete revasc. we are seeing a lift in europe overall. we're starting to enter some of these other markets, and many of these top centers have expressed interest and will likely be in protect iv.
relative to asia, we remain focused on -- japan is the priority, but we also are planting seeds. and again, top centers in asia are starting to enter into the impella training and focus on heart recovery. so we think there'll be more there, but we also don't want to lose focus that the three biggest drivers for global standard of care and for our execution remain u.s., germany and japan.
chris cooley -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
thank you. and if i could just maybe squeeze one other quick one in here. just when you think about the expansions here in the united states from 17 to 23 regions, conceptually it makes sense, you're closer to the customer, more frequent visits, they're helping to drive greater growth in those territories. curious though, are you seeing similar types of trends in both high-risk pci and the shock patient populations? and also just as we see more patients on impella connect, help us kind of understand what this -- how the distribution is really doing out there in the field? just kind of want to get a better feel for what kind of lift you are seeing as you expand from 17 to 23. thank you.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
chris, the design of our distribution and what's happened out there is really part of the covid playbook. so on the covid playbook, we're tracking weekly access to the hospital's icu capacity, impella connect and then we do see a flip back and forth between the high-risk pci patients and the shock patients. we know if shock or pulmonary embolism or ecpella and those things go up, the icus fill up. that means that we're going to have a bit of a delay in high-risk pci at the big centers, but that bolus will come back. the interesting element of that is our smaller and mid-sized territories and hospitals, they did not see that dip as much because they then potentially do that patient and they don't refer that patient to the larger center.
if we track on shock and you look at the year, six out of the 12 months had positive growth. eight of the 12 months had flat to positive. and two -- the first two months of covid last april, may were down and they were down double-digit. but after that, shock itself recovered, and that's kind of part of the playbook. and then in this hub-and-spoke piece of this, is, as we've mentioned, we set records in q4. but in march, we set our records for most patients ever, most high-risk pci patients ever and most cardiogenic shock patients ever. so we think the playbook works, and we like this hub-and-spoke network, and we like the changes we've made to the distribution to really capitalize on that opportunity.
chris cooley -- stephens, inc. -- analyst

thank you. our next question comes from the line of matthew o'brien with piper sandler. your line is now open.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
morning. just a couple of questions on kind of some products that i think are helping the business right now. one of them is clearly helping the business versus just the guidance, which is good to see you getting back up to low-double-digits here, which i think is kind of what you're targeting for the business going forward or maybe a little bit faster. but for starters, on the sheath side of things and i know this is kind of getting down to the weeds a little bit, mike or todd. but, what are you seeing as far as utilization of the 2.5 sheaths among centers that have access to it? and then what's the timing on cp? is it still kind of expected here in a few months? because what i'm really trying to get at is, is this starting to accelerate some adoption of impella because of access of the sheath and then cp can hopefully help accelerate things a little bit more?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, matt, for the question. so the short answer is the xr sheath is the priority for cp. we do have it on the 2.5, and we did do cases in the u.s. last quarter. but the majority of our larger volume users are very comfortable with access closure today. protect iii showed we have low-single-digit vascular complications and bleeding. we also showed that in the stemi dtu fda study. the single access is now approved also in europe and has been the means of choice by a lot of the physicians that do the most impellas. and so they'd much prefer today to have the cp. they're comfortable with access closure and they like the single access. so what we're doing with cp is you have the xr sheath, which is a 510(k), but we are also -- in coordination with that, we're making some minor adjustments to the product to augment that, but that will require a pma submission supplement.
so that's where we think we're going to have the two aligned by the end of this fiscal year. but we're also pretty confident that part of the momentum we're seeing is just that the new techniques, the new clinical data and the single access really are the preference of our top centers.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. makes sense. and then shifting over to 5.5, which is clearly a nice tailwind or a meaningful tailwind right now. mike, it seems like there was an acceleration in the number of centers using the products or getting access to the product here in fiscal q4. are those 211 sites entirely sites that were using 5.0 before? and then among the sites -- and again, i know we're getting down into the weeds, but are you seeing some of the sites that are -- where 5.5 was available, more clinicians coming over and starting to use abiomed for other procedures, now that they can see 5.5, see how well it works and how unique it is? and then saying, ok, maybe i can use cp in some other patients as well. so are we getting any signs of kind of some growing momentum because of 5.5 throughout an entire center?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
matt, the answer is yes, but it's -- remember, you have two different customer bases. you have the heart surgeons and then you have the interventional cardiologists. and they work together well in certain cases. they work together well in tavr because they're all aligned in the hybrid lab. but there's still this inherent competition between high-risk pci and cabg. and what we've shown is that the two work together, something we call high-risk revascularization. so as we identify these patients, some of these patients go for high-risk pci, some of these patients go for high-risk cabg, where they utilize impella and that was presented by dr. ed soltesz from cleveland clinic on the approach that they use. and some of those cabg patients, they do have poor kidney function and they need support coming off the heart lung machine. and this presentation is also still up.
but what their protocol is, is if there's acute on chronic patient, they go to the impella 5.5 as the primary driver. they no longer use the 5.0. and the 5.5 has the optical sensor. it gives us the ability to see what's happening and the pressure in the left ventricle. it's ideal for weaning. then they establish that patient, then they decide is the revascularization going to be done in the cath lab, by the intervention cardiologists, are they going to do it in the surgical suite with cabg. in certain cases, if they need a vt ablation, they'll take them to the ep lab, and they'll do a vt ablation but the impella pump is stabilizing that acute on chronic patient.
that's a different patient than an ami shock patient, whose first symptom is the heart attack that leads to shock. that patient is still going quickly into the cath lab through the door to balloon time protocol, where they'll put the impella in before they do the pci. so the short answer is yes, because it's driving the science and the recognition of unloading. and it allows us to take patients and make sure that we maintain the ability to still provide a path of the least invasive, most cost-effective approach to not only keep the patient alive, but send them home with their own heart.
and so we're really excited to see the leadership by cleveland clinic on surgery, cedars out in la, the teams in chicago, across the board. the 5.5 is really a revolutionary product for heart failure. and we've added some heart failure people in the company and on the distribution. so we really are changing heart failure now to heart recovery, and it's a different mindset, but it's what 5.5 enables and what impella btr will continue because now we'll have the ability to send the patient home and have a pump that runs even longer without a purge.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst

thank you. our next question comes from the line of jayson bedford with raymond james. your line is now open.
jayson bedford -- raymond james -- analyst
hi, good morning. just a couple quick ones. i realize we're at the top of the hour. just on 5.5. so if 5.5 and 5.0 is 15% of u.s. revenue, what percent is 5.5 these days?
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
i don't have the actual percentage in front of me. it's -- the majority of the business now is 5.5. i would say it's close to -- it's over -- it's probably over 75%, jayson.
jayson bedford -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. and then on the guide, just wondering if you could talk about the expected growth in the u.s., which obviously has a much easier comp versus international for fiscal '22? thanks.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
i think when you look at it across all three regions, we do expect to see double-digit growth. obviously, rest of the world -- ous is going to be growing a little bit faster with japan and germany. but even in the united states, whether you look at the low, medium and high-end of our range, we do expect to see nice growth, double-digit, mid-teens growth in the u.s. a lot of it obviously driven by the surgical business. so i think, overall, it's pretty evenly distributed across all three regions.
jayson bedford -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. thanks, todd. and just quickly, mike, where are we with recover iv in terms of starting that trial?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we've got executive committee, jayson. we're working through some of the specific details of it. it's a very difficult population to randomize, as you know, we've tried in the past. we think we can satisfy that now. we're looking at some things around consent. and yesterday, we presented the final summation of the 406 patients in the ncsi with a 71% survival. but what's really interesting in the presentation is that the status c, which is the kind of the classic shock patients had a 77% survival. we even have very positive survival on the class c, which is the cardiac arrest group. so we're -- we have a tremendous amount of information.
we're now working through the logistical challenges and how we'll do the consent. we expect to finish the design end of the year and start this study the following year. but it really is a difficult population, but we feel very confident now with the best practices in japan, in italy and germany and the u.s., that we have the formula for the higher survival with more than 90% having native heart recovery for this type of patient.
jayson bedford -- raymond james -- analyst
all right. thanks, mike.

our next question comes from the line of marie thibault with btig. your line is now open.
marie thibault -- btig -- analyst
hi. good morning. thank you for taking the question. just a quick one here to follow-up on the comments you made to jayson. i wanted to confirm, we always like to see that u.s. patient metric, and i know you gave that to us this quarter, up 13% year-over-year. is high-teens the right bar to think about if we think about the midpoint of your guidance for fiscal '22?
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
are you talking from a u.s. perspective utilization?
marie thibault -- btig -- analyst
yeah. u.s. patient. yeah, exactly.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
i would say patient utilization would be somewhere in that mid-teens. i think it makes sense based on our guidance.
marie thibault -- btig -- analyst
okay, sure. yeah. i back into that. i just wanted to confirm, given some of the higher asps and benefit you've been seeing there. okay. and then a quick follow-up here. i don't think we've heard too much on breethe, but it seems to be getting very good feedback. i would love to hear whether you've included any of that revenue in fiscal '22, whether that's something we can see as a meaningful contributor this year? thanks for taking the questions.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, marie. good question. i think in terms of meaningful impacts, it's been a great launch. we have five sites right now, treated over -- about 20 patients. i think if you think about fiscal year '22, it will be somewhat of that controlled rollout that we've talked about. so again, focus on training and education and, more importantly, patient outcomes. so we'll continue to do a controlled rollout. and from a revenue perspective, i'd say it's not going to probably have a material impact on us as we think about it, the big picture, probably more of a fiscal year '23 story.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of cecilia furlong with morgan stanley. your line is now open.
calvin -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. this is calvin on for cecilia. just two quick ones for me. the first is just could you share with us your thoughts on what your m&a strategy for fy '22 is going to be? do you anticipate remaining kind of active on that front in '22 and beyond? and the second is just, could you give us an update on stemi dtu, on kind of what the pace of enrollment has been on -- perhaps on full enrollment timing to the extent you can share? thanks so much.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
i'll take the first question with regard to m&a. obviously, if you look at our cash deployment strategy, i think our top priority remains investment in organic growth opportunities that we believe lay the groundwork for sustainable growth. with that said, we'll continue to look at new technologies and core competencies. as of the last quarter, we still have a little over $100 million investment on our balance sheet in roughly 15 to 18 companies. and we'll, again, continue to look for differentiated technologies that can either increase impella utilization, improve patient outcomes, anything around access closure and monitoring. but ultimately, we're looking for technology that can bring additional value to our patients, whether in the cath lab, icu or ccu.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
calvin, on the stemi dtu, we added six sites in q4, and we enrolled 28 patients in q4. so we're now at 61 patients enrolled in 26 hospitals.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of danielle antalffy with svb leerink. your line is now open.
danielle antalffy -- svb leerink -- analyst
good morning, guys. thanks so much for taking the question. i actually just have one question, and it's tied to longer-term growth. so i appreciate your giving fiscal 2022 guidance today. i know you're not going to give us fiscal '23 guidance today. but at a high level, if you could comment qualitatively, fiscal 2022 is still facing some odd comps with covid and the recovery and things like that. so i guess, as we look longer term, what's the right way to think about the underlying growth profile of the company? should we be thinking about it in line with sort of end cardiogenic shock and high-risk pci volume? or between now and, say, this time next year, do you feel like you guys are making progress among some of the sort of -- i don't know if it's too dramatic to call them deniers or the folks that were impacted by the aha data, that we should see underlying growth acceleration? i know that's really difficult to answer, but even any qualitative comments would be helpful.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
danielle, i would say at a high level, abiomed 2.0 expects to be one of the fastest-growing profitable medical device companies, and we have been for the last 10 years. and we think between our existing products and new products, existing indications, new indications and potentially stronger guidelines in existing countries and new countries, we have a decade ahead of us of growth.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2021 abiomed earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to todd trapp. please go ahead.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, sarah. good morning and welcome to abiomed's fourth quarter '21 earnings conference call. this is todd trapp, vice president and chief financial officer and i'm here with mike minogue, abiomed's chairman, president and chief executive officer.
the format for today's call will be as follows: first, mike will discuss fourth quarter business and operational highlights and then i will review our financial results, which were outlined in today's press release. after that, we will open the call to your questions.
before we begin, i would like to remind everyone that today's call includes forward-looking statements. the company cautions investors that any forward-looking statements involves risks and uncertainties and are not guaranteed in the future. actual results may differ materially due to a variety of factors identified in our earnings press release and our most recent 10-k and 10-q filed with the sec. we do not undertake any obligations to update forward-looking statements.
with that, let me turn the call over to abiomed's chairman, president and chief executive officer, mike minogue.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, todd, and good morning everyone. throughout the covid-19 pandemic, abiomed has remained on course to advance our innovation and become the standard of care for circulatory support. we adopted and executed, while successfully transitioning from our red, yellow and green phases to abiomed 2.0. the 2.0 marks our transformation into a smarter and more connected online medical device company with a covid playbook. we conduct on-site and online training and education and provide patient support with smart algorithms to track real world utilization in the cloud, identify best practices and optimize patient care.
for the quarter, abiomed delivered a company record of $241 million in revenue, up 17% year-over-year with double-digit growth and record revenue across the u.s., europe and japan. within the quarter, we saw monthly sequential improvement in both global revenue and patient utilization. q4 investments continued, while achieving a 26% gaap operating margin. applying our abiomed 2.0 covid playbook, we definitively transitioned to the green phase, validated with record number of patients supported in a quarter, in a month, in a week and in a day, all in q4.
turning to the full fiscal year, abiomed delivered $848 million in revenue, up 1% year-over-year and 27% operating margin despite the covid-19 pandemic. we took a disciplined approach to the fiscal year to help us navigate the uncertain environment and achieve our tactical plan. over the past year, we endured the setbacks of covid-19 and focused on keeping employees safe, making life-saving heart pumps and supporting our hospitals and patients. we controlled expenses and invested in innovation, new clinical studies and expanded distribution, while remaining fiscally responsible. our balance sheet strengthened to $848 million in cash, while maintaining zero debt and acquiring an ecmo platform. in addition, our ip portfolio increased to 1,150 impella patents and 940 patents pending. we achieved a significant number of regulatory approvals and established world-class online training and education with camp pci.
at abiomed, our patients-first mindset gives us purpose and courage and we always seek opportunities to lead, manage, adapt and execute. for this fiscal year, i would like to thank our employees and customers for their courage, dedication to patients and leadership throughout the pandemic. we exited the year slightly up in revenue, profitable and stronger than ever before.
for today's call, i will highlight our fiscal '21 innovation that will drive our success and momentum into our fiscal year '22 goals and beyond. in fiscal year '21, abiomed launched revolutionary innovation across multiple patient populations, starting with the accelerated rollout of impella connect, our remote monitoring capability, allowing us to go live at nearly 1,000 hospitals in the u.s. currently 70% of our patients are monitored in the cloud with impella connect. no other company in our space provides this level of 24/7 on-site, on-call and online support. this is particularly meaningful in the covid environment. we have also expanded our global footprint within impella connect at 29 hospitals in germany and 49 hospitals in japan.
next, the impella 5.5 with smartassist continues to deliver strong results. within the quarter, our u.s. surgical revenue grew 46% year-over-year as we expanded this device to 53 more sites totaling 211 sites. for the full fiscal year, u.s. surgical revenue grew 44% year-over-year, driven by strength in patient utilization. the impella 5.5 is a revolutionary product because it is minimally invasive, provides forward flow and is a fully unloading heart pump designed for heart surgeons. it is inserted via the axillary artery or directly into the aorta and designed for longer duration support within patient ambulations. the impella 5.5 has reported comparatively higher survival rates and native heart recovery for the acutely decompensating heart failure patient population, representing an additional 100,000 treatable u.s. patients. heart surgeons are also enthusiastic about our btr heart pump, first-in-human experience, expected in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year.
turning to our abiomed breethe oxy-1 system. we have now treated 20 patients to date at several sites. in march, i visited our breethe facility in baltimore and met a breethe ecmo patient on support at the nearby university of maryland medical center. the feedback from physicians on this innovative compact cardiopulmonary bypass system has been positive. customers highlight the ease of use with the simple intuitive interface and the light portable design allowing for ambulation. we will continue to innovate and plan to optimize this technology with smart ecpella software and connected cloud monitoring.
moving on to our regulatory progress. we advanced our u.s. fda early feasibility study for the impella ecp, a true 9 french heart pump. as a reminder, in early q4, we received fda approval for the expansion of the early feasibility study to 20 patients and have enrolled 10 patients to date. the excitement for protect iv is palpable in the heart failure community and we recently announced our first patient enrolled at ascension st. john hospital in detroit. it is important to note that protect iv was designed by the leaders and best clinical trialists in the field of cardiovascular medicine. it is an on-label, prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial that is designed to provide the level of clinical evidence needed to achieve a global class i guideline recommendation for impella in high-risk pci in the future.
the intent of protect iv rct is to leverage and validate the best practices that we have learned over the past 10 years in the protect series and cvad studies that led to the exclusive fda pma approval of impella for high-risk pci. we believe the heart failure community's engagement will propel the protect iv study to be a landmark trial for high-risk pci overall as a new treatment alternative.
in the past, we have defined our current addressable market for high-risk pci as 121,000 u.s. patients. as a result of the protect iv study, we are directly investing this year in outreach referral programs that we expect will better identify the under-treated population of an additional 319,000 high-risk pci patients that are turned down for surgery and not referred for protected pci treatment due to not being diagnosed or tested for coronary artery disease. since the protect iv study is on-label and spans the heart theme, we now estimate our new u.s. addressable patient population for high-risk pci to be 440,000 patients.
for context, 15 million people in the u.s. have coronary artery disease and heart failure and it causes approximately 1 million deaths per year. coronary artery disease and heart failure remains the leading cause of death overall, and is the number one cause of death for people with type 2 diabetes. while we will not complete this study in fiscal year '22, we now have line of sight and a path forward to solidify the new standard of care for high-risk pci with the goal of complete revascularization and improvement in patient quality of life and ejection fraction.
finally, i want to highlight some of our goals for abiomed 2.0 fiscal '22 and beyond with investments focused on extending our lead in innovation, advancing impella clinical evidence and establishing commercial excellence with a premier distribution team. first, we will continue to invest in r&d as we innovate best-in-class heart and lung support technologies that are smaller, smarter and connected to improve ease of use and clinical outcomes. second, we plan to execute multiple rct's, including stemi dtu, protect iv and advance the recover iv cardiogenic shock design with the goal of achieving class i guidelines overall.
in addition, we expect to further validate the safety and efficacy of impella and the importance of complete revascularization in high-risk pci with the publications of protect iii and restore ef. for cardiogenic shock, positive clinical results presented yesterday at the scai scientific sessions for the physician-initiated national cardiogenic shock initiative will be published.
separately, the positive results presented by the mhlw pvad japanese heart committee will also be published. because these cardiogenic shock patients are difficult to randomize and consent, our best practice protocols are derived from over 10 years of real world evidence and over 100,000 patients with physician-initiated and prospective fda and pmda studies in the u.s., europe and japan. this new paradigm focuses on improved survival and native heart recovery.
and finally, through a combination of our u.s. distribution expansion, and leveraging camp pci, we plan to deliver best-in-class training and education on-site and online with the goal of identifying patients' improving outcomes and driving impella adoption.
before i conclude, i want to share a patient story. chris kirkman, a 48-year-old husband, father and sales director from zachary, louisiana, has a family history of heart disease and has lived with hypertension for 20 years. in december 2020, after experiencing shortness of breath, fluid buildup around his abdomen and difficulty sleeping, chris visited a local emergency clinic. he was prescribed medication and sent home. chris' symptoms gradually became more severe over the next few months. when he experienced trouble breathing, chris' wife drove him to the local hospital, where he was diagnosed with advanced coronary disease and congestive heart failure with poor ejection fraction at 20%. he was told he was too high-risk for bypass surgery and discharged home with a wearable defibrillator.
chris was then referred to interventional cardiologists, dr. abraham at baton rouge general-bluebonnet. dr. abraham identified chris as an appropriate candidate for protected pci with impella. when he returned for the scheduled procedure, dr. abraham successfully achieved complete revascularization with the help of impella cp heart pump and chris was discharged home the next day. during his follow-up exam, chris' ejection fraction improved to 45%. today, chris is thankful to be back at work, and enjoying a healthier lifestyle with his wife and three children.
in conclusion, i'm very proud of our employees and customers for their dedication and courage during the covid pandemic. despite the challenging circumstances on both professional and personal levels, abiomed 2.0 delivered one of our most productive fiscal years in my 17-year tenure as ceo. i am confident that abiomed will not just be a successful company, but will drive a new standard of care for multiple growing populations of high-risk heart failure patients around the world.
we look to the new fiscal year with great excitement because we are a stronger company today and have a clear path for execution to fulfill our heart recovery mission. and last, we sincerely appreciate the continued support from our patients, customers and shareholders.
i will now turn the call over to todd.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, mike and good morning everyone. now, starting with q4 results. as mike mentioned, we delivered record revenue of $241 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year with double-digit growth across the u.s., europe and japan. we leveraged our abiomed 2.0 covid playbook, which allowed us to transition to the green phase, where we grew patients and revenue year-over-year and delivered on our innovation, regulatory and clinical milestones despite the current environment.
turning to our regional performance. u.s. revenue grew 13% to $196 million, driven by a 13% increase in patient utilization. we saw double-digit growth in both high-risk pci and cardiogenic shock. the pandemic hit peak levels in the first few weeks of january, which impacted patient utilization. however, as covid cases and related hospitalizations began to decline and we executed our playbook, we delivered sequential improvements in patients and revenue in each month of the quarter. we also set a patient and revenue record in march. at the end of our fiscal q4, in the u.s., the cp is now in 1,509 sites. we have placed the impella 5.0 in 663 sites and the impella 5.5 with smartassist is now in 211 sites, up 53 sites versus prior quarter. lastly, the impella rp is now in 588 sites, up 19 versus q3. u.s. reorder performance in the quarter was slightly below 100% and average combined inventory at the hospitals for the impella 2.5 and cp was 4.7 units per site, consistent with the inventory levels we saw in q3.
turning to outside the u.s. in q4, total revenue was $46 million, up 33% year-over-year, driven by strength in europe and japan. our european revenue increased 28% year-over-year due to higher patient utilization in several markets such as germany, austria, and the uk and a benefit from the euro-u.s. dollar foreign exchange rate. similar to the u.s., in europe, we saw an impact in january when certain countries mandated lockdowns as covid cases and deaths accelerated. however, here too, we leveraged the covid playbook, executed on our plan and delivered monthly sequential improvement throughout the quarter. japan continues to perform very well, delivering $11.6 million in revenue, up 38% year-over-year, driven by patient utilization. we opened 10 new sites in the quarter, bringing our total to 166 sites.
moving forward, gross margin for q4 was 80.9%, flat compared to the prior year due to benefits from increased production volume offsetting higher material spend and stock-based compensation. r&d expense totaled $32 million, an increase of 26% from the prior year. the value of our ongoing innovation has been evident throughout the past year and we believe it will continue to create value as we invest in advancing the impella ecp, xr sheath, breethe oxy-1 system and impella btr and in clinical evidence with protect iv, stemi dtu and danger.
sg&a expense for the quarter totaled $100 million, up 20% versus prior year. the increase was due to targeted investments we made in expanding our distribution team, incremental advertising and higher stock-based compensation.
in the quarter, gaap operating income grew 8% to $63 million translating to an operating margin of 26%. the variance versus prior year, again, was driven by growth investments and higher stock-based compensation. net income for the quarter was $57 million or $1.24 per diluted share versus $0.70 in q4 '20. net income increased 79%, primarily due to the mark-to-market investment in shockwave. shockwave impacted our reported eps by $0.13 in the quarter.
our balance sheet remains robust. in q4, we generated $86 million of operating cash flow and approximately $275 million for the year. as a result, we ended the fiscal year with $848 million in cash, up $197 million or 30% versus last year, while remaining debt free. our strong balance sheet provides us with stability, as well as with flexibility to make continued investments.
now turning to our full year performance. throughout the fiscal year, we were agile within the covid environment, navigating the challenges presented by it, but remained disciplined and executed on our goals. as a result, we saw quarterly improvement in both patients and revenue and delivered global revenue of $848 million, an increase of 1% versus prior year despite the global pandemic.
by geography, on a year-over-year basis, the u.s. declined 2%, while europe and japan grew 12% and 22%, respectively. gaap operating income for the fiscal year '21 was $230 million, down 8% compared to the prior year, which equates to a 27.1% operating margin. we took a fiscally disciplined approach throughout the year. we controlled discretionary expenses and instituted temporary actions to reduce costs, while investing at record levels in innovation. in fiscal year '21, we invested $122 million in r&d, up 23% year-over-year. additionally, we added 40 heads to our distribution team within the year with the majority occurring in our fourth quarter. net income for the year was $226 million or $4.94 per diluted share versus $203 million or $4.43 in the prior year. the 11% increase was primarily driven by our equity investment in shockwave.
lastly, turning to our guidance for fiscal year '22. for the full year, we expect revenue to be in the range of $990 million to $1.03 billion, which translates to 17% to 22% growth for the year. at the low end, our guidance assumes some continued uncertainty with covid; namely, unevenness in recoveries caused by resurgences, national lockdowns, new strains, vaccine availability, and adoption. at the high end of the range, our assumptions include vaccines are broadly distributed, leading to lower new covid cases and a social and economic return to normality, which should have a positive effect on our customers and our business.
as we typically do when issuing guidance, i would like to provide some color on our expectations to the seasonality of our fiscal year. in q1, we anticipate that utilization will remain uneven as we continue to endure the different transition pace across geographies of resurgences, recovery and vaccinations globally. however, we remain confident in the efficacy of our playbook and execution and our ability to continue to treat patients in this environment and believe revenue in q1 '22 will be flat to slightly above q4 '21 revenue of $241 million.
historically, q2 is a seasonally slow quarter for cardiovascular devices due to the summertime slowdown in the cath lab and physician vacations. we believe this could be exasperated this year, given the potential vacations and pent-up demand for travel. so we expect q2 revenue to be flat or slightly below the q1 pace. as we transition to the back half of the year, we typically see sequential lift in q3 based on increased hospital activity and physician engagement. and in q4, our march quarter, we expect to have our best results as we end our fiscal year.
turning to operating margin. we expect our fiscal year '22 margin to be in the range of 24% to 26% as we step up targeted investments in innovation, clinical evidence and distribution. a significant portion of our incremental investment will be in r&d as we innovate best-in-class heart and lung support technologies and further validate the safety and efficacy of impella with multiple ongoing randomized controlled trials. we also plan to expand our distribution, accelerate marketing initiatives, and grow our training and education programs.
in summary, fiscal year '21 was a challenging, but very productive year for us as we endured the pandemic and transitioned to abiomed 2.0. we are pleased to have delivered year-over-year top-line growth, achieved gaap operating margin of 27% and increased our cash to $848 million, all while continuing to make necessary investments to drive abiomed's long-term sustainable growth. we have come through an exceptionally challenging year. i am proud of our employees around the globe for their commitment and hard work and for their accomplishments. i am very excited for the year ahead as we continue to build the new field of heart recovery.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from margaret kaczor with william blair. your line is open.
margaret kaczor -- william blair & company -- analyst
hey. good morning, everyone. thanks for taking the question. and i wanted to start a little bit on the quarter. obviously, you guys saw a nice uptick here. i was hoping to go a little bit deeper into some of those drivers, whether all things being equal, excluding seasonality, now that you're solidly into the screen phase, you're ramping up some of these initiatives, and we talked a lot about commercial initiatives last quarter and getting patients into that that funnel. is this something that should continue to, i guess, get better as we go throughout this year? and if you could talk about that cadence and what's included in guidance? that would be helpful.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
great, margaret. thanks for the question. i guess, the answer is yes, because you've seen it now for two quarters in a row as we transitioned to green. and now green is our phase which is abiomed 2.0 execution. so starting with is just the product innovation. if you just break it out and look at the product growth, cp grew 52%, which is primarily driven by existing indications we have today for high-risk pci and shock. 5.0 and 5.5 combined grew to 115%, now it's driven by 209% growth in 5.5. impella rp, which we're just starting now to rollout smartassist grew 71%. it has exclusive fda approvals and is also approved for the emergency use for covid. and ecmo, we are going slower to continue to evaluate and innovate, and so the demand does exceed our willingness to shift because it's similar to when we launched in japan in the first year. so we've got lots of quarters ahead of just strong growth in those products.
on clinical research, we've got abstract presentations that are being converted now to publications. the big ones are protect iii, which is the largest prospective fda study on high-risk pci. you've got restore ef, which is a best practice protocol, showing a permanent improvement in ejection fraction. you have the completion of the ncsi presentation, which is going to publication and you also have the presentation going to publication for the japan impella cardiogenic shock study. so there is a lot of information, plus there's just tremendous momentum and excitement around stemi dtu, which now we've at least got to about half of our enrollable sites, and protect iv, which we've started to enroll, and of course, ecp had a strong quarter and we were able to do another 15 patients since the last earnings call.
and then last, as you pointed out, we have made changes to the distribution. it's very focused now to strengthen our ability to move with speed, but also have a hub-and-spoke interaction, so that we continue to call on those spoke accounts, which continue to grow, even during covid, as well as the network where the hub centers, which are -- do the most high-risk pci and those complicated shock patients are transferred to, they also saw growth. so, across the board, existing indications, shock and high-risk pci had strong growth. we feel very confident coming out of q1, but we've got more to do. and we're very excited now to just be executing and allowing us to treat more patients than ever before.
margaret kaczor -- william blair & company -- analyst
okay. that is a laundry list of, obviously, new r&d initiatives that you've got. but maybe let's focus a little bit on rp with smartassist. you got approval for that. can you give us thoughts around the asp, whether it could be a premium or is it the same? and then if we think about whether that product could bring in shocks off the sideline sort of like 5.5 has helped with axillary access. is that a possibility? and how do you think about a controlled rollout for your new product for years to come? thanks.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, margaret, just to clarify, i heard the first part on the rp with smartassist, but what was the connection to the 5.5? we cut out there.
margaret kaczor -- william blair & company -- analyst
sorry, it's just more. can it bring clinicians off the sideline as it is more material change, sort of like 5.0 and 5.5 was where it did actually bring docs off the sideline?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
absolutely. so a few things on rp. the rp can be put in, in the cath lab and it is truly percutaneous. so that's unique, but we also are designing that device so that surgeons can put it through the jugular, and it will be utilized that way. so you'll have the ability now. now, we'll come at the end of the year, but we also are getting full support for surgeons that are already using the impella 5.5.
so, as you see from the numbers on the demand, all those products, with the exception of 2.5, are increasing. and for high-risk pci, half of our patients for high-risk pci now are single access, which is the preferred method with the leaders out there. and so, that really does address some of the ease of use and things around the cath lab for high-risk pci. and remember, when you do a single access, they do the pci and they also do the impella in the same hole rather than two holes. so, we've got a lot of momentum and where it comes together is in this heart team approach. some of those patients that are high-risk revascularization get a cabg with a 5.5, and some of those patients go to the cath lab to get a high-risk pci. so, the network and the referral stream is coming together. but again, if you're in the field, and you're a customer, abiomed has all the new technology. we have the most clinical studies and we provide the best 24/7 support that's also in the cloud with the smartassist and impella connect platform.
margaret kaczor -- william blair & company -- analyst
great. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from matthew o'brien with piper sandler. your line is open.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
good morning. thanks so much for taking the questions. so, mike, just a little bit more on 5.5. can you talk about some of the earlier adopters of that technology? how they're ramping? and then, some of the backlog and the interest that you're seeing from all of these other hospitals out there to get access to that technology. and then how we should think about the utilization of that technology here in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
matt, thanks for the question. the impella 5.5 is a breakthrough product. we -- in our investor day last year, dr. ed soltesz gave a presentation of how they use it in a protocol at cleveland clinic. and you'll see that out west with cedars, one of the largest ecmo, vad and transplant centers, you see it in the midwest and now you also see it in the east coast in other hospitals. and the reason it's important is because prior to the impella 5.5, if you wanted a vad, something that could do more than five liters, you essentially have to do a sternotomy, including for our old ab5000, and you'd have to spread the ribs and then these devices require the surgeon, for the implantables, to make an incision and core out a quarter sized hole in the left ventricle. and so, all those things have adverse events and if a patient is in shock or has trouble coming off the heart or lung machine, that's not something you necessarily want to do. and if the patient is 70 and above and you put them on ecmo, you tend to load the ventricle. and then that takes away their ability to get back to baseline, and again, a 70-year-old is not going to get a transplant nor do they want a permanent implantable device in them that requires the most expensive and invasive surgery.
so, what the 5.5 does is, it really opens up these class 3 and class 4 patients that are acutely decompensated or have been in more profound shock that these longer support and need their kidneys have to have the benefit of being unloaded at the heart, and it really does become a game changer and new therapy. and so we're excited. we expect this product to continue to have growth -- strong growth over the next several years, and we have submitted it for approval in japan, where we think it will be even a stronger driver because in japan, they don't necessarily do a lot of sternotomies or believe in transplants. they already do stem cells and things around myocardial recovery, and having an impella 5.5, it immediately unloads the patient, supports the hemodynamics. these patients can come off all of the inotropes, their kidneys make urine. we've even had anecdotal data of patients that are listed for heart and kidney transplant having their kidneys recover after a prolonged use of their 5.5 while they go now to just a heart transplant. so, it's a breakthrough product because it does what a lot of the heart surgeons have always wanted, which is a minimally invasive weanable pump and that's what it's continuing to do.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. that's fantastic to hear. as a follow-up on ecp, you're moving from 20 to 50 patients on the feasibility side. i think that's pretty standard. you're talking about the first patient in the pivotal by the end of this fiscal year, so some time early in 2022. how many patients, mike, should we think about for the pivotal? and then if you're enrolling about 15, i think, you did in the last quarter for the feasibility side. is this something you can enroll by maybe the early part or even mid part of 2023 and then potentially get an approval late in calendar 2023 or even early 2024?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
so, matt, it's a great question. we'll give a little bit of color today, but we're not going to give all the details yet until we lock in the protocol with the fda. but we think a single-arm study, the numbers that we did were primarily from two physicians. there is tremendous excitement from all the centers to use the ecp. and if we can do up to anywhere from 20 to 50 centers, doing high-risk pci in a single-arm to compare with our other data, we feel very comfortable. we'll be able to enroll pretty quickly.
and on a numbers basis, we haven't given any numbers out, but we -- but what you're looking at is an equivalency, so things around access closure, as well as the valve safety or the most important parameters, and we feel very confident in this device. and the fact that it's just a 9 french in and out really does simplify the utilization for high-risk pci. so we're happy to be ahead of schedule. we're pleased with the process. we've already made and implemented some new technology changes. that's the benefit of the early feasibility. so we're going to utilize the next -- up to another 25 patients to continue to keep the experience level there. so we can roll right into the ecp centers and we're ahead of schedule. we're confident and we're excited to bring that product already into the market through the early feasibility study and then expand it right into a pivotal.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from pito chickering with deutsche bank. your line is open.
pito chickering -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. thanks for taking my question. as we [phonetic] over the guidance increase, can you give us sort of the key drivers here between us revenues and international revenues? and how much of the guidance increase, if any, is due to 5.5 penetration to the positive asp? and i asked just because asp -- there was a large delta between the patient growth and revenue growth this quarter.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, pito. this is todd. it's a good question. i would say, when you look at the guidance increase based on the different geographies, we do expect to see, like i say, acceleration in the second half of the year, and basically, all of our three major geographies. so, us, europe and japan. and so, we do expect them to all contribute to that increase in guidance that we provided out for the year.
pito chickering -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. and then i'm sorry if i missed this, but on the margins, you obviously moved up the lower end of revenue guidance by 500 basis points, the top end by 200 basis points but maintaining operating guidance -- margins. so just curious, why we're not seeing more revenue flow through the bottom line here. and which investments are you making today that you weren't [phonetic] contemplating maybe last quarter? thanks so much.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, pito, i would say, it's one quarter into us -- into the year and we have a lot of the spin, i would say, that we're going to be investing and it is really in the second, third, and fourth quarter. so, as the clinical trials ramp up, both stemi, as well as protect iv, we're going to -- you're going to see those costs increase, like i said q2, q3 and q4. you pay for the drink, so every time you initiate a site or enroll patient, that's where the cost is incurred. so right now, i would say, some of the costs have pushed to the right, mostly around, i would say, randomized controlled trials, as well as a little bit on the direct-to-patient initiatives that we're looking to -- we pilot in the first quarter and now we're looking to accelerate like i said, q2, q3 and q4.
pito chickering -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. and then just one quick one. can i get an update timeline of the xr sheath as well? thanks so much.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
pito, the timing for the xr sheath was going to be limited market release by the end of this fiscal year. we essentially made a decision to change the roadmap a little bit. and our design is really to match what our customers now want. and what they want is the higher flow of the cp with single access. so we're going to go to from limited market release to the end of the fiscal year 2022 to mid-year fiscal 2023. but the learning curve is -- has been met and the majority of them really feel comfortable with the cp and single access. and so, it's a benefit for the patient. and if you look at, again this quarter, 50% of our high-risk pci patients use single access and it's an all-time high for high-risk pci. and the current sheath isn't compatible for that.
so, based on the customer feedback, we're now going to align the technology for the next-gen impella cp with the xr sheath that can do single access. and in the short-term, we're growing. we'll put more investment into the single access approval and training that we have from the fda. and as you look at clinical abstracts that have been out, whether it's protect iii or restore ef, our bleeding at bar iii [phonetic] and our vascular complications are in the low-single digits and it's very similar to tavr in that the experienced users are now comfortable with the 14 french access. and when it comes to bleeding and vascular rates in the cath lab, we're actually equivalent or lower than tavr because our catheter is already 9 french. so, long-term, the impella ecp will kind of eliminate any of those concerns for that late majority. but overall, our outcomes for vascular complications and bleeding are much better and our customers want the higher flow from cp.
pito chickering -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from anthony petrone with jefferies. your line is open.
anthony petrone -- jefferies & company -- analyst
great. thanks and congrats on a good quarter here. just a follow-up on price dynamics in the quarter for todd, i just want to clear up. was there a pricing benefit in the fiscal third quarter? and is that part of the guidance looking into the back half of the year? just want to -- it seems like there is a mix benefit going forward, so i just want to clarify that.
and then, follow-up question would be on impella connect, just an update on how many active sites that are there? and what you're noticing in usage trends at those sites? and then i'll have one follow-up on m&a.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. thanks for the question, anthony. i do expect to see the asps continuing to drive tailwinds in the second half of the year and it's really comes down to a few things. number one is, our surgical business continues to perform extremely well. as mike mentioned in his remarks, we're up 200% on the 5.5 in the us. we still have a long runway to go in terms of opening new sites, just as anecdotally over 600 sites with the 5.0. and so, the average asp on the 5.5 is obviously significantly higher than 5.0. and we will still continue to benefit from the favorable mix with the impella 2.5 becoming a smaller piece of the business versus cp. so, i do expect to see that positive trend on asps continuing through, at least into the second half of the year and beyond.
in terms of the impella connect sites, at the end of the quarter, we were obviously close to almost over 1,160 sites in the us. so about 82% of our sites had impella connect, and over 80% of our patients are being supported in the cloud on impella connect. so we continue to make progress there and we continue to accelerate some of that rollout in europe, as well as in japan.
anthony petrone -- jefferies & company -- analyst
and a quick one on m&a, just the timelines on precardia, the feasibility study is already enrolled. but just as we look ahead what that r&d development sort of cycle looks like beyond the feasibility study? and the company shifting here to non-gaap, two deals done in the past year or so. so just comments on how you see m&a going forward? is that a bigger piece of the abiomed story over the next couple of years? thanks.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
anthony, this is mike. thanks for the question. on precardia, without giving specifics, the early feasibility study is completed, the safety data has been submitted, but again, we're continuing to enroll patients there as you make certain improvements and changes to the product. so that's in process. we do see it in the mid-term based on our current regulatory path. so, we'll give more focus on that. it's not long-term, it's in the mid-term, which both from more patients to getting it out on the market as a commercial product. that's our timeline. it really does augment what we're already doing, that referral stream, some of those patients are decompensating because they have advanced coronary heart disease and are great candidates for high-risk pci with impella support. some of those may get worse and end up in cardiogenic shock and may need longer support and have kidney issues, so they're going to get the impella 5.5. and we're very excited about it.
relative to the non-gaap, most of our peers for several years now have been reporting non-gaap. i think it's more transparent in the fact that we've been doing certain types of deals. it doesn't change our mindset overall on acquisitions. if we see something that strengthens our strategy or our intellectual property, and to remind everyone, we were one of the original investors and we own 30% of precardia when it got started. so we were there from the beginning. and that's what you'll continue to see us do as there is ideas and things out there that we're experts in and we might help support and innovate, but then we're willing and we have the balance sheet to be able to do that. so, we're going to stay focused on organic growth, but obviously we're going to be opportunistic where we can acquire more breakthrough technology that matches our strategy.
anthony petrone -- jefferies & company -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from chris pasquale with guggenheim. your line is open.
christopher pasquale -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
thanks. mike, i wanted to follow-up on something you mentioned there a second ago, which is just some of the overlapping roles or connected roles in your emerging heart failure portfolio. so you've got impella 5.5, which you mentioned is having a lot of success with class 3 and class 4 acutely decompensated heart failure patients. now you have precardia, which is sort of targeting that same population. you also have btr still in the internal pipeline. so, how do you think about the different roles for those products? and how they complement versus duplicate one another?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
chris, we look at the growing epidemic of heart failure, and we are going to address the biggest problems that are out there. for heart failure cardiologists, for interventional cardiologists and for heart surgeons. and so, if you're a surgeon, whether you're at a transplant center or just a center that does open heart surgery, the impella 5.5 is a must-have. you already have ecmo now. so part of this now is leveraging our ecpella in those relationships. if you're a heart failure cardiologist, you're in the icu or you're in the referring community. so you want to see the data around high-risk pci, and in fact, we have an executive committee part of protect iv, which are the leading heart failure cardiologists. so, think of protect iv as an interventional cardiology and heart failure cardiology study, so that we can transition the mindset of just optical medical management for those patients for them to think about protected pci with the potential improvement in ejection fraction post-treatment. so, those things leverage well.
and then from precardia, it puts us more upstream with those acute-on-chronic patients, which if they escalate will end up on 5.5 or btr. so there is great synergy. and the way we overlay our distribution on that is, we're the largest distribution calling on every cath lab and surgical suite out in the community. we're also the largest distribution with a dedicated team now working at those top transplant and vad centers that hub-and-spoke, and we even leverage the relationships. and again, all the patients are in the cloud. so, as they go from one hospital to the other, there is information to transfer, our people are involved and there is even a dedicated drg from cms to accept a patient on impella support and manage them. so, we feel very confident in the future, partly because of the innovation, but also just because of the clinical research that we're doing, showing that we continue to improve outcomes for these patients that are very sick populations that have the opportunity to, not only survive, but go home with their own heart.
christopher pasquale -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
thanks. and then i think i heard you say, you have half of the stemi dtu trial sites up and running now. would love an update on how many patients you've actually enrolled in the trial? and just curious why -- i mean, the trial has been going for quite a while, not only at half the sites activated. anything you can do to speed up that progress? and is that still a pretty highly anticipated data set? thanks.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, chris. i think we can always have done better, but we're at 28 hospitals out of -- we're halfway there. i think if you look at most big companies that were doing studies, we only shut down for a few months when covid hit initially. and while we haven't been at the pace we wanted, we still, i believe, moved at a pace that's outperformed other covid-type of studies in the process. once you get these sites up and running, i think that's where you start to see the acceleration of the curve. and stemi itself got complicated because of covid and now delta because some of the hospitals require additional steps and testing on those patients before they will bring them into the cath lab. so, there has been a lot of complexity, but i think the team has adapted and executed pretty well. we got 79 patients enrolled, and we're at 28 hospitals and we were only shutdown a few months because of covid.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
thanks for the question.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from marie thibault with btig. your line is open.
marie thibault -- btig -- analyst
hi. good morning. i appreciate the time this morning for questions. mike, i heard you say that you're adding, i think, it's camp heart failure and heart surgery to the camp pci sort of line up. and wanted to just get an idea, i mean, that's clearly symbolic of the push into heart failure. but i wanted to get an idea of how impactful you feel camp pci has been since you initiated that program? and what we can possibly expect from that training program and the impact on heart failure and heart surgery going forward?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. so, marie, thanks for the question. someone had said the other day if we had had a crystal ball before covid we would have designed camp pci for that reason alone. and we were fortunate and lucky that we had already had the concept and put in place a faculty to do live cases, to do interactive training and have cme credits for physicians before covid hit. so we were doing one live case a week, now we do one every two weeks with the top leaders in this space. there is over 50 live cases that are up on the internet. and the numbers show that the people who are most engaged in camp are the higher performers and growing the most, but of course, that's a biased sample for that reason. but there is just tremendous amount of opportunity to grow and to teach wire skills information around hemodynamics, give cme credits and things around just doing a better pci, and we do believe it's been very helpful, and it only has gotten more important for us and for our customers because of covid. we continue to do virtual training and advisory boards. and then we reserve the right to do in-person meetings where it's going to be more hands-on. but the type of training and what we can do now on the internet with a password-protected user group is pretty phenomenal.
i think what will happen with heart failure and with surgery is, it's further going to expand the knowledge base of our users that will also allow them to share and spread best practices and tips and tricks at a faster pace, which does improve outcomes. and again, our outcomes are improving survival and native heart recovery. so these are big items versus maybe four hours less in the icu.
marie thibault -- btig -- analyst
okay. very good, very good. and then i don't think i heard an update on btr, would love to just hear where that product is in the development phase? thanks.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
at last earnings call we said we're going to anticipate our first in-human in the q4 of this quarter. we have a lot of great things on the schedule. i had to cut certain things out. but we're extremely confident. remember the impella btr stands for bridge to recovery. it will be an lvad without a sternotomy, you'll be able to go home with it. it will run in the cloud, and it will have high flow and it's again forward flow. so, it allows you to wean off the patient while you watch the wall tension in the left ventricle and increase coronary flow. so, it's another breakthrough technology. there is tremendous excitement. we've been working on it for a while and we're very excited to do our first patient here in the us end of the year.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
just want to confirm, it's q4 of 2022.
marie thibault -- btig -- analyst
q4 of 2022.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
not this quarter.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. q4 2022. this fiscal year we will do our first in-human in the us in our early feasibility study. thank you.
marie thibault -- btig -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jayson bedford with raymond james. your line is open.
jayson bedford -- raymond james -- analyst
hi. good morning. a lot has been covered, so i'll be quick. just on the quarter, do you think the business was helped by the fulfillment of any type of pent-up procedural demand?
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, jayson. this is todd. good question. as mike mentioned, we did set a record in q1 and treated more patients in the quarter than ever before. and again, just as a reminder to everyone, in q1 last year, obviously, april was a covid trough and from there we saw a sequential improvement within the quarter with actual have seen patient growth of 7% in june. i think some of that strength or that bolus that we highlighted on our last earnings call really continued a little bit into the month of april. and then i would say, may and june played out as expected, and i would say, in line with normal seasonality. so, overall, i think we are very pleased with how the quarter played out.
jayson bedford -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. and then just maybe, todd, do you have the revenue contribution from breethe, as well as the impact of fx in the quarter?
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
jayson, it was very, very small in the quarter. i mean, less than probably $300,000 in the quarter, so very small at this point in time.
jayson bedford -- raymond james -- analyst
and fx? maybe you gave, i apologize.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. fx. i mean, from a us -- euro-dollar perspective, in europe, it was about a 13 point headwind from fx. i think when you look at it on a consolidated level, and for global abiomed, it was probably less than a point.
jayson bedford -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. and then just lastly, protect iv, any update in terms of how many patients you have enrolled in that study?
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
protect iv, yes. as of right now we have sites -- seven sites that we've activated and we've done a handful of patients.
jayson bedford -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from danielle antalffy with svb leerink. your line is open.
danielle antalffy -- svb leerink -- analyst
hey. good morning, everyone. thanks so much for taking the question. congrats on a really strong start to the year. my question is, if you're looking at the base business, it's very hard to parse out any sort of backlog or whatever from covid, but it feels like this is not the type of market that would necessarily have that. and, i guess, my question is on camp pci, i mean, just to follow-up on that point you made, mike. what a great time to be turning virtual. and i'm wondering if you're starting to get any of those physicians that were just sort of lower volume users that were more dramatically impacted by some of the data that we saw two years ago out of aha. have they started to express interest in getting involved again? and if not, what are they waiting for?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
danielle, the question around kind of the interaction of camp pci is also tied to our covid playbook. so, as we disclosed last year, the sites that were the low users or mid users, so it's sometimes in the community, they actually went up because they ended up keeping patients and doing more high-risk pci. and the biggest drops were in the hub centers, the big centers, which tended to be the covid centers. so part of our covid playbook is making sure that with our distribution, calling on the transplant centers, and the distribution calling on all the cath labs and surgical suites in the outline centers, that we coordinate finding those patients out there. and by finding those patients out there, we've turned on a direct-to-patient initiative and a referring physician network, and then we try to link that in with teaching people where they can go to camp pci, watch live cases, potentially interact with some of these experts and do kind of film reviews.
so, the -- every wednesday is -- or every other wednesday now is live case. the camp has people submit cases and they explain it. so we have a tremendous amount of key studies already put on there. and it does allow us then to kind of leverage and network the top users that can do it from their own computer at home or in the office rather than having to get on a plane and fly everywhere. so it has been very helpful, and what we continue to see in q1, again, is the smaller, the mid-size and the large centers are all growing and that's partly why we're able to have such a strong quarter for high-risk pci.
danielle antalffy -- svb leerink -- analyst
got it. okay. that's helpful. and that's good to hear. my next question, todd, i think is probably more in your camp, and that's on the patient growth in the us versus the revenue growth, there is a big discrepancy. i know there is a -- there tends to be a discrepancy every quarter, but i just want to make sure we're not missing anything. i'm guessing it's mixed shift in stocking. is there anything else that's driving the higher revenue growth versus patient growth?
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
no, danielle. i think you captured all of them. i mean, if you look at -- i'll just did a high level walk, it was we have obviously seen still some mix improvement from 5.5. so that was a couple of points. and then reorder rate last year obviously in q1 with covid, the reorder rate was below 100%. and as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, it was just a slightly above 100%. so i think with the reorder and the sales mix, really kind of bridges the gap between patients and revenue.
danielle antalffy -- svb leerink -- analyst
okay. that's it from me. thanks.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, danielle.

good day and thank you for standing by. welcome to the q1 2022 abiomed, inc. earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, todd trapp, chief financial officer. please go ahead.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, and welcome to abiomed's first quarter of fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call. this is todd trapp, vice president and chief financial officer and i'm here with mike minogue, abiomed's chairman, president and chief executive officer.
the format for today's call will be as follows: first, mike will discuss first quarter business and operational highlights, and then i will review our financial results, which were outlined in our press release. after that, we will open the call to your questions.
during the call, we will discuss certain financial information on a non-gaap basis. this non-gaap information is provided to enhance your overall understanding of our current financial performance. the presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results or superior to results prepared in accordance with gaap. reconciliation between gaap and non-gaap results are presented in the tables in our earnings release.
finally, i would like to remind everyone today, this call includes forward-looking statements. the company cautions investors that any forward-looking statements involves risks and uncertainties and are not guaranteed in the future. actual results may differ materially due to a variety of factors identified in our earnings press release and our most recent 10-k and 10-q filed with the sec. we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
with that, let me turn the call over to abiomed's chairman, president and chief executive officer, mike minogue.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, todd, and good morning, everyone. abiomed reported a strong start to our fiscal year 2022 with global record revenue and record patient utilization in the us, europe and japan. in q1, we delivered revenue of $253 million, up 53% versus prior year and up 5% versus prior quarter. within the quarter, we achieved a 26.2% non-gaap operating margin, while continuing to invest with a focus on extending our lead in innovation, advancing clinical evidence, and building a premier commercial team. our balance sheet remains robust with $805 million in cash and zero debt, while acquiring precardia, a heart failure company. we grew our ip portfolio to 1,216 impella patents and over 1,000 patents pending. we have maintained our disciplined execution on our strategic goals and abiomed 2.0 continues to drive our success. i am proud of our employees for their continued hard work and dedication to our patients and mission of recovering hearts and saving lives.
on today's call, i will highlight progress on our product innovation milestones for impella 5.5 and rp, the regulatory status for impella ecp and briefly discuss our strategy to be the leading company for all cardiologists and heart surgeons at every heart hospital, which means they have a cath lab and a surgical suite. beginning with innovation. the impella 5.5 with smartassist continues to perform very well. in the quarter, our us surgical revenue grew 115% year-over-year and 17% versus prior quarter, as we expanded this life-saving device to 46 more sites or 257 sites out of the 1,113 heart hospitals in total. impella 5.5 is a revolutionary product. it does not require a sternotomy or coring of the left ventricle. and it is a forward flow fully unloading weanable heart pump designed for heart surgeons to implant in less than 60 minutes via the axillary artery in the shoulder. the minimally invasive implant also allows for early ambulation for the patient, which correlates to faster recovery and better outcomes. the longer usage time for the impella 5.5 allows the smartassist software to track aortic pressure, left ventricular pressure, make predictive analysis on volume and right heart stability and communicate in the cloud with impella connect. we look forward to continuing to roll this device out to the remaining 856 heart hospitals in the us and many more outside the us.
we also received fda pre-market approval for the impella rp with smartassist as safe and effective to treat acute right heart failure. this smart pump is the next-generation of right heart support and already has exclusive weaning capability and fda approval for right heart failure with multiple fda studies and a recent emergency use authorization for covid patients with pulmonary embolism. it is the first single venous access percutaneous heart pump with the sensor for the right ventricle. the sensor technology provides real-time guidance and trends that help with pump management and weaning. much of this groundbreaking information on the right ventricle will be published and will elucidate the field of right heart failure.
the impella cp, impella 5.5 and impella rp now all utilize smartassist software, enhanced with impella connect to enable remote monitoring from any internet-connected device through a secure hipaa-compliant website. the impella connect software is now live at more than 80% of our us sites and approximately 80% of our us patients on support are monitored in the cloud. no other company in this space offers this capability or 24/7 service to the hospital, which is ideal with covid. we also continue to accelerate the rollout of impella connect in germany and japan.
next, we remain ahead of schedule on our impella ecp early feasibility study, efs. impella ecp is the world's smallest heart pump and measures 9 french in diameter, easing insertion and removal from the body. this allows for a smaller access [phonetic] site optimal for protected pci, which we believe will continue to drive better outcomes and overall utilization. to date, we have achieved our initial fda study milestones, enrolled 25 patients and submitted additional clinical data to the fda for review. we plan to expand this breakthrough technology to new sites with product enhancements already implemented in the efs process to up to 50 patients. in parallel, based on our interaction with the fda, we have started to prepare the details of the single-arm pivotal impella ecp high-risk pci study. next quarter, we expect to confirm our ide protocol and submit for approval with the goal to enroll our first pivotal patient for high-risk pci by the end of our fiscal year. we want to complement the fda for this efs program overall, which allows for faster innovation, real-time safety feedback, and accelerated access to new technology for us patients.
finally, our strategy to become the leading player for the heart team which includes interventional cardiologists, heart failure cardiologists, intensivists and heart surgeons grows stronger. our breakthrough platform now includes the impella portfolio, ecmo with breethe, ecpella and recently acquired precardia. precardia was designated by the fda as a breakthrough technology and will complement our existing product portfolio, increased options for patients with acutely decompensated heart failure called adhf, and expand our relationship with heart failure specialists managing the icu. heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization in patients older than 65 years of age and we believe this device has the potential to be a revolutionary tool for the treatment of millions of patients in early stage adhf, a new patient population for abiomed. this strategic acquisition in combination with our continued impella 5.5 success and our future impella btr pump marks our movement toward minimally invasive devices for the heart failure community, including our hub-and-spoke hospital network in every region of the country.
to further enhance these clinical efforts, we continued to invest in commercial excellence with a focus on the broader heart failure community and the referral network. specifically, we began our direct outreach referral programs that we expect will better identify the under-treated high-risk pci patient population of 440,000 us patients. we continue to deliver best-in-class training and education by leveraging camp pci and transition to both virtual and onsite settings. we've seen physician traction on our educational platform through events such as live cases and advisory boards and are excited to expand camp pci internationally, as well as at camp heart failure and camp heart surgery this fiscal year.
before i conclude, i would like to share an inspiring patient story. john fisher, 77, is a husband, grandfather, and retired law enforcement officer from ashland, ohio. john has been experienced chest pain for more than a year, had been -- when the chest pain became more severe following his recovery from covid-19, he decided to seek treatment. after an evaluation, john was diagnosed with coronary artery disease, and evaluated for coronary artery bypass surgery called cabg surgery. due to a low ejection fraction of 15% and multiple co-morbidities, including type 2 diabetes, john was turned down for surgery. interventional cardiologist, dr. atish mathur, determined john was a candidate for protected pci with impella. dr. mathur inserted the impella cp with smartassist while he performed a complete revascularization. john returned home six days later. today, his heart function is normal with a current ef of 55%, and he enjoys walking his dogs, wood working and spending time with his grandson, who happens to work at abiomed in headquarters.
in closing, we will continue to create and deliver value by successfully advancing our innovation, clinical research and commercial distribution. we remain steadfast to our mission of creating the field of heart recovery and driving a new standard of care for multiple growing patient populations around the world. q1 was a solid start and we believe we are well positioned for success in fiscal year 2022. i would like to thank our employees and customers for their dedication to the mission of recovering hearts and saving lives, and we appreciate the ongoing support of our shareholders.
i would like to now turn the call over to todd trapp, our cfo.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, mike, and good morning, everyone. we delivered strong results in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 with revenue of $253 million, an increase of 53% versus prior year, primarily due to the recovery in patient utilization from covid-19.
starting with the us, total us revenue grew 54% year-over-year to $207 million. this growth was driven by a 43% increase in patient utilization, favorable sales mix and a higher reorder rate. we are encouraged by the continued recovery from covid within the quarter as we continue to see patients working their way back into the system. at the end of our fiscal q1, in the us, the cp is in now 1,528 sites. we are placing impella 5.0 in 665 sites and the impella 5.5 with smartassist is now in 257 sites, up 46 sites versus prior quarter. lastly, the impella rp is in 609 sites, up 21 sites versus q4. our us reorder performance in the quarter was slightly above 100%, and average combined inventory at the hospitals for the impella 2.5 and cp was 4.7 units per site. this is consistent with the inventory levels of the prior two quarters.
outside the us, revenue totaled $45 million, up 51% versus prior year. european revenue increased 64% year-over-year due to a strong recovery in patient utilization, favorable sales mix, and it benefit from the foreign exchange rate. our japan business delivered $11.3 million in revenue, up 26% year-over-year due to a 78% growth in patient utilization offsetting lower site openings. in the quarter, we opened five new sites, bringing our total sites to 171. this compares to the 10 site openings last quarter and 13 site openings in q1 of 2021. we have seen some impact due to hospital restrictions related to covid-19 and the summer olympics, which limits our ability to train new sites. but this is more timing, as our backlog for new sites in japan remains robust, and we expect to open more sites in the second half of the year as vaccination rates increase and hospital restrictions ease.
gross margin in q1 was 82.1%, compared to 78.2% in the same period of the prior year. the 390 basis point increase was primarily driven by higher volume and favorable sales mix.
our q1 gaap financial results for the quarter are summarized in our press release and earnings deck. for the remainder of the call, i'm going to provide the highlights of our financial performance on a non-gaap basis in order to give greater transparency on the impact from the precardia acquisition and to be consistent with our peers. a full reconciliation between non-gaap and gaap results are summarized in our press release and earnings deck, and are available on the investor section of abiomed.com.
r&d expense for the first quarter totaled $38 million, a 43% increase from the prior year. the increase was driven by clinical costs for protect iv and stemi dtu randomized controlled trials, as well as our investments in new products, such as ecp and btr. we believe that clinical evidence and innovation of smaller, smarter, more connected devices will drive sustainable long-term growth.
sg&a expense for the quarter totaled $103 million, an increase of $35 million, or 51% versus prior year. the year-over-year increase is driven by headcount additions to our distribution team, our direct-to-patient initiative, higher spend on training and education, and covid-related one-time cost actions from the prior year.
non-gaap operating income grew 94% to $66 million in the quarter, which translated to non-gaap operating margin of 26.2%. our margin expansion of 550 basis points was primarily due to higher volume, which more than offset our growth enhancing investments.
non-gaap net income for the quarter was $51 million, or $1.10 per share, up 95% versus q1 of 2021. our year-over-year performance was driven by higher volume and a lower effective tax rate.
our balance sheet remains debt-free. and we ended the quarter with $805 million of cash and marketable securities after funding our strategic investment to acquire the remaining shares of precardia.
in terms of full-year guidance, keep in mind that our fiscal year experiences seasonality. q2 is typically a slow quarter for all cardiovascular devices due to our summertime slowdown in the cath lab and physician vacations. in this summer, we believe, it is being even more exasperated based on the pent-up vacation demand from covid last year. with that said, we expect q2 revenue to be in line or slightly down from our q1 record revenue performance of $253 million in our summer quarter. as we transition to the back half of the year, we typically expect to see sequential lift in q3 based on increased hospital activity and physician engagement. and as we finish the fiscal year in q4, our march quarter, we expect to deliver our best results.
given our strong performance in the first quarter and our confidence and our outlook, we are now raising our full-year revenue guidance and expected to be in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion, up 22% to 24% for the year. this is an increase from our original guidance range of $990 million to $1.03 billion, up 17% to 22% for the year. the low end of our guidance assumes some continued unevenness due to the delta variant. at the high end of the range, our assumptions include a normalized procedure cadence in the cath lab, and a minimal impact from covid based on global vaccine distribution. we expect non-gaap operating margin to be in the 24% to 26% range.
in summary, we are encouraged by our first quarter performance. we executed well and are building for the future through strategic investments in innovation, clinical evidence and commercial excellence. we are well positioned for a successful fiscal year 2022 and beyond as we continue to build the new field of heart recovery.

and our first question comes from anthony petrone from jefferies. your line is open.
anthony petrone -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks and good morning everyone. i have a couple of questions. the first will be just on shortages and guidance, and we're hearing this on a couple of calls this quarter. and just wondering for impella sites specifically how pervasive nursing shortages are in the icus, again, at the impella sites? and then when you look at the 3q shortfall and the $20 million downward revision of guidance, is there a way to maybe splice between the delta headwinds in 3q and into the next couple of quarters? what's allocated toward delta and what's allocated toward nursing shortages? and we'll have a couple of follow-ups on the pipeline. thanks.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive office
anthony, thanks for the call. it's a good question. it's something that we track. as we said in the call here, 75% of our u.s. sites grew. so we have a playbook to adapt to delta. what was new is a little bit of the shortages of staffing. so the procedures want to be done. the physicians are engaged, but they don't have the surgical techs or the cath lab techs or icu capacity that limits use. so that impacted about 25%. if we look at our -- just the same metric for cardiogenic shock, 83% of our regions grew. so we're a little more resilient and that plays to our ability to be relevant and help the patients and also help the icu and the nurses there with training, with support, with online cmes and anything else that we can do bedside. if i think about the next part of the year, i think we've got the delta variant somewhat managed as the hospitals know how to do this better.
they're just assuming they're going to continue to have beds allocated for delta. and don't forget that we treat some of those most severe sick delta patients with our emergency use authorization for the rp or ecmo, v-v ecmo, which is the majority of our breethe patients or ecpella. so we're still there providing support. on the shortages, i think what's going to happen is it's going to be incremental. they're going to continue to prioritize the sickest of the sick patients, which is some of -- or most of our patients. and i think the hospitals are resilient, but they're going to need help. and that's where the abiomed field team, impella connect, iq database, and the training as well as the networking between the hub and spoke and transfer will be helpful.
anthony petrone -- jefferies -- analyst
a quick follow-up there, mike, would be if you have -- using your crystal ball and what you guys see, i mean how deep into 2022 do you think the nursing shortage issue will last? and what do you think the fix will be? and just quickly on the pipeline, any expectations just for timing on the launch of xr sheath on cp specifically into calendar '22 and what should we be watching for into next year for the transition of ecp from early feasibility to the pivotal study?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive office
sure, anthony. so remember, the -- it's the delta variant with icu capacity and the nursing shortages. so that's currently impacting less than 20% of our hospitals and we do think that comes back, and we have seen that come back. so i think as time goes on, that will get minimized. i also think it's an opportunity for abiomed, because of our field team, our clinical expertise, our bedside support, call center and impella connect, that we can help augment what they're doing and assist them in that shortage. and i think it's going to get better. and i think hospitals are more resilient now. so we see this as something that will allow us to continue to grow, and we're well positioned as they continue to train new nurses and we'll probably part of that process.
on the xr sheath, nothing has changed relative to our prior. as you heard on the call, we have a list of new products and new approvals. so we're trying to prioritize for the call here, what are the biggest ones or the most important ones and ones that are happening in the next six months. so ecp is a great progress.
i think it's ahead of schedule from everything we've been stating. we announced today that we expect to have the 5.5 approved in japan by april, which is -- hadn't been commented on. and i think the 5.5 is going to be a breakthrough product in japan, because of the culture there and the aversion to sternotomies and heart transplant. the btr pump is there's -- it's a minimally invasive dischargeable lvad. there's nothing like it in the world. it's what physicians and surgeons have wanted for 10 years. and we expect to be doing patients first in man here in the u.s. through the early feasibility in march and april. we haven't commented about the precardia, but that continues with the efs, and we're looking forward to going to phase iii on the ecmo.
so with all of that technology, we have to continue to execute, control what we control. and it just points to the fact that we are the leaders now for the heart team. essentially, every single heart team out there is working with abiomed on a product, in the cath lab, the surgical suite or the icu or in the cloud. and we have the landmark clinical studies to back up the data as well. so we're excited for that. and i think we're going to continue to see more momentum. and whatever happens in the future, we'll be well positioned and will support our hospitals.

thank you. our next question comes from margaret kaczor from william blair. your line is open.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
hey good morning everyone. thanks for taking the questions. i was hoping to go first into a little bit more detail on how october looks. it sounded like things maybe were improving, and then based on the q3 comments, you're sort of expecting something similar for the full quarter, but not necessarily improving from what you guys are seeing in october. so is that the right read? or there's some comps that we're maybe not anticipating? and then what does that imply for the implied fiscal fourth quarter outlook with kind of those similar dynamics that you referenced?

so margaret, this is todd. thanks for the question. i think it was -- your read is right. i mean we -- in my prepared remarks, we said that october was up mid-single digits from a growth perspective. obviously, for us to be slightly up from q2 into q3, we're somewhere in that 7%, 8% top line growth. so we do expect to see it improve a little bit from october as we get into november and december, and that's what we're hearing from our field team. we think some of the headwinds from delta sort of subside over the next two months, but that's the expectation as we get into q3. and as i look at q4, when we look at the low end of the range, i think we assume that as the business continues to recover, and we see a modest or gradual lift from q3 to q4. again, as delta cases improve and hospitals are able to manage -- i'd say, manage better their labor shortages, which are reducing some of the limitations on the icu capacity. so i think your read is right. and again, we're just trying to be as transparent and provide investors with what we're seeing so far in the month of october.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
okay. now that's useful. and then just as a follow-up, i wanted to talk a little bit about 5.5 launching in japan and then the breethe launches as well, because that does seem to be moving nicely. so any, i guess, first on breethe any additional details on the rollout so far, any surprises or something that potentially could accelerate that launch. and then in japan for that 5.5, could it be as material there as it is in the u.s., both from a pricing and demand perspective?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive office
thanks, margaret. those are the questions that our engineering and clinical team are both working on. so starting with breethe, we have been tracking all the patients. the ecmo space is interesting, because it does not require any clinical data. it's a 510(k) clearance only. and so we are approaching that space as a pma company. we're looking and collecting the data as a pma company. we're looking for best practices. what we recently did in europe is we did our first patient under an ecpella software, where we're combining the software so you can optimize and the systems talk to each other and you can wean that patient, and know what's happening as you unload the heart and also perfuse and oxygenate the body. so there's some really amazing things that we're going to be able to do currently and also some things we're going to do in the future with ai.
also, what we're starting to work on, we've done our first patient where we have impella connect running from a helicopter and a lot of ambulances are starting to connect with wifi. so we're putting impella connect on the ecmo device. so whether you're ecmo only impella or ecpella, we'll be able to transmit that data into the cloud. and whether the person is being -- is at a hospital or being transferred on an ambulance or in a helicopter, that will be an exclusive feature. and we're excited to bring all this innovation and knowledge and clinical expertise to that space. for the 5.5, it's just -- it is a breakthrough product. i mean you have the ability to have a full vad. so i've been in this space 18 years. and what the heart surgeons always wanted was a minimally invasive weanable vad. and with the impella, you get that. and the fact that it's forward flow means that as the pump is working, it's resting the heart. but as you want to reload the heart, as you turn it down, it allows the heart to naturally start to pump with sensors on the device that we can see how the heart is recovering. and it's really revolutionary, because it's -- all the other vads and ecmo devices are essentially dumb devices. you put them in and you really don't have any way of knowing how the heart is doing.
and what's most important for these patients is you get survival with native heart recovery, because survival is the low bar. and even if you survive, many of these papers don't even give heart recovery numbers and these patients end up in hospice care or maybe even those that are lucky, they can get a transplant. so the amount of information we're doing around recovery will be accelerated in japan where they believe in stem cell. they've been -- they've had advanced publications in science of hemodynamic unloading and pressure volume loops. and we think it will be material, be a revolutionary treatment and it will be in a country that really focuses on heart recovery more than anything else, and we're super excited to bring that product to japan.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
great. thanks guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from chris pasquale from guggenheim. your line is open.
chris pasquale -- guggenheim -- analyst
thanks. good morning guys. mike, if i look back at the good old days, before we had all this macro volatility, your second quarter tends to be about flat sequentially, plus or minus a couple of million dollars. so i'm a little surprised to hear that this quarter's result was significantly below what you were thinking. can you break down the $20 million guidance reduction between this quarter's shortfall as you saw it and how much you're taking out of the back half of the year?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive office
sure, chris. and you're right. that is something we look at. and if you're looking at the numbers on the guidance, our normal 47%-53% puts us at a higher range. if you look at our guidance, we're essentially back to where we started the fiscal year, but we've lowered -- or we've increased the lower end of the range. so we started the fiscal year with 17% to 22%. we upgraded it to 22% to 24% after q1, which was incredibly strong. and we had great momentum. we -- the playbook was working. we hadn't yet seen a little bit of the august impact, starting with maybe some extended vacations, delta ramp and then also shortages that are out there in staff. so i think what happened is in july, it hit in august.
august was a little bit down and that carried into september. you're also right that we usually do see the summer quarter dip a little bit. usually, that dip is in patients, where we go a little down or flat. but we tend to open more centers, do more training. and we do have a lot of new products that we're opening in -- that we've already mentioned. so that's where we expected to see a higher number than we achieved. it is the third highest quarter we've ever done in revenue and patients, but we thought we were going to do better. and i think what we're trying to give you transparency to is that the model of the 47% to 53% is just probably not going to be a perfect model this year, because of not just covid, but some of the shortages. but as we're working through the shortages and as i think the hospitals are responding, i think we're going to end up getting back to where we were in the good old days and have just an incredible strong second half of the fiscal year.
chris pasquale -- guggenheim -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then you mentioned that impella is used to actually treat some of these covid patients. it would be helpful to understand a little better how material a factor that is particularly in a quarter like this where we saw a surge in covid cases. can you quantify at all how much do you think that contributed in the second quarter?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive office
chris, we track every patient and all the trends. unfortunately, the patients that we treat are really sick. so that's bad for the patient and the hospital, but what that does is that starts to take the beds and an extended stay will take out a lot of our protected pci patient availability. and that's where the hub and spoke and moving patients around is helpful. so if something happens in the spoke hospital, we might help with getting that patient transferred to a bigger hub hospital. what we also saw, when we track small, medium and large hospitals, is the trend in september was the medium hospitals tended to be more impacted. and while we saw the growth happen year-over-year and especially in shock, those medium-sized users of ours were impacted a little more. maybe they weren't as resilient with their protocols or maybe they were more impacted by the nursing shortages or the facilities were minimized, but i think as we look at the total picture, the cardiogenic shock patients, whether they have covid or not, that's what's happening.
and when you think of myocarditis shock or covid, you're talking about problems with the lungs, the heart and the kidneys, and that's what our products are designed to do, and that's what our products are fda approved for. so we continue to look at this as just a broader heart failure population and specifically to covid, you've seen the majority of these patients getting ecmo where they do v-v ecmo, where it's pure oxygenation, not necessarily heart support. but that's a great question.
chris pasquale -- guggenheim -- analyst
okay. so i guess what i'm hearing is maybe at the margin that's offsetting some of the lost volume that's being squeezed out by the capacity constraints, but net-net, it's still a headwind overall?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive office
correct.
chris pasquale -- guggenheim -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from matthew o'brien from piper sandler. your line is open.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking the questions. sorry to keep going on the guidance side of things. but i wanted to tease out this $20 million reduction from q1 to q2. i think you had said last quarter, the bottom end of the range is what you expected, if covid was uneven, so that's about $10 million of the $20 million. i'm sure covid is probably a little bit worse than you expected here in the quarter and likely for the rest of the year. so it seems like the $20 million reduction, maybe, i don't know, $12 million of that is covid related, maybe somewhere in the $5 million to $10 million range is staffing shortage related for the back half of the year. so is that a reasonable assessment of what's kind of going on here? and then with this kind of $5 million to $10 million for half of the year impact from a shortage perspective, are hospitals able to adjust here heading into fiscal '23 to offset what's a $10 million to $20 million headwind on the staffing shortage side? i'm sorry for the long question.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
yes, matt, let me -- there's a lot of questions. so let me just kind of walk you through again the rationale and i tried to lay it out during the script with regard to the earnings. but again, as you said here and we got through our first quarter, right? our first quarter was a record quarter for abiomed on both revenue as well as patients, right? and then we got into july, and we had, i would say, a really solid july, both from a normal seasonality perspective, and expectations on both revenue and patients. and so if you just look at our annualized, our q1 performance, at that time, you get to over $1.01 billion. and then as mike mentioned, right, we typically have normal seasonality, right? so it's typically 47% first half, 53% second half, and that came into our process. so after the first four months, of the year, we felt actually really good about the revised range of $1.03 to $1.05 at that time. and then the delta surge impacted us in the month of august. and it really hit some of our larger markets, i.e., florida and texas as well as some of the other regions in the southeast. and then what was new for us in august was this dynamic of hospital labor shortages.
and so we did not encounter that headwind in the previous pandemic -- in a previous pandemic. and so i think the labor shortages are temporary, but they have been putting more pressure on procedural volumes across the u.s. and i think these two headwinds, as i mentioned, really impacted august and september performance and caused us to miss our internal forecast by, i'd say, that $5 million to $7 million range. with that said, we did still deliver 18% growth versus prior year. and as a reminder, we did have positive growth in q2 quarter of last year. so i think it was -- we thought it was prudent to really update our guidance at this point of time to $1.01 billion to $1.03 billion, which again was slightly above our initial guidance. and again, all we're trying to do is be as transparent with you as we can during these uneven times.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and then, mike, on the pipeline side of things, with all these headwinds on the covid side and staffing shortages, is there any potential impact to being able to enroll studies or get anything done as far as the pipeline goes? and then on ecp, is that something you're talking about 225 patients. is that something you can enroll in 12 to 18 months? or is it going to take a little bit longer than that?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive office
so matt, great questions, a lot of questions. let me start with our customers and our trialists are totally passionate and committed to these studies. and while other companies are not doing studies or put them on pause, we have multiple rcts and post-approval studies running. so we did do 18 patients on protect iv. we now have -- i'm going to give you up-to-date numbers. we have 24 randomized patients in p4. we have 28 in the registry for that protocol, and we have 18 sites that are fully enrolling up and running. so that's pretty impressive in the quarter with everything we just went through on delta and shortages. on stemi, we are -- we did it over 10 patients in the quarter. we have 36 sites that are enrolling, and we're at 99 patients. we're going to have a 100-patient recognition here, and that continues to move. so we're excited about that. the last component of your question, i believe, was the ecp. and we are going to make it a priority. we're going to -- with the sites that are there.
we're going to have them enroll and the fact that we'll have a nine french device, means the peripheral vascular disease and many of these other things that might cause certain challenges, it will cast a wide net and we're going to ask the centers that are in that study to prioritize and to go efficiently, but there is tremendous demand and excitement for that product as well. so the one thing, regardless of what's happening, our job is to continue to adapt and execute. we have taken advantage of the internal things we can control whether it's innovation or the clinical research, and we feel that nothing stops innovation. so as we continue to innovate and improve outcomes for patients, we're incredibly confident in the time lines that are out there for new products in these clinical studies.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from danielle antalffy from svb leerink. your line is open.
danielle antalffy -- svb leerink -- analyst
hi good morning everyone. thanks so much for taking the question. mike and todd, with these hospital labor shortages, just giving it some thought. i mean i feel like now is the time more than ever that you guys are able to leverage impella connect and the capabilities there. and i'm just wondering if you're seeing any incremental traction or adoption. i know it's a net negative, covid is a net negative, but incremental adoption because of your impella connect capabilities, and the hospital labor shortages, which do feel like that's not easy fix and impella connect offers a very good solution. anything you can say qualitatively around that would be great.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive office
danielle, thanks for the question. i think your -- it's a very insightful question, because you're recognizing what we've been investing in is to provide a level of support that doesn't exist in the industry, whether it's bedside or in the cloud or capturing the data, or even training nurses. so as the nurses that are coming into the icu, they're newer, we can work with them, we can do hands-on training, they can go online and do cme training, and we can coordinate specialized care. so we continue to do that. i just want to be clear, though, that the delta variant had the massive impact and what made it more complicated for us and the playbook was the labor shortages that did not impact 75% of our sites.
the impact was more of 25% of our sites. and for shock, it impacted less than that 17%. so i think that what we're doing is we're whittling away at it, and we're trying to minimize it with exactly what you're talking about with our bedside support, with our smartassist. it makes managing the patient easier with impella connect, putting that in the cloud, so that our experts, our nurses, our call center and our local people as well as the physicians can review that patient without being bedside and then quantitatively put numbers on it and track it. so i think all the things that you -- we've mentioned and you're pointing to, that does give us an advantage and allows the hospital to benefit from our services, and that's where this network approach, our ability to have the premier field team is really coming into play, and i think will continue to help us drive positive growth.
danielle antalffy -- svb leerink -- analyst
thanks for that. and one quick follow-up on the btr. that's really great news and a big step forward. i know it's very early, you're just talking about first-in-man, but this feels like something that could get breakthrough designation. so what should we be thinking as far as time to potential commercialization? i mean, are we still talking five-plus years away? or could it be sooner than that?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive office
danielle, the way we look at the early feasibility studies is it brings a technology into the u.s. years ahead of what it would have done in the old days. and we really want to credit the fda for this really innovative and amazing program. it's actually transformed the medical device field. and what that also means to us is you can come in, and we will be applying for breakthrough for the btr pump as well, which is similar to the ecp is it allows the fda to prioritize, to put resources, to be flexible and to have a faster cycle, but allows you to enter in almost in like a prelaunch. and again, on all of these studies, as you get into the pivotals, you are -- it's a controlled study, but you are generating revenue. the hospitals are getting drg payment.
and in our own space, this is kind of how we launch anyhow. we go slow and steady, because it's so important to learn to get great outcomes. and i kind of see it as somewhat of as a preclinical launch, but it puts this technology into the hands of these u.s. physicians, and it really helps drive this heart team approach. and as you can see from our portfolio, you now have products for the cath lab, surgical suite, ep lab and of course, the icu, all running in the cloud. and i think that just is a great advantage for us to bring technology earlier into the u.s.
danielle antalffy -- svb leerink -- analyst
thank you.
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive office
thanks, danielle.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from pito chickering from deutsche bank. your line is open.
pito chickering -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. thanks for taking the questions. so one more guidance question here, and i do apologize, but focusing just on icu capacity, hasn't that been getting better in october versus august and september. and why are you not seeing more improvement in october? and also what are you assuming around icu capacity changing for november, december versus october?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive office
yes, pito, it's a good question. thanks for it. i think obviously, we're tracking icu capacity by city, by state, by hospital. and i think we are seeing improvement in a lot of areas over -- since what we saw in september heading into october. with that said, if you look at some of the states like carolina -- the carolinas, if you look at their icu capacity over the last six, seven, eight days, they've gotten worse. and so i think this is going to be a lot of these areas where you're going to see areas like north florida, texas. obviously, we've seen improvement in those metrics in the month of september as we get into october, but you see some other flare ups and like i said, carolinas, some areas in northern new england that are just continue to pop up. so overall, i'd say it's getting better. but we continue to believe that you'll see these hotspots pick up, especially as people move inside during the winter months and it might move up the coast a little bit. but again, it's something we're tracking every single day.
pito chickering -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. fair enough. for impella growth going forward, we've seen a lot of hospitals start to use ecmo due to covid that previously didn't use it. do you think as hospitals become more use to mechanical support, that will help drive impella adoption? and have you already begun seeing that?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive office
pito, that is something we track. and again, we've done over 15,000 patients with ecpella over the years, and now we have our own ecmo products. so that trend will continue, but that trend works both ways. one is a physician that's struggling with a 14 french hole just on the impella, which is a 9-french catheter. that's something that ecmo is 17 to 19 french large tubes all the way through. so there's definitely an intimidation and an issue there with bleeding in ecmo, that's in the literature as well as inflammatory response and risk of stroke. relative to the overall process, i think it's good, because people are learning about mechanical circulatory support. people are thinking quicker about how do i get to that support. there's been a publication that talks about the centers that have shock teams. they do a better job of getting better outcomes.
they technically talked about it, they use less and what they mean less is, they're using less probably escalation of inotropes and just balloon pumps, and they're moving quicker to the best practices of pre pci in shock or escalating, looking for right heart failure or using ecmo or ecpella where you need oxygenation. so i think that's all been very positive. and again, on covid, the majority of those patients are v-v ecmo. and so i think there's also some education that's been happening around just the oxygenation and the need for oxygenation versus cardiac support. so it's all been positive. and again, we continue to do everything we can to support patients, whether they have lung problems or heart problems.
pito chickering -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jayson bedford from raymond james. your line is open.
pavan sabin -- raymond james -- analyst
hi. this is pavan sabin for jayson bedford. i had a quick question about -- so in the u.s., revenue grew 16%, but the patient usage trailed, growing only 8%. i think todd mentioned about 400 points of that is from mix. but is there any other dynamic playing into that discrepancy between revenue growth and patient utilization?
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i can walk you through the high-level walk. so you're right, patients we're up 8% in the quarter. we did see about four points of favorable sales mix. so again, that's just the transition from impella 5.0 to impella 5.5 with smartassist as well as the continued switch from impella 2.5 to cp, where we have higher average selling prices. so that's about four points of, i would say, top line growth. we did see a slightly higher reorder rate in the quarter, 101 versus 102, that's probably a point or 2. and then we had some higher deals in the quarter from a year-over-year perspective, and that would probably be another one point or 2. so that's really the walk from patients to revenue in the u.s.
pavan sabin -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. do you guys mind providing that for europe as well, because i think we're seeing a similar dynamic there as well?
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so in europe, i would say it's a couple of things. it's -- again, we had some pretty solid growth in patients. we are seeing a little bit of a higher reorder rate in europe, as a result, it's pretty lumpy. it goes from -- one quarter could be 94%. this quarter was a little over 100%. and so i would say it's reorder rates as well as we are seeing a benefit of some favorable sales mix over in europe as well as we transition from cpc seven to cpc eight with smartassist, we are seeing a little bit of a price increase as well there. so a little bit of the same dynamic that we saw in u.s. we're seeing in europe.
pavan sabin -- raymond james -- analyst
that's helpful. you guys -- obviously, you guys have a plan to launch 5.5 in japan. in terms of additional international expansion, is there a time line on 5.5 in europe or any other new geographies you guys are targeting?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive office
so 5.5 launched in europe. so that is in europe already. we are looking and bringing other technology to the rest of the world, which would be the rp with smartassist, our ecmo product and those geographies continue to grow.
pavan sabin -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks. that's helpful. and finally, with the xr sheath 2.5. you guys launched about two quarters ago. how has that been doing? have you guys seen any impact on volumes from that?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive office
we commented on the last quarter that 51% of our high-risk pci cases are now being done with a single access. so they do the procedure with the impella and the pci in the same femoral artery. that has been the preference. our best users, our largest users, also want the impella cp. they want the higher flow and the sensor capability. and they also want the option to be able to wean the patient either in the cath lab or in the icu. so the focus right now is making the xr sheath more compatible with single access and primarily for the impella cp.
pavan sabin -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. thank you. and finally, this might be way too early for this, but is there any way you guys can frame the btr market opportunity in terms of new patient population or additional tam?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive office
sure. i mean we've talked about an additional 100,000 patients that we are looking to support as a combination between impella 5.5 and impella btr. and that is a very conservative number out of the 1.6 million class iii and 400,000 class iv patients that are looking to have the ability to feel better and also potentially get better. and that's a subset of what we would call the acute on chronic heart failure patients. those are also the patients that are, i think, the second highest admission into the hospital. to some extent, we're going to start treating those patients earlier with precardia, which is a preload reduction device that can be put in, in the icu with the heart failure cardiologists.
and for those that get worse, they may go on to 5.5. and for those that are just going to require longer-term support, the impella btr is not fda approved, but that is the intent to go through the study to then utilize this technology for those patients as well. the lvad technology is vastly improved over the years. however, it still requires a sternotomy and coring out of the left ventricle, and it doesn't provide forward flow. so in some cases, the valves are sewn shut. and what we're trying to do is give that patient and that physician full support with a minimally invasive axillary implant through the shoulder, allow the patient to get up and walk around and it buys them many options of recovery and other therapies that they can utilize.
pavan sabin -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks guys. that's all from me.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from marie thibault from btig. your line is open.
marie thibault -- btig -- analyst
hi, good morning and thank you for taking the questions. i wanted to highlight a question here on 5.5. it certainly seem like a bright in the fiscal second quarter as it has for a few quarters now. and i wanted to try to see if you could parse out for us how much of a contribution that made to sort of the overall u.s. patient usage in the quarter? and whether there were any differences in dynamics between 5.5 usage and some of the cp usage as far as kind of covid and nursing shortages?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive office
sure, marie. so just at a high level, the 5.5 individually grew 116% year-over-year and it was up 7% quarter-over-quarter. the entire surgical business, the 5.0, 5.5 grew 60%. we also had some growth in the impella rp. and what your -- what the impact that it's having is we're becoming quite frankly, a preferred provider for heart surgeons, especially at the top center, cedars, northwestern, cleveland clinic, hackensack as you go around the country. and we're not necessarily looking at it as a single product. we're looking at it as a way to solidify our partnership with the hospital and bringing the heart team together, because those surgeons also do high-risk cabg, where they potentially need support. and those surgeons in some cases, turn down patients that then get referred over for pci. one example is at cleveland clinic in their protocol, if you're an acute on chronic patient, so the patients i just talked about, you have worn out heart, you have advanced coronary disease and you decompensate.
at that facility, they're likely going to stabilize you with a 5.5, then they're going to do an evaluation of what treatment they're going to do. and some of those patients go to the cath lab with the 5.5, some of those patients go to the ep lab with the 5.5 and some of those patients go on to cabg. and so it's really designing a protocol that allows for the ability to stabilize the patient, protect the heart and the kidneys, and then bring whatever treatment adjunctive therapies that's in the best interest of that patient. todd could comment if he wants to make a point on the breakout on the numbers.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
yes, marie, in terms of -- if you look at the u.s. surgical business, it represents about 18% of our revenue today. and of that, 5.5 is 92% of that makeup. so if you look at our growth in the quarter, i would say it's a combination of also opening new sites, but we're also treating 27% to 30% more on patients year-over-year.
marie thibault -- btig -- analyst
that's really helpful detail. and then my second question here. we certainly heard a lot of other med tech companies talk about concerns about the supply chain, higher input cost inflation. would love to hear what abiomed is seeing and whether that's been baked into the margin outlook in some way?
michael r. minogue -- chairman, president and chief executive office
marie, thanks for that question. i want to complement our manufacturing and ops team for the resiliency. as you know, we have redundancy. we make the product here in massachusetts and in aachen, germany. we're very focused on it, like everyone else, but the team continues to execute, but it's something that we monitor and pay close attention to. so i think what you're hearing from us is transparency in the quarter, but confidence in our innovation and our ability to continue to manufacture and supply our products.
marie thibault -- btig -- analyst

thanks, nicole. good morning, everyone. during the second quarter, we made progress on advancing our innovation, expanding clinical evidence and leveraging our premier commercial field team in a challenging environment with covid and hospital staffing shortages. in q2, abiomed delivered $248 million of revenue, up 18% year-over-year, driven by 16% growth in the u.s. and record revenues in europe and japan, up 24% and 19%, respectively. the growth was driven by higher patient utilization and continued strength in our u.s. surgical business. we believe delta and hospital labor shortages had regional impacts beginning in august and continuing into september. as a result, only 75% of our u.s. regions grew year-over-year. for the 25% of the regions negatively impacted, we believe, based on prior experience, we will see recovery in those regions in the future. in q2, the shortage of hospital staff, especially nursing, was a new dynamic that we had not experienced during the covid pandemic.
as a result, the q2 revenue missed our internal july expectations. overall, hospitals today are managing the treatment of the pandemic better, but impella usage in the cath lab is still impacted by icu capacity limitations. hospital staffing shortages in the u.s. caused some health systems to reduce cardiac procedures or temporarily close facilities. despite these headwinds faced within the quarter, the majority of u.s. regions remained resilient and recorded growth. in q2, we adapted within the quarter, by leveraging our abiomed 2.0 playbook, which included monitoring specific trends on new covid cases and hospital icu capacity. this gave us the ability to adapt quickly to support high-risk or emergent patients, assist in patient transfer from spoke to hub, or support the icu and patient with an abiomed representative bedside or on the phone with impella connect.
operationally, we achieved a 24% operating margin while investing a record level of $41 million in research and development to continue to advance our pipeline of life-saving devices. our balance sheet remains robust with $862 million in cash and 0 debt, and our patent portfolio continues to gain strength with 1,297 patents and over 1,100 patents pending. we believe abiomed has one of the strongest ip portfolios in the medical device industry, and we will add to it as we continue to innovate. on today's call, i will highlight advances in innovation, progress on regulatory approvals, and how abiomed's premier field team is providing heart hospital teams breakthrough technology, landmark clinical studies and 24/7 support during a challenging time. at abiomed, leading in technology and innovation is one of our four principles. during the quarter, we celebrated the twoi-year anniversary of the fda pma approval for the impella 5.5 with smartassist. this is our minimally invasive forward flow, fully unloading heart pump designed for heart surgeons with direct or axillary implantation in less than 60 minutes. this game-changing technology has enabled minimally invasive implantation with ambulation for more than 3,000 patients in the u.s. and has achieved greater than a 70% survival in a very sick, cardiogenic shock patient population.
as a result, in q2, u.s. surgical revenue grew 60% year-over-year. today, impella 5.5 is in 27% of u.s. heart hospitals or 306 of the 1,113 hospitals. furthermore, we are eager to bring this technology to japan, and have already applied for pmda approval. we believe the japanese market is ideal for impella 5.5 given its ability to provide minimally invasive, longer-term, unloading support, enabling native heart recovery in a country culturally averse to heart transplants and invasive sternotomies. we expect to receive japanese pmda approval for impella 5.5 by this april 2022. in q2, we also expanded our abiomed breethe oxy-1 system to a total of seven u.s. sites and have treated 53 patients, which concludes phase ii of our pilot site product launch. the clinical feedback, primarily from heart surgeons on this compact cardiopulmonary bypass system, has been positive based on the ease of use with a simple, intuitive interface and the light portable design allowing for patient ambulation. we will continue introducing this device at a measured pace and bring our disciplined approach to clinical data and innovation to the ecmo space. on the regulatory front, we achieved multiple milestones. first, we launched impella rp with smartassist at four sites and treated patients within the quarter.
this smart pump is the next generation of our fda-approved right heart device with a sensor and exclusive weaning capability. we also continue to make progress on the impella rp with insertion through the internal jugular vein or ij in the neck, as compared to the femoral vein in the leg. this is the preferred placement for heart surgeon -- heart surgeons and allows for early patient ambulation. we expect to file an impella rp pma supplement at the end of the fiscal year. second, in august, the fda granted breakthrough device designation to impella ecp. this designation means the fda will prioritize impella's ecp regulatory review processes including design iterations, clinical study protocols and pma application. to date, we have enrolled 26 patients in the pilot efs study at four hospitals. based on the interaction with the fda, we believe the high-risk pci pivotal study will require a single arm with up to 225 impella ecp patients at approximately 30 sites. we expect to lock in these details this quarter and enroll our first pivotal ecp patient in march and april, around the same time as our first impella btr patient in our fda early feasibility study.
moving to my last highlight, abiomed's premier commercial team has positioned us as the leading heart recovery company, validated with our breakthrough technology landmark clinical studies, and 24/7 clinical support. we are also actively engaging the referring community with our direct-to-patient initiative and hub-and-spoke model to bring awareness and treatment options to this underserved cardiac disease, high-risk patient population. our impella connect remote monitoring and 24/7 support has been valuable to the healthcare providers during the covid-19 resurgence and nurse labor shortages, because we assist with patient management as icus become strained. impella connect software is now live at more than 85% of our u.s. sites, allowing for the majority of our u.s. patients on support to be monitored in the cloud by the field, the call center or the customer. outside of the u.s., our impella connect software is now live at 37% of our japanese sites and 14% of our european sites. today, no other company in this space offers this level of support and expertise. before i share a patient story, i want to remind listeners that 15 million americans live with cardiac disease and it is the number 1 cause of death in the u.s. with 875,000 deaths per year. additionally, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in women. now our impella patient frannie argulis, 61, is a mother, grandmother and nursing supervisor from henrico, virginia. earlier in the year, frannie experienced jaw pain then collapsed at home.
frannie's husband called 911 and the paramedics transported her to where she works at st. mary's hospital in richmond, virginia. the cardiologists remove blood clots in the cath lab and placed a stent in frannie's right coronary artery. during the procedure, she went into cardiogenic shock and the cardiologists, dr. darren appleton and dr. peter rowe inserted the impella cp with smartassist to support her left ventricle. while on support, smartassist technology triggered suction alarms, alerting physicians to check for right heart failure. further testing confirmed right ventricular failure and the physicians inserted impella rp to provide biventricular support. after one day, frannie's left ventricle function improved and impella cp was removed. seven days later, impella rp was weaned and removed and three days later, frannie returned home. today, frannie has normal heart function with an ef of 55% and is back to work as a nursing supervisor and living an active lifestyle with her grandchildren.
as a heart recovery patient, her insurer, medical mutual, will avoid paying for the most expensive and invasive lifetime procedures that come with lvads and heart transplant. in conclusion, in q2, we made progress on product innovation and regulatory milestones, while leveraging our commercial field team and the abiomed 2.0 playbook in a challenging environment. abiomed remains focused on disciplined execution and sustainable growth as we continue to pursue our goal of becoming the global standard of care to recover hearts and save lives. to our employees and customers, you are the best in the industry. thank you for your dedication and commitment to putting patients first. and to our shareholders, thank you for your continued support.
i will now turn the call over to todd.
todd a. trapp -- vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, mike, and good morning, everyone. in the quarter, we delivered revenue of $248 million, an increase of 18% versus prior year. despite the challenges of the delta variant and hospital labor shortages, we delivered double-digit growth across all geographies with record revenues in europe and japan. by region, the u.s. reported revenue of $200 million, up 16% versus prior year, driven by higher patient utilization and continued strength in our surgical business. u.s. patient utilization increased 8% year-over-year, with growth in high-risk pci and double-digit growth in cardiogenic shock. as mike mentioned, we believe delta and labor shortages had a more significant impact on patient utilization within the quarter, which caused us to miss our internal goal. we will continue to leverage our abiomed 2.0 playbook to adapt in this environment and assist the hospital's icus. our product penetration continues to drive adoption and revenue growth. as a reminder to investors, all of the following details on product installed base is summarized in our quarterly slide deck. in the u.s., at the end of september, the impella 2.5 and cp have reached 1,549 sites.
the impella 5.0 has been placed in 666 sites, and the impella 5.5 with smartassist is now in 306 sites, up 49 sites versus prior quarter. the full market release of the impella 5.5 with smartassist continues to perform well, with u.s. revenue growing 116% year-over-year. finally, the impella rp is in 634 sites. in the quarter, the reorder rate was 102%, slightly above prior year. average combined inventory at the hospitals for the impella 2.5 and cp was approximately 4.8 units per site, slightly above the inventory levels we saw last quarter. we continue to see a favorable impact on revenue from sales mix in the u.s., resulting in about four points of growth. outside the u.s., we delivered record revenue of $48 million, up 27% year-over-year. our european revenue increased 28% to $33 million versus prior year, driven by higher patient utilization, sales mix and timing of orders. however, germany was slightly impacted by extended physician vacations, combined with nursing shortages in select areas. despite these headwinds, our european business delivered record revenue in our second quarter. in japan, we also delivered a record revenue quarter of $12 million, up 19% year-over-year. impella utilization remained strong, up 33% versus prior year despite headwinds from a covid resurgence in the summer olympics.
within the quarter, we opened nine new sites, bringing our total sites to 180 out of a potential 350 hospitals. moving to key financial metrics. gross margin was 82.3% in the quarter compared to 81.5% in the prior year. the year-over-year variance was driven by sales mix and higher production volumes. in the second quarter, r&d expense totaled $41 million, an increase of 34% versus prior year. year-over-year growth was driven by investments in small board devices like impella ecp and xr sheath. future heart failure technologies such as precardia and impella btr and stemi dtu and protect iv randomized controlled trials. sg&a expense for the second quarter totaled $103 million, up 30% versus prior year, driven by investments in our direct-to-patient initiative, customer training and additions to our premier distribution team. in the quarter, non-gaap operating income was $60 million, down 1% versus prior year, translating to an operating margin of 24.4%. this reflects growth investments tied to our continued focus on extending our lead with innovation, advancing clinical evidence and further enhancing our distribution team. non-gaap net income for the quarter was $47 million or $1.03 per diluted share versus $46 million or $1.01 in q2 of '21. the year-over-year improvement was driven by higher interest income and a lower effective tax rate.
we had another solid quarter on cash, as we generated $61 million of operating cash flow. our balance sheet is robust as we ended the quarter with $862 million of cash in marketable securities. now turning to our outlook. with the impact of the pandemic and new challenges with hospital staffing shortages, uncertain conditions remain. in order to provide full transparency to our investors, we want to give insight on our revenue expectations for the second half of the year. the delta variant and hospital labor shortages in the u.s. impacted august, september and continues to put pressure on impella procedural volumes in october. abiomed started the fiscal year with a range of $990 million to $1.03 billion with growth of 17% to 22% versus the prior year. after a record q1 and a solid july, we upgraded our guidance to $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion, with growth of 22% to 24%. given our current visibility to october, which appears to be trending toward approximately high single-digit revenue growth year-over-year, we expect q3 global revenue to be slightly up from q2. this assumes some improvement in delta rates and hospital staffing in november and december.
we now expect fiscal year '22 revenue to be in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.03 billion, an increase of 19% to 22% versus prior year and slightly above our original fiscal year '22 guidance. we expect non-gaap operating margin to be in the range of 24% to 25%. in summary, while we navigate through the uncertainties, we remain focused on investing in innovation and clinical research and operational execution to achieve our fiscal year '22 goals. we remain confident in the long-term outlook for abiomed as we continue to improve outcomes, recover hearts and save lives.
